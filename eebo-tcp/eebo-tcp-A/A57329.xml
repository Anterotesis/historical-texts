         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER's Advertisement TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Need not give any Account of the Excellency of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the World, of which this is an Abridgment: The great Knowledge and Learning, the accurate Skill and Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the sublime Wisdom and Piety, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the curious Remarks and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations which so signally appear in that History, have sufficiently recommended it to the Judicious part of the World. Yet notwithstanding these Excellencies,
<pb facs="tcp:64357:4"/>
Sir <hi>Walter</hi> has not been without some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Imperfections in respect to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, which he has shewn in his too frequent and long Digressions, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations; and tho' several of them are very fine and Ingenious, yet too many of them are wholly Foreign to his Subject: But his Moral and Religious Reflections, tho sometimes long, are generally too Excellent to need a Vindication. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-mention'd Faults of this Great Man, which were the general Faults of the Age in which he liv'd, have made many Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Persons wish for an Epitomy of that large Volume, wherein his Excellencies might in a great measure be retain'd, and his Errors be wholly expung'd. This was attempted near Fifty Years since by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander Ross,</hi> but with small Skill and Success; for he has injudiciously fill'd his Epitomy with the most trifling and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shy parts of the Original, and omitted too much of what was most material and substantial. For which Reason I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to Publish this Abridgment, of
<pb facs="tcp:64357:4"/>
which I shall give the Reader this Brief Account.</p>
            <p>Above a Year and an half since it was given me by an Ingenious and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Friend, who knew nothing of the Author; but finding it to be done with singular Care and Judgment, he desir'd me to View it and Publish it. Upon Examination, I found my Friend's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to be rather short of the Author's Deserts, both as to his Skill and Accuracy in Extracting the Essence of the Original; so that I could do no less than expose so choice a Piece to the view of the Publick. All that I have done, besides the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punging and shortning some Passages, is the Correcting and Altering of the Style, which in most places was too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solete: But in that I have still preserv'd its first Resemblance to the Original, which was almost as remarkable for the Style as the Matter; so that the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not to expect all the Purity of a New Written History, for that would have
<pb facs="tcp:64357:5"/>
been too unlike Sir <hi>Walter.</hi> Besides, the Reader may here find an Excellent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of Sir <hi>Walter</hi>'s Preface, which is a most sublime Piece of Morality and Divinity, and a most Noble Lesson and Instruction to all Princes and great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; being by many esteem'd of more Worth than all his History besides.</p>

            <head>Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi>'s Premonition to PRINCES.</head>
            <p>MY own weak Reason convinc'd me, how unfit a choice I made of my Self, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a Work of this mixture. For had it been generated in my younger Years, before any Wound received either by Fortune or Time, yet I might well have feared that the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Age and Death would have covered both me and it, long before its performance: It had better suited with my Disability, to have confined my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course within our renowned Island of <hi>Britain,</hi> and to have set together the disjointed Frame of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Affairs, than in the Evening of a Tempestuous Life, thus to begin with an History of the World from the Creation. But the deep piercing Wounds, which while uncured, are ever aking; with the desire to satisfy those few Friends, tryed by the Fire of Adversity (the former inforcing, the latter persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) have caused me to make my Thoughts legible, and my self the Subject of every Man's Opinion, wise or weak.</p>
            <p>To the World I present them, to which I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indebted; neither have others that succeeded me sped much better in the change of Fortune; Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb facs="tcp:64357:6"/>
and Adversity ever tying and untying vulgar Affections. And as Dogs bark at those they know not, and accompany one another in their Clamours, so is it with the unthinking Multitude; which led by uncertain Reports, condemn without hearing, and wound without Offence given; contrary to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of <hi>Syracides.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticus 11.7.</note> Against this vanity of Vulgar Opinion, <hi>Seneca</hi> giveth a good Rule; <hi>Let us satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our own Consciences, and not trouble our selves about the Censures of others, be it never so ill, as long as we deserve well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching my self, if in any thing I have preferred the service of my Country, the general accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can yield me now no other profit, than a fair Day does after Ship-wrack; and the contrary, no other harm than as a Tempest in the Port. I know I lost the love of many, for my Fidelity to Her, whom I must still honour in the Dust; though far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the defence of her excellent Person, I never persecuted any. To labour other satisfaction were the effects of Frenzy, not of Hope; seeing it is <hi>Truth,</hi> not <hi>Opinion</hi> which can travel the World without a Passport. <hi>Equity</hi> alone might persuade, if there were not as many Forms of the Mind, as there are external Figures of Men; and that as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man hath received a several Picture as to Face, so hath he a diverse Picture as to Mind: Every one a Form by himself; every one a Fancy and Cogitation differing; there being nothing in which Nature so much triumpheth, as in Dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. From hence it cometh that there is found so great a diversity of Opinions; so strong a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of Inclinations; so many natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
<pb facs="tcp:64357:6"/>
natural, wise and foolish, manly and childish Affections and Passions in mortal Men. For it is not the visible fashion or shape of Plants, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creatures, that makes the difference of working in the one, or of Condition in the other, but the internal Form.</p>
            <p>And though God has reserved the reading of mens Thoughts to himself; yet as the Fruit tells the name of the Tree, so do the outward Works of men (so far as their Cogitations are acted) give us a Light to guess at the rest. Nay, it were not hard to express the one by the other very near the Life, did not the Craft of many, Fear in most, and the Worlds Love in all, teach every Capacity, according to the compass it has, to qualify and mask over inward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities for a time. Yet no man can long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue masked in a counterfeit Behaviour: The things which are forced for pretences, having no ground of Truth, cannot long dissemble their own nature; and the Heart will be seen at the Tongues end.</p>
            <p>In this great dissimilitude of reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the common People are ill Iudges of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest things, and their Wisdom is to be despised, said <hi>Eccles.</hi> As for the better sort, every Vnderstanding has a peculiar Iudgment, by which it both censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth others, and valueth it self; and therefore I will not think it strange, if my worthless Papers be torn by Ratts, since in all Ages Censurers have not spar'd to tax the Reverend of the Church with Ambition; the severe to themselves, with Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; lovers of Iustice, with Popularity; and Men of the truest valour with Vain-glory: For nothing is so easie as to <hi>Reprove</hi> and <hi>Censure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64357:7"/>I will not trouble the Reader with repeating the deserv'd Commendations of History; yet true it is, that among many other Benefits, for which it has been honour'd, it triumphs in this over all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Knowledge, that it gives Life to our Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, since the World it self has Life even to this day: And it has triumphed over Time, which nothing else but Eternity has done; for it has carried our Knowledge over the vast devouring space of many Thousand Years, and has opened the piercing Eyes of our Mind, that we plainly behold living now, as if we lived then, <hi>that wise Work of the great God,</hi> saith <hi>Hermes.</hi> By it (I say) we live in the <hi>very time</hi> when it was <hi>Created;</hi> behold how it was <hi>govern'd,</hi> how cover'd with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and again <hi>repeopl'd</hi>: How <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> flourished and fell, and for what <hi>Virtues</hi> or <hi>Vices</hi> God made the one <hi>prosperous,</hi> and the other <hi>wretched.</hi> Neither is it the least of our Debt to <hi>History,</hi> that it has made us acquainted with our dead Ancestors, and raised them out of Darkness to teach us no less wise, than eternal Policy, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring former Miseries with our own ill Deservings. But neither the lively Instructions of Example, the Words of the wisest, nor Terror of future Torments, have yet so wrought upon our stupid Minds, as to make us remember, That the infinite Eye, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God doth pierce through all our Pretences: Nor to make us remember, That the Iustice of God requires no <hi>other Accuser</hi> than our own <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> which by no false Beauty of our apparent actions, nor all the formality, which we (to gull Mens Opinions) put on, can be covered from him.
<pb facs="tcp:64357:7"/>
Examples of God's <hi>Judgments</hi> in particulars upon all <hi>Degrees,</hi> that have played with his <hi>Mercies,</hi> would fill Volumes. For the Sea of Examples hath no Bottom; though Marks, set on private Men, are (when their Bodies are cast into the Earth) written only in their Memory which lived with them; so that the Persons succeeding, who saw not their Fall, fear not their own Faults. God's Iudgments on the Greatest have been Recorded to Posterity, either by those happy Hands, which the Holy Ghost guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by others. Now to point as far as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Fall, for <hi>Ambition;</hi> at Kings eating Grass with Beasts for <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude;</hi> at <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s wise Action when <hi>he slew</hi> the <hi>Infants;</hi> at <hi>Jesabel</hi>'s Policy in covering <hi>Naboth</hi>'s <hi>Murder,</hi> with many Thousands of the like, were but a Proof, that Example should be rejected at a distance. For who hath not observed what <hi>Labour, Practice, Peril, Blood-shed,</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> the Kings and Princes of the World have undergone and exercised, taken upon them, and committed, to make themselves, and their <hi>Issues</hi> Masters of the World? yet hath <hi>Babylon, Persia, Macedon, Rome,</hi> or the rest, no Fruit, Flower or Leaf springing upon the face of the Earth: Nay, their very Roots and Ruins do hardly remain; for all that the Hand of Man can make, is either over-turned by the Hand of Man, or Consumed by Time. Politicians say, States have fallen, either by <hi>Foreign Force,</hi> or <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Negligence</hi> and <hi>Dissention;</hi> or by a third Cause rising from both: Others observe, That the greatest have <hi>sunk</hi> under their own <hi>weight</hi>; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That Divine Providence hath set a Period <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But seeing the Books following undertake the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the first Kings and Kingdoms, and that a short Preface cannot run very far back to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; I will for the present examine what Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage has been gain'd by our own Kings and their Neighbour Princes, who having beheld both in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Humane Letters, the success of Infidelity, Injustice and Cruelty, have (notwithstanding) Planted after the same Pattern. Mens Iudgments agree not; and no mans Affection is stirred up alike, with Examples of the like nature; but is either touched with that which seemeth to come nearest to his own private Opinion, or else best fits his Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. But the Iudgments of God are unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; no Time can weary him, or obtain his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to that in one Age, which he Cursed in another. Those therefore which are Wise, will be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the bitter Fruits of <hi>irreligious Policy,</hi> as well in old Examples as new; for ill Actions have always been attended with <hi>ill Success,</hi> as will appear by the following Examples.</p>
            <p>We have then no sooner passed over the <hi>violence</hi> of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, but we encounter that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Justice</hi> upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Henry I.</hi> who having by <hi>Force, Craft,</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> over-reached his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> D. of <hi>Normandy,</hi> Vsurped the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and disposessed him of his Dukedom, and barbarously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his Sight, to make his own Sons <hi>Lords</hi> of all; but God cast them all, <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female, Nephews</hi> and <hi>Neeces (Maud</hi> excepted) into the bottom of the Sea.</p>

This <hi>King</hi> never indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mediation in rewarding Servants, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in exceeding wise; for what himself gave, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self received both <hi>Thanks</hi> and <hi>Love:</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Affections of Men (purchased no way so ready as by Benefits,) were Trains which better became <hi>Great Kings</hi> than <hi>Great Subjects.</hi> On the contrary, in whatsoever he grieved his Subjects, he wisely put it off to those that he found fit Ministers of such Actions. He used not to begin their Processes, whom he <hi>hated</hi> or <hi>feared</hi> by the Execution, as <hi>Lewis XI.</hi> did: Yet he somewhat follow'd the Errors of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,</hi> as the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Stanley,</hi> (who set the Crown on his) and the <hi>Death</hi> of the young <hi>E. of Warwick,</hi> Son to <hi>George</hi> D. of <hi>Clarence</hi> do shew, and likewise the Success of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children of the first Line, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> (the Pattern of a <hi>merciless Prince</hi>) Succeeded: One who precipitately advanced many, (but for what Virtue no Man could imagine) and with change of his Fancy ruined them, no Man knowing for what Offence. To how many others gave he abundant Flowers from whence to gather <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64357:10"/>
and in the end of Harvest <hi>burnt</hi> them in the <hi>Hive</hi>? How many <hi>Wives</hi> did he <hi>cut</hi> off, or <hi>cast</hi> off, as his <hi>Fancy</hi> or <hi>Affection</hi> changed? How many <hi>Princes</hi> of the Blood, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of all Degrees, did he <hi>Execute</hi>? What causeless cruel <hi>Wars</hi> did he make upon his own Nephew <hi>King James V</hi>? What <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Wills</hi> did he invent to establish the <hi>Kingdom</hi> in his own <hi>Family,</hi> using his sharpest Weapons to cut off the <hi>Branches</hi> which sprang from the same <hi>Root</hi> that himself did? Yet God took away all his own without increase; though for themselves in their several Kinds, all Princes of eminent Virtues: And that Blood which King <hi>Henry</hi> affirmed that the cold Air of <hi>Scotland</hi> froze up in the <hi>North,</hi> God hath diffused by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of his Grace; from whence his Majesty now living, (and long may,) is Descended: Of whom I may say truly, that Malice her self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not charge him justly with any of those <hi>foul Spots,</hi> by which the <hi>Consciences</hi> of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Princes</hi> were defiled; or the Sword of his Iustice stained with any Drops of that innocent Blood which had stained their <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Fame.</hi> And for the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> it may truly be avowed, He received it from the Hand of God; neither hastning the Time upon any provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; nor <hi>taking Revenge</hi> upon any that sought to put him by it: And refused Assistance of her Enemies, that wore it long with as great Glory, as ever <hi>Princess</hi> did. He entred neither by <hi>Breach</hi> nor <hi>Blood,</hi> but by the ordinary Gate, which his own Right had set open; and was received
<pb facs="tcp:64357:11"/>
in at it by an universal Love and Obedience. Thus the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>Britany</hi> infinitely severed from the <hi>South</hi> in Affection for a long time (whereof grew deadly Wars with much Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty) were at length happily united. For which <hi>Blessing</hi> of God, never to be forgotten, as we are bound to much Thankfulness; so the Fruit of this Concord maketh all petty Grievances to appear but as a Mole-Hill to a Mountain. And if the uniting of the <hi>Red Rose</hi> with the <hi>White</hi> were the greatest Happiness, next <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> that ever the <hi>Kingdom</hi> received from God to that Day; certainly the Peace between the Two Lions of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Gules</hi> doth by many Degrees exceed, both by sparing our Blood and assuring the Land.</p>
            <p>As it pleased God to punish the <hi>Usurpation</hi> and unnatural <hi>Cruelties</hi> of our own <hi>Kings;</hi> so do we find he dealt with the Sons of <hi>Lewis De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonair,</hi> Son of <hi>Charlemain.</hi> For after <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonair</hi> had put out his Nephew <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Eyes, the Son of <hi>Pipin</hi> the Eldest of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> King of <hi>Italy</hi> and Heir of the Empire, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that caused him <hi>to die</hi> in Prison; there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed such <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Bloodshed, Poisonings,</hi> and <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> till the whole Race of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Emperor was extinguished. <hi>Debonair</hi> further to secure himself, put his Bastard Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into a <hi>Monastery:</hi> But God rais'd up his own Sons to <hi>vex, invade, imprison,</hi> and <hi>depose</hi> him, alledging the former Violences to his <hi>Nephew</hi> and <hi>Brothers:</hi> Yet he did that which few Kings do; he publickly <hi>acknowledg'd

and recanted</hi> his <hi>Cruelty</hi> against <hi>Bernard</hi> in the Assembly of the States.

It is in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that all the Wits of the World are exercised; and to enjoy the Times we have, we hold all things lawful; and either hope to hold them forever, or hope there is nothing after them to be hoped for.

For Happiness consisteth in a Divine Life, not in knowledge of Divine Things, wherein Devils excel us.

their Places and Power; without which, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of the Multitude is as the Out cry of a Herd of Animals, who without knowledge of any true Cause, please themselves with the Noise they make. <hi>Impious</hi> Men in <hi>Prosperity</hi> have ever been <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded,</hi> and the most <hi>Virtuous</hi> (if unprosperous) have ever been <hi>despised,</hi> and Virtue and Fortune are rarely distinguish'd.

For when our Mortal Spirits are departed, and dispos'd of by God, they are pleased no more in in Posterity, than Stones are proud which sleep in the Walls of a King's Palace; neither have they more Sorrow in their Poverty, than there is Shame in the Prop of a Beggar's Cottage.

And when he consider'd all his Labours, and could not tell whether a Fool or a Wise Man should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Fruit thereof, himself hated his own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

For I shall prejudice my Son (which I am resolved not to do) if I make Restitution, and confess my self to have been unjust, (which I am too proud to do) if I deliver the Oppressed.</hi> These wise Worldlings have either found, or made them a <hi>Leaden God,</hi> like that which <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth wore in his Cap, and used to kiss it, and ask it Pardon, when he had caused any to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, promising it should be the last; as when by the Practice of a Cardinal, and falsified Sacrament, he caused the <hi>Earl of Armagnack</hi> to be stabbed at Prayers. Of this Composition are all devout Lovers of the World, that they fear all that is
<pb facs="tcp:64357:17"/>
worthless and frivolous; they fear the Plots and <hi>Practices,</hi> yea the very <hi>Whisperings</hi> of their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites; they fear the Opinions of Men, which beat but upon Shadows: They flatter and forsake the prosperous or unprosperous, Friends or Kings: Yea, they dive under Water, like Ducks, at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Peble Stone thrown at them by a powerful Hand. On the contrary, they shew an obstinate and Gigantick Valour against the terrible Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the All-powerful God; yea, they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Gods</hi> against <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Slaves</hi> towards <hi>Men,</hi> whose <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> are alike rotten.</p>
            <p>Now for the rest, if we examine the Difference between the <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Mighty,</hi> whom we call <hi>Fortunate,</hi> and the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Oppressed,</hi> whom we account <hi>Wretched;</hi> we shall find the Vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the one, and the Misery of the other so tyed by God to the very Instant, and so subject to enterchange, (witness the sudden Downfall of the greatest, and the speedy Rise of the meanest) that the one hath nothing certain whereof to <hi>boast,</hi> nor the other to <hi>lament.</hi> For no Man is so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of <hi>Honour, Riches, Health,</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> but may be deprived of either, or all, the very next hour; for what an Evening will bring with it is uncertain; and none can tell what shall be to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, saith St. <hi>James: To Day he is set up, to Morrow he shall not be found; for he is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Dust, and his Purpose perisheth.</hi> And though the <hi>Air</hi> of Adversity be very obscure, yet
<pb facs="tcp:64357:18"/>
therein we better discern God, than in the <hi>shining Light of Worldly Glory,</hi> through whose Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness no Vanity whatsoever can escape our Sight. And though Adversity seem ridiculous to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and Fortunate, who delight themselves at others Misfortunes; though it seem grievous to those which were in it: Yet this is true, that of all that's past, to the very Instant, what remains is equal to either. For though we have lived many Years, and in them have rejoyced (according to <hi>Solomon</hi>) or have we sorrowed as long; yet look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, we find both Ioy and Sorrow sailed out of Sight, and Death which hath held us in Chase from the Womb, hath put an end to both. Let him therefore, whom <hi>Fortune</hi> hath served, and <hi>Time</hi> befriended, take an Accompt of his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (the only Keeper of Pleasures past) and truly examine what it hath reserved of Beauty, Youth, or past Delights; or of his dearest Affections, or whatsoever Contentment the amorous Spring time gave his Thoughts, and he shall find, that all the Art which his Elder Years had, can draw no other Vapour out of these Dissolutions, than <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, secret,</hi> and <hi>sad Sighs.</hi> He shall find nothing remaining, but those Sorrows which grow up after our fast Springing Youth; overtook it, when it was at a Stand; and overtopping it utterly, when it began to wither. Looking back therefore from the Instant of our present Being, And the poor diseased Captive hath as little Sense of all former Miseries and Pains, as the Man so blessed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion hath of fore-past.

For whatsoever is cast behind us, is just nothing; and what is to come depends upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Hope.

            </p>
            <p>For my self, this is my Comfort, and all that I can offer to others, That the Sorrows of this Life either respect <hi>God,</hi> when we complain to him against our selves for our Offences; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, <hi>Thou Lord art just in all that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us</hi>: Or respect the <hi>World,</hi> when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to our selves against <hi>God,</hi> as doing us wrong either in not giving what we <hi>desire;</hi> or taking away what we <hi>enjoyed:</hi> Forgetting that humble and just Acknowledgment of <hi>Job, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken.</hi> And out of doubt he is either a Fool, or ungrateful to <hi>God,</hi> or both, that doth not acknowledge, that how mean soever his Estate be, it is far greater than God owes him: Or how <hi>sharp</hi> soever his Affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If an Heathen called Adversities the <hi>Tributes of living;</hi> a wise Christian ought to know them, and bear them as the Tributes of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending. For seeing God, who is Author of all our <hi>Tragedies,</hi> hath written out and appointed what every Man must <hi>play,</hi> using no Partiality
<pb facs="tcp:64357:19"/>
to the mightiest <hi>Princes;</hi> Why should other Men who are but as the least Worms, complain of Wrongs? Did not the <hi>Lord</hi> set <hi>Darius</hi> to play the part of the greatest <hi>Emperor,</hi> and the part of the most miserable <hi>Beggar,</hi> that begged Water of an Enemy to quench the Drought of Death? <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> in the Morning, the same Day became the Footstool of <hi>Tamberlane;</hi> both which parts <hi>Valerian</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> had played, being taken by <hi>Sapores. Bellisarius</hi> had performed the part of a most Victorious <hi>Captain,</hi> and after became a Blind <hi>Beggar;</hi> with a Thousand like Examples. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is no other Accompt to be made of this <hi>ridiculous World,</hi> than to resolve, That the change of <hi>Fortune</hi> on this <hi>great Theatre,</hi> is but as the change of <hi>Garments</hi> on the <hi>lesser:</hi> For when every Man weareth but his own Skin, the Players are all alike. If any Man out of Weakness judge otherwise, (for it is a Point of great Wit, to call the Mind from the Senses) it is by reason of that unhappy Fancy of ours, which forgeth in Men's Brains all the Miseries to which he is subject (the Corporal excepted) therein it is that Misfortune and Adversity effect what they do. For seeing Death is the end of the Play, and takes from all, whatsoever Fortune or Force takes from any one; It were foolish Madness in the Shipwrack of Worldly Things, (where all sinks but the Sorrow for the Loss of them) to sink under Fortune, which (according to <hi>Seneca</hi>) is of all other the most miserable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:64357:19"/>Now to the Picture of Time, (which we call <hi>History</hi>) let my good Intent excuse my drawing it in so large a Table. The Examples of Divine Providence every where to be found, (the first Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Histories</hi> being nothing else but a Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of such Examples) have perswaded me to fetch my Beginning from all Beginnings, the <hi>Creation.</hi> For these two glorious Actions of the Almighty are so linked together, that the one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily implieth the other: Creation inferring Providence, and Providence presuming Creation; though many seeming wise have gone about to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them; <hi>Epicurus</hi> denies both, yet allows a Beginning: The <hi>Aristotelians</hi> grant <hi>Providence,</hi> but deny all <hi>Beginning,</hi> whose verbal Doctrine grounded upon a rotten Ground, was not able to stand against the Doctrine of Faith, touching the Creation in time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. though natural Reason might have inform'd him better. And though <hi>Aristotle</hi> failed herein, and taught little other than Terms in the rest, yet many do abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely subject themselves to him, as not to indure any other search of Truth. The Law of their <hi>Philosophical Principles</hi> doth not so bind, but that where <hi>Natural Reason</hi> is in Force against them, it ought to stand in all Questions of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Finite Power,</hi> as a Fundamental Law of Human Knowledge. For every <hi>Human Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> hath equal Authority, if Reason make no difference. But where Reason is not admitted, and Inventions of Ancestors approved without
<pb facs="tcp:64357:20"/>
Iudgment, Men suffer themselves to be led after the manner of Beasts.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Sloath</hi> and <hi>Dulness</hi> has made Ignorance a powerful <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and has set true <hi>Philosophy, Phisick</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> on the Pillory, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten over the First, <hi>Contra Principia negan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> over the Second, <hi>Virtus specifica,</hi> and the Third, <hi>Ecclesia Romana.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:64357:20"/>
               <hi>Fate, Fortune, Nature,</hi> or to <hi>two Powers,</hi> of which one was Author of <hi>Matter,</hi> the other of <hi>Form</hi>: And lastly, for want of a Work-man, <hi>Aristottle</hi> brought in that New Doctrin of the <hi>Worlds Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> contrary to these Ancients, <hi>Hermes, Zoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster, Musaeus, Orpheus, Linus, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, Melissus, Pherecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Thales, Cleanthus, Pythagoras, Plato,</hi> and many others; who found in the necessity of invincible Reason, one Eternal Infinite Being, to be the Parent of the Vniverse. <hi>Whose Opinions, tho' uncertain,</hi> (saith Lactantius) <hi>shew that they agree upon one Lord, Providence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, Light, Reason, Understanding, Destiny, or Divine Ordination, which is the same we call God.</hi> For as all Rivers in the World, tho' rising and running diversly, fall at last in the Ocean: So after all searches made by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Capacity,</hi> all Man's Reason dissolves it self in the <hi>Necessity</hi> of this <hi>Infinite Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who held the Matter of the World <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> hardly deserve an Answer, as giving part of the Work to <hi>God,</hi> part to <hi>Fortune,</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> found this Matter. And were it Eternal, it either fitted it self to <hi>God,</hi> or he accommodated himself to it; both which are <hi>foul Absurdities.</hi> But suppose this <hi>Chaos</hi> or Matter had been <hi>too little</hi> for the Work, God then Created out of <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> so much <hi>New Matter</hi> as was wanting; or if the <hi>Matter</hi> were <hi>too much,</hi> he must <hi>anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate</hi> what was supersflous; both which are alike
<pb facs="tcp:64357:21"/>
proper to <hi>God</hi> only: It could not therefore be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a less than an <hi>All-sufficient Power;</hi> for to say it was the Cause of it self, were the greatest <hi>tism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if <hi>Matter</hi> were <hi>eternal,</hi> of necessity it must be <hi>infinite,</hi> and so left no place for <hi>infinite Form;</hi> but the <hi>finite Form</hi> proves the <hi>Matter</hi> finite, and so not eternal. He who will believe the <hi>contrary, eternal Death</hi> be his Reward; for what Reason of Man (not stupify'd by <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi>) hath doubted, that That <hi>infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> (of which we comprehend but the Shadow) can want either <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> for as many Worlds as there are Sands in the Sea, if it were his <hi>Will,</hi> which is the only limitation of his Works?</p>
            <p>Can a <hi>finite</hi> Man, a Fool and meer <hi>Dust,</hi> change the Form of <hi>Matter</hi> made to his Hand, and <hi>infinite Power</hi> cannot make a finite World without <hi>preexisting Matter</hi>? The universal World has not shew'd us all his Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>bounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But others who hold the Worlds Eternity upon the ground <hi>of nothing, nothing is made,</hi> (which is true where the Agent is finite) may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider their Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> confessing, That all the Ancients Decree a kind of Beginning, and the same infinite; and he farther saith, There is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it; but it is found the beginning of all things, and embraceth and governs all things. If we compare the universal World, that Infinite it
<pb facs="tcp:64357:21"/>
self, we may say of the most unmeasurable Orbs of Heaven, that they are neither <hi>quid, quale,</hi> nor <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> and therefore to bring Finite out of Infinite is no wonder in <hi>God's Power.</hi> Therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naximander, Melissus,</hi> and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> call the <hi>World</hi> not Vniversal, but a <hi>part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality and Infinite: Plato</hi> calls it a <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of God.</hi> God's being a sufficient effectual cause of the World, proves it not Eternal as he is: For as his Sufficiency is free, so is his Will; no difficulty can hinder, nor necessity force his <hi>Will</hi> in choice of <hi>Time.</hi> Again, tho' natural Agents which can work, do it not 'till they are moved, which argueth <hi>Change</hi> in them; yet it followeth not, that because God cannot be moved, therefore he caused the World from Eternity. For the same <hi>action of his Will</hi> which intended the World for ever, from Eternity, did also set down the time to effect it, 'till which time he <hi>withheld it.</hi> Others answer, That the <hi>Pattern of the World</hi> was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally with <hi>God,</hi> which the <hi>Platonists</hi> call the <hi>spiritual World;</hi> but the Material World was not eternal, but shall continue for ever; which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians understood of a <hi>new Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> yet without new <hi>Creation</hi> of <hi>Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who deny the <hi>World</hi> shall have any <hi>End,</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the Heavens, which are neither <hi>Corrupted,</hi> nor have any shew of <hi>Age.</hi> The little Change may argue <hi>Newness,</hi> but not <hi>Perpeuity:</hi> Yet to Answer Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures with Conjectures, many of old held the <hi>Torrid Zone</hi> not habitable by reason of the <hi>Suns Heat;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64357:22"/>
nor the Sea <hi>Navigable</hi> under the Equinoctial Line; but now we know the contrary, which argueth that the <hi>Suns Heat</hi> is <hi>decayed</hi>: And if little Change did prove <hi>perperuity,</hi> then also many <hi>Stone-walls,</hi> which have stood two or three Thousand Years, and many things digged out of the Earth, might seem to remain <hi>unchanged</hi> ever since the <hi>Flood;</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably held <hi>Created</hi> from the <hi>Beginning,</hi> &amp;c. If Elementary Bodies shew so <hi>little Change,</hi> no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if <hi>Celestial</hi> shew <hi>none.</hi> And seeing inferiour Creatures are <hi>generated</hi> by <hi>help</hi> of <hi>Celestial,</hi> and receive <hi>Virtue</hi> from the <hi>Sun,</hi> their <hi>general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> argueth <hi>its decay</hi> also.</p>
            <p>But if the World were <hi>eternal,</hi> why not all things in it; especially Man, who is more Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, why did he not <hi>provide</hi> for his <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>? Again, if there were no <hi>common order</hi> of the divers Natures, how came that Difference, who set the <hi>Earth</hi> in the <hi>Center,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Bodies</hi> in their <hi>Courses,</hi> &amp;c. If <hi>those</hi> keep their <hi>Course</hi> of their own accord, to do good to the inferior Bodies, they are then <hi>eternal Love;</hi> yea, so many <hi>Gods, &amp;c.</hi> And if they be limited to their <hi>Course,</hi> there is an efficient Cause which hath bounded them.</p>
            <p>Now as to <hi>Nature</hi>: As <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath by the Ambiguity of the Name recommended Errors, and obscured <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>glory</hi> in the Creation and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>World;</hi> so his best <hi>Definition</hi> of it is but <hi>Nominal;</hi> only differencing natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from artificial, which yet the <hi>Academicks</hi>

explain better, calling it <hi>Seminary strength infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into Matter by the Soul of the World;</hi> and why give they the first place to <hi>Providence,</hi> the second to <hi>Fate,</hi> and third to <hi>Nature.</hi> But be <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> what it will, it cannot be the <hi>Cause</hi> of all things, if it hath not both <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> said <hi>Lactantius. Nature cannot but work, if Matter be present; and then also it can but produce the same things, except she have divers Matters to work upon,</hi> said <hi>Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> But <hi>Nature</hi> could not chuse diversity of <hi>Matters</hi> without <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Will, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> why then is such a <hi>Cause</hi> call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>All Men assign the highest place among <hi>all</hi> their <hi>Gods,</hi> to One, by <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s confession, <hi>de Coelo;</hi> and Reason teacheth us to Acknowledge and Adore the <hi>most Sublime Power.</hi> I account it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore monstrous Impiety to <hi>confound God,</hi> who disposes all things according to his own <hi>Will,</hi> with <hi>Nature,</hi> which disposes of nothing but as the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> wherein it worketh will permit. <hi>Nature</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isteth not of her self, but as a Faculty infused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things <hi>existing,</hi> by the supreamest Power; who therefore is to be Worshipped for creating such a Nature in all things, as without understanding what or how it worketh, yet bringeth all things to <hi>perfection.</hi> If therefore Men will rest upon that ground which all Antiquity held, That there is a Power <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>eternal;</hi> all things deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in Holy Scripture do as easily flow to the Proof of it, as the Waters to that of a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning River.

            </p>
            <p>To inquire farther into God's Essence, Power, and Skill, is to grow mad with Reason: What is beyond the reach of true Reason, is no shame to be ignorant of; neither is our Faith weakened by our being Ignorant how God Created the World, which Reason perswades he did.</p>
            <p>I cannot stand to excuse divers Passages in the following History, the whole being exceeding weak; especially the Division of the Books, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed to inlarge the <hi>Building</hi> after the <hi>Foundation</hi> was laid.</p>
            <p>Generally, as to the Order, I took Counsel from the Argument: After <hi>Babel</hi>'s Fall, the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> are first, of whose Actions we find but little Recorded, and more in <hi>Fame</hi> than <hi>Faith</hi>: Other Kings Actions are also related by Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, with some other things belonging to those Ages: These Digressions, the whole Course of our Lives (which is but Digression) may excuse: Yet I am not wholly ignorant of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>History.</hi>

               <p n="10">§. 10. Nature is an operating Power infused by God into every Creature; not any self-ability to be the Original of any thing of it self, no more than the Helm can guide the Ship without an Hand, or an Hand without Judgment. All Agents work by virtue of the first Act; <hi>and as the Eye seeth, Ear heareth,</hi> &amp;c. yet it is the Soul which giveth <hi>Power, Life</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> to these Organs: So it is God which worketh by Angels, Men, Nature, Stars, or infus'd Properties, as by his Instruments; all second Causes being but Conduits to convey and disperse what they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Fountain of the Universal. It is God's infinite Power and Omnipotence that giveth Power to the Sun and all second Causes, and to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her self to perform their Offices; which opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power from God being once stopp'd, Nature is without Virtue. <hi>Things flourish by God,</hi> said <hi>Orpheus.</hi> I endeavour not to destroy those various Virtues gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God to his Creatures, for all his Works in their Virtues praise him; but how he works in, or by them, no Man could ever conceive; as <hi>Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> confounding the Wisdom of Philosophers, denyed that all their study had found it; for could the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Knowledge of any thing be had, then of necessity all other things might be known.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. <hi>Destiny</hi> might safely be admitted, but for the inevitable necessity even over Mens Minds and Wills, held by <hi>Stoicks, Chaldeans, Pharisees, Prisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianists,</hi>

&amp;c. <hi>Hermes</hi> and <hi>Apuleius</hi> conceived well That <hi>Fate is an obedience of second Causes to the First. Plotinus</hi> calls it <hi>a disposing, from the Acts of the Celestial Orbs, working unchangeably in inferiour Bodies</hi>; which is true in things not ordered by a rational Mind. <hi>Fate</hi> is that which God hath spoken concerning us, say the Stoicks, <hi>Seneca, Ptolomy.</hi> And no doubt Stars are of a greater use, than to give an obscure Light; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Seasons of Winter and Summer so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in Heat and Cold, by the motions of Sun and Moon, which are so certain, but the working of the Stars with them.

               <p>The Treasure of His Wisdom, who is so Infinite, could not be short in giving them their peculiar Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Operations, as he gave to Herbs, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which adorn the <hi>Earth.</hi> As therefore these Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Earth</hi> have their Virtue to feed and cure; so no doubt those <hi>Heavenly</hi> Ornaments want not their further use, wherein to serve his Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as his just Will shall please to determine. But in this question of <hi>Fate,</hi> let us neither bind God to his Creatures, nor rob them of the Office he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them: If second Causes restrain God, or God by them inforce Man's Mind or Will, then wicked Men might lay the fault on God.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. <hi>Prescience,</hi> or Fore-knowledge (if we may speak of God after the manner of Men) goeth before his <hi>Providence</hi>; for God infallibly foreknew all things before they had any Being to be cared for; yet was it not the Cause of things following, nor did it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Necessity.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. <hi>Providence</hi> is an intellectual Knowledg, Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing, Caring for, and Ordering all things: Behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things past, present, and to come, and is the

This Image of Power was made by Ignorants, who ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed that to <hi>Fortune</hi> of which they saw no manifest Cause.

The best Philosophers held, that all things in Heaven and Earth were ordered by the Soul of the World, said <hi>Cicero.</hi> When Riches and Honour are given to empty Men, and Learned, Virtuous, and Valiant Men wear out their Lives in a dejected condition, the Cause is manifest to the <hi>Wise,</hi> tho' <hi>Fools</hi> ascribe it to blind <hi>Fortune.</hi> For either it is Affection in Men preferring others, or great Persons which endure no other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse

Others conceive this <hi>Image</hi> to be in Man's immortal Soul; which is one, and <hi>Incorporeal,</hi> governing the Body, being in every part of it totally, as God is totally in every part of the World; but the Soul's being totally in every part more than potentially, is doubted of.

from the Sun</hi>; which Error the <hi>Manichees</hi> also held. But as the Sun is not of the Essence of the Divine Light, but a Body enlighten'd with a created Light; so this <hi>Mind</hi> or Understanding in Man, is not of the Essence of God's Understanding, but the purest of the Soul's Faculties, or the light of the reasonable Soul; called the Soul of the Soul, or Eye of the Soul, by <hi>Augustine,</hi> or Receptacle of Wisdom. Between this <hi>Mens</hi> or understanding power and Reason, between it and <hi>Anima,</hi> and <hi>Animus,</hi> is this difference, that by the <hi>Soul</hi> we live, by Reason we judge and discourse, by the Mind or <hi>Animus,</hi> we will and chuse; but this Mind called <hi>Mens,</hi> is a pure substantial Act of the Soul, not depending on Matter, but hath relation to that which is intelligible, as its first Object. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus</hi> saith, the Soul is the Image of the Mind, which is the Image of God, <hi>&amp;c. Ficinus</hi> labours to prove the Mind hath no need of Organs: <hi>Zanchius</hi> says, the Mind needs no Means to understand by, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that the Representations which come from the Sense to the Phantasie, are the Objects of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; which Resemblances are to the <hi>Mind</hi> as Colours are to the <hi>Sight.</hi> Thus he makes the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie an Organ to the <hi>Mind,</hi> as the Eye to the Sight, contrary to his first Assertion. However these be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, we may resemble our selves to God in Mind, in respect of that pure Faculty which is never sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Contemplation and love of God. <hi>The Mind,</hi> said <hi>Bernard, is not the Image of God, because it understands, remembers, and loveth it self; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it understands, remembers, and loveth God, who Created it.</hi> So that Immortality, Reason, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, do not make us God's shadow, <hi>but the Habit of Righteousness, most perfectly infused into the Soul and Mind in the Creation.</hi> It is not by Nature that we are printed with the Seal of God's Image (though Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be part of the essential Constitution of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Species or Kind) but this is from the Bounty of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64357:35"/>
God's Goodness, which breathing Life into Earth, contrived therein the Inimitable Ability of his own Justice, Piety, and Righteousness. So long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Men walk in God's ways, which is called walking with God, and do fear, love, and serve him truly, <hi>for the love of God only,</hi> so long they retain this <hi>Image.</hi> But it cannot be in Unjust, Cruel, False and Ambitious <hi>Souls, &amp;c.</hi> And though Nature (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to common understanding) do make us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and apt enough to receive this <hi>Image,</hi> yet if God's exceeding Wisdom and liberal Mercy fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not Eyes to our Souls, we could not come by it. For not only the Perfection, but the Image of it self, to wit, the supernatural Gift of Grace and Glory, is wholly blotted out by Sin.</p>

with this terrible Inscription, <hi>God will bring every work to Iudgment.</hi> Let us therefore not flatter our selves, wilfully to offend God in hope easily to make our peace at the last, which is a Rebellious Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Deriding the dreadful God that can ruin us eternally.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. To this corruptible Body, God gave a Soul spiritual and incorruptible, which shall again return to him, as the body to the Earth.

Man's Four <hi>Complexions</hi> like the Four <hi>Elements,</hi> and his Seven <hi>Ages</hi> like the Seven <hi>Planets.</hi> Our <hi>Infancy</hi> is like the <hi>Moon,</hi> in which it seemeth only to grow, as Planets; in our next Age we are instructed as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Mercury,</hi> always near the Sun: Our <hi>Youth</hi> is

Now, and never before, we think upon our Eternal Habitation, to which place we pass with many sighs, groans, and doleful thoughts; and in the end, by <hi>Death</hi> we finish the sorrowful Business of a wretched <hi>Life,</hi> toward which we have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways travelling, sleeping, and waking; and by what crooked Paths soever we have walked, yet it led us the straight way to the gate of Death. Neither can beloved Companions, or rather our Gods, <hi>Riches</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> stay us one hour from entring that all-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Dungeon of Death, which is not yet satisfy'd with all those past Generations, but still cries <hi>all Flesh is grass,</hi> 'till it have consumed all.

               <head>CHAP. III. Of Paradise, and many Opinions about it.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. PAradise, the first Habitation of <hi>Adam,</hi> Eastward in <hi>Eden,</hi> about which Mens Opinions are as various as the Persons that Disputed it; and many imbibe gross Errors, led by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of great Men, wherein many Fathers were far wide, as it is the Fate of all Men to err, neither has any Man knowledge of all things.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Many held Paradise in <hi>Moses</hi> Allegorical only; as <hi>Origen, Philo,</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> lean'd to that Opinion; so did <hi>Strabus, Rabanus, Beda, Commestor. Chrysamensis</hi>; and <hi>Luther</hi> thought it not extant, though it was formerly. <hi>Vadianus Noviomagus</hi> held it the whole Earth. <hi>Tertul. Bonaventure</hi> and <hi>Durand</hi> place it under the Equinoctial; <hi>Postellus</hi> under the <hi>N. Pole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Paradise by <hi>Moses</hi>'s description, was a Place on Earth, in <hi>Eden,</hi> a Country Eastward, so called, for the Pleasantness thereof; as in <hi>America</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is called <hi>Florida.</hi> Here the vulgar Translation is mistaken in interpreting it a Paradise of Pleasure from the beginning. This situation of Paradise in the East, occasion'd the praying, and setting Churches to the East, contrary to the standing of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, and the Priest turning to the West; yet God is every where; neither is any Mystery in the word East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but the place stood so from <hi>Canaan. Moses</hi>'s whole description proves it an Earthly place, and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> witnesseth <hi>Eden</hi> was a Country near <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran:</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi>'s actions, and end of placing in it, prove no less against those vain Allegories of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture stories, confuted by <hi>Iews,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi>: Yet I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not an Allegorical sense of some stories, besides

                  </gap>he Literal, as <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Suidas</hi> held Paradise had both. <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Alcinous</hi> Garden, and <hi>Elizian</hi> Fields, were Poetical Fictions stoln out of the Divine Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, and profaned by them.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. It is no Curiosity to enquire after the Place; seeing nothing is in Scripture, but for instruction; and if the truth of the story be necessary, the place set out for the proof of it, is not to be neglected, and Mens fancies therein overthrow the Story. For what is more ridiculous, than to seek <hi>Adam</hi>'s Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise as high as the Moon, or beyond the Ocean which he waded through to come to <hi>Iudea</hi>; or that it is a separated ground hanging in the Air under the Moon, from whence the four Rivers fall with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and force through the Sea, and rise again in our habitable World; as <hi>Commestor</hi> dreamed, and others. That therefore the Truth might receive no prejudice, God's Wisdom hath so carefully described the place for our easie finding, as the choisest part of the Earth. And if it be a generous mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know the Original of our Ancestors, this search cannot be discommended.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. Paradise is not so defaced by the Flood that it cannot be found, as <hi>Augustinus Chrysamensis</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for though the Beauty of it be lost, and Time has made it as a common Field in <hi>Eden,</hi> yet eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and seventy years after would not so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary have described it, nor the Prophets have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Eden</hi> so often, if the same could not be found, or if the Rivers which in his time bear the Names, were not the same, of which <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> were never doubted, as the Country of <hi>Eden</hi> is yet well known. As for the alteration made by the Flood, changing the current of Rivers, and raising of Mountains, as some judge, it is improbable; for the Waters covered the Earth spherically, and did not fall violently from higher places, or come in with Storms ebbing and flowing, which makes such
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64357:38"/>
choakings up of the mouths of Rivers. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then were raised by universal erruptions, and by down right falls of Rain, which use to scatter the strongest Winds. <hi>Seth</hi>'s Pillar erected 1426 year before, as Antiquitiy reports, and standing in <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>'s days, and the City under <hi>Libanus,</hi> whose Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins remained to <hi>Annius</hi>'s days, and by <hi>Berosus</hi> forged Fragments call'd <hi>Enochia,</hi> built by <hi>Cain,</hi> and the City <hi>Ioppa</hi> remaining after the Flood, argue the Flood had no such effect to work such alteration, when even Bay-Trees outstood it. Antiquity also speaks of <hi>Baris,</hi> and <hi>Sion,</hi> on which the Fable is that Giants were saved, which argueth their Judgment touching the Antiquity of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Paradise was not the whole Earth, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichus, Vadianus, Noviomagus,</hi> and <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> judged, seeing the Text saith it was Eastward in <hi>Eden,</hi> and the Angel was plac'd on the east side of Paradise, and <hi>Adam</hi> was cast out of it, not out of all the Earth. Yet the Error of <hi>Ephrem, Athanasius,</hi> and <hi>Cyrill,</hi> was greater, that Paradise was beyond the Ocean, through which <hi>Adam</hi> walked when he was cast out, to return to the Earth of his Creation, and was buried on <hi>Calvery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Paradise by <hi>Bar-Cephas, Beda, Strabus,</hi> and <hi>Rabanus,</hi> was placed on a Mountain almost as high as the Moon; neither did <hi>Rupertus</hi> differ much. It seemeth they took it out of <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> who mis-understood it, no doubt took this Place for Heaven, the Habitation of Blessed Souls after Death, though for fear of the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> they durst not set down in plain terms what they believed of that Matter. And though in the end <hi>Socrates</hi> was put to death for acknowledging one only sufficient God, yet the Devil himself did him that right, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him the wisest Man. As for the place in question, <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> conceive, that by it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64357:38"/>
he meant the Celestial Paradise: <hi>Solinus</hi> indeed <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> of a place called <hi>Acrothonos,</hi> upon Mount <hi>Atho,</hi> pleasant and healthful, whose Inhabitants are called <hi>Macrobioi,</hi> long lived: Upon the aforesaid <hi>Lunary Hill,</hi> they say <hi>Enoch</hi> was preserved; which <hi>Isidore</hi> and <hi>Lumbard</hi> approve; and <hi>Tertullian, Ireneus, Iustin Martyr</hi> believed the Souls of blessed Men lived there; which Fancies <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> have Confuted. As for the Bodies of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> they may be changed, as others shall be at the last Day. The School-men in this and their other Questions, were exceeding subtle, but yet taught their Followers to shift better than to resolve by their Distinctions. The Fables of <hi>Olympus, Atlas,</hi> and <hi>Atho,</hi> higher than any Clouds, <hi>Pliny</hi> himself disproveth.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>Tertullian, Bonaventure</hi> and <hi>Durand</hi> place <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi> under the <hi>Equinoctial</hi>; to which <hi>Aquinas</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the Distemper of <hi>Heat</hi> there. But this is <hi>Non causa</hi> for <hi>causa</hi>; the true Cause is, <hi>Eden</hi> and the Rivers are not there; else the Clime hath as pleasant fertile places as any other; neither was any Region Created but for Habitation, and those hot Countries are tempered by <hi>East</hi> Winds, and long cool Nights as I well know; only where Mountains hinder the Wind, and in sandy Grounds void of Trees, the Country is not so well Inhabited, as the other parts, which are so Fertile, that the Inhabitants Idleness maketh them Vitious, and the Countries to be <hi>Terrae Vitiosae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. <hi>Paradise</hi> not being in the former places, we are certain it was in <hi>Eden,</hi> not hard to have been found out, had not Names been changed since <hi>Moses</hi>'s days; and that other Nations have sought to extinguish both the Name and Monuments of the <hi>Iews.</hi> For our <hi>help</hi> we have <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris</hi> agreed upon, and that it was <hi>Eastward</hi> from <hi>Canaan</hi>; which latter might agree with <hi>Arab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

exceeding <hi>Fertile.</hi> As for bordering Countries, though <hi>Moses</hi> name none, yet <hi>Esaiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> do; and though that <hi>Amos</hi> name <hi>Eden,</hi> which is <hi>Coelosyria,</hi> and <hi>Beroaldus</hi> findeth a City there called <hi>Paradise,</hi> yet can it not be the <hi>Eden</hi> we seek, seeing <hi>Coelosyria</hi> and <hi>Cyprian Damascena</hi> is full <hi>North</hi> from <hi>Canaan,</hi> and wants our known Rivers. Come then to the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi> in <hi>Thelassar,</hi> and the rest named by <hi>Esaiah: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lassar</hi> was a strong City in an Island upon the Border of <hi>Chaldea</hi> on the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> towards the <hi>North,</hi> which after <hi>Senacharib</hi>'s death, <hi>Merodach Balladan</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning <hi>Babilonia,</hi> fortified against <hi>Esar Haddon,</hi> which City <hi>Marcellinus</hi> calls <hi>Thelatha; Pliny, Teridata,</hi> which <hi>Iulian</hi> durst not assault. The other places in <hi>Esaiah</hi> are either in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> as <hi>Charan</hi> and <hi>Reseph,</hi> or in <hi>Media,</hi> as <hi>Gosan</hi>; so <hi>Ezekiel</hi> setting out the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which traded with <hi>Tyrus,</hi> joineth <hi>Charan</hi> with <hi>Eden,</hi> as also <hi>Calne,</hi> which <hi>Ierom</hi> calls <hi>Seleuiza,</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Euphrates</hi> towards <hi>Tigris,</hi> called also <hi>Canneh,</hi> and the Inhabitants <hi>Schenits</hi> by <hi>Pliny</hi>; who Inhabited from <hi>Seleucia</hi> on both sides <hi>Euphrates,</hi> Westward to <hi>Coelosyria,</hi> as far as <hi>Tapsachus,</hi> where the River is Fordable. <hi>Charan</hi> therefore cannot be <hi>Channeh,</hi> the one standing on <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the other on <hi>Chaboras,</hi> which falleth into <hi>Euphrates,</hi> far off in <hi>Mesopotamia</hi>: Or <hi>Aran</hi> between the Floods.

               <p n="1">§. 1. THAT the two Trees of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legde,</hi> were material Trees, the most Learned and Religious Writers doubt not of; though they were Figures of the Law and Gospel, yet some would have them only Allegorical, because of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2.7.

Touching the Tree of <hi>Life</hi> it is hard to think, that Bodies nourished by <hi>Corruptible means</hi> should be immortal; yet if <hi>Adam</hi> had not disobeyed God's Commandment, he and his Posterity might have lived an healthful, unalterable Life, Four times longer than the first Fathers, and then been transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as <hi>Enoch</hi> was. For God's infinite Wisdom fore-saw that the Earth could not have contain'd a perpetual increase, or Millions of Souls must have been unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:64357:41"/>§. 2. Touching the Tree of <hi>Knowledge, Goropius Becanus</hi> will have the honour to have found it to be the <hi>Indian</hi> Fig-tree; but however that Opinion be esteem'd, and that never Man thought better of his own, than he, yet herein he usurped upon <hi>Moses Bar-cephas,</hi> who hit on this Conjecture 600 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and cited <hi>Pbilaxinus</hi> and others long before. <hi>Becanus</hi> upon a Conceit this Tree is only found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Banks of <hi>Acesines,</hi> which runneth into <hi>Indus,</hi> will therefore find <hi>Paradise</hi> there; but my self have <hi>seen</hi> 20000 of them in a Valley of <hi>America,</hi> not far from <hi>Paria,</hi> as also in <hi>Trinidado.</hi> The magnitude of this Tree in <hi>Pliny</hi> and others, I am asham'd to report; the Stemm as streight as may be, without Branch for Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Thirty Foot, where they spread abroad their Boughs; and from the Head branches a Gumm that hangeth downward, and by increasing in a few Months, as a Cord, reacheth the Ground, taketh Root and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh a Tree; which also by the like Gum maketh others, and in a short time, such a Grove ariseth, like which there is no Tree. And if a Branch hang over the Water, the Gum will pierce the Water and take root, so that falling sometimes into a Bed of Oysters, they are so intangled, that plucking up one of these Cords, I have seen 500 Oisters hanging about it: The Leaves largeness, and Fruits pleasantness I find not according to Report, yet have I travelled 12 Miles under them. In conclusion, though <hi>Becanus</hi> count it impudent Obstinacy to dare to think this not the Tree, yet <hi>Philo</hi> believes that the Earth never brought forth the Tree since.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Becanus</hi>'s witty Allegory of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, believes it not worthy the Commendation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Touching the name of the Tree, <hi>Bar-cephas</hi> translated by <hi>Masius,</hi> saith, it was so called of the Event; for that after eating thereof, they should know by experience the Happiness they had lost, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64357:42"/>
the Misery their Disobedience would bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>Iunius</hi> followeth this Exposition. <hi>Adam</hi> by excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Creation could not be ignorant of the Good and Evil of Obedience, and Disobedience; yet as Men in sickness better know the good of health, and evil of sickness than they conceived before, so was it with <hi>Adam.</hi> For looking into the Glass of his guilty Conscience, which Evil he never knew, he saw the horrour of Gods Judgment, and sensibly knew the loss of the Good which could not be valu'd; and purchas'd Evil not to be expressed: And then he saw himself Naked both in Body and Mind, that is, deprived of Gods Grace and former Felicity; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was it called the <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi> and not of any Operation it had by a peculiar quality. For the same Phrase is used in Scripture; and names are given to Signs and Sacraments, as to things performed and done. But <hi>Adam</hi> being betray'd and overrul'd by his own Affection, and ambitious of further Knowledge, and of the glory would attend it, and slightly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on what the Lord had threatned, was transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the gentle winds of pleasing perswasion, whereupon Satan strengthened his progression, poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning the roots of mankind, which he moistened with the Liquor of the same ambition, by which himself perished for ever. The means the Devil us'd, was his Wife, given to have been a Comforter, not a Counseller. She desiring to know what was unsit for her, as doth all that Sex ever since, and He unwilling to grieve or discontent her, as all his Sex are to this day, yielded to her Charms. If this befell him in his perfection, not yet acquainted with bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Imbracements, and if <hi>Solomon</hi> the wisest could not escape the snare of Female Allurements, it is not so wonderful, as lamentable, that other Men perish at that Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>CAIN</hi> inheriting his Fathers Pride, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining his Brother, who was more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable than himself, became the first Murderer, and made his Brother the first Martyr. And tho' God mitigated his Revenge of this Sin upon <hi>Cain</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, yet for the Sins of Cruelty and Injustice he destroyed the World.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Cain</hi>'s dwelling in the Land of <hi>Nod,</hi> or agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Iunius</hi> expounds it, is not as <hi>Ierom</hi> and others held, that he setled in no certain Country; but of his distracted Thought and unquiet Conscience the Country was so called. This Country in which he setled, and in which for fear of wandering he built a City, <hi>Iunius</hi> supposeth to be <hi>Arabia</hi> the <hi>Desart</hi>; but the Text boundeth it on the East of <hi>Eden,</hi> whereas <hi>Arabia</hi> is West. As for the <hi>Nomades</hi> which liv'd upon Pasturage, without Tillage, they were not any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nation, but it was a common Name for all that so lived, as the <hi>Northern Tartars, Getulians, Numidians,</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Britains,</hi> and <hi>Northern Irish.</hi> Besides, the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unpeopled, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s Family small, and that also on the East side of <hi>Eden,</hi> in that part of <hi>Assyria</hi> which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls <hi>Calena,</hi> it is unlike <hi>Cain</hi> would go so far West to <hi>Arabia.</hi> Touching the City <hi>Enoch</hi> built, either for security, or to oppress others, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> judged, probably it was of great Repute in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> when mighty Oppressors carried all the Fame. It may be also, some Monuments of it remained, as they say, of <hi>Ioppa,</hi> after the Flood, which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Posterity, being of like violent disposition either to reedifie the same, or some other of that Name. Hence it might be, that in time Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies scatter'd from thence their Captives; the

name of <hi>Henochians</hi> from <hi>Bactria</hi> and <hi>Sogdiana, East</hi> from <hi>Eden</hi> (where <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> find the Name <hi>South</hi> from <hi>Oxus</hi>) unto <hi>Iberia, Albania</hi> and <hi>Colchis</hi> near <hi>Pontus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Moses</hi> has been very brief in the Story of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Issue, it being utterly to be destroy'd: Yet the long lives of that Age and the liberty his Children took in Marrying, may well argue he might in one quarter of his Life, people a large City, which his Issue were more ingenious to supply with the Inventions ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them, while <hi>Seth</hi>'s Posterity is commended for care of Religion and Heavenly things.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. The Patriarchs Ages, when they began to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, is not found in them that are named: For <hi>Moses</hi>'s purpose was not to record a Genealogy of the first begotten, but of the Ancestors of <hi>Noah</hi> before the Flood, and of <hi>Abraham</hi> after; so that having the Age of these that succeed one another in that Line, it was sufficient, whether they were younger or elder Brethren. <hi>Cain</hi> was the Eldest of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sons, yet <hi>Adam</hi>'s Age when he begat him is not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as it is of <hi>Seth</hi>: Neither can any one say directly, <hi>Adam</hi> had but <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> before, nor that <hi>Enoch</hi> was <hi>Seth</hi>'s Eldest Son, <hi>Mehalaleel</hi> begat <hi>Iared</hi> at 65. who begat <hi>Chanoch</hi> at 162; the like or greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the rest, which cannot be ascribed to the long abstinence from Marriage upon Religious respect, as we see in holy <hi>Enoch.

The Patriarchs Years have been questioned, some holding them Lunary or <hi>Egyptian</hi>; but that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; for then some should beget Children at 6, 7, or 8 Years old, and the Eldest should live not 100 Years, which is short of many after the Flood; yea long since, <hi>Pliny</hi> witnesseth under <hi>Vespasian,</hi> in a search, many were found above 120, and some 140 Years

Old. Simple Diet and temperate Life, made the <hi>Essaeans, Egyptian</hi> Priests, <hi>Persian</hi> Magicians, <hi>Indian Brachmans</hi> live long, saith <hi>Iosephus. Pliny</hi> reports <hi>Nestor</hi>'s 3 Ages. <hi>Tyresia</hi>'s 6 <hi>Sybils</hi> 300 Years, <hi>Endy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion</hi>'s little less. <hi>Ant.

To conclude, there are three things (not to speak of Constellations) which are natural <hi>Causes of long and healthful Life</hi>: Strong Parents, pure Air, and temperate use of Dyet, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Rest, all which excelled in the First Ages. And though the Flood infused an impure quality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth to hurt the means of Man's Life, yet Time hath more consumed Natures Vigour, as that which hath made the Heavens wax old like a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hereto add, our strange Education of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, upon unnatural Curiosity nourished by a strange Dugg: Hasty Marriage, before Natures Seed be ripe, or Stock well rooted to yield a Branch fit to replant. But above all, the Luxury of latter Ages, which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oppresseth Nature, and then thinks to relieve her with strong Waters, hot Spices, Sauces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. The Patriarchs knowledge of the Creation might well come by Tradition from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> seeing <hi>Methusalem</hi> lived with <hi>Adam</hi> 243 Years, and with <hi>Noah</hi> 500 Years, and he with <hi>Abraham</hi> 58 Years, from whom it was not hard to pass by <hi>Isaac, Iacob</hi> and his Posterity to <hi>Moses</hi>: Yet for the more certainty of the Truth, it was undoubtedly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Moses</hi> by immediate Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, as his many Miracles do prove. Questionless also, Letters were from the Infancy of the World, as <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Pillars and his Prophecy witness, of which part was found in <hi>Saba,</hi> saith <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> read some Pages; neither can it be denyed there was such, saith <hi>Augustine.</hi>

The Patriarchs Lives were lightly passed over 'till <hi>Enoch,</hi> whose Piety is commended, and his leaving the World not by Death: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Change were such as shall be at the last day, let Divines judge. <hi>Lamech</hi>'s Prophecy of his Son <hi>Noah</hi> is touch'd upon, but <hi>Noah</hi>'s Life is handled more amply. The Wisdom, Policy and Wars of that World, were no doubt, great, as may be gathered, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.4. but the Universal Impiety which brought the Universal Destruction, deserved that the Memory of their Actions should be drowned with their Bodies. It were madness to imagine the Sons of God spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. were good Angels, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Giants on Women, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> dreamt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Lactantius,</hi> Confuted by <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom.</hi>

               <p n="8">§. 8. The Giants spoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. <hi>Becanus</hi> strains his Wit to prove, they were not such properly, but so called for their Oppression: But <hi>Moses</hi> calling them Mighty, which argueth extraordinary Strength, and Men of Renown and great undertaking, there is more Reason to hold them <hi>Giants</hi> in a proper sense, especially considering what Scripture Reporteth of such in the Days of <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua, David, &amp;c.</hi> yea of whole Kindreds and Countries. If such were found in the Third and Fourth Ages of the Worlds decay, there is no Reason to doubt thereof in the First and Second flourishing Ages.

               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood was extraordinary, not upon natural Causes, as the other; but by God's special Power strengthening the influence of Stars to fill all the Cisterns of Waters in Fountains and Clouds: And though <hi>H.</hi> of <hi>Machline,</hi> Scholar of <hi>Albertus,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the last, and of a watery Sign and House of <hi>Luna,</hi> over against the Ship, by which the Flood might have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen; and was also by <hi>Noah,</hi> as <hi>P. de Aliaao</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; yet however God used second Causes, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded supernatural force to the Clouds and Fountains, to empty their whole Treasuries of Waters.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. There needed not new Created Waters in this <hi>Flood</hi>; not to dispute whether God hath restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself from Creating.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64357:48"/>
besides his Condensation of the Air to convert it into Rain, which is so ordinary; and thus might the Waters grow to exceed the Mountains 15 Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.

               <p>My first Argument against the common Opinion is, from the time of 130 Years, which most, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Berosus,</hi> give <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s coming to <hi>Shinar,</hi> which by easy Journeys, might be travailed in 20 days from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64357:49"/>
the <hi>Gordei</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> having only <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, and <hi>Tigris</hi> to help them. This maketh it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, they should be so many Years before they Planted such a Country so near them; which could not be to them so long unknown, being Encreased to a great Multitude long before those 130 Years.</p>
               <p>My 2<hi>d.</hi> Argument is from the Civility and Multitude of the Eastern Nations, who had used <hi>Artillery</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> long before the <hi>West.</hi> It was thought a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Philostratus,</hi> that the Wise Men inhabiting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Hyphasis,</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> drive away their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with Thunder and Lightning, whereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and made <hi>Hercules</hi> cast away his Golden Shield. <hi>Io. Cuthenberge</hi> brought Printing from the <hi>East: Conrade,</hi> from him, brought it to <hi>Rome</hi>; and <hi>Gerson</hi> bettered it; all about a 100 Years past. <hi>Alexander Macedon</hi> found more Cities and Magnificence in the little Kingdom of <hi>Porus,</hi> which lay close to <hi>India,</hi> than in all his Travels; esteeming <hi>Italy</hi> barbarous, and <hi>Rome</hi> a Village: But <hi>Babylon</hi> was in his Eye, and the Fame of the <hi>East</hi> pierced his Ears. <hi>Ioppan,</hi> now <hi>Zippingari,</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Religious and addicted to Letters, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, Prayers, and Worshipping but one God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. My Third Argument is from the resistance which <hi>Semiramis</hi> found in <hi>Est-India,</hi> though her Army ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Three Millions, as <hi>Diod. Siculus,</hi> out of <hi>Ctesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> reports, besides 500000 Horse, and 100000 Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons; of all which, admit but a third part true. <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s Greatness is not doubted, nor that his People grew into such Multitudes by <hi>Semiramis</hi>'s time, Wife of <hi>Ninus,</hi> Son of <hi>Belus,</hi> Son of <hi>Nimrod</hi>: But that a Colony sent from <hi>Babel</hi> into the <hi>East,</hi> should so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in so short a time, is incredible; yet these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Report, that <hi>Staurobathez,</hi> King of <hi>East-India,</hi> exceeded her in numbers, which could not be, if the <hi>East</hi> were replenished by a Colony from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64357:50"/>6. My Fourth Argument is 1st. from <hi>Noah</hi>'s person, who being at <hi>Babel</hi>'s Confusion, and the 731st Year of his Age, was not like to be unsetled, and to seek a Seat. 2. The Text saith, he became a Husband-man; which argueth his setled Course of Life; not a Wanderer from <hi>Armenia</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> then to <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> then to <hi>Africa,</hi> so to <hi>Spain, Italy, &amp;e.</hi> as they report; not considering his Years, the difficulty of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an over-grown wild World, which had lyen waste 140 Years. 3. Besides the place of his Landing, being <hi>East</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rich and Pleasant, the Wise Father would not neglect the planting of it, and seek out less pleasing Parts with such difficulties. 4. Neither is it to be thought, the Reverend Father was at that presumptuous Work of <hi>Babel,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained it not. 5. We find <hi>Ioctan, Havila</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> Planted in <hi>India,</hi> which were not like to have turned back from <hi>Shinar. Lastly,</hi> The Scriptures si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>Noah,</hi> after his departure from the <hi>East</hi> to <hi>Shinar,</hi> argueth him left there; and so out of all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, which might touch the History of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> was to prosecute.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Annius</hi> on <hi>Berosus</hi> lands the Ark on the <hi>Caspian</hi> Mountain of <hi>Armenia</hi>; to which purpose he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the <hi>Caspian</hi> and <hi>Gordian</hi> Hills, which <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> sets far asunder, and <hi>Mercator</hi> sets 5 Degrees, and <hi>Villanovanus,</hi> much more Ancient, sets 7 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or 420 Miles one from the other. And tho' I grant, that Mankind was renewed in <hi>Scythia,</hi> 250 Years before <hi>Ninus</hi> (as <hi>Porticus Cato</hi> records) yet was not this <hi>Scythia</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> but under the Mountains of <hi>Paropamisus</hi> in 130 Degrees of Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, according to <hi>Ptolomy</hi>; whereas the supposed <hi>Armenia Araxea</hi> is in 87. neither hath he any <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> nearer <hi>Armenia Araxea</hi>; though he sets out 100 several Nations of <hi>Scythians,</hi> such as <hi>Imaus</hi> by the <hi>Asian Sarmatia</hi> on the <hi>West; Imaus</hi> on the <hi>East</hi>; the <hi>Sacces, Sogdians</hi> and <hi>Margians</hi> on the <hi>South</hi>; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64357:50"/>
the Mouth of <hi>Oxus</hi> and unknown <hi>Countries</hi> on the <hi>North.</hi> He also maketh the <hi>Asian Sarmatia</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend many Nations, and a great part between <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi> besides <hi>Colchis, Iberia</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania.</hi> Neither <hi>Prenetus, Iohn Plancrápio, Haytonus</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> writing of <hi>Scythia</hi> or <hi>Tartaria,</hi> speak one word of <hi>Armenia</hi>; nor <hi>Matheus a Micon,</hi> a <hi>Sarmasian</hi> Cannon of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> who travelled a great part of <hi>Sarmatia Asiatica</hi>; yet he observed that <hi>Tanais,</hi> or <hi>Don,</hi> and <hi>Volga</hi> or <hi>Edel,</hi> spring but of <hi>Lakes</hi> and <hi>Marishes,</hi> and not out of <hi>Riphian</hi> or <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Mountains in <hi>Scythia.</hi> He also sheweth that the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Sarmatia</hi> contains <hi>Russia, Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> and is bounded on the <hi>West</hi> by <hi>Vissa</hi> or <hi>Vistula,</hi> parting it from <hi>Germany</hi>; That the <hi>Scythians</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Sarmatia,</hi> came thither above 300 Years past out of the <hi>East,</hi> where the <hi>Ark</hi> rested; and that the <hi>Sacae-Scythians</hi> were North of <hi>Taurus</hi> or <hi>Ararat</hi>: As for the <hi>Ariacan Scythians,</hi> between <hi>Iaxartus</hi> and <hi>Iactus</hi> on the East of the <hi>Caspian,</hi> they are no <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. My fifth Argument is from the place where <hi>Noah</hi> Planted a Vine, which could not be in <hi>Armenia,</hi> much colder than <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where yet Vines grow not naturally, as they did where <hi>Noah</hi> Planted, as his Husbandry witnesseth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Objection</hi> 1. The Text saith, <hi>from thence God scattered them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Answer,</hi> That is, the Builders of the Tower, which were not all, but certain of them, which were increased after the Flood.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Objection</hi> 2. <hi>Ararat</hi> signifieth <hi>Armenia,</hi> which the <hi>Caldean Paraph.</hi> calls <hi>Kardu.</hi> 2. <hi>Answer.</hi> Writers agree not about <hi>Ararat</hi>: The <hi>Sybill</hi>'s Books place it in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> near where <hi>Caelenes</hi> was built; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the River <hi>Marsyas</hi> joineth with <hi>Meander</hi>; but this is far from the <hi>Gordiean</hi> Mountains. <hi>Iosephus,</hi> out of <hi>Berosus,</hi> placeth <hi>Ararat</hi> between <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Parthia,</hi> toward <hi>Adibene</hi>; where they vent pieces of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64357:51"/>
the Ark, but he erreth: For <hi>Adibene</hi> whereon <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> Bordereth, is part of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and hath all <hi>Media</hi> between it and <hi>Parthia.</hi> As for the Reliques of the Ark, they make it but a Report, by an infamous Historian. The <hi>Armenian</hi> Mountains, or <hi>Moschici</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> or <hi>Pariedri</hi> in <hi>Pliny,</hi> stretch to the upper part of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> in 43 and 44 Degrees, <hi>North</hi> of the <hi>Gordiaeans</hi> in the 39 Degree 10/60. From the <hi>Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> the <hi>Georgian Christians</hi> are called, preserved from <hi>Infidels,</hi> which compass them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Neither was it necessary the Ark should stay on the highest Mountains, seeing <hi>Noah</hi> came not out till the Vallies were clear'd; yet other Mountains are higher than the <hi>Armenian,</hi> as <hi>Athos,</hi> or <hi>Olympus,</hi> between <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> whose shadows are above Thirty Seven Miles, now called <hi>Lucas,</hi> saith <hi>Castaldus; Olympus</hi> also in <hi>Thessaly</hi> over-tops Wind, Rain, and Clouds: <hi>Antandrus</hi> in <hi>Misia</hi> seen to <hi>Constantinople</hi> whence <hi>Scamandrus</hi> floweth, running through <hi>Troy: Altas</hi> in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> no man's Eye can reach the Top: <hi>Caucasus</hi> is inlightned after Mid-night at the first Cock-Crow, said <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which I believe not, seeing <hi>Tenerif</hi> in <hi>Canaria,</hi> which is known to be the highest in the World, is not Light so soon.</p>
               <p n="12">12. These Incongruities rise from <hi>Ararat</hi> in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia. First, Sybil</hi> placeth it in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> contrary to <hi>Berosus. Secondly, Baris</hi> is not the highest, and if it were, yet the Ark might rest else where. <hi>Thirdly, Baris</hi> signifieth <hi>high,</hi> towards which may be any high Hill; especially, <hi>Caucasus,</hi> whence <hi>Indus</hi> riseth: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Authors agree not where <hi>Gordia</hi> stands. <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Truth requireth to find an <hi>Ararat East</hi> from <hi>Shinar,</hi> and warmer than <hi>Armenia,</hi> in the <hi>North.</hi> Let us therefore understand, that <hi>Ararat</hi> in <hi>Moses</hi> is no one Hill, but a common Name to many, as the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Pireneans</hi>; so that the long Ridge of Hills which <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi> calls <hi>Taurus, Niphatus, Coatras, Coronus, Sariphi,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> call <hi>Taurus,</hi> till they cross <hi>Imaus,</hi> where
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64357:51"/>
they are called <hi>Ararat</hi> or <hi>Armenia,</hi> for that they seem to begin there. Thus <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls all the Hills between the <hi>Caspian</hi> and <hi>Euxinus,</hi> by one name <hi>Caucasus,</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Hercanus, Armenian Coraxis, Caspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Moschian, Henochian, Scythian Amazon</hi>; so all the the Ridge of Hills in <hi>America,</hi> from North <hi>Granada</hi> to the <hi>Magelan</hi> Straights, is called <hi>Andes.</hi> The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ararat</hi> runs <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> as <hi>Imaus North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi> As for <hi>Ptolomy</hi> he used the Names fittest to distinguish the Countries, with the Hills bounded on the <hi>North,</hi> or <hi>South</hi> side. For all the <hi>Asian</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains have Three general Names, <hi>Taurus, Imaus, Caucasus,</hi> which receive other Titles, as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide particular Regions. <hi>Taurus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> is <hi>Imaus</hi> in <hi>Comogena,</hi> and so to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> on whose <hi>East</hi> it is sometime <hi>Taurus,</hi> sometime <hi>Niphatis,</hi> which is the only name on the <hi>East</hi> of <hi>Tygris,</hi> till they part <hi>Assyria,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> and are called <hi>Coatraes</hi>; and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>East Media,</hi> they are <hi>Orentes,</hi> and in the <hi>East</hi> side <hi>Coronus</hi>; beyond <hi>Parthia</hi> they are <hi>Saraphi</hi>; on the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Bactria, Paropamisus,</hi> and lastly <hi>Caucasus,</hi> where <hi>Indus</hi> springeth with <hi>Hydaspis,</hi> and <hi>Zaradrus,</hi> where <hi>Caucasus</hi> Encounters the <hi>Scythian Imaus,</hi> in the 140 Degree of Longitude, and 35, 36, 37, of Latitude, where properly they are called <hi>Caucasus.</hi> In this part of the World the Mountain and the River <hi>Ianus,</hi> and the Mountain <hi>Nisius</hi> (so called of <hi>Bacchus Nisius</hi> or <hi>Noah</hi>) are found, on which the Ark stayed, as <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> conceived; where also are the best Vines, as they are in the same Degree of Latitude through the World, as in <hi>Iudea, Candia,</hi> parts of <hi>Greece, Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi> Under the <hi>South</hi> of these Hills the Clusters of Grapes are two <hi>Cubits</hi> long, saith <hi>Strabo,</hi> like those of <hi>Escol</hi>: And in <hi>Margiana, Alexander</hi> found most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Wine, saith <hi>Curtius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Ararat</hi> passeth through <hi>Armenia,</hi> which is sometimes called <hi>Ararat</hi>: but it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name to all that Ridge of Hills which runneth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64357:52"/>
                  <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> from <hi>Cilicia</hi> to <hi>Caucasus,</hi> as the <hi>Alps, Pireneans, Andes</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> which run Three Thousand Miles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea is a common Name, which yet upon divers Coasts bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth proper Names, as do other Seas. Let us then appeal to the Word of Truth, and take it literally, seeing the plain Sense carrieth no inconvenience, and let us fancy no strange Exposition from it. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Respect we owe the Holy Scripture, every Word having its full weight in Gods Book, shews that it is not to be taken otherwise than as we Read; as <hi>Augustin</hi> said of the Gospel. <hi>Moses</hi> words are, <hi>And as they went from the East they found a plain,</hi> &amp;c. Which prove without Controversie the Ark rested <hi>Eastward</hi> from <hi>Shinar.</hi> For <hi>Moses</hi> is every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in setting out Coasts, and Quarters of Countries, as <hi>Nod Eastward</hi> from <hi>Eden, Sepher</hi> in the <hi>East, Gen.</hi> 4.16. <hi>and</hi> 10.30. <hi>and</hi> 12.18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.6. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. <hi>and</hi> 12.42. Now <hi>Armenia</hi> is so far from the <hi>East</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that it is <hi>West</hi> of the <hi>North.</hi> The <hi>Gordian</hi> Hills for Latitude are Forty One: <hi>Babylon</hi> Thirty Five for Longitude, (which makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi>) the <hi>Gordian</hi> are Seventy Five, and <hi>Babylon</hi> Seventy Nine, and Eighty, which makes Five Degrees from the <hi>North</hi> to the <hi>West</hi>; besides a Quarter of the Compass from <hi>East.</hi> But in Scripture the least difference may not be omitted, every Point and Accent being full of Sense. The <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts then from <hi>Shinar</hi> were first Civiliz'd, having <hi>Noah</hi> himself for their Instructor, whose numerous Armies overmatched the Millions of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and whose Fruitfulness made it fit for <hi>Noah</hi>'s Husbandry, as <hi>Ish-Adamah,</hi> a Man exercised in Earth, saith <hi>Ar. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The Planting of Nations: <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons, and which was Eldest.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>SHEM,</hi> in <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Judgment was Eldest; but the <hi>Septuagint, Iunius, &amp;c.</hi> prefer <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> from <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.21. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> putting the word <hi>Elder</hi> after <hi>Iaphet,</hi> which the <hi>Latin</hi> sets before. Gods Blessings are not tyed to Elder in Blood, but Piety: Otherwise <hi>Iaphet</hi> was 2 Years older than <hi>Shem,</hi> being begotten in <hi>Noah</hi>'s 500<hi>th</hi> Year; when <hi>Shem</hi> in <hi>Noahs</hi> 600<hi>th</hi> Year was but 98. Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.32. with 10.10. &amp; 9.24. Namely <hi>Cham</hi> the Youngest.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. In this Plantation it is to be presumed. 1. So far as the Scriptures Treat of the Story of Nations, Profane Authors want Authority in point of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, whose Records have been borrowed from thence only. For <hi>Moses</hi> is found more Ancient than <hi>Homer, Hesiod,</hi> or any <hi>Greek,</hi> saith <hi>Eusebius, Prooem.</hi> in <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. We are to consider, that <hi>Noah</hi> who knew the World so long before, sent not his Sons at Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, as Discoverers, but allotted them the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Habitation. This could not be sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Considering what Woods, Thickets, Pools, Lakes, Marishes, Fenns, and Boggs, 130 Years Desolation had bred in those fruitful parts. This made diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and slow Journeys and Marches, both from the <hi>East,</hi> and <hi>Shinar,</hi> till Increase of Issue forced them on further.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Iaphet,</hi> with whom <hi>Moses</hi> beginneth, Planted the Isles of the <hi>Gentiles, Europe</hi> and the Isles about it, besides a Portion in <hi>Asia. Gomer,</hi> his Eldest Son is without Reason, placed in <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Berosus, Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64357:53"/>
&amp;c.</hi> in the Tenth Year of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and when <hi>Tubal</hi> was in <hi>Austria,</hi> or <hi>Biscai,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Twelfth Year of <hi>Nimrod, Ann.</hi> 142 after the Flood: For before <hi>Babels</hi> Confusion the Company were not dispers'd; consider then the time of Building such a City, and a Tower, to equalize Mountains, said <hi>Berosus,</hi> or reach to Heaven, said <hi>Nimrod,</hi> which took an exceeding compass, and whose Foundation in Marish Ground was full of Labours: As for Materials the want was great, and the Workmen unexperienced, and the Work almost finished.</p>
               <p>This time <hi>Glicas</hi> judged to be about 40 Years: So that <hi>Gomer</hi> and <hi>Tubal</hi> could not Plant so soon: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the tedious conveying of Wives, Children, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel from <hi>Shinar,</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> 4140 Miles, through Countries, now of much more difficult Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. <hi>Nimrod</hi> spent many Years in a short and more easy Journey to <hi>Shinar</hi>; and why did <hi>Tubal</hi> leave many rich Countries to Plant in <hi>Biscay,</hi> the most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Country of the World? To say they had the Convenience of Navigation, shews Men know not what it is to carry Multitudes by Sea, with Cattel, on which they lived. Whether Navigation was then in Use, is doubted, considering how long it was before Men durst cross the Seas, and that the Invention was ascribed to the <hi>Tyrians</hi> long after by <hi>Tibullus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog, Tubal</hi> and <hi>Mesech,</hi> settled first about lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> where <hi>Beroaldus</hi> (whom I find most judicious in this Plantation out of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 38. and 39.) findeth the <hi>Gomerians, Tubalines,</hi> and <hi>Togarminans. Iosephus</hi> in this Plantation led <hi>Eusebius, Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Ar. Montanus</hi> into many errours; and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> have troubled many: But this <hi>Gog</hi> the Prince of <hi>Magogians,</hi> or <hi>Coelo-Syrians,</hi> must needs be the Successor of <hi>Seleucius Nicanor,</hi> who sought to extinguish the <hi>Iews</hi> Religion, and force them to <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Hermolaus Barborus</hi> maketh the <hi>Turks</hi> come from the <hi>Scythians: Iunius</hi> makes it a National Name

Many are the Fancies of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Antiquity of Three Hundred and Thirty Kings before <hi>Amasis,</hi> Contemporary with <hi>Cyrus</hi>; and of their Story of 13000 Years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Mercator</hi> pleads their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity from their <hi>Dynasties,</hi> of which the Sixteenth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with the Flood, so that the first must reach the Creation.

But where <hi>Pererius</hi> holds it impossible that <hi>Egypt</hi> could be Peopled 200 Years after <hi>Adam,</hi> and supposing it not replenished at all before the Flood, I find no force in the assertion. For we have no reason to give less Increase to the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> than <hi>Noah,</hi> the Age of the one being double, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while treble to the other, which Argueth strength to beget many a long time.

As for <hi>Egypt</hi> being an Established Kingdom in the Days of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> it argues 'twas Inhabited long before: And contrary to <hi>Pererius,</hi> we may rather wonder how the World could contain the Issue of those long li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

heathful Fathers, than doubt the Peopling of it. For if our short Lives, wherein scarce one in Ten Liveth to 50 Years, the World wants no People: And if Wars and Pestilence did not cut them off by Thousands, the World could not contain them: What would it do if none dyed before 50 or 100 Years? Then Conceive the Millions, when Men Lived 8 or 900 Years <hi>&amp;c. Pererius</hi> is likewise deceived in the occasion of their dispersing at <hi>Babel</hi>: For had not that occasion happened, their Increase would in short time have forc'd them to seek new Habitations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That therefore the World was all over Peopled with offenders, it appeareth by the Universality of the Flood. As for <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Antiquity, it is probable that <hi>Mizaraim</hi>'s Sons found some Monuments in Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Altars, or other Stones, or Metals, touching former Government there, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Lives of the Kings after the <hi>Flood,</hi> which succeeding Times through Vain-Glory amplified.

               <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Beginning and Establishment of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. GOvernment hitherto in the World, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Paternity and Eldership, from which the word <hi>Elder</hi> was used, as well for Governours as the Aged; to shew that the Wisdom of Years should be in Governours; the first Government being from

the Father to the Elder Son. Hence grew <hi>Segnour</hi> and <hi>Segnourie,</hi> for Lordship and Dominion, which is Puissance in Property and Power; Power having command of Subjects, as Property hath Mastership of Servants. <hi>Caesar</hi> hath Power to Command what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Man possesseth, but Property only in his own. When <hi>Paternal</hi> persuasion grew too weak to resist Inclination to <hi>Evil,</hi> and to Correct it when it grew Habitual; Necessity, which bindeth all Mortals, made both the Wise and Foolish at once, to perceive, that the Estate of Men would prove more miserable than that of Beasts, if a general Obedience to Order and Dominion did not prevent it; and that licentious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order promising <hi>Liberty,</hi> upon Tryal, would prove no less dangerous to all, than an intolerable Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. <hi>Necessity</hi> propounds, and <hi>Reason</hi> confirms this Argument: All Nations were persuaded to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Magistrate</hi> in some degree; which Change was pleasing when compared with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Mischiefs in want of Government. Yet Time brought out therein some Inconveniences, which Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity also sought to avoid, and thereupon thought upon some equal Rules, to limit <hi>Dominion,</hi> which before was <hi>lawless. Laws</hi> being then set for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, acquired the Title of <hi>Regal</hi> Power or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and want thereof was known to be <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical</hi>; the one Ordained by God for his People's good, the other permitted to afflict them. In this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of <hi>Regal</hi> Authority, Princes, <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> were esteemed Gods, said <hi>Fabius Pictor.</hi> And though Necessity and Reason seem Authors of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet God kindled this Light in the Minds of Men, and set them a Pattern in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein they see <hi>Bees, Cranes, Deer,</hi> &amp;c. to follow a Leader; and God, in his Word, taketh it upon him to appoint Government, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. and 5.21. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.21.</p>

more than <hi>Paternal,</hi> is uncertain; or from what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kind of publick Government, the Tyranny of that Age did grow. After the Flood, Three sorts of Government are found approved. 1st. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by one Ruling by Just Laws, called <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> opposed to <hi>Tyranny.</hi> 2<hi>dly.</hi> The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by divers principal Persons, Established by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Ruling by Laws, call'd <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> opposed by <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> in Usurpation of a few. 3. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the People, called <hi>Democracy,</hi> opposed to <hi>Ochlocracy,</hi> which is a <hi>tumultuous Will</hi> of a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Multitude without Law.</p>
               <p>The Eldest of every Family at the first, set Order to his Issue, and upon increase, planted them about him in one Field, of which grew <hi>Villages</hi>; then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Society,</hi>

                  </gap>, which is a <hi>Fountain</hi>; for that all these <hi>Villages</hi> drank of the same <hi>Fountain,</hi> like our <hi>Hundreds.</hi> And when Malice, Pride, and Emulation set one Race against another, Men joined divers Villages, which had Banks and Ditches for defence, calling it <hi>Oppidum,</hi> as opposed to their Enemies: <hi>Vrbs, ab Orbe,</hi> a Circuit first made with a Plough, said <hi>Varro</hi>; which word was first used for the Walls and Buildings, as <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> for the Inhabitants, but were after confounded; yet every Inhabitant is not properly a <hi>Citizen,</hi> but he which hath the Freedom and Priviledges of it, and is capable of bearing Rule in it. And as <hi>Cities</hi> grew by Association of <hi>Villages,</hi> so did Common-Weals by Association of <hi>Cities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. The First Age after the <hi>Flood,</hi> was called <hi>Golden,</hi> while Ambition and Avarice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in the Blade, Men being more plain, simple, and contented; yet in respect of Government, they were as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, in which as good Kings made <hi>Golden times,</hi> so the contrary; yea, Princes Beginnings are commonly <hi>Golden,</hi> in which their Game is commonly smoothly plaid, but Time shrinks their Hearts, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64357:60"/>
small Errors at first, breed greater; as it is also in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man's Life, his Youth is <hi>Golden,</hi> which when Time hath eaten up, and bred such alteration, we praise what is past. It is the Vice of our Malignity to extol the past, and loath the present; such inquire not wisely, said <hi>Ecclesiasticus.</hi> Our Ancestors have, we and our Children will make the same Complaints; and what is <hi>new</hi> shall be <hi>old,</hi> saith <hi>Arnobius.</hi> The Virtue of Kings (next after God) produc'd their Crowns, and the Peoples Love so purchas'd, kept them on their Heads.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. From this beginning of <hi>Regality</hi> grew <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>; Princes chusing by the same Rule of <hi>Virtue,</hi> Men to assist them; which Honour succeeded not by <hi>Blood,</hi> but <hi>Virtue,</hi> which is true <hi>Nobility,</hi> the note of one Excelling another in Virtue; and should bind <hi>Nobility</hi> not to degenerate. As for Riches, Power, Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do no more define <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> than bare Life defines a Man. <hi>Honour</hi> is the Witness of Virtue and well-doing; and true <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> is the continuance of it in a Family; so that where Virtue is extinguished, they are like painted Images, worshipped by the Ignorant, for Christ, our Lady, and other Saints. Flowers not manured, turn to <hi>Weeds,</hi> and the purest Fountain running through a filthy Soil, is soon Corrupted. Race and Linage is but the <hi>Matter,</hi> Virtue and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of a Common-wealth, is the <hi>Form</hi> of true <hi>Nobility,</hi> which being found in Posterity, over-weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our proper Honour acquired by our own Virtue; but if Virtue be wanting to <hi>Nobility</hi> by discent, then Personal acquired Nobility is to be preferred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comparison, for that by Descent may be in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Villain. There is a third <hi>Nobility,</hi> which is in Parchment, purchased by Silver, or Favour, being Badges of Affection, which when Princes change, they could wish they were blotted out: But if we had as much Sense in our denegeration in Worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

as we have of Vanity in deriving our selves from such Parents, we shou'd perceive such Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be our Shame.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64357:61"/>
to shew us the Founder of the place, and of the Empire, which first over-ruled all the rest. As for the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Kingdom, it arose from the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> according to <hi>Iunius:</hi> So <hi>Calvin</hi> before followeth <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius. Ierom, Cyril, Methodius</hi> and <hi>P. Comestor,</hi> with <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> took <hi>Assur, Gen.</hi> 10.11. to be <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s Son, as doth <hi>Torniellus</hi> of late: But <hi>Rab. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> understood it as <hi>Iunius.</hi> Yet <hi>Calvin</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Iunius</hi> and himself, objecting <hi>Esay</hi> 23.13. (than which no place more difficult) to prove <hi>Assur</hi> founded the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> much more the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But the City of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> founded, and after destroyed by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> may with good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be understood of <hi>Vr,</hi> called <hi>Vrcta</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy, Chaldeopolis</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Cameria</hi> by <hi>Hecateus.</hi> This <hi>Vr</hi> stood upon the chief stream of <hi>Euphrates</hi>; by which it passed into the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulf, though now it is stopped and runneth into <hi>Tigris,</hi> of which stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page <hi>Niger</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> speak. This City then had Trade with <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and was a Port Town: By which the <hi>Sabeans</hi> sent Commodities to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and so to <hi>Tyre.</hi> This <hi>Vr</hi> founded by <hi>Shem</hi>'s Son <hi>Assur,</hi> was afterwards destroyed by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> which God fore-seeing, sent away <hi>Abraham</hi> from thence. That the Founder differs from <hi>Assur</hi> the destroyer, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Truth and circumstances. For thus <hi>Seth</hi>'s Posterity which followed <hi>Assur,</hi> being Planted at <hi>Vr,</hi> were separated from the Idolatrous <hi>Chushits,</hi> And if <hi>Sem</hi>'s Son <hi>Assur</hi> founded <hi>Ninive</hi>; how left he it to <hi>Ninus</hi> Son of <hi>Belus,</hi> and Husband of <hi>Semira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi>?</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Nimrod,</hi> called <hi>Saturn</hi> by <hi>Iulian Africanus,</hi> established the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Monarchy, which he inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Assyria:</hi> Where he Founded <hi>Ninive</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities, which his Son <hi>Belus</hi> finished, who after <hi>Nimrods</hi> 114 Years Reign succeeded, and spent much time in draining the Marshes of <hi>Babel,</hi> and began

with <hi>Sabbatius</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Scythia Saga,</hi> which <hi>Ninus</hi> finished.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Ninus</hi>'s days might well afford many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, if we consider the order of their departing from <hi>Babel</hi> according to their Kindred, every Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following the chief thereof, whom Nature and Necessity taught the rest to submit unto; and who took opportunity from Time and <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s examples to exercise legal Authority. <hi>Belus,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Nimrod,</hi> found <hi>Sabatius</hi> King of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi> able to resist him, whom I take to be <hi>Tanais</hi> in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi> As for his <hi>Vexoris, Reineccius</hi> hath judiciously taken to be <hi>Sesostris</hi> the Great, some Ages after <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.

               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Belus,</hi> I judge to be a Name, rather given by <hi>Ninus,</hi> for Honour to his Father, than taken by him. <hi>Cyrill</hi> calls him <hi>Arbelus</hi>; and saith he was the first that would be called God. <hi>Bel,</hi> say the Learned, signifying the Sun in <hi>Chalde,</hi> and there Worshipped for God: And many words in Scripture grew from it, <hi>Bel, Baal, Belzebub, Baalim,</hi> which Name was given to God, till upon abuse he forbad it.

               <p n="7">§. 7. Image-Worship began from <hi>Belus</hi> in <hi>Babel, &amp;c.</hi> Schoolmen shift off this fearful Custom strangely. For seeing the very Workman-ship is forbidden, how can the heart of a wise Christian satisfie it self with the distinction of <hi>Douleia,</hi> and <hi>Latrua,</hi> and <hi>Hyperdou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia,</hi> which can imply but a difference of Worship; and it is most strange, that Learned Men do strain their Wits to defend what Scripture oftentimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly forbids, and Curses the practicers. And where they say, the Prophets condemn Heathen Idols only, it is manifest <hi>Moses</hi> spake of the Living God, saying, <hi>You saw no Image when the Lord spake to you in</hi> Horeb.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64357:62"/>
                  <hi>Basil</hi> forbids us to imagine any Form of God, lest we limit him in our Minds; what Presumption then is it, to put him under the Greasy Pensil of a <hi>Painter,</hi> or the rusty Tool of a <hi>Carver? Rome</hi> for 170 Years by <hi>Numa</hi>'s Law, held it impiety, till <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin, Priscas,</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> condemned it, as <hi>Augustin</hi> shews: So <hi>Seneca, Sybil, Sophocles.</hi> And though <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> say, that Heathen Images are instead of Letters; yet as Heathen Pictures proved notorious Idols, so those Stocks, Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> called Pictures of Christ, our Lady, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were by the Ignorant, not only Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, but thought to live. It is safest then for Christians to believe Gods Commandments directly against Images, and that which the Prophets and St. <hi>Paul</hi> speak plainly and convincingly.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>Ninus</hi> the first Idolater, an Invader of others, and publick Adulterer: Of whom nothing is certain which is written; for <hi>Berosus</hi> who chiefly followed him in the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Succession from <hi>Nimrod</hi> to <hi>Ascalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> in the days of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> is disproved by many <hi>Ctesias,</hi> who lived with <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Younger, a gross flatterer of Princes, speaks of incredible numbers in <hi>Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis</hi>'s Wars.

               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Birth Year is therefore forc't to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained; all agree it was in the 43<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Ninus</hi>; but the Disagreement between <hi>Chronologers</hi> is about the Year after the Flood, in which he was Born. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilochus de Temporibus</hi> in <hi>Annius,</hi> maketh but 250 Years from the Flood to <hi>Ninus,</hi> whereto add 43, which make 293 Years at <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Birth: Others do accompt 352 from the Flood to <hi>Abraham.</hi> In this Labyrinth and unresolved Question, I chuse rather the scandal of Novelty, than sluggishly to proceed in that easie way of Ancient mistaking, seeing to be Learned in many Errours, or to be ignorant in all things, hath little advantage of each other.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Arguments for the First Date of</hi> 293. §. <hi>First,</hi> they Argue from Scripture. <hi>Secondly,</hi> from Authority of <hi>Iosephus, Augustine, Beda, Isidore,</hi> and others. <hi>First,</hi> The Scripture is <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.26. when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is first Named the Worthiest, and Son of the Promise; therefore First-born. <hi>Secondly, Moses</hi> respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the History of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not <hi>Nahor. Thirdly,</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi> were not the First-born, his Birth is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Unprobable; <hi>Terah</hi> had a Child at 130 Years of Age.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Answer to the Objections.</hi> §. Leaving what Divines have Answered; to scan this Question, we are to consider, whether <hi>Abraham</hi> made two Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from <hi>Charran</hi> unto <hi>Canaan</hi>; the former before; the latter after his Fathers Death, as some conceive
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64357:64"/>
upon what is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. Against this fancy. <hi>Martyr Stephen</hi> Witnesseth, that God brought him into the Land after his Father was Dead. This can be no other than that of which <hi>Moses</hi> writ, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. as <hi>Beza</hi> proveth on <hi>Act.</hi> 7.2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as <hi>Stephen</hi> had none of whom to Learn the Story of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Life, but <hi>Moses</hi>; so he would not give so great a scandal to the <hi>Iews,</hi> therein to disagree with <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider the Journey from <hi>Charran</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> distant Three Hundred <hi>English</hi> Miles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, and tedious, over Mountains and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts, which he must pass three times in two Journies, and so make Nine Hundred Miles; besides his Travel from <hi>Vr</hi> to <hi>Charran,</hi> as much more. And consider the Train <hi>Abraham</hi> had with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.5. which shew no inclinations of returning to Dwell at <hi>Charran,</hi> till his Fathers Death, as 'tis plain, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.4. when also by their account, <hi>Abraham</hi> must be about 135 Years Old, and <hi>Isaac</hi> also must be about 35: When he might well have Married him, and not send 5 Years after thereabout on such a Journey: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can this Opinion agree with that which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Servant Reported to <hi>Laban,</hi> touching his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, which he could not be ignorant of, if he had been so lately there; <hi>Moses</hi> hath carefully set down all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Journies, most of them of less impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than this; neither can any reason be given, why <hi>Abraham</hi> did return this second time to <hi>Charran,</hi> but only to support their Opinions.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. To the Objection of <hi>Terah</hi>'s Age un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it for a Child, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was at One Hundred, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18 11. it is hardly worth answering; but if they consider <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>'s, the wonder was in her own disability, not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, who had divers Sons 37 Years after; yea many Ages after, that <hi>Boaz, Obed,</hi> and <hi>Iesse,</hi> Begat Sons at 200 Years, or there about.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. To the Objection of making <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Age uncertain, and so the succeeding Times: I Answer, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64357:65"/>
Age is as certain as any other from his Father's death, as if his Birth had been dated. For as St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> tells us, his departure followed his Father's death, so <hi>Moses</hi> recordeth his Age to be 75 Years, and his Father's 205 at his Death. To the Objection, that <hi>Moses</hi> respected not <hi>Nahor</hi> and <hi>Haran,</hi> to set out their Age, as he did <hi>Abraham</hi>'s; I Answer, There were great Reasons to respect them also, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of God was to spring out of them by <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Marrying with them. And though they had Worshipped strange God's, as <hi>Terah</hi> himself, <hi>Ios.</hi> 24. Yet after <hi>Abraham</hi>'s being called, their willing departure with him from their Country and ordinary reverend Speeches of <hi>Iehova,</hi> prove they were no <hi>Infidels,</hi> and without Faith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.31, 50. I dare not therefore pronounce them out of the Church, who, I am sure were in the Faith.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Abraham's <hi>being first named, proveth him not the Eldest:</hi> §. If in Scripture it appear not that God made especial choice of the First-born, as it is in <hi>Seth, Isaac, Iacob, Iuda, David,</hi> &amp;c. the being first named can prove no Birth-right. <hi>Shem</hi> is first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> whereof, said <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> Order of Nativity is not here respected, but signification of future Dignities, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. And he rather judged <hi>Abraham</hi> the Youngest of the Three. <hi>Piety,</hi> saith he, <hi>or rather Divine Election, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it Piety and the Fear of God, gave precedence to</hi> Shem <hi>among the Sons of</hi> Noah, <hi>and to</hi> Abraham <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Sons of</hi> Terah.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Moses</hi> testifies <hi>Abraham</hi> was 75 Years old when he left <hi>Charran: Stephen</hi> saith it was after <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>'s death; at 83, he rescued <hi>Lot</hi>; at 86, <hi>Ismael</hi> was born; and <hi>Isaac</hi> at 100, and all in <hi>Canaan.</hi> But if he begat <hi>Abraham</hi> at 70, <hi>Abraham</hi> must be 135 Years old when he entred <hi>Canaan, &amp;c.</hi> Moreover, by this Accompt, <hi>Isaac</hi> must be 35 years Old, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64357:65"/>
                  <hi>Ismael</hi> 49. at <hi>Terah</hi>'s death, and Born in <hi>Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> contrary to Scripture. Thirdly, by this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, <hi>Terah</hi> should be but 145 Years Old at his Death, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was 75. Fourthly, <hi>Sarah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within Ten Years of <hi>Abraham</hi> her Unkle, <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> her Father being his younger Brother, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her at Nine Years Old, which Reason <hi>Lyra</hi> useth. The like Reason is taken from the Age of <hi>Lot,</hi> the Son of <hi>Haran,</hi> called an Old Man at <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>'s Eighty third year.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>The Conclusion, noting the Authors on both sides.</hi> §. It agreeth with Scripture, Nature, Time, and Reason, that <hi>Haran</hi> was <hi>Terah</hi>'s Eldest Son. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> was herein uncertain, and what he saith in his <hi>City</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> lib. 16.15. is answered in his 52d Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion on <hi>Gen.</hi> And as he follow'd <hi>Iosephus,</hi> so <hi>Isidore</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi> follow him. The <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and generally the <hi>Romanists</hi> following the first Opinion, allow but 292 Years from the Flood to <hi>Abraham.</hi> But <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> and divers later, <hi>Beroald, Codornan, Beucer, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Beza, Iunius,</hi> &amp;c. hold <hi>Abraham</hi> begotten in the 130<hi>th.</hi> Year of <hi>Terah. Scaliger, Seth, Calvisius,</hi> &amp;c. to the contrary, call it <hi>Heresy</hi> in Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; <hi>Bucholcreus, Chitreus, Functius,</hi> and others, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; yet <hi>Torniellus</hi> in his Annals confutes them. But if we advisedly consider the state of the World in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days, we shall rather increase the time from the Flood to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> did to 1072; than shorten it to 292: For such paring of Time to the quick, draws the Blood of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if Scripture's Testimony were not supreme. Seeing then we know the World was so peopled, and Kingdoms so furnished with Cities of State and Strength, more time is required for it than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imagine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

His youngest Son <hi>Nimrod,</hi> Founder of the Empire, born after <hi>Dedan</hi> Son of <hi>Raamah,</hi> the fourth Son of <hi>Chus,</hi> could not, according to the ordinary course of those Times, be esteemed Born, 'till 65 Years after <hi>Chus,</hi> allowing 30 Years to <hi>Chus,</hi> before his first Son, and 30 Years to <hi>Raama,</hi> Father of <hi>Dedan,</hi> born before <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and 5 Years for his five Elder Brethren. Allow 60 Years after for two Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before their setting forth before <hi>Shinar,</hi> and six Years for their Travail with Wives, Children, and Cattel out of the East, through over-grown Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Mountains. Thus 131 Years are spent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Babel</hi> is taken in hand; the 221 Years which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main of 352, are divided, to <hi>Ninus</hi> 42 before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Birth, 65 to <hi>Belus,</hi> and 114 to <hi>Nimrod,</hi> yet this maketh <hi>Nimrod</hi> in all, not above 180 Years old, which was not much for that Generation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.3. in which they lived; yea, 400 Years. <hi>Ninus</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 9 Years after, and <hi>Semiramis</hi> suceeded 42 Years, when <hi>Abraham</hi> was 52 Years old. <hi>Ninias,</hi> or <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meis</hi> succeeded 38; in whose 23<hi>d</hi> Year, <hi>Abraham</hi> at 75 years old, came to <hi>Canaan</hi>; and 10 years after, <hi>Abraham</hi> over-threw <hi>Amraphel</hi> King of <hi>Shinar,</hi> which may seem to have been <hi>Ninias,</hi> in whose 33<hi>d</hi> year it happen'd; though the Reasons to the contrary are not easily answer'd.</p>

From Example; Things hastily set up with violence, last not, as <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and <hi>Tamberlain</hi>'s, whose Empires dyed with them; neither had they time to review what they had done, God adjoining short life to asswage Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and Nature cares least for what she doth in hast. <hi>Ninus</hi> persued boundless Dominion with Violence; <hi>Semiramis</hi> exceeded him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Ninias</hi> having changed Nature and Condition with his Mother, preferring Pleasure and Ease before Honour and Greatness; as he indured his Mother's Reign, so wanted he Spirit to maintain what she left him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Neighbouring Princes, whose Wounds and Wrongs from his Parents, put them in mind to cure the one, and revenge the other. 2 And it was God's will, when he would impose that long and tedious Journey upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the Countreys should be in Peace, through which he wandred; to which end those Millions of Warriours and Engins perished with <hi>Semiramis,</hi> to make the Recovery of lost Liberty the more easy. Lastly, Histories report, that <hi>Arrius,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Ninias,</hi> recovered <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctria,</hi> and <hi>Caspia,</hi> and <hi>Baleus</hi> or <hi>Xerxes</hi> reduced the rest, even to <hi>Egypt</hi>; which argueth their former Revolt.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. Consent of Writers almost forceth us to think as I have delivered, touching the Four Kings; yet if we take them rather for Four petty Kings, which in that sluggish Reign of <hi>Ninias</hi> had gathered Colonies out of those Four Countries, and Planted themselves elsewhere, we shall remove some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. For if <hi>Chedorlaomer</hi> were King of <hi>Persia</hi> it self beyond <hi>Babylon,</hi> what a Journey were it to come so far and gather such Forces which must pass so great Countries as <hi>Assyria, Chaldea, Mesopotamia, Syria,</hi> and part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> to Conquer five small Cities, and leave all the rest of <hi>Canaan</hi>; yea, to come in Person, and that the second time.

                  <hi>THE Kings</hi> of Egypt, <hi>'till</hi> Israel<hi>'s Deliverance; and the causes of the uncertainty of the History.</hi> §. <hi>Cham,</hi> after <hi>Babel</hi>'s Confusion, having known <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Fertility, Planted it <hi>Anno</hi> 191 after the Flood. <hi>Osiris</hi> succeeded <hi>Anno</hi> 352. <hi>Typhon,</hi> or <hi>Hercules, Anno</hi> 603. <hi>Orus,</hi> 620. <hi>Sesostris</hi> the Great, 735. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostris</hi> the Blind, 786. <hi>Busiris,</hi> or <hi>Oris</hi> 2<hi>d. Anno</hi> 782. <hi>Acenchere,</hi> or <hi>Thermutis,</hi> or <hi>Meris,</hi> 820. <hi>Rathoris</hi> 832. <hi>Chenchrese</hi> 841, drowned. <hi>Augustin,</hi> a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent searcher of Antiquities, omitted the Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings, finding no certainty of them, through the Ambition of their Priests, who, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the Antiquities, which they only kept, filled the Records with Romances and Names of Kings, which never Reigned. Other good Authors were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous of what they found so Recorded, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the same in their own Names. Of these, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> finding some Fragments, and adding what he would, is no farther to be Credited, than where approved Writers Confirm his Assertion. Herein the Old Christian Writers follow <hi>Eusebius</hi>; but the Modern, <hi>Annius</hi> and Prophane Authors; follow <hi>Diodorus, Herodotus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. Cham <hi>began his Reign in</hi> Egypt, <hi>after the</hi> Flood, <hi>Anno</hi> 191. §. This is gathered from the <hi>Dyanasties</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whose 16<hi>th</hi> began in the 43<hi>d.</hi> year of <hi>Ninus</hi>: The 12 first under their 12 great Gods, lasted 84 Years, seven a-piece; the 13 indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 14 years; the 14 lasted 26; the fifteen was 37, which three last were under three younger Gods: All the 75 added together, make 161 years; which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64357:68"/>
being deducted out of 352, the remainder is 191, the beginning of Government there, after <hi>Cham</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival. The same also is probable from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Babel,</hi> which being after the Flood, <hi>Anno</hi> 131, and Forty years, according to <hi>Glicas,</hi> spent in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we can allow no less than Twenty years, for the slow passing such a Company through such a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult long way; which Sums being added, make up 191 years, when the first <hi>Dynasty</hi> began; for to begin them sooner, were either to plant <hi>Egypt</hi> as soon as <hi>Babel,</hi> or with <hi>Mercator,</hi> to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood; which their number, exceeding the number of those long-liv'd Fathers, will not admit.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>The</hi> Dynasties <hi>of</hi> Egypt <hi>were not absolute Kings, but Vice-Roys under Kings.</hi> §. The probability of this will appear by the custom of Kings governing by Great Men, as of old, the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> by the Master of the Palace; the <hi>Turk</hi> by a Grand <hi>Visier</hi>; the Philistin Kings which came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had a Captain, as <hi>Abimelek</hi> had <hi>Phicol</hi>; the Kings of Israel, as <hi>Saul</hi> had <hi>Abner; David</hi> had <hi>Ioab.</hi> And <hi>Cham</hi>'s lend disposition to follow Pleasure, might breed the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, which continued even to the days of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the place by <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; from which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>William</hi> Arch Bishop of <hi>Tyre</hi> affirms the same Form of Government continued in <hi>Egypt</hi> in his days, when the Sultans govern'd under the <hi>Calif,</hi> as Lieutenants under a King. How these Dynasties suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and how long they continued, is uncertain.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Cham. <hi>and</hi> Mizraim <hi>or</hi> Oris. §. Of Cham the Scripture calls that Country the Land of <hi>Ham,</hi> not for being Peopled by his Sons, for so were other Countries, which yet are never so called, but for that himself planted it. <hi>Osiris</hi> called himself the Eldest Son of <hi>Saturn,</hi> as in <hi>Diodorus,</hi> lib. 1. which <hi>Saturn</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was Grand-father of <hi>Ninus</hi>; as in his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of <hi>Cham</hi> came the Temple of <hi>Hammon</hi> near <hi>Egypt</hi>: And in <hi>Ierom</hi>'s days the <hi>Egyptians</hi> called
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64357:68"/>
their Country <hi>Ham</hi>; so <hi>Ortelius</hi> saith out of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> that <hi>Egypt</hi> was called <hi>Chemia.</hi> That <hi>Cham</hi> reigned 161 years, is not improbable, considering <hi>Sem</hi> his Brother lived 600 years. <hi>Mizraim</hi> or <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> according to <hi>Diodor,</hi> succeeded, of whom the Land also took its Name, and by the Natives, is yet called <hi>Mezre,</hi> as <hi>Reineccius</hi> sheweth. How long he Reigned, is hard to determine; but that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Birth is probable, when the <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastie</hi> of the <hi>Thebaei,</hi> began according to <hi>Eusebius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Osiris</hi> Reign is guessed at by his Son <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim,</hi> or <hi>Hercules Lybeus</hi> his Warring with <hi>Typhon,</hi> and the <hi>Giants,</hi> his Associates in Revenging his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Death. His <hi>Egyptian</hi> Wars he ended, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his <hi>Italian,</hi> in the 41 Year of <hi>Baleus</hi> King of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria,</hi> according to <hi>Berosus,</hi> when he left the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his Brother <hi>Orus.</hi> To this <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and many other Wars before his Italian, <hi>Krentzhemius</hi> alloweth but 6 Years, which draweth <hi>Osiris</hi> Death to the 34<hi>th</hi> Year of <hi>Belus,</hi> and so makes him Reign 297 Years, and so should end 7 Years after <hi>Israel</hi> came into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> This cannot be, for the King under whom <hi>Israel</hi> came, out-lived <hi>Iacob,</hi> and had Reigned from before <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s standing before <hi>Pharaoh</hi>; yea, we may give 13 Years more of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Bondage to him. This King then could not be <hi>Osiris,</hi> who lived not so long as <hi>Iacob</hi>; nor <hi>Typhon,</hi> nor <hi>Hercules</hi>; but <hi>Orus,</hi> Son of <hi>Osiris,</hi> advanced by <hi>Hercules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Typhon,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> their Reigns are not distinctly defined; only <hi>Orus,</hi> is placed 7 Years after <hi>Osiris</hi> by <hi>Krentzhemius,</hi> and whose Reign seemeth to last 115 Years, and from whose Death, to the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> Departure are 122 Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sesostris,</hi> or <hi>Sesonchosis,</hi> succeeded according to <hi>Scholiast. Apollonii</hi>: He was a great Conquerour in <hi>Asia,</hi> even into <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Europe:</hi> Whom <hi>Iustin</hi> erroniously maketh <hi>Vexoris,</hi> saith <hi>Reineccius,</hi> some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after <hi>Ninus.</hi> This <hi>Sesostris,</hi> some think is <hi>Besak,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:64357:69"/>
but it is not so, as divers differences in setting out their Wars do manifest. Whereas after <hi>Orus, Menas</hi> is Reported by <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus. Reineccius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that <hi>Osiris</hi> was so called by way of Dignity. <hi>Krentzhemius</hi> probably gathers that <hi>Menas</hi> was <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius, Ter-maximus,</hi> Conquerour, Philosopher, and Benefactor to Mankind, giving good Laws, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profitable Arts to his Conquered People. After 33 Years he fell Blind, as did <hi>Pherones</hi> his Son, whom 14 Years after <hi>Orus,</hi> the Second, or <hi>Busiris</hi> succeeded 75 Years before <hi>Israel</hi>'s Departure out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>Busiris,</hi> or <hi>Orus</hi> the Second, whom <hi>Reineccius</hi> judgeth to have been a new Family, (though accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all Mens computation) he began 5 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Moses</hi>'s Birth; yet might he be first Author of the <hi>Israelites</hi> Misery, Ruling as <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> under the blind King, whom he might easily draw to that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Strangers, so to ease the Subjects, and to win their Favour, to promote his Off-spring to the Crown which he attained, and held 30 Years, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Eusebius.</hi> After him <hi>Thermutis, Pharaob</hi>'s Daughter, which took <hi>Moses</hi> out of the Water, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. <hi>Eusebius</hi> calls her <hi>Acencris,</hi> but placeth <hi>Ameno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis</hi> next before <hi>Busiris. Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> call <hi>Sesostris</hi> Son <hi>Pheron</hi>; so it may be she was his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who Marrying <hi>Busiris,</hi> Reigned after him 12 Years.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>Rathoris,</hi> or <hi>Athoris,</hi> succeeded his Sister 9 Years; and after him, <hi>Chencris,</hi> who perished in the <hi>Red Sea</hi>; and <hi>Achencris</hi> succeeded 8 Years, and <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> 15, in whose 15 Years, <hi>Epaphus,</hi> Son of <hi>Teligonus, Rathoris</hi> Brother Reigneth, in the lower <hi>Egypt,</hi> and Built <hi>Memphis.

but that Eternal One, of whose <hi>being</hi> all other things are but shadows. Of all the Ten Plagues, the last only brought that Tyrant <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to an absolute submission, when he began to fear his own Life. The <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> was a Sacrament of our spotless Saviour.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> seeing the <hi>Israelites</hi> departure, with the Spoil also of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> bethought himself, and pursuing them with all his Power, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.7. over-took them after Three Days March. And though <hi>Moses</hi> knew he went out with the mighty Hand of God, yet he neglected nothing, becoming a Wise Man and a Valiant Conductor. So he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Ramases</hi> in <hi>Goshen,</hi> whither the dispersed <hi>Hebrews</hi> were gathered as to their Rendezvous, and Marched Eastward toward <hi>Etham,</hi> and Encamped at <hi>Succoth,</hi> the Fifteenth Day of <hi>Abib,</hi> which thenceforth was accounted the first Month of their Year, for Religious Occasions, leaving another for Politick, which they distinguish from Sacred, in Recording things Transacted.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Israel</hi> passing from <hi>Succoth,</hi> kept Mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rough Ground on his left-hand to <hi>Etham,</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Chariots should not compass him. From <hi>Etham,</hi> the next day he Marched <hi>South</hi> Eight Miles, and on the Third day he came to <hi>Pihachoroth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mountains of <hi>Etham,</hi> on the <hi>North,</hi> and <hi>Baalzephon</hi> on the <hi>South,</hi> and Encamped upon the wash of the Sea.</p>

This Sea, called <hi>Chencrese,</hi> in which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> Perished the 16<hi>th</hi> Year of his Reign, is commonly called the Red Sea, though of the Colour of other Waters. It
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64357:71"/>
seemeth to me, that Name grew from the Clifts, Sands, Islands, and much of the Bordering Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, which being Red, by reflection makes the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter seem Red also. The <hi>Greeks</hi> call it the <hi>Erythrean</hi> Sea, of King <hi>Erythreus</hi>; and for that <hi>Erythros</hi> signifies Red, some think it was so called. The <hi>Portugals</hi> Report that store of red Stones are found in it, on which, store of Red Coral groweth. At <hi>Pihachoroth,</hi> which is from <hi>Ramases,</hi> not above Thirty Miles, the Sea is about Four Miles broad to <hi>Arabia,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> passed over, and not at <hi>Elana</hi>: For that part of <hi>Egypt</hi> which is opposite to <hi>Elana,</hi> is from <hi>Ramases</hi> Eighty Miles, which <hi>Moses</hi> with his Multitude, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for such Marches, could not pass in three days.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6.

For first, these Nations having setled there from the beginning, and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and fallen to their Idolatry; and having had neighbourly Commerce with them, it could not be, but they should affect them, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the ancient Inhabitants. Secondly, the <hi>Israelites</hi> by long abode in <hi>Egypt,</hi> were become strangers to them, and the less affected for differences in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and feared, for being a Potent, United People; whereas the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were divided, and therefore not feared of them so much. Thirdly, both <hi>Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> and <hi>Edomites</hi> being Carnal People, might resent the Actions of <hi>Israel</hi> for their old Quarrels between their first Parents; yet none of these directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them in defence of the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> Only the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites</hi> (which are commonly taken to be a Tribe of <hi>Edom</hi>) offered them violence,<note place="margin">

It were a great sin to call God to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness a Lye, and so make him a Deceiver; but we call him to be our Surety: Yea, we call him to Judge, and so make him false in Witnessing, in undertaking our Faith, and corrupt in Judgment, the least of which Offences were heinous to a King; how odious then is it to God, to make him break Promises, to Deceive, to pervert Judgment?

That <hi>Zidon,</hi> the First Son of <hi>Canaan</hi> was the Founder, we doubt not, and yet it was in his Posterities command in <hi>Moses</hi> Days: As for <hi>Agenor,</hi> whether he was an <hi>Egyptian</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> or a Native of this Country bred up there, it may be that in <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s days, he and his Four Sons, <hi>Cadmus, Phoenix, Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Cilix,</hi> might come out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> with such Force as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> could spare, to the succo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Touching the mention of Letters, the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> claim it; and that <hi>Atlas, Orion, Orpheus, Linus, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, Prometheus, Cadmus,</hi> had the first light from them, and that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was instructed by the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians.</hi> The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> boast of it, and indeed they were very Ancient, and had Famous Records used by <hi>Iosephus. Lastly,</hi> Some ascribe it to <hi>Moses,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all probability, seeing Learning then flourished in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Assyria</hi>; but true it is, the Excellent Spirits of the First Age found it, either <hi>Seth, Enos, &amp;c.</hi> And God every where present, hath given this Invention to Nations, which never had Commerce with others.

And <hi>Herodotus</hi> Report is credible, that after the first Year, 'till the tenth, the <hi>Greeks</hi> lay little before <hi>Troy,</hi> but rowed up and down by Sea and Land for Booties and Victuals, wasting the Country round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. But being all returned to the Camp, the tenth Year a Pestilence fell among them, and a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention about dividing their Captive Virgins, which made <hi>Achilles</hi> refuse to Fight, because <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had taken away his Concubine. But after his Friend <hi>Patroclus,</hi> to whom he had lent his Armour, was slain by <hi>Hector,</hi> and pillag'd of his Armour, as the manner was, <hi>Achilles</hi> desirous of Revenge, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be reconcil'd, upon <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s seeking to give satisfaction by Gifts and Restitution of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine <hi>Briseis.</hi> After this, in the next Battel, <hi>Achilles</hi> slew <hi>Hector</hi> (though <hi>Homer</hi>'s Narration of his flying about the City thrice be unprobable) and drew him at his Chariot about the Field, and then sold his Body to <hi>Priamus</hi> at a great rate.

If this Idol then could not endure the representation of the true God, what Marvel is it, that when it pleased him to Cloath his only Begotten with Flesh, and sent him into the World, that all the Oracles wherein the Devil derided and betray'd Mortal Men, lost Power, Speech, and Operation at that instant?

               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>SOlomon</hi> began to Reign in the 2991<hi>st</hi> Year of the World; and was first Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Custom of Princes. Though his Reign were peaceable, yet his beginning was with the blood of his Brother <hi>Adonijah,</hi> without warrant either from his Father, or the Law of God. The occasion was his desire of <hi>Abyshag</hi>; but being his Elder Brother, who also had sought the Kingdom, it was enough, as a word is to the Wise; and he which seeth the Claw, knows whether it be a Lyon or no. <hi>Solomon</hi> took the motion, as a demonstration of a new Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; such was the jealousie of seeking a King's Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or Concubines; as <hi>Absolom</hi>'s taking his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Concubines, was a taking possession of a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, so it was applied to <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Nathan,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.8. Birth-right pleaded by <hi>Adonijah,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's Law, and of Nations; but the Kings of the <hi>Iews</hi> were more Absolute, and not without Example in <hi>Iacob,</hi> for private Inheritance. As for what we read of Peoples Elections, it was but an acknowledging him whom the Lord chose, and not to frustrate the Elder's Right. <hi>Solomon</hi> also executed <hi>Ioab,</hi> deposed <hi>Abiathar,</hi> and put <hi>Shemei</hi> to death. He Married the Daughter of <hi>Vaphres</hi> (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> calls him) King of <hi>Egypt</hi>; and according to his request to God, obtained extraordinary Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, especially for Government; as appeared in the Example purposely set down, of his judging the two Harlots; yet did he excell in all other Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

Renewing the League with <hi>Hiram</hi> of <hi>Tyre,</hi> he had much of his Materials for his Buildings from him. Of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Temple, and parts of it, many Learned Men have Written; as <hi>Salmeron, Montanus, Bibera, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radas, Azorius, Villalpandus, Pineda,</hi> &amp;c.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the matchless Temple, he made many other Magnificent Buildings, of which <hi>Gerar</hi> on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> taught the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to visit those parts in <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s days, before they were sent for. <hi>Thadimor, Ioseph</hi> held to be <hi>Palmyra,</hi> in the Desart of <hi>Syria,</hi> to the North-East of <hi>Libanus,</hi> the utmost Border of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Dominion, which <hi>Ierom</hi> calls <hi>Thermeth</hi>; and by <hi>Adrian</hi> Rebuilt, and called <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anopolis.</hi> He also Repaired and Peopled the Towns <hi>Hiram</hi> refused, and made his first and only Journey in <hi>Syria Zobah,</hi> to establish his Tributes, and then visited all the Borders of his Dominions; from <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myrena</hi> in the North, to <hi>Eziongaber</hi> and <hi>Eloth</hi> in the South, upon the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Solomon</hi> from <hi>Eziongaber,</hi> sent a Fleet to <hi>Ophir,</hi> an Island of the <hi>Molucca</hi>'s in <hi>East-India,</hi> from whence he received 430 Talents of Gold, all Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges defrayed.

Solomon<hi>'s Fall, and term of Life.</hi> §. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> forgetting what the Lord Commanded; as he had plenty of all other things, so of Wives, even of Idolatrous Nations, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.1, 2. prohibited; whereupon they turned his heart after other Gods; for which, the Lord punish'd him with Enemies in his Age, and rent his Kingdom from his Son, as he threatned, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. Touching his Age, it is conjectur'd by his Father's Actions, whose Conquests were ended, before he wan <hi>Rabba,</hi> when <hi>Solomon</hi> was not Born. So that half of <hi>David</hi>'s Reign being spent at the time of vanquishing the <hi>Ammonites, Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Birth must fall after <hi>David</hi>'s 20 Years; and above a Year it could not be, seeing <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Age at <hi>Solomon</hi>'s death, compared with the many heavy things which befell <hi>David</hi> after; and that <hi>David</hi> in his Charge to <hi>Solomon,</hi> speaketh as to a Man grown; though <hi>Solomon</hi> at Nineteen Years old, speaking to the Lord about his weighty Charge, might well call himself a Charge. Some time after, <hi>Ammon</hi> forced <hi>Thamar,</hi> and two Years after was slain by <hi>Absolom,</hi> who fied to <hi>Geshur,</hi> where he abode three Years, yet saw not his Father's face for two years. How long after he brake into Rebellion is uncertain, which seemeth to be the 30<hi>th</hi> Year of <hi>David</hi>'s Reign, but the 40<hi>th</hi> Year after his Anointing; as those words 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.7. may well be taken.

                  <hi>REhoboam</hi> succeeded his Father, but was not so Wise as to resolve the People's Petition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Counsel; nor yet to discern of Councils, which is the very best of Wisdom in Princes and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for though he consulted with grave advised Men, yet he was Transported by his Favourites, who, ignorant of the nature of Severity, which without the Temper of Clemency, is Cruelty it self, thrust him on to threaten an Increase of what was unsupportable already; ignorant also, that Severity is to be used for the Help, and not for the Hurt of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. These foolish Parasites could better judge of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64357:98"/>
King's disposition, which Learning was sufficient for to enable them to the Places they held. This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> set forward <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s designs, and the Prophecie of <hi>Ahijah,</hi> as the sequel shewed; for the People at once chose <hi>Ieroboam</hi>; and after the manner of all Rebels, forgetting Duty to God, and Bonds of Nature, renounced all interest in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>; the Honour of their Nation, and murder the Officers sent to appease them. After this, <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> intended Wars upon them, but was stayed by the Prophet from God. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> fortified himself, and to prevent re-uniting by communion in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, impiously set up a new Worship, learn'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> expelling the Levites. Thus by irreligious Policy, he founded that Idolatry, which rooted <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> out of the Land at last; neither could he be stayed by the Prophet that foretold his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor Miracle upon his own hand. This point of Policy must be made good, though it cast off God, and the Religion of his Fathers. Whereunto an <hi>Italian</hi> Historian compares the Policy of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in making good the State they have gotten, by what means soever, as if God would not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it.

But of the wretched end of such Policy, all these are notable Examples.</p>

But in his Fifth Year, <hi>Sesac</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who favoured <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> taught him how weak Fortifications are, where God watcheth not the City. <hi>Sesac</hi> brought

And tho' then God used to shew the Causes of such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by his Prophets, yet is he the same just God, to raise and throw down Kings and Estates for the same Offences. And those Afflictions of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Courses thereof, are set down for Presidents to succeeding Ages.

               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Asa,</hi> after three years, succeeded <hi>Abijah,</hi> who reformed Religion, and prospered. He overthrew <hi>Zerah</hi> and his 100000 Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Zerah</hi> was an <hi>Arabian,</hi> not an <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> was proved before <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. Sect. 3, 14. <hi>and</hi> c. 10.</note>. But after he fell to rely on Man, and hired <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi> against <hi>Baasha,</hi> not relying upon the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God, he fell to persecute the Prophet which reproved him, and to oppress the People, for which God plagued him. There lived at the same time, <hi>Agesilaus</hi> and <hi>Bacis</hi> of <hi>Corinth, Astartus</hi> and <hi>Astarlaius</hi> Kings of <hi>Tyre; Alys</hi> and <hi>Capis,</hi> Kings of the <hi>Latins; Ophrateus</hi> in <hi>Assyria.

               <p n="5">§. 5. The Alterations in the Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Asa,</hi> might have reduced the Ten Tribes to the House of <hi>David,</hi> if God had not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the contrary. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> lost 500000: <hi>Nadab</hi> his Son, in two years, lost his Life and Kingdom, so that of his Fathers Worldly Wisdom, to Establish a Kingdom in his Posterity, nothing remained but the hateful Memory, that he made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin. <hi>Baasa</hi> rooting out <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s House, yet imbraced his Idolatry, which drew the same Sentence of God's Wrath upon him and his Family; and tho' he thought it Wisdom, to Fortify his Kingdom,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64357:100"/>
which he found weakened by <hi>Asa,</hi> by making League with <hi>Benhadad</hi>; yet God turned his Wisdom into Foolishness, and by the same Hand destroyed <hi>Neph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talim. Ela</hi> Son of <hi>Baasha</hi> succeeded, and was slain by <hi>Zimri</hi>; who wanting strength to defend himself against <hi>Omri,</hi> had Courage enough to burn himself in <hi>Terza. Omri</hi> by the Peoples Division was a while opposed by <hi>Tibni,</hi> but prevailed.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Israel</hi> thus afflicted under those unhappy Princes, it is a wonder that the People returned not to their ancient Kings, and reunited not to those Two Mighty Tribes; but they still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in grievous oppressions of the Factious Usurpers and Competitors, and under the revenging hand of God for their defection. To say God's secret Will was such, was not reason either to the Ten Tribes not to return, nor to <hi>Abijah,</hi> after he had so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Israel,</hi> not to perfect his Conquest; for though his Father was restrained expresly by the Lord, yet was not he. We may then boldly look into two Causes. <hi>First,</hi> Why the People bore so quietly the slaughter of <hi>Nadab,</hi> and interpretation of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> their own chosen King, and revenged the death of <hi>Ela</hi> Son of <hi>Baasa,</hi> an Usurper. It is therefore probable, that the People by defection from <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> seeking ease of former Burthens, found <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> and his Son to retain some Kingly Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, which had been grievous to them under <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> which <hi>Baasa</hi> had forborn, and reduced the form of Civil Government to a more temperate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which much pleased them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the same may be the Reason they returned not to the House of <hi>David,</hi> whose Scepter they found so heavy under <hi>Solomon,</hi> and were threatned by his Son with more burthen. They had seen <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Shimei</hi> slain without all form of Judgment, <hi>Adonijah</hi> without Cause, as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> should have been; which lawless
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64357:100"/>
Power grew more barbarous in <hi>Iehoram, Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> &amp;c. As for the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> we find no such arbitrary proceeding; for even <hi>Iezabel</hi> kept the form judicial against <hi>Naboth.</hi> And well it may be, though <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had established a Law against the Prophets of God, which the Idolatrous People ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; by which Law <hi>Iezabel</hi> slew so many. This difference of Power, Arbitrary, and according to Law, made the People of <hi>Iudah</hi> less affectionate to their Princes than the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who were accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to kill their Kings as the <hi>Iudeans</hi> did, but revenged when they were able, such as were slain by Usurpers. The like moderation of Kingly Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives in the Government of <hi>England,</hi> gained such affection of the People, as never any perish'd by the Fury of the People, whose heat in greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection was extinguished with the blood of some great Officers. Let not Monarchs fear straitning of their Absoluteness by mighty Subjects, as long as by their Wisdom they keep the hearts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who will be sure to come in on their side: As <hi>Briarius</hi> with his hundred hands assisted <hi>Iupiter,</hi> when all the Gods conspired against him. For a good Form of Government is sufficient of it self, to retain the People, not only without assistance of a laborious Wit, but even against all devices of the shrewdest Politicians; every Sheriff and Constable being sooner able to arm the Multitude in the King's behalf, than any over-weening Rebel against him. Princes immediately assign'd by God, or getting Command by strong hand, have presumed of more Absolute Prerogatives than Kings Chosen; and the People which thought Obedience to Princes a part of Duty to God, will endure much more with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, than others who have Kings of their own chusing.</p>

were 1160000, by which he recovered his Tributes from the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Philistins,</hi> besides his own Garisons; yet his Country did not exceed the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Kent</hi> in largeness.

I am therefore of Opinion (submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to better Judgments) that the numbers spoken of, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. were not all at one time, but that the two first numbers under <hi>Adnah</hi> and <hi>Iehobanan,</hi> were after Mustred, and Commanded by <hi>Amasia, Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada,</hi> and <hi>Iehosabad</hi>; yet this Mighty Prince made a League with <hi>Ahab,</hi> and matched his Son <hi>Ioram</hi> with his Daughter, and assisted him at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> for which he was reproved by <hi>Iehu</hi> the Prophet; as he was a second time by the Prophet <hi>Eliezer,</hi> for joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Son in preparing a Fleet.

                  <hi>JEhoram,</hi> the Son of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> being thirty two Years old, began to Reign, and Reigned 8 Year, of which, 4 was in his Father's Life; who at his two Journeys with <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iehoram,</hi> Kings of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> left him Viceroy 'till his return. The first was in <hi>Iehosaphat</hi>'s 17th Year, when also <hi>Ahazia</hi> Son of <hi>Ahab</hi> began to Reign; whose Brother <hi>Iehoram,</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> year after, succeeded K. of <hi>Israel</hi> in the 2<hi>d</hi> year of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam,</hi> King of <hi>Iuda</hi>; that is, of his Reign when his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> took the sole Government again upon him, 'till the Fifth year after, when he reassumed his Son <hi>Ioram</hi> into the Government, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. two years before his death, in the fifth year of <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of <hi>Israel.</hi> So that <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Twenty five years, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.42. it is evident, his Son <hi>Iehoram</hi> could not be King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> 'till the Eighth year of <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of <hi>Israel.</hi> The like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is to be had in accounting the Reigns of other Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> whose years are sometime to be taken compleat, current, or confounded with other Kings preceding, or succeeding, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of their Times together shall require. In this History, consider that <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> a Religious King, is the first of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Issue, that entred a League both Offensive and Defensive with the Kings of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> with whom his Predecessors had tyred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in vain with continual Wars. This Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with one which hated the Lord, could not long prosper, not issuing from the true Root and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Wisdom; yet as a piece of sound Policy, it wanted not fair Pretences of much common good, as mutual Fortification of both Kingdoms against Uncircumcised Ancient Enemies. For confirmation
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64357:102"/>
of such an apparent Good unto Posterity therefore, the Bond of <hi>Affinity</hi> was knit by Marriage of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> with <hi>Athalia,</hi> a Lady of a Masculine Spirit, who had learned so much of <hi>Iezabel</hi> her Brother's Wife, that she durst undertake more in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> than the other in <hi>Samaria,</hi> as a Fire-brand ordained by God, to Consume many Nobles in <hi>Iuda,</hi> and perhaps some, whose Worldly Wisdom, regardless of God's pleasure, had brought her in. The <hi>Syrian</hi> Wars at <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> were the first Fruits of this League, undertaken upon equal Adventure, but upon the hope of Benefit only to <hi>Ahab</hi>: As godly Princes seldom thrive by matching with Idolaters, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther serve the Turns of those false Friends, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill-affected towards God, cannot be well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Servants. At this time also, as <hi>Ahaziah</hi> was designed King by <hi>Ahab</hi> his Father, so was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> by <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> after the others Example, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Example in any of their Predecessors,</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Iehoram</hi>'s Reign so diversly dated in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, argueth, that <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> having taken him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Government, as <hi>Ahab</hi> had given Example, found cause after to recall that Power. Probable it is, that his Insolent Idolatrous Wife having corrupted him, was the cause that the Government, both for Religion and Justice, grew so far out of order, that <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> was forced to the Reformation we read of, and sequestred his Son from the Government, 'till it were setled again; and so after five years cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to it the second time, which bred a new Date, as did his Father's death two years after, breed a third: Many things might move <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> to <hi>Iehoram</hi>'s second calling to Govern him, as to try what Wisdom his restraint had wrought, or to prevent his Brethrens Insolency against him, if <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hosaphat</hi> had at his Death, left him in disgrace, which might be the cause of great Tumults; it may be also, <hi>Iehoram,</hi> by dissimulation, had won the good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Howsoever it was, this is manifest, that his Father at his death, doubting his Affection to his Brethren, for their better Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, besides great Riches, gave them the custody of strong Cities, and unusual means against unusual Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Jehoram<hi>'s Reign alone, in which</hi> Edom <hi>and Libna</hi> Rebel. §. <hi>Iehosaphat</hi>'s providence for his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Sons availed nothing against the determination of an higher Providence; for these strong Cities were a weak defence for the young Princes against his Power, to whom the Citizens were obedient. If they came in upon the King's Summons, he had them without difficulty; if they refused, they were Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; yet could not hold out, when all would fail them, for fear of a Potent King. However it was, all were slain, and many great Men with them, who had any way offended the Tyrant, either formerly, or in behalf of his Brethren. <hi>Iehoram,</hi> after this, made innovation in Religion, not only incouraging the People prone to Idolatry (of all other sins detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God) but using Compulsion also, and was the first we read of, that inforced Irreligion. <hi>Edom,</hi> in the mean time, revolted, and made themselves a King, having, from <hi>David</hi>'s days, been Tributaries, and govern'd by Vice-Roys. Now <hi>Isaac</hi>'s Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy began to take effect, that <hi>Esau</hi> should break the Yoke of <hi>Iacob</hi>; for after this, <hi>Edom</hi> was never sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi>: Yea, in process of time, <hi>Antipater</hi> and <hi>Herod, Elumeans,</hi> Reigned as Kings in <hi>Ierusalem. Lybna,</hi> also a City of the <hi>Levites</hi> in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> rebelled against him, because he had forsaken the Lord God of his Fathers; In defence of whose Worship, these <hi>Levites</hi> thought themselves bound, especially against his inforcement to the contrary.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64357:103"/>
Wherein also they might take Incouragement for <hi>Iehosaphat</hi>'s Charge, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.8. But as <hi>Iehoram</hi> had left <hi>Edom</hi> in their defection, so he attempted nothing against <hi>Libna</hi>; which seemeth to proceed from a doubtful Mind, whether to put Weapons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of his Subjects against their Fellows, whose Cause might well be favour'd by many, who yet durst not discover themselves, being unarmed, as they might when Weapons were put into their Hands. So desperate is the Condition of Tyrants, who think it a greater Happiness to be Feared than Loved; yet are oblig'd to fear those whose Love would make them dreadful to others.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Iehoram</hi> taking no notice of God's displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by these Afflictions, was threatned by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Writing sent to him; being such a Tyrant, as the Prophets durst not reprove him to his Face, as they had done many of his Predecessors, bad as well as good, but they writ to him, keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from him; <hi>Elias</hi> being Translated, might have left this Writing, or, (as some conjecture) by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking in Writing one Letter for another, <hi>Elias</hi> is put for <hi>Elisha, &amp;c.</hi> The Accomplishment of the Prophecy, proved as terrible as the Sentence, when the <hi>Philistins,</hi> which from <hi>David</hi>'s days durst never look out, brake in upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> a naked People on Horse-back, of no Force, dwelling in a Barren Desert. So that the one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of those whom <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> Mustered, had been able to repel greater Forces than both these Enemies could raise, had the <hi>Iudean</hi> People been Armed, as by their Prince's Jealousy, they were not, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Policy of the <hi>Philistins</hi> in the days of <hi>Saul</hi>: The House of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> which they surprised, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rather a Country House than in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering they made no further Ravages. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, all <hi>Iehoram</hi>'s Children were not now slain, considering the Slaughters made after by <hi>Iehu</hi> and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64357:103"/>
                  <hi>Athaliah,</hi> within two years: Lastly himself, after two years Torment, voided his Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as the People had small cause of comfort in his Life, so they observed not the decency of pretending Sorrow for his Death; neither had he the Honour of his Ancestors Burial, though his Son Succeeded, and his Wife did all. <hi>Athaliah</hi> busie in Plotting her own Greatness, and providing trusty Counsellors for her Son, thought it unreasonable to offend the Eyes of the People with a magnificent Funeral of a Man by them detested; and chose rather to let the Blame of past Actions lie upon the Dead, than by doing him Honour, to procure an ill Opinion of her self and Children, which it now concerned her to avoid. Such is the quality of Wicked Instigators, to charge the Man whose Evil Inclination they corrupted by sinister Counsel, not only with his own Vice, but with their Faults also, when once he is gone and can profit them no longer. Thus we may clearly see, how the corrupted Affections of Men impugning the Revealed Will of God, accomplish nevertheless, his hidden Purpose; and without miraculous means, confound themselves in the seeming Wise Devices of their own Folly. All Men may likewise learn to submit their Judgments to the Ordinance of God, rather than to follow Worldly Wisdom, contrary to his Commandments.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> succeeded his Father in the Twelfth year of <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and was guided by the same Spirits that had been his Father's Evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Touching his Age, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.2. a Point more difficult than important; I see not a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conclusion than that of <hi>Torniellus</hi>'s mentioning an Edition of the Seventy at <hi>Rome, Anno.</hi> 1588, which saith, he was Twenty years old when he succeeded; and the Annotations thereon, which cite other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, which give him two years more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:64357:104"/>
and returneth home after the Battle, and presently took a new Journey to visit <hi>Iehoram.</hi> It seems his speedy return to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was not pleasing to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah,</hi> as interrupting her in her Plots, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sought to oblige him abroad, if it were but in a vain Complement, to visit one whom he had seen but yesterday. But however these things may seem accidental, yet all concurred, as disposed at this time, to fulfil the high pleasure of God; yea, <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Plots, which intended nothing less.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. Ahaziah <hi>and that Family perished with the House of</hi> Ahab. §. <hi>Iehu</hi> is anointrd King, and made Executioner of the Sentence of God against the House of <hi>Ahab,</hi> according to the Prophecy of <hi>Elias,</hi> and is proclaimed by all the other Captains. He having this Honour upon the sudden thrown upon him, was not slow in the heat of their Affections, to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in possession, and to set on foot the Business which so nearly concerned him, and not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded, being no more his own than God's. <hi>Ahab</hi>'s House never so flourished, having Seventy Princes of the Blood, a valiant King, honoured with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of <hi>Ramoth Gilead</hi>; so deeply Allied with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and Courted by the King, and so many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Blood, that it might discourage all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemies, and make Rebellious Enterprises hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. In this Security and Joy of the Court for the King's Recovery and Entertainment of the Princes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the King, his Court, and Friends are sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly surprized and slain; neither could <hi>Iezebel</hi>'s Painted Majesty, nor Man-like Spirit, with untimely brave Apothegms, terrify her Adversary, who, of her Servant, became her Lord; at whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, her base Grooms feared not to violate her affected Majesty: <hi>Ahaziah</hi> is also wounded to Death.</p>

               <p n="1">§. 1. AThaliah <hi>Vsurpeth, and upon what pretences,</hi> §. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> being dead, after one Years Reign his House was not able to retain the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.9. which Speech hath bred the question of <hi>Ioash</hi>'s Pedigree. <hi>Athaliah</hi> having Reigned under her Sons Name, had laid the Plot to play the Queen under her own Title, if her Son fail'd; and to that end, had furnished the King, Councel, and Places of Chief Command, with Men fittest for her purposes. And though Ambition be violent, yet seldom is it so shameless as to neglect Beauty. It is not therefore improbable to think that <hi>Athaliah</hi> seeing the Royal Blood so wasted in her Husband and Son's days, had by some means drawn her Husband or Son to make her Heir if the King's Blood should be extinct; considering, that without some such order taken, when the King's Blood fail'd, the Kingdom were like to be torn in sunder by Competitors, or some Popular Seditious Man should be chosen, that would subvert all regularity, and exercise his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty on such as they loved most, and cast aspersions on the Royal House. Pretence of Testaments to thrust out true Heirs is no new thing: Yea, what is new under the Sun? To prefer a younger before the natural Heir, hath proof in <hi>David</hi>; and for State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Policy to slay a Brother, by example of <hi>Solomon,</hi> &amp;c. And though these had ground of their doings, yet they which follow Examples which please them, will neglect the Reasons which please them not. <hi>Solomon</hi> slew <hi>Adonijah</hi> which had Rebelled, and was entred a new practice; <hi>Iehoram</hi> slew his Brethren better than he; <hi>David</hi> purchased the Crown, yet he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64357:105"/>
gave it by God's direction, when as <hi>Ahaziah</hi> sought to cut off <hi>David</hi>'s Issue, which the Lord had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Reign, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.3.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Iehu</hi> had so much business in establishing his own Kingdom, that he could not molest <hi>Athaliah</hi> as he desired, she being of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s House. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things about Religion, he destroyed <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests; and though never King of <hi>Israel</hi> had such a way to overthrow <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s Idolatry, seeing he needed not fear the Peoples return to <hi>David</hi>'s House (in appearance) quite rooted out, and had his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an unexpected Favour of God; and for his Zeal against <hi>Baal,</hi> had a special promise for Four Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; yet he wou'd needs piece out God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence with his own Circumspection. He had, no doubt, displeased many about <hi>Baal,</hi> and should offend more in taking away <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s ancient Idolatry; yet all these never thought of making him King, if God had not done it; when more difficulties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in getting them now, than in keeping them, though with their offence whom he sought to retain by forsaking God. This Ingratitude of <hi>Iehu,</hi> drew terrible vengeance from God on <hi>Israel,</hi> executed by <hi>Hazael,</hi> according to <hi>Elisha</hi>'s Prophesie, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.12. with 10.32. Thus <hi>Israel</hi> succeeded under <hi>Iehu,</hi> whose carriage and success was better in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering his Master that trusted him, than in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his People from Cruel Enemies. And thus it commonly falls out, that they which can find all difficulties in serving him, to whom nothing is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, instead of finding what they propound by contrary Courses, overwhelm themselves with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they sought not; and are by God, whom they first forsook, left unto the miserable Labours of their own blind Understanding and Wisdom, wherein they reposed all their Confidence.</p>

It is probable also she held Correspondence with <hi>Hazael,</hi> as King <hi>Asa</hi> had done, and had secured her self by Gifts, having robbed the House of God for <hi>Baalim,</hi> whose Idolatry she set out with Pomp, to recommend it to the People, as she sought by want of means to make the Service of the Sanctuary neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Ioash</hi>'s preservation was by means of <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, Ahaziah</hi>'s Sister, and Wife unto <hi>Iehojada</hi> the High-Priest, the upholder of God's Service in those unhappy times. By her Piety it seemeth she was not <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s Daughter, yet had she access to the Court, and conveyed the young Child with her Nurse into the Temple, where he was secretly brought up, that the Tyranness could not discover it; and thought it not fit to make much ado about him, but rather let it be thought he was dispatched with the rest; lest the People hearing of his escape, should hearken after Innovation.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Athatiah</hi> had acted as Queen above 6 Year, without molestation, when suddenly the Period of her Glory and Reward of her Wickedness met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the young Princes Age required no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be concealed, for his better Education, to fit him with Courage and Qualities proper for a King, and to prevent the over-deep rooting of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety by the longer Reign of that Cursed Woman. <hi>Iehojada</hi> wisely considered this, and combined with Five Captains, of whom he was best assured, by whom he drew over other great Men to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And because it was difficult to draw open Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he gave order to the Levites, which waited by course in the Temple, that they should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home 'till they knew his further pleasure. Thus admitting new Comers, and retaining the old, he secretly gathered together a competent number to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64357:106"/>
encounter the Queens Guard, and furnished them out of the Armory of the Temple which King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had made; with which also he armed the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and their Followers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All things being in readiness, they proceed to the Execution, and the young King is joyfully Crowned; and the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Usurper coming in desperately, without Forces, ignorant of the business, ended her own Tragedy with a sudden and shameful death. <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of her coming with her Power, which were repelled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not credible; though all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces she could bring, could not frustrate the Council of God, yet her Indiscretion made the effect more easie:</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Athaliah</hi> had no doubt considered <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi>'s rashness, casting himself into the gaping Gulf of danger; yet her self is by the like Bait drawn into the same Trap; and as she lived like <hi>Iezebel,</hi> so was she rewarded with her.</p>

               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>JOASH</hi> about Seven Year Old began to Reign, under the protection of <hi>Iehojada</hi> during his Minority. When he came to Age, he took two Wives by <hi>Iehojada</hi>'s Advice, repairing <hi>David</hi>'s Family, almost worn out. The first Act he took in hand after he Ruled without a Protector, was the reparation of the Temple, which had been his Sanctuary, which he followed with much Zeal.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Iehojada</hi> the Priest being 130 Year Old, died, before his Country could have spared him, and was buried among the Kings, as he well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

He which had 30 Years shewed Zeal to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store true Religion, and root out Idolatry, which had been growing some 16 Years, was easily drawn to fall away, when he perceived his Princes Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and being once entred that course, he ran headlong, as one who thought Liberty the only To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a King, no longer to endure the sower Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of Devout Priests. Hereby it appears, he which had been so long among the Devout, as <hi>Saul</hi> among the Prophets, was not of them; but like an Actor upon the Stage, had counterfeited, to express more Zeal and lively Affection than they could do, which were truly Religious.</p>

                  <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> Son of <hi>Iehu</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> Reign'd 17 Years, from the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Ioash</hi> King of <hi>Iudah.</hi>

               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Ioash</hi> having broken loose from God, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over to Men not so easily shaken off; for <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> King of <hi>Aram,</hi> returning from <hi>Gath,</hi> set on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which forc'd <hi>Ioash</hi> to buy his Peace with all the Treasure he could make, Holy, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; yet he never enjoyed Peace with <hi>Hazael,</hi> who sent a small Army after, and destroyed his Princes, and ravag'd his Country. Many might be the Motives to excite <hi>Hazael</hi> against <hi>Iudah</hi>; he had an experienc'd Army; <hi>Iudah</hi> had assisted <hi>Israel</hi> at <hi>Ramoth,</hi> and the Journey from <hi>Gath</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> short; yet it is probable that the Sons of <hi>Athaliah</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him, with hope of a great Party to be drawn by them, of such as favoured them; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is improbable that <hi>Hazael</hi> would have awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a sleeping Enemy. However it were, it was of God, who knoweth how to prefer Motives to such as he will imploy, though they intend it not. Some confound the two Invasions of <hi>Hazael</hi>'s; but they are different; the first was a compleat Army, which frighted <hi>Ioash,</hi> and had <hi>Hazael</hi>'s presence; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was small, and was encounter'd by the <hi>Iude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when the King of <hi>Aram</hi> was at <hi>Damascus.</hi> Some hold the Invasion was in <hi>Iehojada</hi>'s days; but it seemeth otherwise, seeing the Service of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flourished all his Days. God sometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents Men's Sins by affliction, before Men see cause, because it reforms them. As for the Wicked, usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their Sins get the start of their Punishment, which can do no good upon them, through hardness of heart by custom of Sin, as it was by this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Man, whose villanous Pattern few Tyrants can endure to imitate.</p>

personal Reasons might move <hi>Ioash</hi> to respect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Reason of Reasons, that he was a Reverend Prophet of God, yet at <hi>Ioash</hi>'s Commandment they murdered him. Not unlike the Husbandmen, who killed the Heir, in whom all the hope to win any thing at their hands did rest. For it might well be expected, that this Man might be bolder, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail more than all the rest; yet of all the rest, he succeeded least. It seems <hi>Ioash</hi> thought himself no free Prince, as long as any might be thought to have such interest in him, as to dare to deal plainly with him.</p>

Neither did the deserved Curse of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr stay long; for within the Year, when the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thought he was now absolute King without Controul, the <hi>Aramites</hi> broke into his Country, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Pillage, than to perform any great Action, being so few. The King of <hi>Iudah</hi> many ways dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his Cowardise, as by drawing blood of Friends, basely buying Peace with Enemies, when he was able to draw into the Field 300000 Men, as his Son did after; and now in levying a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my against a few Foreigners, or Bands of Rovers. Against these his Wisdom thought fit to advance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Princes, to shew his Valour, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed through incomparable odds to be free from danger. But God, that laugheth at the Folly of Wise Men, and casteth contempt upon vain-glorious Princes, intending to do more by the few <hi>Aramites</hi> than themselves merit, whether by Folly of Leaders, amazement of Souldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this great Army fell before them, and they had the slaughtering of those Princes, which had drawn their King to Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64357:108"/>
the King of Kings, and the beating and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoming of <hi>Ioash</hi> himself, who thereupon was forced to take his Bed, in which two of his own Servants, slew him, for the blood of <hi>Iehojada</hi>'s Children.</p>

               <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>Amaziah,</hi> Son of <hi>Ioash,</hi> succeeded, being Twenty five Years old, who having learned the Art of Dissimulation of his Father, finding the Princes dead which favoured Idolatry, and seeing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples dislike of his Father's Courses, by their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing his Murder; he framed himself to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the Times, forbore the Traytors, indured his Father's disgrace in his Burial, and Conformed to Religion. But after the Peoples out-cry against his Father, had tyred it self, and that he saw the Conspirators had neither Might, Partakers, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors, he put them to Death, but spared their Children; which gave Content to the People, as a point of Justice; thus by long Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to Religion and Justice, he grew strong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioash,</hi> also, King of <hi>Israel,</hi> grew in Power, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the War against the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, tho' following the Idolatry of the Calves,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64357:108"/>
which had almost consumed the Ten Tribes by <hi>Hazael</hi> and <hi>Benhadad.</hi> Yet at the Prayer of this <hi>Idolater,</hi> God had Compassion in giving him success, that he recover'd his Fathers temporal Losses; but God's Favour more worth than all, he neither sought nor got. This Man entred in the 37th year of <hi>Ioash</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and in the Fifteenth of <hi>Iehoahaz,</hi> his Father, who lived two or three after. He receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father's poor Stock of ten Chariots, Fifty Horsemen, and One Thousand Foot, his thriving with this Stock, he ascribed to the Prayers of the Holy Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.14. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet dyed about the Third or Fourth year of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ash,</hi> and for a Legacy, bestowed three Victories up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, whereby he set <hi>Israel</hi> in a good way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all their Losses.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>Amaziah,</hi> inflamed with desire to undertake some Expedition, by Example of <hi>Ioash</hi> King of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> tho' he could furnish 300000, yet knowing they had lived without Exercise a long time, except that with the <hi>Aramites,</hi> which rather discouraged them, he therefore thought good to hire 100000 Experienced Men out of <hi>Israel,</hi> with which he would recover <hi>Edom,</hi> which revolted under <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram.</hi> But upon a Prophet's Warning, he dismissed the <hi>Israelites,</hi> not beloved of God, and went in confidence of God's Assistance, and prospered; while his discontented hired <hi>Israelites</hi> ravag'd in their return; yet he recover'd not <hi>Edom.</hi> He took some of <hi>Edom</hi>'s Idols, which might have been led in Triumph, but the wretched King which took them, was besotted by them, and made them his Gods; neither would endure the Prophet's reproof from the true God. If the costly Stuff, or the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-ship ravished his Fancy, he might have disposed them to Profit or Ornament; if the <hi>Edomites</hi> Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, it should rather have moved laughter at them and their Gods, who had failed their Old
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64357:109"/>
Clients. I therefore think a proud Discontentment carried him from God, whom having Obeyed in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back his Mercenary <hi>Israelites,</hi> he looked that the Lord would have subdued <hi>Edom</hi> unto him, as well as give him a Victory; forgetting that God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that <hi>Esau</hi> should break off the Yoke of <hi>Iacob</hi> at length; and therefore should have limited his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and been contented with an honourable Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But as Men careful before the Battle, to pray to God, acknowledging him the giver of Victory; and when the Field is won, vaunt of their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, as if God used their Fore-sight and Courage therein; so <hi>Amaziah</hi> finding God did nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, arrogated what was ordinary, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and scorned to be checked by a Prophet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before lost One Hundred Talents by one of them, without any Benefit. From this proud Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God, and Conceit of his own Sufficiency, little Inferior to <hi>David,</hi> he challenged <hi>Ioash</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and upon occasion of the late Wrongs done by his Subjects, perhaps required Subjection of the Ten Tribes, by Right from his Ancestors <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> Had he only required Satisfaction, It may be, <hi>Ioash</hi> would not have returned such an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> as argueth an Insolent proud Challenge. <hi>Ajax</hi>'s Father wished him the Victory by the Gods assistance: He answered, that Cowards got Victory so, but he would have it without them; after which proud Speech, and many valiant Acts, upon some disgrace, he fell Mad and killed himself. <hi>Amaziah</hi>'s Thoughts were like Parents of like words, and he might as well have said, he had the Victory without God; which made him insolently challenge <hi>Ioash,</hi> as if he were able to encounter a valiant Leader, and People trained up in a long Victorious War, because he had defeated the weak, broken <hi>Edomites.</hi> As his first Counsel among his Parasites, to defy <hi>Ioash,</hi> was foolish, so was his proceeding, which was careless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64357:109"/>
in providing and preventing; in both which, his Adversaries took the start, and prevented <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi> with a brave Army in his own Country, to save him the labour of a long March. This sudden Invasion much discouraged <hi>Iudah,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving devoured <hi>Israel</hi> in their greedy hopes, saw themselves disappointed, and their own Estates sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the others: This Issue was, that <hi>Amaziah</hi> was taken, and was led in Triumph to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which, to save his Life, he basely procured to be opened to the Conqueror, who made a large breach in the Wall, at which he rid in, made what Spoil he thought fit, and departed.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. <hi>Ioash</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> being in Possession of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it may be marvelled why he seized not upon the whole Kingdom; especially considering he might think the Kingdom was not tyed to the House of <hi>David,</hi> as appeared in <hi>Athaliah</hi>; and that the <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans</hi> were liklier to endure his Government, being such a Conqueror, and descended of Kings, of which <hi>Iehu</hi> was Anointed from God. I need not add the Commodities growing by Union of these two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; neither read we of any special Prohibition to him; but it appears, <hi>Ioash</hi> minded not the Kingdom, for then he would not have aimed at such a Triumph and Entrance at a Breach, which is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Affronts to Citizens, but would have entred at a Gate with fair Intreaty of a People, rather yielding than vanquished; he would also have forborn the Spoil, especially of the Sanctuary, which the People prefer to their Lives; and in forbearing whereof, he had won the Opinion of Piety, as the Sacrilege upon the House of their God and his, branded him with a Mark of extraordinary Prophaneness, who by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Church-Robbery, became odious, and lost the Inheritance of the whole Orchard, by stealing a few fair Apples. The Citizens provoked by these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, after a few days, would gather Spirit,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64357:110"/>
to conceive the Enemy was of their Mould, and that themselves were not disarmed, were a great multitude, had Provision and such advance of Place as Armed Women and Children; and considering the Evils grown, and like to encrease by former Cowardize, would grow to a desperate Resolution to correct the first Errors. Upon these grounds, it is certain that great Towns entred by Capitulation, are not so easily held as entred, as <hi>Charles</hi> VIII<hi>th</hi> of <hi>France</hi> found at <hi>Florence,</hi> which made him come to Terms, when he saw the Citizens Resolution, rather to hazard all, than to submit to his intollerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, being now entred the Town. Besides, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ash</hi> might consider how hardly he could make good his Possession against the Army of <hi>Iudah,</hi> rather terrified than broken; and lastly, <hi>Ioash</hi> having had the Three Victories against <hi>Aram,</hi> promised by the Prophet, he should not expect a perpetual Success against them; and therefore thought it best to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home with the best Security he could for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying his rich cumbersom Booty, and to make head against the <hi>Aramites,</hi> who, in his Absence, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Advantage, and given <hi>Israel</hi> such a Blow as he could never recover; taking therefore Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for his quiet Passage, he returned home.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. <hi>Amaziah,</hi> who threatned to work wonders, and raise again the Empire of <hi>David,</hi> was stript of his <hi>Lions</hi> Skin; and appeared nothing so terrible a Beast as he had been painted, and became an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of scoffing to many; as the Shame which falls on an Insolent Man, seldom fails of much Reproach. Governours are commonly blamed by the Multitude, for the Calamities which befall them, though by the Peoples default; but every Child could see the Root of all this Mischief in this Bastard, which having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked a valiant Adversary, for Fear betrayed the City, opened unto him by this base intreaty, to save his Life (which his Brutal Father would not do)
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64357:110"/>
which he redeemed at so dear a rate, as the Spoil of City and Temple, which might easily have been saved by a little delay, which would have forced <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ash</hi> faster home than he came out, hearing of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramites</hi>; and a little Courage, in that space, recover'd, would have perswaded him to leave his Baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, had not this good King given Hostages for a Convoy. That this punishment and dishonour brought him back to God, appeareth not, but the contrary, by the Reason of the Conspiracy Related by the Holy Ghost. He which tells a Man in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, of his sins past, shall sooner be thought to upbraid him with his present Fortune, than to seek his Reformation; which might make the Priest and Prophets little welcome to him. On the other side, his Flatterers which sought to raise up his Heart, of which themselves might always be Masters, wanted no plausible Matter; and he was not the first Noble Commander which hath been foiled, as <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self abandoned <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Absalom. Sesac</hi> was sent into the City as well as <hi>Ioash</hi>; the Temples Pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging had been excused by Necessity of State; his Captivity excuseth his Command to open the City, but they which opened it were to blame, knowing he was not his own Master, when he commanded it; his Captivity was his Honour, who might have escaped by Fight, as others did, which betrayed him by running away while he fought to incourage them by his Example; yet his Mischance saved Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, while the Enemy wisely preferred the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of a Lyon, before the Chase of an Army of Stags which followed him. These, or the like Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es might have satisfied Men, if the King had studied to please God; but as he still neglected the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, so after this, he out-living his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Fifteen Years, recovered no Love of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by his Government, but increased their Hatred to his Ruine. He which thinketh himself less Honoured
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64357:111"/>
than he deserveth in his own Opinion, will force his Authority, to be esteemed a severe Man; that by affected Sowerness, he may be thought a grave, wise Man, and that by the Fear in which the Oppressed live, he may be thought a Reverence to the Oppressed; at least it will dazel the Eyes of Underlings, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from prying into the weakness of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours. Thus the time in which, by well using it, Men might attain to be such as they ought, they do usually mispend it in seeking to appear such as they are not, so procure more Indignation than was feared, instead of the Respect that was hoped; which is of dangerous Consequence in an unable Spirit in high Authority, too passionate in Execution of an Office, and cannot be checked but by violence. If <hi>Amaziah</hi> thought by extreme rigour to uphold his Reputation; what did he but make the People think he hated them, who easily believed he did not love them? He had indeed provided for his own secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, by revenging on his Father; but who shall take Vengeance (or on whom) of a Murther in which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one hath a part? Surely God himself, who hath not given Leave to the People to shed the blood of his Anointed. Yet as he was careless of God, and was carried head-long, with his own Affection; so his Subjects, by his Example, not enquiring what was their Duty, rose up against him with a precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Fury, which yet he could not avoid by flying to <hi>Lachish,</hi> as a choice Town for Strengh and Affection, where yet he found no other Favour, but that they would not kill him with their own Hands, but abandon'd him to the Conspirators sent after him, who dispatched him with little Opposition.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. <hi>Amaziah</hi> being Slain, the Throne of <hi>Iudah</hi> was vacant Eleven Years; for as he out-lived <hi>Ioash</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> 15 Years, which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> held, and must dye the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> so it is expresly said, <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mercator, &amp;c.</hi> But I know not why it may not be admitted in <hi>Iudah,</hi> seeing the like necessity hath inforced it in the Kingdom of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as between the death of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> 2. and his Son <hi>Zecharias,</hi> and between <hi>Peka</hi> and <hi>Hosea.</hi> Such suspence of the Crown of <hi>Iudah</hi> is more probable, considering how things stood at the death of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi> although the computation were not so apparent. For the Publick Fury which extended so far against the King's Person, was not like to be appeased, 'till order was taken to redress the Matters which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that eruption. We need not then wonder that they who involv'd themselves in the former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against the Father, would stay the Crown 'till things were set in order, the Prince being so young, and to be under protection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To make <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s Reign to begin the 11th with his Father, were the best, but only for swallowing up so much of <hi>Ioash</hi>'s Reign, extending the Years of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and contracting the Years of the Princes of other Nations.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12.

This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy voluptuous Prince was so base, he durst let no Man see him; 'till at length <hi>Arbaces</hi> Governour of <hi>Media,</hi> got a sight of that beastly Spectacle of a Man in Woman's Attire counterfeiting an Harlot;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:64357:112"/>

               <head>CHAP. XI.X Of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and his Contemporaries in <hi>Israel,</hi> and elsewhere; of his two Successors.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>UZziah,</hi> or <hi>Aaria</hi> being Sixteen Years of Age, succeeded his Father <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi> in the Twenty Seventh Year of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and Reigned Forty Two Years; he served the God of his Fathers, and prosper'd. His Victories and Atchievments were far beyond any since the time of <hi>David,</hi> and his Wealth exceeded any since <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s days. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> also King of <hi>Israel</hi> prospered in the North, and won <hi>Damascus,</hi> and <hi>Hamath</hi>; not for his Piety, being an Idolater: It was only the Lord's compassion on <hi>Israel,</hi> so extreamly afflicted by <hi>Aram.</hi> Yet as God's goodness to <hi>Iehu</hi> his Grandfather, could not win him from <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s politick Idolatry of the Calves, no more could it make <hi>Ieroboam</hi> his Son render the Honour due to the only giver of Victory; so that the Promise made to <hi>Iehu</hi> for Four Generations, grew to an accomplishment, to be a fair warning to his Son to expect a Change, except himself or his Son would change his Idolatry. But as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> ended his days in his Idolatry, so his Son <hi>Zachary,</hi> who should have succeeded presently, was held out many years without apparent reason, but only the two Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi>; yet Secondary Causes were like not to be wanting. Probable it is, that as <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s Reign had bred many brave Captains, so they saw so little in <hi>Zechary</hi> to respect him for, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps found something which moved disdain, that they could not agree to submit unto him 'till some principal of them were dead; every Man of them in the mean time holding what he could, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64357:113"/>
Anarchy lasted about 23 Years, from the 11<hi>th</hi> Year of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> when <hi>Ieroboam</hi> died, unto the 38<hi>th</hi> of the same <hi>Vzziah,</hi> in the which <hi>Zechariah</hi> entred, and sate 6 Months. And though some suppose <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> to Reign 11 Years with his Father, and to cut off so much of this Inter-regnum, yet they leave 12 Years; but I prefer the former, as best agreeing with the Reign of other Princes, and not extend <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s Reign and Life as this doth. <hi>Zechariah</hi> the Son of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the last of <hi>Iehu</hi>'s Line, after 6 Months Reign, was by <hi>Sallum</hi> slain, fulfilling the 4 Generations following to <hi>Iehu</hi>; yet not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sallum</hi> to slay him, as <hi>Iehu</hi> had been against <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horam.</hi> Thus <hi>Iero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Pekahiah</hi> succeeded his Father 2 Years, in the Year of <hi>Azariah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah. Peka</hi> the Son of <hi>Remaliah</hi> slew <hi>Pekahia,</hi> and Reigned 20 Years.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Vzziah,</hi> whose Succession had been endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered by the hatred to his Father, but by Holy Men brought up and advanced, as was <hi>Ioash,</hi> and had his Holy <hi>Zechariah,</hi> under whose direction he prospered, as <hi>Ioash</hi> under good <hi>Iehojada.</hi> But as <hi>Ioash</hi> after his Tutor's death, so <hi>Vzziah</hi> after his <hi>Zechariah,</hi> forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Law of God, which had separated the Priest's Office from the King's, would needs usurp the same; for which presumption, being reprov'd by <hi>Azariah</hi> the Priest, the Lord seconded the just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, and struck the King with Leprosie.

               <head>CHAP. XX. Of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>'s Foundation in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi>'s time.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>ITALY,</hi> before the Fall of <hi>Troy,</hi> was known to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by the names of <hi>Hesperia, Ausonia, Oenotria,</hi> of a Colony of <hi>Arcadians</hi>; and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> of <hi>Italus. Reyneccius</hi> derives the Name rather from a Colony of <hi>Aetolians,</hi> which Inhabited <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium,</hi> from whose Names, with small Change, that part was called <hi>Italia,</hi> which in time grew the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name, saith <hi>Pliny.</hi> Such change in the <hi>Aeolic</hi> Dialect is Familiar, as to call an Island Peopled by <hi>Aetholians, Aethalia.</hi> The Original of <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> was from <hi>Iavan,</hi> who sailing over the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, between <hi>Aetolia</hi> and the Western Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, planted <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy. Reyneccius</hi> makes <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai Italus,</hi> one which <hi>Berosus</hi> calls <hi>Cethim Italus,</hi> but is deceived, for <hi>Atlas</hi> is esteemed more Antient than <hi>Moses</hi>; and if he were <hi>Cethim</hi> or <hi>Kithim, Noah</hi>'s Grand-Son, his Antiquity exceeds that of <hi>Italy</hi>; which Name, <hi>Virgil</hi> confesseth later, and from a Captain. But seeing <hi>Hercules</hi> a little before <hi>Troy</hi>'s Fall, left a Colony of <hi>Eleans</hi> or <hi>Aetoleans,</hi> it may be under the command of one called <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolus,</hi> a Name famous among <hi>Aetolians: Italy</hi> might take Name of him.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Aborigines,</hi> that is, the Natives of the place Inhabited <hi>Latium,</hi> whom <hi>Halycarnassus, Varro,</hi> and <hi>Reyneccius,</hi> think to have been <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who used to vaunt of their Antiquity, having more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly kept their Country in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Greeks</hi> yet being fruitful, sent Colonies to other Countries, as when <hi>Evander</hi> was sent into the same parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>

It may be then that <hi>Saturn</hi> hiding himself, was some allusion to the old Opinion of the Wise Heathen, that the true God was an unknown God, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> found an Altar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.

               <head>CHAP. XXI. Of <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> and his Contemporaries.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>HEzechiah</hi> at 25 Years old succeeded, about the end of <hi>Achaz</hi> 14 Years, in the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Hosea</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and Reigned 29 Years. His first Work testified his Pious Zeal in opening the Temple, shut up by his ungracious Father, and reformed Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Comp. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29, and 30. with 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. It is uncertain whether he did this in his Father's time, or in his sole Government, as I rather think. He invited also the Ten Tribes to the Passover, which the Generality scorned. In the fourth Year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> which scorned to Celebrate their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> fell into a new Servitude, wherein they continued to this day. For <hi>Salmanasser,</hi> Son of <hi>Tyglath,</hi> hearing that <hi>Hosea</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> practised with <hi>Soe</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> against him; came, and after Three Years Siege, won <hi>Samaria,</hi> and carried the Ten Tribes into <hi>Assyria,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced others in the Land.</p>
               <p>These later <hi>Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Kings following, are the first we find mentioned both in Profane and Sacred Books, and therefore must serve to joyn the times of the old World with that following, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none but Prophets have written otherwise than Fabulous of former Times. True it is, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> and some <hi>Persian</hi> Kings bear the same Name in Scripture, and Profane Stories; but of others the diversity of Names have bred question of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as whether <hi>Salmanasser</hi> in Scripture be <hi>Nabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasser</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> be <hi>Nabopolas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> both which points <hi>Bucholcerus</hi> out of good <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematick</hi> Observations, hath well proved; for by them it appears, that from <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After this, Friends came in on both sides, and three other Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles were fought; but in the last, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were put to flight. Thus the War continued so long by the obstinacy of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> that their Wives sent them word their Cities would become dispeopled for want of Issue; whereupon they sent back their ablest young Men, promiscuously to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their young Women, whose Issue became the greatest part of the Nation, and were called <hi>Parthians.</hi> The <hi>Messenians</hi> at length, by Oracle, were order'd to Sacrifice a Virgin of the Stock of <hi>Egyptus,</hi> of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> Royal Blood. <hi>Aristodemus</hi> the King, ripped up his own Daughters Belly, to prove her a Virgin, contrary to her Lover's report; which to save her, said she was with Child; yet the <hi>Messenians</hi> prevailed not: So that the miserable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slew himself at the Grave, with whom the <hi>Messenians</hi> lost their Courage, and yielded after twenty years rigorous Contests.

The <hi>Spartans</hi> believed not them which reported he was escaped, 'till the slaughters he made of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> at <hi>Era</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured it.

               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Neco,</hi> Son to <hi>Psamniticus,</hi> following his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers designs, who had made entrance into <hi>Syria,</hi> being assisted by the extraordinary Valor of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and knowing how <hi>Assyria,</hi> stood in danger by the Power of the <hi>Medes,</hi> intended with a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Army to visit <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and strengthen the Passages about <hi>Carchemish,</hi> or further to Invade <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> Having therefore over-thrown <hi>Iosiah</hi> in his way, not intending to stay the Conquest of <hi>Iudah,</hi> he proceeded and took <hi>Cadytis,</hi> perhaps <hi>Carchemish,</hi> and became, in a manner, Lord of all <hi>Syria,</hi> saith <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus,</hi> particularly of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> whom he set to Sail from the <hi>Arabian</hi> Gulf round about <hi>Africa,</hi> by the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>good Hope.</hi> In his return from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> he took <hi>Ieboahaz,</hi> the younger Son of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> whom <hi>Ieremy</hi> calls <hi>Shallum,</hi> whom the People had made King, and put him in Bonds, and put <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liakim</hi> in his place, calling him <hi>Iehojakim,</hi> and layed a Tribute on the Land, but forbore the Conquest. <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> was King but three Months; <hi>Iehojakim</hi> the Elder Son of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> Reigned Ten years, he was of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Faction, and of the behaviour of the worst of his Ancestors, which had so Infected the Land, that the Chief Priests also were defiled therewith. Yet the Lord raised up Prophets which reproved him, among whom <hi>Vriah,</hi> flying from the Tyrant which sought his Life, is from <hi>Egypt</hi> sent back to death, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Custom of Nations.</p>

so that he could not intend <hi>Syria,</hi> but was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded then, by a great part of <hi>Assyria,</hi> if not by all, as some less probably think. Yet his little concern with the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Affairs all his long Reign, argues him busied at Home in setling his Purchases there; and having Amity with <hi>Hezekiah. Ben. Mirodacb</hi> his Son succeeded Twenty one years, whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours (as I take it) captivated <hi>Manasses,</hi> in whose time <hi>Psamniticus,</hi> with his Greek Mercenaries, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in <hi>Syria,</hi> which might procure <hi>Manasses</hi> his release, and it may be a part of the Kingdom of <hi>Samaria,</hi> which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> could not now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nabulassar</hi> his Son succeeded Thirty five years, whose works at home kept him from looking abroad; for <hi>Phraortes</hi> King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> Invaded <hi>Assyria,</hi> and Besieged <hi>Ninive,</hi> which it seems was not yet subject to <hi>Babylon</hi>; for <hi>Nabonassar</hi> repelled him not, but the <hi>Scythians</hi> Invaded <hi>Media,</hi> and forced him thence. <hi>Phraortes</hi> Son of <hi>Deioces</hi> King of <hi>Media,</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Dominions, attempted <hi>Ninive,</hi> which yet remained of her self well enough, saith <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> Custom of Danger hardened the Un-war-like, whom sudden unknown Dangers amaze. <hi>Ninive</hi> had now been long exercised, so that <hi>Phraortes</hi> and his Family perished there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his Son, a braver Man of War, won in Lesler <hi>Asia,</hi> all from <hi>Halis</hi> Eastward. He Besieged <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive,</hi> and took it, saith <hi>Eusebius,</hi> whom I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than <hi>Herodotus,</hi> saying, the <hi>Scythians</hi> came upon him, which is not likely, for we cannot think him so improvident; but rather hearing they were to guard <hi>Media,</hi> he left the City, which about this time was destroyed, as we read in <hi>Tobit,</hi> a Book of sufficient Credit, for the Story of those Times. And sure we are, the Prophecy of <hi>Nabum</hi> was fulfilled by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>; and probable it is, that <hi>Nabulassar,</hi> after <hi>Cyaxares</hi> left it in weak case,

might seize upon it easily, and put a Vice-Roy in it, which upon their Rebellion against <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> were utterly destroyed.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. The <hi>Scythians,</hi> about this time, made a great Expedition into <hi>Asia,</hi> of which <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaks much, and many Fabulous things ill agreeing with the time. Their first Eruption must needs be within the Reign of <hi>Psamniticus</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who met with them in <hi>Palestine,</hi> and got them by intreaty and gifts to leave the Country.

For the <hi>Cymmerians,</hi> or <hi>Cimbrians</hi> are well known by their Conquests of many Nations, to have been no such Cowards. These were of the Posterity of <hi>Gomer,</hi> who Peopled most of the Western World, and whose Reflux over-whelmed no small portion of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi>; of whose Original, read <hi>Goropius Becanus</hi> his <hi>Amazonica,</hi> where we find the <hi>Cimmeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Scythians,</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians</hi> were all one Nation, distinguished by divers Names according to their Tribes, <hi>&amp;c. Homer</hi> also spake disgracefully of them for the same cause; for they had wasted his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as had the <hi>Amazons.</hi> As for the expulsion they write of, it was no more than sending out of Colonies into <hi>Asia,</hi> with an Army of <hi>Scythians</hi> to help to Plant them elsewhere, their own Country
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64357:125"/>
being over-charged. The <hi>Sarmatians</hi> also were their Companions, as their return by <hi>Novogrod</hi> in <hi>Russia,</hi> which was <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> sheweth. Such another Eruption they made above Five hundred years after. The <hi>Cimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> being the first Company, held the way of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xine</hi> Sea on their Right hand, passing through <hi>Colchis,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Pontus,</hi> then <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> where fortifying the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, whereon the <hi>Greeks</hi> after built <hi>Synope,</hi> they there left the unserviceable men of their Train, under Guard. From thence to <hi>Lydia, Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Ionia,</hi> the way lay open. In <hi>Lydia</hi> they Won <hi>Sardis</hi> from the King of <hi>Ardis, &amp;c.</hi> The misery of Wars is never such, as when Men are forced to seek a State which others possess; when all is little enough for the one side, and worketh the rooting out of the other. They which Fight for Mastery, are pacifyed with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and Services; but in these Migrations, the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants are so unsatiable, that they need all the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants have, even to the succeeding Infants Cradle. The merciless terms of this Controversy, arms both sides with desperate Resolution, seeing all is at the stake on both sides, to the utter Ruin of the one side. Our <hi>Britains</hi> can witness the differenc of Conquests, who lost but Liberty by the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the which they gained civil Acts, which before they never knew; but by <hi>Saxons</hi> they lost all, to the era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the <hi>Britains</hi> Race. The <hi>Danes</hi> made the like attempt on the <hi>Saxons,</hi> with such continuance as bred acquaintance between them, neither being able to subdue the other; so many <hi>Danes</hi> became peaceable Inhabitants in wasted parts, and the rest returned home. Such was (as I think) the end of the <hi>Cimmerian</hi> War in <hi>Lydia,</hi> which having continued long, made both sides willing to rest; so that upon some Victory of King <hi>Halyattes,</hi> the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> were content with what they had gotten on the East side of the River <hi>Halys</hi>; which henceforth became the Border of <hi>Lydia,</hi> on whose East side, dwelt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazons,</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:64357:126"/>
that is, the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> and <hi>Scythians.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to serveth, that when <hi>Cyaxares</hi> of <hi>Media</hi> sought Revenge on the <hi>Scythians, Haliates</hi> assisted them, to prevent his encroaching Westward. <hi>Herodotus</hi>'s Tale of this War about the <hi>Scythian</hi> Fugitives, is less probable. The <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians</hi> took to the <hi>South,</hi> as the <hi>Cimerians</hi> had to the <hi>West,</hi> passing between <hi>Caucasus</hi> and the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea through <hi>Albania, Colthene,</hi> &amp;c. where now are <hi>Servia</hi> and <hi>Georgia,</hi> and entred <hi>Media</hi> in the time of <hi>Phraortes,</hi> who was glad to Compound with them, while <hi>Psammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> reigned in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the sixth year of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulassar,</hi> from which their Twenty Eight Years Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ended in his Thirty fourth; the <hi>Medes</hi> not venturing a second Battel, thought nothing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to remove such troublesome Guests, and therefore submitted to a Tribute, and so got them to remove; who finding the Country more Pleasant toward the <hi>South,</hi> were easily perswaded. How <hi>Babylon,</hi> being in their way to <hi>Egypt,</hi> escaped, is uncertain; yet 'tis certain, that all those parts of <hi>Asia</hi> were Tributaries to them. <hi>Psamniticus,</hi> to prevent their entring <hi>Egypt,</hi> (as a <hi>Iealous</hi> Husband of a fair Wife) which he would not be willing they should see, met them in <hi>Syria,</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Palestine,</hi> and at their being at <hi>Ascalon,</hi> and he at <hi>Gaza,</hi> and with fair words and rich Gifts so perswaded 'em, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to visit their high Country Friends, and left <hi>Syria</hi> the more easy for him to deal with, while the Nations beyond <hi>Euphrates</hi> who had new work to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain these Strangers with, returned. The <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> flowing back, the way they came, grew an intolerable Burthen to all they light on, especially the <hi>Medes,</hi> which there over-swarm'd, being Rich and near home, in a Climate best agreeing with their Bodies. Here they fell from exacting, the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tribute, to take what they liked; yea All, from many; whereby the Land was unmanured. <hi>Cyaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:64357:126"/>
to remedy this oppression, took this Course; that the <hi>Medes</hi> Feasting the better part of the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> made them drunk, and slew them, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all; like as the <hi>Danes</hi> had been used in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> 'Tis like that this was done on the Chief Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which forced the Multitude upon indifferent Conditions to return home, being yet strong enough against the Encounters by the way. Others perhaps were setled in the Country before; others might go to their Countrymen in <hi>Lydia.</hi> At this time is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the Story of the returned <hi>Scythians,</hi> which vanquished their Corrival Slaves at home with Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whips; according to the Custom of the <hi>Muscovian</hi> Women sending a Whip, which she Curiously Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, to the Man which shall be her Husband, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Subjection.</p>

Before the <hi>Grecian</hi> Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piads, and the Eastern Date from <hi>Nabonassar,</hi> the Course of Time had no beaten Path, as after it had more certain Marks; yet from <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s Destruction, the former, with
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64357:129"/>
the succeeding Ages, are more clearly discern'd in their Connection. The harm which some have found in the years of the overgrown Monarchies, doth preserve their Names, which otherwise might have been forgotten, but cannot shew the Year of such a King, in which any thing expressed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was done. Neither could any certainty be gathered from the late Kings of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> &amp;c. if <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Reign had not been precisely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the years of <hi>Iehojakim,</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> Hence have we the first light to discover how to connect Sacred and Profane Histories; for <hi>Iudah</hi>'s Seventy years Captivity begin under <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and ending the first of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> directs us backward and forward. This first year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is joyned with the first of the fifty fifth Olympiad. And that he Reigned twenty three year before his Monarchy, and seven after, is apparent; and giving them four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eight year between <hi>Troy</hi>'s Fall, and <hi>Iphetus</hi>'s restoring the Olympiads, we may arrive to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true <hi>Grecian</hi> Antiquities. For other Nations, let St. <hi>Augustine</hi> be trusted.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. The Seventy Years of <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity being our chief mark of direction, we are to inform our selves truly therein. Some begin from <hi>Ieconias</hi>'s Captivity, eleven year before <hi>Zedekiah</hi>; citing <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.1. <hi>Beraldus</hi> judgeth that it began the first of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and fourth of <hi>Ioakim</hi>; citing 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.11. but cannot thus make it good. Wretched <hi>Porphyrie</hi> scoffeth at St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.11. not knowing <hi>Iosias</hi>'s Sons had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Names, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> shewed. The Wretch affirmeth the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> was written long after his death, at or near the time of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> whom <hi>Eusebius, Apollonius,</hi> &amp;c. have answered. And the Seventy Interpreters Translated it out of <hi>Hebrew,</hi> one hundred year before that. <hi>Iaddus</hi> the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64357:129"/>
High-Priest also shewed the Book to the Great <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> &amp;c. True it is, the <hi>Iews</hi> ascribe it to <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi> and equal it not to the Prophet, but put it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Hagiographs,</hi> or Holy Books; which are <hi>Daniel, Psalms, Iob, Proverbs, Canticles, Ruth, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, Ecclesiastes, Hester, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles.</hi> Our Christian Councils and Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it Canonical; and our Saviour who cited no <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> cited it as a proof exceeding all.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. That the Seventy Years Captivity began at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s destruction, not <hi>Ieconias</hi>'s Captivity, is clear; <hi>Ieremiah</hi> himself, explained himself, and <hi>Daniel,</hi> cited by some to the contrary. Compare <hi>Chap.</hi> 25.9, 11, 12. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.10. where, in the first place, he expresly beginneth the Captivity of Seventy years, at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s Destruction; and thereof certifies the Captivity in the second place.

Touching the King's Reigning in <hi>Babylon</hi> those seventy Years, and the time of each, help us a little to the times before or after; neither it seems were most of their Acts worth Recording. For as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s latter times were either in delights, or madness, so his Posterity grew slothful, as Sons whose Fathers have purchased enough to their hands; yet let us consider of Men's Opinions therein, and judge as we see cause. The surest Opinion, is theirs which follow the Scripture; which Name only <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, Evilmerodach,</hi> and <hi>Balthasar</hi> and <hi>Ieremy,</hi> which seemeth to limit the Dominion of <hi>Babel,</hi> to Father, Son, and Grandson. To qualifie this, I see no necessity, except Profane Authors were constant and probable in more Successions, which they are not. <hi>Iosephus</hi> reckons five, citing <hi>Berosus</hi>; but far otherwise than doth <hi>Ierom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:64357:130"/>
                  <hi>Anius Metasthenes</hi> nameth five, of which, the three last were Brethren; but neither he, nor the rest, can qualifie <hi>Ieremiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Opinion is here handled, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, beginning the seventieth year from <hi>Iecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi>'s transportation: and giving <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> but two years, <hi>Balthasar</hi> one, of which he maketh four, spent in his protection, and maketh him a Son of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Daughter. But as <hi>Ieremiah</hi>'s speech of <hi>Evilmerodach</hi>'s raising up <hi>Ieconias,</hi> argueth longer time, so his speaking expresly of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s Sons in the Succession. So <hi>Daniel</hi> employ'd in so high a Place by the King, and after falling to a private Life, could not have been forgotten of him in two year, or less. <hi>Scaliger</hi> also finds one <hi>Nabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidus</hi> after <hi>Balthasar,</hi> and giveth him seventeen years, and maketh him <hi>Darius Medus,</hi> whom others make the same with <hi>Balthasar,</hi> to make good <hi>Berosus,</hi> whom <hi>Scaliger</hi> his chief Patron, herein forsaketh. His grounds are, one, out of <hi>Daniel</hi> 5.31. where <hi>Darius</hi> is not said to win, but receive the Kingdom; makes no strong conclusion, &amp;c. His other is out of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasthenes</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> calling <hi>Nabonidus</hi> a <hi>Mede,</hi> but I find it not; and if I did, I would little regard it, considering his other improbable Reports with it. Besides, the Opinion agreeth hardly with Scripture, which saith, <hi>the Kingdom should be divided between the Medes and Persians.</hi> So that either <hi>Darius</hi> was not <hi>Nabonidus,</hi> or else bethink us what <hi>Persian</hi> sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with him. Nay, both the Nations made the Empire, as <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Ram sheweth; and the <hi>Greeks</hi> call the Wars made by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the Wars of the <hi>Medes.</hi> So that the Notion of the Chronologers holding <hi>Darius</hi> Partner in <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Victories, was not well condemn'd.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Lyra,</hi> and others, who hold those only named in Scripture, to have reigned in <hi>Babylon</hi> during those Seventy years; I esteem more comformable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64357:130"/>
For the years of their Reign, it is clear, that <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> began to Reign, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.27. <hi>Ier.</hi> 52.31. in the Thirty Seventh year of <hi>Iechonias</hi>'s Captivity, from which, deduct <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s Eleventh year, when the City was taken, there remained Twenty Six of the Seventy. How to distribute the other Forty four to the succeeding Kings, is not so needful, as long as the total Sum is certain. Yet I will be bold to conjecture, as others have done, giving to <hi>Belthasar</hi> Seventeen years, with <hi>Iosephus</hi>; so there remain Twenty Seven, of which one may be taken away for the First of <hi>Darius</hi>; so Twenty six remain for <hi>Evilmerodach:</hi> Besides <hi>Iosephus,</hi> all that confound <hi>Balthasar</hi> and <hi>Nabonidus,</hi> give him Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Years; and <hi>Daniel</hi>'s being grown out of <hi>Balthasar</hi>'s Knowledge, who yet had served him his Third year, argueth some long time between. That <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> Reigned some good time, is probable, by <hi>Iechonias</hi>'s favour under him; and some of great judgment, have given him Twenty three years, and more might be given as well as that.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. Touching the actions of these Kings. <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>'s former years were Victorious. In his Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year he won <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and proud <hi>Tyrus, Esa.</hi> 23.15. The same year <hi>Egypt</hi> was next aimed at, as the fairest Mark; but the petty Nations about <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> who desired the Ruin thereof, were to be made sure, for fear of incommoding his Return from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> if he succeeded not. All these ill Neighbours which imagined to gain by <hi>Iudah</hi>'s fall as <hi>Tyrus</hi> had, and had followed the Camp as Ravens, were sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly opposed by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> as the Lord had threatned, and brought into the Condition <hi>Iudah</hi> was in, <hi>Esa.</hi> 16.14.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> having freed the Coast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, through <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> leaving nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friend to <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor Foe to himself, able to give impediment to his Proceeding or Retreat, he
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64357:131"/>
presently took it in hand, and according to our Three great Prophets, had a Victorious Conquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> although some good Authors following <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> and <hi>Diodore,</hi> extenuate it to a Ravage without Conquest; and that <hi>Apries,</hi> or <hi>Hophra</hi> their King, was slain after in an Insurrection of his Subjects, and <hi>Amasis</hi> chosen to succeed. But <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> are herein contradicted by such Authority as Force our Belief, as <hi>Esa.</hi> 20.4, 5, 6. <hi>Ier.</hi> 43.10. and 44, and 46.25, 26. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.20.30. and 32.31. So that <hi>Iunius,</hi> who in one place took <hi>Hophra</hi>'s Enemies to be <hi>Amasis</hi> and his Fellows, yet on <hi>Ier.</hi> 44.30. he Confessed the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests had abused <hi>Herodotus. Iosephus</hi> also herein is rather to be believed, reporting <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Conquests, and slaying of the King by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another in his stead; all which is consonant to the Prophets.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Victories after the Conquest of <hi>Syria,</hi> more enlarged his Dominions than his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for besides the Conquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> we are bound to believe he Conquered <hi>Phut,</hi> and <hi>Lud,</hi> and other Nations, as it seemeth, even to <hi>Mauritania.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Egypt</hi> had flourished Fifteen hundred Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years; but from henceforth, Forty years under a Vice-Roy, and was long after in recovering strength, but never to her Antient Glory, <hi>Esa.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Actions are diversly dated, some from the beginning of his Reign, whose first year ran with part of <hi>Iehojakim</hi>'s Third, when <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> was carried Captive. Another date was from the beginning of his Empire, which was after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as his Dream, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.1. which could not be the Second years Reign, considering the third then being up of <hi>Daniel,</hi> before he stood before the King, as also that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was yet no such King, as he was when <hi>Daniel</hi> declared the Dream,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64357:131"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the Conquest of <hi>Egypt, Ninive,</hi> which Rebelled, was destroyed by him, as <hi>Nahum</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told; whose Prophecy went between the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ninive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s last Times are found only in <hi>Daniel,</hi> as his Buildings in <hi>Babel, cap.</hi> 4.27. wherein he glorified so much; and no marvel if <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>'s report out of <hi>Berosus,</hi> be true, of an Orchard supported by Arches, as high as Mountains, rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Fifteen days. But his over-valuing his own Greatness, abased him as low; and the Lord, for his presuming to erect an Image to be worshipped to his dishonour, whom he had before acknowledged, cast such contempt upon him, as never befel such a Man. For, after the Lord had convinced him by the miraculous cooling of his Furnace, and by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Dream, warned him, and given him one year respite, he had Human Sense taken from him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon his restoring, <hi>Augustine</hi> and others, held him saved.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> succeeded, in whose Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year ended the Fortieth year of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, and now brake the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Yoak under <hi>Amasis</hi> their King. This fell out while <hi>Astyages</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> Grand-Father to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> held War with <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi> and had the better, which embolden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Egypt. Astyages</hi> died in the Ninth year of <hi>Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merodach,</hi> and left the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> in Arms against <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi> whom also they slew.</p>

A conjecture how it might be that in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>'s Seven Years of Madness, <hi>Niglisar</hi> might govern by his Wife <hi>Nitocris</hi>'s means, <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s Daughter and <hi>Labassardach</hi> after him, but slain after Nine Months, presently before <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s Restauration.</p>

               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Cambyses</hi> succeeded his Father; like him only in desire to increase the Empire.

This dumb shew <hi>Darius</hi> took as a yielding him All, even the Elements in which these Creatures live, and their Weapons: But <hi>Gobrias,</hi> one of the Seven Princes, construed their meaning aright, as telling him he cannot escape their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, except by flight, diving, or hiding himself. This they made good, by assailing his Camp, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with continual Alarums; and so fearless, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook his Camp by Night, and hasted to <hi>Ister,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet the <hi>Scythians</hi> came before him, missing him as they came.

               <p n="7">§. 7. These <hi>Grecian</hi> Colonies in the Sea Coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> after Five hundred years Liberty, were brought under by <hi>Croesus,</hi> and fell with him under the <hi>Persian</hi> Yoke, and were by the Practise of <hi>Histiaeus,</hi> put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rebellion, because <hi>Darius</hi> had taken him to <hi>Susa,</hi> and they, under shew of Honour, held him, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his greatness in <hi>Ionia.</hi> This he perceived to be practised with <hi>Aristagoras,</hi> his Cousin and Deputy in <hi>Miletum,</hi> to make a Breach, hoping to be sent to reduce them, as he was. For <hi>Darius</hi> hearing of this Revolt, and of the <hi>Athenians</hi> joining with them, was exceedingly provoked against <hi>Athens,</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by <hi>Hyppias</hi>; as for the <hi>Ionians,</hi> he sent <hi>Histiaeus,</hi> who promised what he intended not; but before his

The <hi>Athenian</hi> Forces were Ten Thousand and One Thousand <hi>Plataeans,</hi> with which coming into the Field, the <hi>Persians</hi> scorned their small numbers, and thought them void of Understanding, to venter into the Field.

The States of <hi>Greece,</hi> which had excessively admired the Valour of <hi>Sparta,</hi> seeing it now to seek Peace, upon Terms not so Honourable, grew to contemn it, as the <hi>Corinthians, Thebans,</hi> &amp;c. who cast their Eyes upon the great Rich City of <hi>Argos,</hi> and conceived great matters of it. This is the common base Condition of the most, who curiously searching into other Mens Vices, cannot discern their Virtues; and comparing our best parts with their first, are justly plagued with false opinion of that good in others, which we know wanting in our selves; the <hi>Corinthians</hi> beginning, complain that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had left some of their Towns in the <hi>Athenians</hi> hands; the <hi>Mantinians</hi> follow, who feared revenge, for that they had drawn some <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi> from the <hi>Spartans,</hi> to follow them. These begin to enter League with the <hi>Argives,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Peloponesus</hi> follow. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> knowing the scope of this new Confederacy, send to <hi>Corinth,</hi> to stop the Matter where it began, charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with their Oath of old Alliance, which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> answer; saying the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64357:143"/>
first broken in concluding with <hi>Athens,</hi> without care of restoring the Towns taken from <hi>Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Corinthians</hi> thereupon enter League with <hi>Argos,</hi> and draw others, only the <hi>Thebans</hi> were not so forward, because <hi>Argos</hi> was a popular State. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> also, for further security, sought Peace with <hi>Athens,</hi> and obtained a Truce, but no League. But in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, as <hi>Athens,</hi> had, by force, gotten an absolute command, and could perform what she promised, so <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which had so many followers, but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, could not do so; as where they should restore <hi>Panacty</hi> held by the <hi>Thebans,</hi> for recovery of <hi>Pylus,</hi> they could not, and so gave discontent to <hi>Athens.</hi> There were also in <hi>Athens, Alcibiades</hi> a young brave Noble-man, and others, as also some in <hi>Sparta</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of War, who promoted the breach of Peace what they could. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> therefore sent to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> which thought not now of superiority, as lately she did, but of Security, advising them to secure-themselves by League with <hi>Athens.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> seeing that <hi>Argos</hi> took that course, sent to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> to stay the proceeding, knowing the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was not for their Wealth; but by a trick of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> lost their labour.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. The <hi>Argives</hi> presuming of their Allies, molest the <hi>Epidaurians,</hi> which the <hi>Spartans</hi> were bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; upon which occasion, the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> collaterally infest each other, and the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Baeotians, Phocians, Locrians,</hi> follow the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> who, in one Victory, recovered much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; so that the Nobles of <hi>Argos</hi> getting the uper-hand of the Citizens, made League with them, renouncing <hi>Athens</hi>; but the People recovering, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed away their Nobles, and reversed all.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>Athens,</hi> in the intermission of open War at home, renew their hopes of subduing <hi>Sicily,</hi> and sent such a Fleet as <hi>Greece</hi> never set out, of which <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades</hi> was one General. <hi>Siracuse</hi> is besieged, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64357:144"/>
by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and the Fleet block'd up in the Haven; neither could <hi>Athens</hi> relieve it through home Factions, whence <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was driven, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish himself; and by this reason <hi>Sparta,</hi> in the absence of their Forces, Invaded <hi>Attica,</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Money.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> also by <hi>Alcibiades</hi>'s Advice (who fled to them) fortifyed <hi>Decelia</hi> near <hi>Athens,</hi> and all the Country about; Yet the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> in their Obstinacy, sent another Fleet, which was quite vanquished in the Haven, and the Army, by Land, utterly over-thrown. This befell the <hi>Athenians</hi> deservedly by <hi>Nicias</hi>'s Resolution, who chose to venture little less than all the Power of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> rather than to incur the <hi>Athenians</hi> Censure upon Return, to be condemned unjustly, as other Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals had been; this Resolution cannot be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, seeing an honest valiant Man should do what Reason directs, and measure Honour and Dishonour by a well-informed Conscience, rather than the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Report and Censure of others; yet it is excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, considering the Peoples Injustice; and knowing an ill Fact is nothing so pernicious as an unjust Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which begun upon one, becomes a President. But his fear to fly, as he thought to do, was ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, because of an Eclipse that day, which made him defer it 'till twenty seven days after, with lamentable effect.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> after this loss had also their Subjects abroad rebellious, and which recovered their long lost Liberty. At home also the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Citizens, wearied with the Peoples Insolency, changed the Government, procuring the Captains abroad to set up an <hi>Aristocracy</hi> in the Towns of their Confederacy, as four hundred usurped it at home. But the Army at <hi>Samos</hi> disliked that usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, and <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who was f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Persian</hi> Vice-Roy, with whom he was grown into such Favour, as he persuaded him to stay his Favour to the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> Yet his Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not confirmed at <hi>Athens,</hi> 'till the four hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wearied with the Troubles of the Times, and not prevailing with <hi>Sparta</hi> for Peace, resigned their Authority to Five thousand, which had been their Assistants, who presently agreed to the revocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him and his Companions.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. After this, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> joining with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Fleet, after an Overthrow of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Fleet, commanded by <hi>Mindarus,</hi> took <hi>Cyzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Perinthus, Chalcedon, Bizantium,</hi> and with this Honour returned to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he was made High-Admiral. But upon a loss of a great part of his Fleet by his Lieutenant in his Absence, fighting contrary to his Commandment, he was again forced to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish himself, to a greater loss to <hi>Athens</hi> than before.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. After this also the <hi>Athenians</hi> Ships in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture, were forced into the Haven of <hi>Mytelene,</hi> where they were beset, so that <hi>Athens</hi> were compelled to Man all their Vessels, to relieve them at <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musae</hi>; yet the ten Captains, which had the Victory of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> were condemned at <hi>Athens</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly, as after appeared.</p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. <hi>Lysander,</hi> with the <hi>Peloponesian</hi> Fleet, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged <hi>Lapsacus</hi>; the <hi>Athenian</hi> Fleet of an hundred Eighty Sail came too late to relieve it; and then put in at <hi>Sestos,</hi> and after at <hi>Aeges-Potamos,</hi> from whence they daily braved <hi>Lysander,</hi> not a League off, and return to <hi>Ages Potamos,</hi> from whence the Men used to go by Land to <hi>Sestos,</hi> leaving the Ships. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> lived near, and saw their negligent endangering the Ships, and gave them warning, which they regarded not; so <hi>Lysander</hi> came suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on them, and overthrew them, went to <hi>Athens</hi> with <hi>Pausanias</hi> and <hi>Agis,</hi> the Two Kings of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and Summoned the City, which refused 'till Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min Forced, which fell on them by the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:64357:145"/>
taking the Islands from them, which used to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. So all her Subject Cities are freed; the Wall, to the Port cast down; her Government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to her own Territories; and she to use but Twelve Ships, and to follow <hi>Sparta</hi> in all Wars. And so ended the <hi>Peloponesian</hi> War, after twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years. Her only hope of Recovery was in <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades,</hi> whose death the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> procured. <hi>Lacedemon</hi> abusing this good Success, grew Odious, so that many Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> combined against her, and <hi>Thebes,</hi> under the leading of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who trained up <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> gave her a great Foil.</p>

               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Athens,</hi> after her Overthrow, had Thirty Governours, called Tyrants, chosen to execute the Law, with supreme Authority. These contriving
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64357:145"/>
to retain that Power, put certain Seditious Fellows to death without Law, which all Men approved, considering their Lewdness, but not that it might prove their own case, if their Governours please to call them Seditious, as it fell out. For their Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sent to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> to desire a Garrison, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cut off the Seditious; but by entertaining the Captain to his liking, they grew bold with the Chief Citizens, and shed much Blood. <hi>Theramenes</hi> one of them, shewing his dislike, after they had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Three thousand Citizens of their liking, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the Government, with priviledge, in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of Death to be tryed by Law, and not at Commandment of the Thirty; they call <hi>Theramenes</hi> in question, as without the priviledge, and put him to death.</p>

               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Cyrus</hi> after such Disgrace from his Brother, who spared his Life only for his Mothers importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of whose Favour he presumed; knowing also the Affections of his People, and presuming upon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> formerly aided by him; thought his Interest to the Crown worth prosecuting. He sends to <hi>Sparta,</hi> which commands their Admiral to be at his command; he seized on some Towns subject to <hi>Tissaphernes</hi>; furnished the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with Money to List Souldiers to be at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; then making a shew of Besieging <hi>Miletus,</hi> he calls over his <hi>Grecian</hi> Forces, and suddainly set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> posting to the Court, his News caus'd great Exclamations and Fear, in which the King gathered his Army of Nine hundred Thousand, with which yet he durst not venture the Tryal. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> which follow <hi>Cyrus</hi> are, with difficulty allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over <hi>Euphrates, &amp;c.</hi> but being over, resolved to find out <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who was retiring to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Border of his Kingdom, had not <hi>Teribazus,</hi> one of his Captains, dissuaded him.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with his Army of One hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, drawing toward his Brother, who had Intrenched Forty Miles in Length, Thirty Foot broad, and Eighteen deep, and yet left it; at length when he thought he had been fled, was forced sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64357:146"/>
to Arm. The <hi>Greeks</hi> not used to incounter such Multitudes, began to distrust their own Courage; yet upon the On-set, found they had to do with so many contemptible Cowards, who fled without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> glad to see it, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon adopted King, yet desires to appear worthy of it, put himself with Six hundred Horse, upon a Squadron of Six thousand which fled before him; and being left by his Followers which pursued the Enemy, he, again spying the King in the midst of his Troops, brake in with a <hi>Iew,</hi> and pierced the King's Curace, but was presently slain, and his Head and right Hand being cut off, were shewed on a Spear Point, recalled thy flying <hi>Persians,</hi> who before were crying on <hi>Cyrus</hi> for Mercy. After this, the King and <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> met, and followed the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which knew not of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Death; who seeing the King following, turned to him. And he, wheeling about, left them, and took an Hill, from which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and then returned to their Quarters.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> could not rejoice in his Success, when he thought what Report the <hi>Greeks</hi> would make of the baseness of his People, which might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>Greeks</hi> to visit his Country with more Force than he would like. The next Morning therefore, when they knew from <hi>Ariaeus</hi> of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s end, he sent <hi>Phalinus</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> unto them, to require their Arms, and to sue for Mercy; which they scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. The <hi>Greeks,</hi> next Night, came to <hi>Ariaeus,</hi> a principal Commander under <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who tarried for them; but Four hundred Foot and 40 Horse, all <hi>Thraconians,</hi> fled to the King <hi>Ariaeus,</hi> who being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by them to make him King, wanted the Courage to venture for it, but was glad to covenant with them for mutual assistance in returning, which he directed. The next day they lighted on the King's Army, which gave them way; yea the King sent to them about a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64357:147"/>
Peace, and appointed them a place where to have Victuals.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> cometh to them like a Fox to entrap them, pretending his Love to them, being Neighbour to <hi>Greece,</hi> and promising his Mediation to the King, if they will send a mild Answer; and to Conduct them home. Hereupon a League is sworn betweeen them, and he returned to the King, and after Twenty days came back to them, and set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The <hi>Greeks</hi> grew jealous of his long stay, and would not have staied, had not <hi>Clearchus</hi> their General persuaded them, relying too much on <hi>Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphernes</hi>'s Oath. <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> after some days March together, found opportunity upon <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> seeking to assure him of the <hi>Greeks</hi> good Will to him (which he seemed to doubt) to draw all their Captains to his Camp, promising to tell them which of them it was which sought secretly to raise dissention between them. Thus having drawn them into his Snare, he sent <hi>Clearchus,</hi> and other four Colonels to the King, but slew the rest; then he sent <hi>Ariaeus</hi> as from the King, to require them to yield, but in vain.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. The <hi>Greeks</hi> amused at the loss of their Leaders, neglected to consult what Supplies to make, 'till <hi>Xenophon,</hi> whose Learning supplyed the want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, awaked them; who thereupon is intreated to take the charge of <hi>Proxenus</hi>'s Regiment and those Captains; <hi>Xenophon</hi> made Slings, took Fifty Horses out of the Carriages, and set Men on their backs; taught the Archers to shoot compass, which they had not used; and thus kept off the <hi>Persian</hi> Archers. Thus their Valour made them way through all difficulties; so that <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> fell to his surest course, to distress them by burning all the Country before them.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:64357:147"/>§. 9. The <hi>Greeks</hi> passing through the <hi>Carduchi,</hi> a Fierce Swift People, and skilful Archers with the Sling, were much troubled with them seven days; and came to <hi>Centriles,</hi> which runneth between them and <hi>Armenia,</hi> where Forces were layed to hinder their Passage; but finding a Ford, they chased away the <hi>Persian</hi> Subjects, and left the <hi>Carduchi,</hi> which seem to have Inhabited the Mountain <hi>Niphates,</hi> not far from <hi>Tygris</hi> Spring; contrary to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who placeth them far East, upon the River <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in <hi>Medea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. The <hi>Greeks</hi> being come to <hi>Armenia,</hi> passed Sixty Miles to the heads of <hi>Tygris,</hi> and as far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond peaceably, 'till <hi>Teribazus</hi> encountred them at the River <hi>Teleboa.</hi> He Governing for the <hi>Persians,</hi> pretended to favour the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them; but in their security lying in wait for them, was discovered by a Souldier, taken by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who found him out on the sudden, and made him leave his Rich Pavilion behind him. Thence they went to the Northward, near the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where they found store of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. The <hi>Greeks</hi> came to the River <hi>Phasis,</hi> and passed those Nations, the <hi>Phasians,</hi> and <hi>Chalybeans</hi>; the first fled with all Provision into strong Holds, of which one was forced, and yielded store of Cattle. The Fierce <hi>Chalybeans</hi> afflicted them much, and fought with them hand to hand; the <hi>Scythians</hi> used them kindly at <hi>Ginias,</hi> whose Governour led them to Mount <hi>Moschici,</hi> whence they saw the <hi>Euxine-Sea.</hi> Then they came to <hi>Trabisond,</hi> or <hi>Trapezus,</hi> a Colonie of <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Colchos,</hi> whose People used them with Hostility, which was well requited, while they rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Trapezus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">§. 12. The <hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>Trabisond</hi> desiring Shipping for their Men's easie Travel, which the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Admiral who lay there promised to provide.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64357:148"/>
But lying long in expectation of Ships, and Victuals failing, they sent their Sick, with Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Baggage by Sea; and the Army being Eight Thousand Six Hundred Men, went by Land to <hi>Cerasus,</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Town, as was <hi>Cotione</hi> their next Lodging, both Colonies from <hi>Sinope,</hi> as was <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pezus.</hi> Here the Inhabitants Discourtesie made the Souldiers to use violence, which the <hi>Sinopians</hi> took ill, and threatned Revenge. <hi>Xenophon</hi> excused it by necessity, which if it would not serve, he shewed how little he fear'd them; upon which considerations they yielded.</p>
               <p n="13">§. 13. <hi>Xenophon,</hi> while Ships are preparing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to build a City thereabouts; which being discovered, they most disliked the Design; and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nope</hi> and <hi>Heraclea</hi> much feared it; and to prevent it, promise both Ships, and Mony. The Ships are sent without Mony, which made the Captains fear a Mutiny, having held the Souldiers in hope of it; but upon coming of <hi>Cherisophus</hi> from the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Admiral, with a few Gallies, and promise of Mony at their arrival in <hi>Greece,</hi> they set out from the Port of <hi>Sinope.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>GReece</hi> understanding the effeminate Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> desired an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of that huge unweildy Empire; but were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by home Distractions through the <hi>Theban</hi> War; which called the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Power out of <hi>Asia. Xenophon</hi>'s retreat from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> four thousand two hundred and eighty one Mile, in one Year and three Months, through Enemies Countries, I know not whether any Age hath parallel'd; <hi>Conon</hi> the <hi>Briton</hi> with six Thousand Men, came home thro' all the breadth of <hi>Italy,</hi> and length of <hi>France,</hi> in despight of the Emperor <hi>Theodosius</hi>; which Retreat was like, rather than equal.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Timbro</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> General in <hi>Asia,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s Men, took in Towns which fell from <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> but for his Oppressions is deposed, and <hi>Dercillidas</hi> a <hi>Spartan</hi> succeeded; who bearing a grudge to <hi>Pharnabasus,</hi> and not favoured by <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> the other <hi>Persian</hi> Governours in lower <hi>Asia,</hi> upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment with <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> entred <hi>Aeolis,</hi> and in few days subdued it; wasted <hi>Bithynia,</hi> took <hi>Atarne,</hi> a strong City, and <hi>Cheronia,</hi> with Eleven Towns in it. Then he was Commanded from <hi>Sparta,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <hi>Caria,</hi> the Seat of <hi>Tissaphernes.</hi> In defence

whereof, <hi>Pharnabasus</hi> joyned with <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> by which means the <hi>Greeks</hi> were over-match'd, being forsaken by the <hi>Ionians</hi> and Islanders; yet <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> feared to Fight, well remembring <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>'s Retreat; and so contrary to <hi>Pharnabazus</hi>'s Councel, a Truce is concluded.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being now at leisure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to revenge some private Wrongs done by the <hi>Eleans,</hi> who were Precedents of the Olympian Games, and accordingly forced them to free the Cities which had been subject to them, and overthrew their Walls. This pretence of Liberty, was their usual ground of Wars; though after that, they made the same Towns little better than Vassals to <hi>Sparta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> newly made King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of the honour of Victory against the <hi>Persians,</hi> with a great Army set forward to <hi>Aulis</hi> in <hi>Baeotia,</hi> to Sacrifice there, as <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had done long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but the <hi>Thebans,</hi> Lords of that Country, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> resented this Contumely, pursued his Enterprize, and landed at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> entertained him with a Treaty of Peace; seeking only to gain time for the better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himself with Men and Mony; which being come, he sent to <hi>Agesilaus</hi> to be gone, or to maintain his Post by force. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> answer'd, <hi>He was glad he had to deal with an Enemy, which by Perjury de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served vengeance from Heaven.</hi> So seeming to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for <hi>Caria,</hi> where <hi>Tissa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King his Master distrusting him,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64357:149"/>
and seeing how odious he was to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> thought fit for procuring Peace, to take off his Head by <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thraustes,</hi> whom he sent to succeed him. Which being done, he sent to <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> to certifie the Author of the War was dead; and that the King was content that the <hi>Greeks</hi> should enjoy their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, paying his Tribute. The Answer is referred to the Council of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and 'till it came, <hi>Agesilaus</hi> is content for Thirty Talents, at his request, to transfer the War against <hi>Pharnabasus.</hi> Thus these Lieutenants valu'd not the King's Affairs further than in their own Provinces; the foolish Custom of those Kings being to be guided by Eunuchs, and Concubines, Rewarding or Punishing the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, as they got, or lost.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> wasteth <hi>Phrygia,</hi> took <hi>Pharnabasus</hi>'s Palace, and drove him out of his Camp, <hi>&amp;c. Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabasus</hi> seeketh some good Composition, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many good Offices done to the State of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> in the Wars with <hi>Athens. Agesilaus</hi> replieth, That having War with his Master, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to offend him; but if he would revolt from the King, they would Establish him a free King over his Province. <hi>Pharnabasus</hi> answering plainly, That while his Master trusted him, he would be their Enemy; but if the Charge were taken from him, he would shift sides, and come over to them. So <hi>Agesilaus</hi> removeth out of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> having made a violent Enemy, of an honourable Friend.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Tithraustes</hi> perceiving <hi>Agesilaus</hi> design'd not to leave <hi>Asia,</hi> took a wise Course, and sent Fifty Talents to be dispersed among the Principal of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and caus'd the <hi>Argives</hi> and <hi>Corinthians</hi> to raise War against <hi>Sparta,</hi> whom they formerly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Quarrel is framed, from the <hi>Locrians</hi> paying a Rent to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> which the <hi>Phocians</hi> claimed, and for which they made a Distress by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; whereupon the <hi>Thebans</hi> invaded <hi>Phocis</hi> in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64357:150"/>
Hostile manner, which flyeth to <hi>Sparta</hi> for aid. The <hi>Spartans</hi> send <hi>Lysander</hi> to raise Men about <hi>Phocis,</hi> and to attend <hi>Pausanias</hi> the other King, with Forces out of <hi>Peloponesus</hi>; but <hi>Corinth</hi> refused to assist. <hi>Thebes</hi> knowing how many Succours <hi>Lacedemon</hi> should have, even of those which affected them little, sent to <hi>Athens</hi> to beg assistance, and obtained it by <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibulus</hi>'s means; who in the time of the Thirty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, being Banish'd, was courteously used at <hi>Thebes,</hi> while <hi>Pausanias</hi> stayed for the Confederates. <hi>Lysan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was slain at the Siege he layed to <hi>Halyartus</hi>; whither after <hi>Pausanias</hi> came, and that the <hi>Athenian</hi> Aid was come to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> he departed; for which he was Condemned, and fled to <hi>Tegea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. The <hi>Thebans</hi> upon this Success, had the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives, Corinths, Eubaeans,</hi> and others, come into Confederation; so that <hi>Sparta</hi> seeing the danger, sent for <hi>Agesilaus. Pharnabasus</hi> considering how much the <hi>Greeks</hi> Division imported the King his Master, as before he had advanced the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Sea-Forces to the Overthrow of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> so now he seeketh to raise the <hi>Athenian,</hi> and break the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who for three Talents had sold his Favour: He therefore furnish'd <hi>Conon,</hi> and the <hi>Athenians</hi> with Eight Ships, and gave him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a great Navy, with which he destroyed the <hi>Spartan</hi> Fleet at <hi>Cnidus,</hi> in requital of the loss of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Navy at <hi>Aegos Potamos,</hi> surpriz'd by <hi>Lysander. Conon</hi> thus return'd to <hi>Athens,</hi> with a strong Navy, and much Gold.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for some years sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their Reputation by some Victories gotten by <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> 'till <hi>Iphicrates</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> General, gain'd a great Victory over them at <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> and that by <hi>Pharnabasus</hi>'s persuasion; promising them to Rule by their own Laws. The Cities in <hi>Asia</hi> expelled the <hi>Spartan</hi> Governours, <hi>Abidos</hi> only excepted; and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64357:150"/>
                  <hi>Thrasibulus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> with a Fleet had taken <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium, Chalcedon, Lesbos,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> not able to maintain War against Men as good as themselves, assisted with <hi>Persian</hi> Treasure, crave Peace with <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> offering to leave the <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> to him, and set the Islands and Towns in <hi>Greece</hi> all free; so that <hi>Greece</hi> should never be able to molest the King. This Offer was not accepted, so War is continued in <hi>Asia</hi> against <hi>Strutha,</hi> the King's Lieutenant there, and in <hi>Greece</hi> among themselves; but by means of <hi>Antalcidas</hi> the King, they made Peace.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. <hi>Olynthus,</hi> a strong City in <hi>Thrace,</hi> grew formidable to their Neighbours, having subjected divers Cities, which made the rest, even in <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to crave aid of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which brought it under; and in their way <hi>Thebes</hi> is surprized by Treason.</p>
               <p n="11">§. 11. <hi>Thebes</hi> recovered by a Plot layed by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Banished Citizens, and <hi>Phylladas</hi> a Scribe of the Town; who, at a Feast promising to bring them the Choice Women of the Town to the Embraces of the Attenders, brought the Banish'd in Womens Attire, being come secretly, who slew them, and freed the City.</p>

               <p n="1">§. 1. THE <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were Stout and Grave in all Proceedings, but dishonourable in neglecting all Respects, which hinder'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of <hi>Sparta,</hi> which often brought them shame and loss, when the execution was committed to weak conceited Men. Thus <hi>Thebes</hi> began to hold
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64357:151"/>
them hard to it, and <hi>Athens</hi> began to surround <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponesus</hi> with their Navy. But <hi>Athens</hi> seeing <hi>Thebes</hi> to incroach on her weak Neighbours, of which, some were Dependents on them, whom yet they could not succour, being engaged in such Wars, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to make Peace in <hi>Greece,</hi> according to the Form <hi>Antalcidas</hi> brought from <hi>Persia.</hi> The <hi>Thebans</hi> being sent to, agree, and meet at <hi>Sparta</hi> with the rest; where being required to subscribe to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Boeotians, Epaminondas</hi> required that <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> should do the same for <hi>Laconia,</hi> being no more subject to <hi>Sparta,</hi> than <hi>Boeotia</hi> to <hi>Thebes. Agesilaus</hi> hating <hi>Thebes,</hi> did thereupon, passionately dash the name of <hi>Thebes</hi> out of the League; and in hast sent <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> one of their Kings, with all his Power, who was slain at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> and the Flower of the Army; after which loss, <hi>Sparta</hi> never recover'd it self; but <hi>Thebes</hi> grew to such Command, that in a short time, they brought Seventy Thousand strong to the Gates of <hi>Sparta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. The <hi>Athenians</hi> taking upon them to manage the Peace, calling the Deputies of all the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Estates, conclude the general Liberty of all Towns small and great. The <hi>Mantuans</hi> hereupon build their Town which <hi>Sparta</hi> had forced them to demolish, and allie themselves with such <hi>Arcadian</hi> Towns as most hated <hi>Sparta.</hi> But by a Faction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> are called in, and <hi>Agesilaus</hi> led them, but effected little. <hi>Epaminandos</hi> of <hi>Thebes</hi> assisted, with divers other Countries, which followed <hi>Thebes,</hi> joyning with the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> ravag'd <hi>Laconia,</hi> where since the <hi>Dorians</hi> entred, Six Hundred past, where never Enemies set foot, yet durst not the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> come out of <hi>Sparta</hi> to succour it; so he re-built <hi>Messene,</hi> long ago destroyed by <hi>Sparta,</hi> calling home the old Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:64357:151"/>§. 3. <hi>Sparta</hi> after this, required no more the leading of the Army, or other Precedency, only the <hi>Athenians</hi> yielded them the Leading by Land every Five Days successively with them; a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vain Ambition, as the next Invasion of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponesus</hi> shewed. And this Example bred the like emulation in the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who thereupon will have their turn to lead with the <hi>Thebans</hi>; which Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency bred suspicion in the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and Hatred in the rest; so that in the next Enterprize of the <hi>Spartans</hi> upon them, their Conceits overthrew them.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> misfortune rejoyced the <hi>Thebans,</hi> as without whose aid Enterprizes proved ill, and by whom the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were kept under; the <hi>Thessalians</hi> were protected, and the <hi>Macedonian</hi> quarrels so moderated, that <hi>Philip</hi> Son of <hi>Amyntas</hi> was committed to them as an Hostage. In this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation (little short of a general Command of all <hi>Greece</hi>) they sent Famous <hi>Pelopidas</hi> to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> for his Alliance, which he granted, rejecting the contrary Suits of the other <hi>Grecian</hi> States, who had been very incommodious to him, and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, where <hi>Thebes</hi> had always shewed good affection to <hi>Persia.</hi> Besides, as they were no Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and so the less to be doubted in <hi>Asia,</hi> so their strength might secure him against the rest, who now might much molest him in the Revolt of all his Maritime Provinces, by sending them aid, without which he easily reduced them; for the time set by Divine Providence for the <hi>Persians</hi> Fall was not yet come. The <hi>Thebans</hi> thus made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors of the common Peace by the King, yet got nothing, the other Estates refusing.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Thebes</hi> being grown by the mutual envy of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta,</hi> which being brought low, are glad to combine against her; all the other Estates of <hi>Greece</hi> are divided between them. The
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64357:152"/>
                  <hi>Arcadians</hi> had renounced the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> their old Leaders, and are become doubtful Adherents to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> without whose consent they had made Peace with the <hi>Athenians. Epaminondas</hi> therefore with the <hi>Thebans</hi> thought to invade <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> before the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi> turned Enemies, and while <hi>Corinth</hi> in their way stood Neutral, and the <hi>Arcadians</hi> were yet in disorder, and had sent to <hi>Thebes</hi> to complain of the Captains in <hi>Tegea.</hi> This Complaint was answered, <hi>That their Peace with Athens was the Cause; but</hi> Epaminondas <hi>would come by them, and prove their Fidelity by their aid in his intended War.</hi> The <hi>Arcadians</hi> amaz'd at this Answer, send to <hi>Athens</hi> for help, and to <hi>Sparta,</hi> offering to help against the Invasion; who kindly accepted it, not standing upon point of Leading.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> besides great Forces raised out of other parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> had all the strength the <hi>Argives</hi> and <hi>Messenians</hi> could make; and while he stayed at <hi>Nemia,</hi> intercepted Intelligence that the <hi>Athenian</hi> Forces which he meant to encounter, would come by Sea. Thereupon he decamp'd, and march'd to <hi>Tegea,</hi> who with the most of <hi>Arcadia</hi> declare themselves his. The common Opinion was, that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> would first attempt the revolted <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians,</hi> therefore the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Captains fortifie <hi>Mantinaea,</hi> and send for <hi>Agesilaus</hi> from <hi>Sparta,</hi> with the small Forces that were there; so that <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> with speed and secrecy marching to <hi>Sparta,</hi> had surpriz'd it, had not <hi>Agesilaus</hi> returned with precipitation, upon Intelligence by an unknown Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> disappointed of this hope, is presented with another; conceiving the <hi>Mantineans</hi> now fearing no danger, would disperse themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Fields about their Harvest; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon sent his Horsemen before to interrupt them. But the <hi>Athenians</hi> coming thither, think to meet their Confederates, rescued the distressed <hi>Mantineans</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:64357:152"/>
in the Fields, and presently after came all the <hi>Boeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> Power, and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and their Friends were at hand.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> failing in both these Attempts, to prevent the decay of the Terrour of his Name in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> resolved to check their Courage in the first growth, and to leave a Memorable Character of this Expedition. Having therefore warned his Men to prepare to fight for the Sovereignty of all <hi>Greece,</hi> he made shew to the Enemy by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching, to decline them, so to allay their heat, and breed security, wherein he might suddenly strike amazement in them, by breaking in, as it hapned. The <hi>Thebans</hi> had the Honour of the Day, by forcing all their Enemies out of the Field, but lost their incomparable Commander <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,</hi> by the stroak of a Dart in his Breast, of which he died when the Truncheon was pulled out; but first advised the <hi>Thebans</hi> to make Peace, as wanting a General, when he heard that <hi>Lobidas</hi> and <hi>Diophantes,</hi> two Principal Men of War were slain. Thus died the Worthiest Man that ever <hi>Greece</hi> bred, and hardly matched in any Age or Country.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. The <hi>Mantinean</hi> Battle was the greatest that had been ever in the Country of Natives, in which all <hi>Greece</hi> were interessed, which never had better Souldiers, or braver Commanders. The issue made all willing of a General Peace, wherein was concluded every Estate should enjoy what it then held, and none forced to depend on other; the <hi>Messenians</hi> being included in this League, for which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> refuse it. After this, <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Sparta</hi> had leisure to seek Wealth in foreign Wars, as did <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> who sent to assist <hi>Tachos</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> descended from <hi>Amyrtaeus,</hi> who rebelled against <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi> But <hi>Agesilaus</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:64357:153"/>
Trayterously fled from the King, to his Rebels, so that he was forced to flye to <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Nectanebus</hi> succeeded, who Rewarded <hi>Agesilaus</hi> with two Hundred and Thirty Talent of Silver; with which, returning home, he died.</p>

Then hasting to <hi>Thessalia,</hi> his South Neighbour, he took <hi>Larissa</hi> upon the River <hi>Peneus</hi>; but before he would proceed with <hi>Thessaly,</hi> he made sure of the entrance out of <hi>Thrace,</hi> winning <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> seated upon the bordering River; he also recovered <hi>Pydna,</hi> and <hi>Crenidus,</hi> which he called <hi>Phillipi.</hi> He also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred League with the <hi>Olynthians,</hi> his Father's mortal Enemies, and gave them <hi>Pydna,</hi> yet not designing they should hold it, or their own.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Philip</hi> by the <hi>Phocian</hi> or Sacred War, in the second year of the hundred and sixth Olympiad, was drawn into <hi>Greece.</hi> This War grew by occasion that the <hi>Phocians</hi> having Plowed up one piece of ground belonging to <hi>Delphos</hi>'s Temple, were by the <hi>Thebans</hi> prosecution fined a great Summ at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of <hi>Greece,</hi> and for refusing, are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Sword.

               <p>Therefore having overthrown them twice, and forced them to keep their City, he corrupted two Citizens, which gave him entrance; where he slew his Brethren, and sold the Citizens for Slaves.

               <p n="1">§. 1. <hi>ALexander</hi> succeeded <hi>Philip</hi> his Father after Twenty Five Years Reign; being a Prince no less Valiant by Nature, than by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enriched with all sorts of good Learning. He entred upon his Reign Four Hundred and Seventeen Years after <hi>Rome</hi>'s Building, being Twenty Years Old; which young Years encouraged his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations to consult about recovery of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which he prevented with much Expedition.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64357:156"/>
For after Revenge of his Father's death, and freeing his own Nation from all Exactions, and Bodily Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and winning with Clemency, such as feared his Disposition to Cruelty, and using Austerity to such as contemned his Youth, He made a Journey into <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> and so well exercised his Spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that by the Councel of the State of <hi>Greece,</hi> he was Elected General- against the <hi>Persians,</hi> which Enterprize possessed all his Thoughts. But the <hi>Persian</hi> Gold having guilt <hi>Demosthenes</hi>'s Tongue, he persuaded the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> to stand for their Ancient Liberty, and gave it out that <hi>Alexander</hi> was slain. Indeed Policy, as it is now a-days, defined by Fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hood and Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, holding, that devised Rumours and Lyes, tho' they serve the turn but for a day or two, are greatly available; but in all my Observations I have found the Success as ridiculous as the Invention; for Men finding themselves abused by such Baits, at other times neglect true Reports, which much concerneth them to believe. <hi>Alexander</hi> much grieved to have his Thoughts diverted, and time lost from his <hi>Persian</hi> Enterprize, made such expedition, that he brought the first News himself of his preparation to <hi>Athens,</hi> which, as upon a sudden fainting, presently submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and easily pardoned, by persuasion of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s desire to see <hi>Persia</hi>; as Wise Men are not easily drawn from great Purposes, nor by occasion easily put off. Then he subdued the Nations bordering North of <hi>Macedon</hi>; but yet could not get out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> 'till he had demolish'd <hi>Thebes,</hi> which attempted his Garison in the Citadel, and obstinately refused to yield up the Authors of their Rebellion.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Alexander</hi> having without cause given, put to death his Mother-in-Laws Kinsmen, advanced by his Father, and some of his own, whom he suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; took also with him into <hi>Asia</hi> such Tributary Princes as he doubted, by unjust Cruelty to secure
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64357:156"/>
all things; yet the End fell out contrary to the Policy which Ambition commended to him; all his Planting was soon rooted up; whom he most trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were the most Traiterous, and his Mother, Friends, and Children fell by as merciless a Sword as his own, and Confusion left his dead Body in the Grave. He passed into <hi>Asia</hi> with Thirty Two Thousand Foot, and Five Thousand Horse, all Old Souldiers, which he landed near <hi>Troy</hi>; where at the River of <hi>Granick,</hi> he was forced to climb up the deep Bank, guarded against him with many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Persians</hi>; of whom he slew Twenty Thousand Foot, and Two Thousand Five Hundred Horse. But this slaughter must be taken rather on the Back than the Breast; for had they stood to it, <hi>Alexander</hi> must needs have lost above Twenty Thousand Foot, and Two Thousand Five Hundred Horse, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the <hi>Persian</hi> Horsemen had fought fiercely; and the <hi>Grecians</hi> in <hi>Darius</hi>'s Pay fought it out to the last Man, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> Reports.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Souldiers were greatly encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by winning this Passage; and all the Country so terrified, that all the lesser <hi>Asia</hi> yielded without a Blow. For in all Invasions, where the Invaded are beaten, upon great advantage of place, they will easily be persuaded that such an Enemy upon equal terms can hardly be resisted; the Assailant therefore in such Cases of defending Places, is to be opposed with the ablest Forces; yet fewest Places of great circuit are so fenced, wherein one Entrance or other is not to be forced by an able Enemy; as the <hi>Alps,</hi> wherein <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King found entrance to <hi>Milan,</hi> though the <hi>Switzers</hi> guarded them; <hi>Xerxes</hi> forced the entrance at <hi>Thermopylae; Cyrus</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and <hi>Alexander,</hi> found the Gates of <hi>Taurus</hi> open into <hi>Cilicia; Iulius Agricola</hi> found Fords into <hi>Anglesey,</hi> which made the amazed <hi>Britains</hi> submit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was therefore well done of <hi>Alexander,</hi> to pass the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64357:157"/>
River in the Face of their Enemies, without seeking an easier Passage, beating off the Enemy in their strength, leaving no hope of Succour to their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, in so unable Protectors. After this, <hi>Sardis, Ephesus, Trallis,</hi> and <hi>Magnesia,</hi> yielded them selves, and so enjoyed their own Laws; but he demolish'd <hi>Halicarnassus,</hi> for its obstinate resistance. Then he entred <hi>Caria,</hi> and restored <hi>Ada</hi> the Queen, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Darius</hi>'s Lieutenant, and <hi>Lycia, Pamphylia, Pisidia,</hi> and all the Sea-Coasts of lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> and then entred <hi>Celenas</hi> on <hi>Meander,</hi> and so through <hi>Phrygia</hi> toward the <hi>Euxine-Sea,</hi> and so to <hi>Gordium,</hi> where he cut th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Gordian-Knot asunder. He also expelled the <hi>Persians</hi> out of the Isles of <hi>Lesbos, Scio,</hi> and <hi>Coas,</hi> which he committed to two of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, to clear the Sea-Coast on his back, and then remov'd to <hi>Ancira</hi> on the River <hi>Sangarius,</hi> as is <hi>Gordium,</hi> and so to <hi>Paphlagonia.</hi> Here he heard of the death of <hi>Menon, Darius</hi>'s Lieutenant, which much heartened him, being the only Captain he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected of all his Enemies. For so much hath the Spirit of some one Man excelled, as it hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and effected the alteration of the greatest States, as the erection of Monarchs, Conquest of Kingdoms, guiding handfuls of Men against Multitudes of equal bodily strength, contriving Victories beyond all hope and Discourse of Reason, converting the fearful Passions of his own Followers into Magnanimity, and the Valour of his Enemies into Cowardize. Such Spirits have been stirred up in sundry Ages to erect and cast down, and to bring all Things, Persons, and States, to the same certain ends which that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Spirit of the Universe, Piercing, Moving, and Governing All Things hath ordained, as which is seen in this King's Undertaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a Spirit like his own, was opposed only with difficulties of Passages, and tedious Journies; and certainly the things performed by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> discover as brave a Spirit as <hi>Alexander</hi>'s, working no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64357:157"/>
less exquisitely, though the effects were less mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, as were the Forces and Power of Commanders by which it wrought. But he who would find the exact Pattern of a Noble Commander, must look upon such as <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> that in courting Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Captains, better followed than themselves, have by their singular Vertue over-top'd them, that would not have yielded one foot to another. Such as these seldom obtain to great Empires, seeing it is harder to master the equal Forces of one hardy well-order'd State, than an unweildy Empire of many servile Nations; and that only Brave Roman <hi>Caesar</hi> is the Example, whose exquisite managing attained the Greatness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> hasteth to the Streights of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to prevent <hi>Darius,</hi> which <hi>Arsenes</hi> the Governour had left to a weak Guard, which abandoned it, when he pretending to wast the Country, withdrew himself further off; so the Province came easily into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>'s Power.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Darius</hi> approached with his Army of more than Two Hundred and Ninety Thousand of divers Nations, saith <hi>Curtius</hi>; Four Hundred Thousand after <hi>Iustine,</hi> and Six Hundred Thousand in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch. Curtius</hi> describeth the manner of his coming with such Pompous Riches, Gorgeous Apparel, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant of his Gods, Train of Ladies attending his Mother, Wife, Children, with their Nurses, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs, Concubines, all sumptuously Apparel'd; with Six Hundred Mules, and Three Hundred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels laden with Treasure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such was the Train of this May-game King; so unmarshalled, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, unarmed, but with Gold and glittering Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as would have encouraged the nakedest Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World against them. We find by common Experience, that no discourse of Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, National Vertue, Religion, or Liberty, and whatsoever else is wont to encourage Vertuous
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64357:158"/>
Men, hath any force with the Common Souldier, in Comparison of Spoil and Riches. Rich Ships are Boarded upon all disadvantages, Rich Towns furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously assaulted, and plentiful Countries willingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded. War is willingly made, and for the most part, with good success against the Richest Nations. For as the needy are adventurous, so Plenty is wont to shun Peril; and Men which are well to live, do rather study to live Wealthy, than care to dye Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; for no Man hasteth to the Market, where nothing is to be bought but Blows. This Battle at <hi>Issus</hi> is no where well described; but we may guess what resistance was made, if it be true that <hi>Curtius</hi> saith, that of the <hi>Persians</hi> were slain Two Hundred Thousand, and of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> but Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Eighty; of which number, <hi>Arianus</hi> and others cut off almost half; so that it seemeth these died rather by over-labour, in killing, than being killed. <hi>Darius</hi> found it true now, what <hi>Charedemus</hi> a Banished <hi>Athenian</hi> told him near <hi>Babylon,</hi> That his rich delicate confused Multitude, would be more fearful to the Countries through which they should pass, than to the Long-trained <hi>Macedonians,</hi> against whom it were fitter to oppose a competent number of <hi>Grecians</hi> of equal Courage, having such abundance of Treasure to do it; for which unpleasing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, the poor <hi>Greek</hi> was slain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Desperate is that Princes safety, whose Ear judgeth what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, to be too sharp, and will entertain nothing that is unpleasant. For Liberty in Council is the life of it, which vanisheth if it be taken away. The like Advice was given by the <hi>Grecians</hi> which served un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, which he set light by, who intreated him not to fight in the Streights, but to retire into the Plains of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where he might environ all the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> and to divide his Army into Parts, not committing the Whole to one stroak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that Infinite Wisdom of God, which worketh diversly,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64357:158"/>
doth often in the alteration of Kingdoms and States, take Understanding from Governours; not to discern of Counsel. <hi>Alexander,</hi> by Advice of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> stayed in a place where <hi>Darius</hi> could bring no more Hands to fight than he, and utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him, took his Treasure, Wife, Mother, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Train of Ladies, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to leave at <hi>Babylon</hi>; and <hi>Darius</hi> casting off his Crown, hardly escaped. Yet, after this, he writ to <hi>Alexander</hi> about ransoming his Women, and some proud Conditions of Peace, which he scorned. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> after the Victory, made <hi>Parmenio</hi> Governour of all <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> which presently submitted; <hi>Zidon</hi>'s Kingdom, committed to <hi>Hephestion,</hi> he gave to a Day Labourer of the Royal Blood, who desired he might bear his Prosperity, as well as he had done his Adversity.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Alexander</hi> coming near <hi>Tyre,</hi> received from them a Crown of Gold, and store of Victuals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Presents; but could not be admitted into the City as he desired, to offer Sacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> 'till he erected a Cause-way from the Main, Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Furlongs to it, which he did in Seven Months. He put Eight Thousand to the Sword, Crucifyed two Thousand on the Shore, and made Thirteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Slaves, for that they had barbarously drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Messengers. The Government he gave to <hi>Philotus,</hi> Son of <hi>Parmenio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Darius</hi> sendeth again to stay his passage on toward the East, laying down the difficulties, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to compass him in the Plain Countries, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him his Daughter and many Kingdoms for Dowry: <hi>Alexander</hi> answered, he offer'd him what was his own; that he was to give, not to take Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; and disdained all resistances at Rivers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving past the Sea. <hi>Parmenio,</hi> full of Years, Honour and Wealth, told <hi>Alexander,</hi> if he were <hi>Alexander,</hi> he would accept his Offer: <hi>So would I,</hi> said he, <hi>If I
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64357:159"/>
were</hi> Parmenio. <hi>Alexander</hi> proceeded to <hi>Gaza,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by <hi>Belis</hi> for <hi>Darius,</hi> with much Resolution, where he buried many <hi>Macedonians</hi> in the Sands, and was wounded in the Breast; yet took the Town and caused <hi>Belis</hi> to be drawn about it, being weak by many Wounds, defending that Cruelty by <hi>Achilles</hi>'s usage of <hi>Hector.</hi> From thence he went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where <hi>Iaddus</hi> the High Priest in his Robes met him, whom he fell down before, remembring he had in <hi>Macedon</hi> seen such a Priest, which professed the same God, and incouraged him in his purpose for <hi>Persia</hi>; so he gave the Jews what Immunities they desired.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>Alexander</hi> turned from thence towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>Astaces,</hi> Lieutenant unto <hi>Darius,</hi> delivered <hi>Memphis</hi> into his Hands, with 800 Talents of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. There doating after Deities, he took a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Journey to visit <hi>Iupiter Hamon,</hi> through the dangerous Sands, that the lying Oracle, might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Son, and so to be Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.

               <p n="21">§. 21. <hi>Alexander</hi> having overthrown <hi>Porus,</hi> and hearing by these <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, that one <hi>Agamenes,</hi> beyond <hi>Ganges,</hi> commanding many Nations, was the powerfullest King of all these Regions, and able to bring into the Field, Two hundred thousand Foot, three hundred Elephants, twenty thousand Horse, and two thousand armed Chariots, was much inflamed to proceed, but all the Art he had, could not persuade the Souldiers thereto; only they are content to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to the South, having <hi>Indus</hi> for his guide.</p>
               <p>So he returned to <hi>Acesines,</hi> intending to lay up his Fleet, where it encountreth <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> by which two Rivers, he built two Cities, <hi>Nicae</hi> and <hi>Bucepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> Here he intended a fourth supply of six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse-men, and seven thousand Foot out of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and twenty five thousand Rich Armour from <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he distributed among the Souldiers.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64357:164"/>
Hereabout he won many Towns, received One hundred Embassadors from an <hi>Indian</hi> King, with a Present of three hundred Horses, one hundred thirty Waggons, and one thousand Targets. Sailing Southward by many obscure Nations, among them he built another <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and took, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, one called <hi>Samus,</hi> whose Inhabitants fought with poisoned Swords. Being come to the out-let of <hi>Indus,</hi> he sent to discover the Coast along toward the Mouth of <hi>Euphrates.</hi> After part of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spent here, he marched in Eighteen Days to <hi>Gedrosia,</hi> in which Passage, his Army suffered such Misery for want of Food, that not the fourth part returned alive.</p>
               <p n="22">§. 22. <hi>Alexander</hi> came to <hi>Carmania,</hi> and drawing near <hi>Persia,</hi> he fell to imitate <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Triumphs in Cups, which Swinish hateful Vice, always inflamed him to Cruelty. For the Hang-man followed the Feast, saith <hi>Curtius,</hi> and <hi>Apastes,</hi> a Provincial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, was slain by his Commandment. Here <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and his Fellows employed in the Murder of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> brought him a supply of Five thousand Foot, and one thousand Horse, but upon complaint of their Out-rages, <hi>Cleander</hi> and the rest, with six hundred Souldiers, were commended to the Hang-man, to the joy of all. <hi>Alexander</hi> removed and came to <hi>Pasargada,</hi> where <hi>Cyrus</hi> was buried, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with many rich Gifts by <hi>Orsines,</hi> a Prince of the Race of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> put to Death, by the practice of <hi>Bagoas</hi> one his of Eunuchs, because he was neglected of him; the Accusation that he had robbed <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s his Tomb, was from Two loose Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. <hi>Phrates</hi> also was slain upon suspicion of his Greatness; so headlong was he become to shed Blood, and believe false Reports. <hi>Calanus</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, burnt himself, being Seventy three years old, fore-telling <hi>Alexander</hi> of his own Death shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Alexander</hi> removed to <hi>Susa,</hi> where he Married
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64357:165"/>
                  <hi>Statira, Darius</hi>'s Eldest Daughter, and her Sister he gave to <hi>Hephestion,</hi> and Eighty Persian Ladies to his Captains; and at the Marriage hé gave Six thousand Cups of Gold to so many Guests. <hi>Harpalus</hi> his Treasurer in <hi>Babylon</hi> having been lavish of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, fled away with five thousand Talents, and six thousand hired Souldiers, but was taken and slain in <hi>Greece,</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s great Joy. Great discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grew in his Army, knowing his purpose to send his decay'd Souldiers to <hi>Macedon,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the rest, whom he labour'd to pacify in vain, 'till their Passions were evaporated; when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate Multitude may be led as a Whale, with a twined Thread, is drawn to Land after some tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. <hi>Craterus</hi> is sent with those which were Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to return, and made Lieutenant of <hi>Macedon, Thrace</hi> and <hi>Thessaly,</hi> which place <hi>Antipater,</hi> now sent for by the King, had held with great Fidelity. <hi>Antipater</hi> could see no reason of his removal, but a disposition in the King to send him after <hi>Parmenio.</hi> With this <hi>Antipater,</hi> the King, for all his great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, had no great Appetite to grapple; for Jealous Princes do not always stand in doubt of every ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, though Valiant Man, but where there is a Kingly Courage compounded of Hardiness and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; this is often so fearful to Kings, as they take leave, both of Law and Religion, to free themselves of such. <hi>Alexander</hi> after this, went to <hi>Media</hi> to set things in Order, where <hi>Hephestion,</hi> his greatest Favourite dyed; on whose Monument, he bestowed Twelve thousand Talents. The King took Methods to make all Men weary of his Government, seeing Cruelty is more fearful than any Adventure that can be made against it. <hi>Antipater</hi> therefore came not, nor sent any Excuse, but free'd himself by his Sons, <hi>Cassander, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Lollaus,</hi> who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the King's Cup. These, at a drinking Feast, in a Carouse in <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Cup, gave him a Draught
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64357:165"/>
of Drink stronger than <hi>Hercules</hi> himself; so he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the World within a few days. Princes seldom find advantage by making their Ministers over-great, and thereby suspicious to themselves. For he which doth not acknowledge Fidelity to be a Debt, but that Kings ought to purchase it of their Vassals, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver please himself with the Price given; only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storative indeed that strengthens it, is the Goodness and Vertue of the Prince, and his Liberality makes it more diligent. <hi>Antipater</hi> had Govern'd two or three Kingdoms Twelve years, and peradventure knew not to play another part, as <hi>Caesar</hi> which forgot the Art of Obedience, after long governing the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">§. 23. <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Cruelty and Pride is inexcusable; his Drunkenness no less. <hi>Augustine</hi> justly derided his lamenting want of Employment, when he should have no more to Conquer; as if well to Govern the Conquered, would not sufficiently busie his Brain. His Valour, a Thousand in his Army Matched. His Liberality <hi>Seneca</hi> Taxeth, and his Speech about a Kings gift is Foolish. Compared with other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the World. <hi>Caesar,</hi> and others after more glorious; for he never undertook Warlike Nations.</p>

                  <hi>ALexander</hi> in his stubborn Pride, refused to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish any Successor; esteeming none Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; and the greatest Ambition of his Followers Learned of their Master to endure no Equals; a Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son soon taken out by Spirits reflecting upon their own Worth, wanting the Reverence of a greater Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Thus the Question of the Succession became difficult. <hi>Alexander</hi> having no Issue but by <hi>Barsinoe</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:64357:166"/>
a <hi>Persian,</hi> and <hi>Roxane,</hi> of mean Condition, both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against as of Conquered Nations. <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip,</hi> who gave his Mother <hi>Barsinoe</hi> great with Child to <hi>Lagus,</hi> is of opinion, the Rule should rest in the Captains, to order it by Voices. <hi>Aristonus</hi> another Captain, propounded <hi>Perdicas,</hi> as designed Successor by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who at the point of death, left his Kingdom to the worthiest, and delivered his Ring to him; who had succeeded his Favourite <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phestion</hi> in Favour and Place, he being urged by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to take the Royal Estate upon him, not content with the Souldiers acclamation, of a counterfeit Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, put it off, looking that every one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would intreat him, that so his Acceptance might be the less Envied. But as he which feigns a sleep may be eaten with a Wolf; so <hi>Meleager</hi> his Enemy, took advantage of his Irresolution, and acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; concluded, that whoever were Heir to the Crown, the Souldiers ought to Inherit the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to that which he invited them, who were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing backward in sharing it.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> a Natural Brother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in this Uproar, is named by some one, liked by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and produced, and commended by <hi>Meleager</hi> to the Army, which changeth his Name to <hi>Philip,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesteth him in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Robes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proclaims him King, contrary to the Mind of many of the Nobles, who yet by the intercession of the Ancient Captains, are reconciled, though neither side meant faithfully.

The Camp hearing of this Attempt, fell into an Uproar, which the King their Creature could not appease, 'till offered to resign unto them; so upon the King's motion, after sundry Embassies between
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64357:166"/>
him and his Nobles. <hi>Meleager</hi> is joined with <hi>Leona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Perdicas</hi> in Government of the Army; so much Love is protested, where none is meant. For presently after, upon Rumors against <hi>Perdicas,</hi> purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raised, as if they proceeded from <hi>Meleager,</hi> to make him guilty of seditious Rumours, if he should give way thereto; He, to prevent the danger, persuades <hi>Perdicas</hi> to a general Muster, for cleansing the Army by punishing seditious Persons and other Offenders, not in the least intending his special Friends, and such as followed him, when he disturbed the Election of a King, by calling away Souldiers to the sharing of the Treasure. The manner of this Muster is solemn, having the Horsemen, among whom the King must ride, the Elephants, the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Foot, and Mercenaries set in Batalia in distinct parties, so as to skirmish by way of Exercise. The <hi>Macedonian</hi> Pikes (called the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx</hi>) led by <hi>Meleager,</hi> is placed at disadvantage, and so charged by the Horse-men and Elephants, as afforded no jesting; and the King being now in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicas</hi>'s possession, must command to be delivered to death, such of the Infantry as <hi>Perdicas</hi> required. Thus Three hundred of <hi>Meleager</hi>'s Friends and Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are cast to the Elephants to be slain; and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leager</hi> flying to a Temple for Sanctuary, having too late discovered the Design, was there also slain. The Princes held a new Counsel, divide the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among themselves, leave <hi>Aridaeus</hi> the Office of a Visitor, and <hi>Perdicas</hi> his Protector, and Commander of his Forces; and gave <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> a Captain, the Charge to bury the Corps of <hi>Alexander,</hi> at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander,</hi> in his life time, knowing the factious quality of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> had commanded that all the banished should be restored, thinking, by them, to have a sure Party in every City; but by that proud Injunction, contrary to their Laws, lost the Hearts of the rest, who esteemed it a beginning of open Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64357:167"/>
The <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Aetolians</hi> who oppos'd this Decree, upon <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death, Proclaim War against the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and by <hi>Leosthenes</hi> their Captain, who called in the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> overthrew the <hi>Boeotians</hi> which sided with <hi>Antipater,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Alexander. Antipater</hi> doubting his own strength, sent to <hi>Craterus</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> whose coming into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> had so troubled his Thoughts but a Month be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So vain are the Hopes and Fears of Men, which decree all by mortal Wisdom, shunning and persuing their Destiny afar off, even when it seems near at hand. <hi>Craterus</hi> and the Captains in <hi>Asia,</hi> nearest to <hi>Europe,</hi> are solicited to make haste; for <hi>Antipater</hi> could raise in <hi>Macedon</hi> but Thirteen Thousand raw Souldiers, and six hundred Horse, besides the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salian</hi> brave Troops. Whereas <hi>Leosthenes</hi> brought into the Field twenty two thousand Foot, and two thousand five hundred Horse, besides many Auxila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which came in. But before <hi>Craterus</hi> came, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater</hi> ventred a Battle, which he lost, and was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into <hi>Lamia,</hi> a fortifyed and well provided Town to endure a Siege, which <hi>Leosthenes</hi> presented him with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Perdicas,</hi> Protector of <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> had no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Province, but greater Forces than any, with which, and his Marriage with <hi>Cleopatra, Alexander</hi>'s Sister, he hoped for greater Matters. He first subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which had never submitted to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and committed it to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> whom he trusted above all Men.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Antipater</hi> having in vain expected his <hi>Asian</hi> Succours, offered to yield upon Terms of Reason, but <hi>Leosthenes</hi> will have an absolute yielding; which the other, having been his Commander, refused; so the Siege is delayed 'till the <hi>Aetolians</hi> grew weary and departed, so that the Trenches were thinly Mann'd. Upon this advantage, <hi>Antipater</hi> sallied out, and slew many, and <hi>Leosthenes</hi> himself; but yet was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64357:167"/>
of the Siege. <hi>Leonatus,</hi> in the mean time, is persuaded to hasten to it with twenty Thousand Foot, and Two thousand five hundred Horse out of <hi>Phrygia</hi> the lesser, which he willingly undertook for <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s sake, which sent for him to <hi>Pella</hi> in <hi>Macedon.</hi> But <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Leosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> raised his Siege, and went to meet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Antipater</hi> and he joined, and obtain'd a great Victory, and the greater by <hi>Leonatus</hi>'s Death. The vanquished <hi>Macedonians,</hi> too proud to fly, and weak to renew the Fight, betook them to high grounds, 'till the day following, when <hi>Antipater</hi> came, who also kept the high ground as if he meant not to fight, which moved many <hi>Greeks</hi> to depart. This instability (incorrigible in Volunteers) was the more inexcusable. <hi>Craterus,</hi> with a strong Army, at length is come, and joineth with <hi>Antipater,</hi> making between them Forty thousand heavy Armed, Three thousand light, and Five thousand Horse; of which number, the <hi>Greeks</hi> wanted one thousand five hundred Horse, and Eighteen thousand Foot, who lost he day, with the slaughter only of Five hundred Men. So the <hi>Greeks,</hi> not subject to one General, desiring to preserve their own Estates, betrayed their Country's liberty by a careless defence, while <hi>Thessaly</hi> seeks her Peace.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Antipater</hi>'s gentle Conditions to such as were forward to seek Peace, drew on the rest; only <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> and <hi>Aetolia</hi> are plotting to prosecute the War, begun by them more bravely than wisely, 'till <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> is come to their Doors, when wanting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to resist, they seek Peace, absolutely submitting, as <hi>Leosthenes</hi> had proudly required of <hi>Antipater,</hi> who now overthrew the Popular Estate, raised a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy of Nine thousand of the most considerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, transmitted the tumultuous into <hi>Thrace,</hi> and slew <hi>Demosthenes.</hi>

The Captains hearing of this his Humanity, fell to mutiny, thinking it unreasonable to make War on so Virtuous and Honourable a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to fulfil the pleasure of a Lordly Ambitious Man, using them like Slaves. <hi>Pithon,</hi> formerly made Governour of <hi>Medea,</hi> being present, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Perdicas</hi> for a disgrace offered him by the other,

He took <hi>Oriculum, Susa, Pometia,</hi> and the <hi>Gabii</hi>; but for the Rape of <hi>Lucretia</hi> by <hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi> his Brother, he and all his Family were expell'd by <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Collatinus</hi> her Husband; that manner of Government was changed from a King to two yearly Consuls, or Providers for the City, wherein these two began. Their first War was with <hi>Porsennus</hi> King of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> who came to <hi>Rome</hi> by force, to restore <hi>Tarquinius</hi>; but was so long resisted by <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Cocles,</hi> upon the Bridge, 'till being overpower'd by Numbers, he was forc'd to leap into the River <hi>Tibris</hi> with his Armour on, and so terrified by <hi>Mutius Scae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vola</hi>'s resolution, burning his own hand for killing

the Secretary instead of the King, that he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to League with <hi>Rome. Brutus</hi> being slain in this War was mourned for a whole year by the Ladies, as the Champion of their Chastity. <hi>Mamilius Tusculanus,</hi> Son-in-Law to <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> with his <hi>Latines,</hi> renewed the War; against whom, <hi>Aulus Posthumus</hi> in a new Office of <hi>Dictator</hi> was sent, who overthrew them. After Sixteen Years of Consuls, upon a tumult of the People, the Office of Tribunes was enacted, to follow the Peoples Causes as Solicitors. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Wars with the <hi>Volsci</hi> and <hi>Aequi,</hi> in which, <hi>T.

Not long after, Three Hundred and Six <hi>Fabii</hi>'s undertaking the War against the <hi>Veii</hi> in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> were slain, and left but one Infant of the whole Family; of whom (it is said) came <hi>Fabius Maximus.</hi> In process of time, the Consuls and other Magistrates are abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Ten Men ordained, who Enacted Laws, and Two Years after, are forced to resign to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls. After that, they subdued the <hi>Veients</hi> and <hi>Falisci</hi> yielded to <hi>Camillus</hi> in reverence to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice upon the Schoolmaster of their Town, who having decoy'd out many Principal Men's Children, yielded them up to him for Hostages, whom he sent back bound, with his Scholars whipping him. He also won the City of <hi>Veij,</hi> after Ten Years Siege; but upon unequal division of the Spoil, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully they Banished him.

After Seven Months Siege <hi>Brennus</hi> agreed to depart for One Thousand Weight of Gold, which while they were weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Camillus</hi> with an Army came upon them, and forced them away. At this time they had Military Tribunes.</p>

This War continued Fifty Years, and drew the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> into it, in which time the <hi>Latines</hi> claimed freedom in <hi>Rome,</hi> which bred a quarrel, wherein the <hi>Latines</hi> were overthrown.

Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> upon view of their Camp, perceiving he had to deal with Men well-trained, set a strong <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> upon the passage of the River, which when he saw them force, he thought it time to bring on his whole Forces before all the Army was come over, and all little enough, while Spear and Sword were used. But when his Elephants came in, the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse quickly turned head, and the Foot at the sight and first impression of those strange Beasts fled with such consternation, that they left their Camp to the Enemy. Yet <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> by this trial finding the <hi>Romans</hi> could better endure many such Losses, than he such Victories, sent <hi>Cyneas</hi> to persuade an Agreement with the <hi>Romans,</hi> which they refused, as long as he was in <hi>Italy.</hi> This Answer inflam'd <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> with desire to enter into League with that gallant City, which refused to treat of Peace, except he first left <hi>Italy.</hi> They come therefore to a second Battel, which he obtain'd by his Elephants, but with such loss of the Flower of his Army, that he desired any occasion to be gone with Honour.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> waiting an opportunity to leave <hi>Italy,</hi> hath two occasions offered; and first from <hi>Madecon,</hi> where <hi>Ptolomy Ceraunus</hi> (who had murthered <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> his Protector) was slain by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who came out of the Country with those who took <hi>Rome,</hi> and passing through many Countries, and making long abode in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> at length came to <hi>Macedon,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one <hi>Belgius</hi>; after whom came <hi>Brennus</hi> another Captain, with One Hundred and Eighteen Thousand Foot, and Fifteen Thousand Horse, which <hi>Sosthenes</hi> with the <hi>Macedonians</hi> avoided, by shutting up the Cities. At the same time also the <hi>Cicilians</hi> sent to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> for aid against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

he took, and with Thirty Thousand Foot, and Two Thousand Five Hundred Horse entred <hi>Sicily,</hi> expell'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> won <hi>Erex</hi> the strong Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in <hi>Syracusa</hi> began to play the Tyrant. But being again called into <hi>Italy</hi> by the <hi>Tarentines</hi> against the <hi>Romans,</hi> he was beaten by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Gallies, and after that forced out of <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Epirus,</hi> by <hi>M.

               <p n="5">§. 5. <hi>Antigonus</hi> Son of <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes,</hi> with an Army, Navy, and Treasure came into <hi>Macedon,</hi> while <hi>Brennus</hi> with most of his <hi>Gauls</hi> was gone to plunder the Temple of <hi>Delp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These went to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> requiring him to buy his Peace; to whose Embassadors he shewed his Riches, Navy, Camp, and Camels. This being reported at their return, inflamed the <hi>Gauls</hi> to hasten thither; of whose coming <hi>Antigonus</hi> having intelligence, left his Camp, and put himself and all his Men into a Wood, so the <hi>Gauls</hi> finding him gone, hasted to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, supposing him fled. Part of <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Army having recovered their Ships, espying the <hi>Gauls</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous disorder, taking their time, suddenly went on shoar, and set upon them with such Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that after the slaughter of many, the rest yielded to <hi>Antigonus.</hi> This Success bred in the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians a great reputation of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> but his own Men had no better opinion of him than of one who crept into Woods at sight of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>This appeared shortly after, when <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> being returned to <hi>Epirus</hi> with a small Army of Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, and Five Hundred Horse, came to make Devastations in <hi>Macedon,</hi> in hope to force <hi>Antigonus</hi> to compound with him for his Peace.

and his Army for the Kingdom. <hi>Antigonus</hi> had no inclination to fight with him, but to weary him with protracting time; but <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> so forced a Streight, in which he overtook him, that he slew most of the <hi>Gauls, Antigonus</hi> not taking any care to relieve them; which the Captains of the Elephants fearing to be their own case, yielded. Then <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> went to the Phalanx, which could not be Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged but in Front, which was very dangerous; but perceiving they had no desire to fight, he drew near to them in Person, persuading them to yield, which they presently did; so <hi>Antigonus</hi> with a few Horse fled to <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> but is forced by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> Son of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who pursued him, to fly to <hi>Pelopone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>

He therefore raised an Army of Twenty Five Thousand Foot, Two Thousand Horse, and Twenty Four Elephants, as against <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> to free such Cities as he held there, but indeed to restore King <hi>Cleonymus</hi> to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemon,</hi> but made shew of all Friendship to them. This dissimulation the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had used 'till none would trust them; and yet now they were not hurt by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s use of it, by reason of his deferring the assaults, 'till they had fortified the Town, which was never done before. He assailed the Town three days together, and had won it the second day, but for a Fall his wounded Horse gave him, and the third day relief came unto them; so that despairing to carry it, he was content to go to <hi>Argos,</hi> whither one Faction of the City called him, promising to render it, as the other Faction called <hi>Antigonus</hi>; but both sides repented it when they were come, and desired their departure, which <hi>Antigonus</hi> assured them by

It commanded <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the Islands in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> South-West from
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64357:184"/>
                  <hi>Sicily</hi>; it had Flourished about Seven Hundred and Thirty Years when <hi>Scipio</hi> took it, who carried off One Million Four Hundred and Ten Thousand Pounds, besides the Souldiers part. It was oft Rebuilt, and Invincible while it Commanded the Sea, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most compass'd it; 'twas Twenty Miles in Circuit, and a treble Wall. Without the Walls, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, were Streets with Vaults for Three Hundred Elephants, and Stables for Four Thousand Horse, with room for Provender and Lodging for the Horse-Men, and Twenty Thousand Foot, which never troubled the City, as it is at this day in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> The Castle of <hi>Beyrsa</hi> in the South-side, was two Miles and a half in compass, with an <hi>Arsenal,</hi> under which the Ships and Gallies did Ride. The Form of the Common-Wealth was like that of <hi>Sparta,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Titular Kings, and Aristocratical Senators; but in latter times the People usurpt too much; which confusion in Government, with their too great trust to Mercenaries, together with Avarice and Cruelty, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd their ruine. They exacted from their Vassals one half of the Fruits of the Earth, besides Tributes; made merciless Officers by exactions to augment the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and put to death, without Mercy, him who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended ignorantly, nay even their Captains upon ill Success, which made them often desperately to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard all. The Year after <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s expulsion, <hi>Rome</hi> sought a League with <hi>Carthage,</hi> agreed the <hi>Romans</hi> should Trade in no part of <hi>Africk</hi>; but no Haven in <hi>Italy</hi> to be shut against <hi>Carthage,</hi> &amp;c. Their Care was to keep the <hi>Romans</hi> in continual War in <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Sicily</hi> destitute of aid from thence, might more easily be brought under by them. This made them offer Succours to <hi>Rome</hi> against <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> to prevent his interrupting their attempts in <hi>Sicily</hi>; at which time the League was renewed, especially against <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who then defeated the purposes of <hi>Carthage</hi> for that time.

But unable to hold out, and being divided, one side resolves to give themselves to <hi>Carthage,</hi> the other to <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> readily lay hold of the Offer, send For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and had the Castle surrendred. But the contrary Faction drawing that side to agreement, expelled the Captain, for which he was Crucified at home as a Coward and Traytor. <hi>Carthage</hi> hereupon besieges <hi>Messana,</hi> and the <hi>Syracusians</hi> joyn with them by Sea and Land; while <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Consul, with an Army passing the Streights of <hi>Sicily</hi> by Night, put himself into <hi>Messana,</hi> sending to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> King of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> requiring them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from their Confederacy; which Message being slighted, occasion'd the <hi>Punick</hi> War.</p>

                  <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> being sent unto them of <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sana,</hi> sally'd out on that side <hi>Hierom</hi> kept, and worsted him, and the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> who had foolishly joyned with <hi>Carthage,</hi> against whom they must have sought aid at <hi>Rome</hi> if <hi>Messana</hi> had been won. <hi>Hierom</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such another Bargain would have made him Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, departed, and the next day the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> succeeded so ill, that they left Camp and Country to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who Confederated with this Nest of Thieves and Murderers, with whom no League was just.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>Sicily</hi>'s Dominion is now become the Prize for which <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> contend; concerning which Island the general Opinion of Antiquity is, that it was a Demy Island adjoyning to <hi>Italy,</hi> near <hi>Rhegium,</hi> and separated by Tempests, others say by Earthquakes, others by Tides. It excells all the Islands of the Midland Sea in bigness and fertility, and is formed like the Greek Δ <hi>Delta,</hi> or a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle. For Fertility <hi>Cicero</hi> calls it the Granary of the Commonwealth, and Nurse of the vulgar sort, furnishing their greatest Armies with Leather, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and Corn. About <hi>Leordium</hi> and other parts Wheat groweth of it self. It had Six Colonies, and Sixty Cities; it bred <hi>Archimedes,</hi> the Mathematician, <hi>Euclid</hi> the Geometrician, <hi>Empedocles</hi> the Philosopher, and <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Historian. It was Peopled by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> out of <hi>Spain,</hi> after the first Inhabitants which were Giants, and the <hi>Sicans</hi> were cast out by the <hi>Siculi</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> driven out from the place in which <hi>Rome</hi> stands, by the <hi>Pelasgi</hi>; from these <hi>Siculi</hi> it beareth the name. After them came the <hi>Morgetes</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> who were expelled by the <hi>Oznotrians,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Trojans</hi> came after, and then the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> which built <hi>Parormus,</hi> or <hi>Palmero.</hi> The report of Giants which first Inhabited the Island, I could reject, did not <hi>Moses</hi> make us know that such were the first Planters of the Countries about <hi>Israel</hi>; and did

not other Authors confirm it, as <hi>Augustine, Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Procopius, Isidore, Nicephorus, Pliny, Diodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> &amp;c. yea <hi>Vespusius</hi> in his second Navigation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>America,</hi> saw the like there. And I wonder at this the less, seeing the same is written of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that is written of one, touching their simplicity of Life, mean Sustenance, poor Cottages, Cloathing of Skins, Hunting, Arms, manner of Boats; in all which, as we are altered from the first Simplicity, to extream Curiosity, and excess in Building, Diet, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, so have we as monstrous Persons for Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and all Vices; all which as Time bred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, so shall it overthrow all Flesh at last.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Dionysius,</hi> Son-in-Law to <hi>Hermocrates,</hi> being made Praetor, and Commander of the <hi>Syracusian</hi> Armies, behav'd himself so well, that he got the good will of the People and Men of War; and began early, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Twenty Five Years Old, that he might play the Tyrant long. He obtain'd his first Favour by accusing the Noblemen, whom the baser sort desire to reign over; then he got of them Six Hundred Men to guard his Person, as <hi>Pisistratus</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> had
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64357:187"/>
done, against the malice of his Enemies; and to gain the Souldiers, he gave them double Pay, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the restoring of many Banished Men, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by were made his own. Then he made himself ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Lord by possession of the Citadel, in which was great Provision, and under which the Gallies Moored; what he design'd by this the Chief Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens discerned it, though the People would not see. Yet after a Foil given at <hi>Gela</hi> by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> (which the Men at Arms thought he was willing to) they left him, and hasting to <hi>Syracuse,</hi> in hope to free the City of him, they forced his Palace, ransaked his Treasure, and abused his Wife; all which he reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, being at their heels, sparing none that he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected. Then he grew so doubtful, being the greatest Robber that ever State had, that he trusted not a Brother to enter his Chamber unsearched; yet being at the War, the Citizens rebell at home, so that with much difficulty he recovered the Citadel, and so the Command of the City; and when the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude were gathering in Harvest he disarmed the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. Afterwards he went into the Field with Eighty Thousand Foot, and Three Thousand Horse, and sent his Brother <hi>Leptines</hi> with Two Hundred Gallies to Sea, and Five Hundred Ships of Burthen, which overthrew Fifty Ships of War, Five Thousand Souldiers, and many Ships of burthen brought by <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milco</hi> from <hi>Carthage,</hi> while many Cities also yielded to <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who yet lost a great part of his Army at <hi>Egesta. Himilco</hi> finds half his Army with <hi>Mago</hi> by Sea, which met again with <hi>Leptines,</hi> and slew Twenty Thousand, and took One Hundred Gallies, which made <hi>Dionysius</hi> hasten home, whom <hi>Himilco</hi> follows with speed, besieging him by Sea and Land; but the Plague having taken away One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thousand of his Men, and other numbers slain by the City with the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> aid, he craved Peace, which the other sold for a great Summ, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:64357:187"/>
on Condition to leave such as were not <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; but when he was out at Sea the Tyrant followed, and slew many. <hi>Mago,</hi> who stayed behind to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> received Supplies of Eighty Thousand Men, which did nothing but make Peace with <hi>Dionysius</hi>; who march'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he took <hi>Rhegium,</hi> and used much Cruelty therein.</p>
               <p>Afterwards in another Battle with <hi>Mago</hi> he slew him, and Ten Thousand <hi>Africans</hi>; but <hi>Mago</hi>'s Son slew his Brother <hi>Leptines,</hi> and Fourteen Thousand Men, which made him now buy his Peace: Shortly after he died, after Thirty Eight Years Tyranny, and his Son <hi>Dionysius</hi> succeeded, with his Father's disposition; tho' to gain favour he dissembled, freed many Prisoners, and remitted many Taxes; but slew his Brethren by another Mother, the Sister of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> a Valiant Just Man. This Man had so prevail'd with him as to hear <hi>Plato,</hi> whom he had sent for, by whose Wisdom he began to be reform'd, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd it not. After this, his Flatterers procure <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onysius</hi>'s Banishment, persuading the King, <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> sought to weaken his Mind by Philosophy, and by offer which he had made to furnish the King with Fifty Gallies, to make himself Master of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Dionysius</hi> was well beloved in <hi>Greece,</hi> where he gathered Eight Hundred brave Followers, whom he carried to <hi>Syracuse</hi>; while the Tyrant was in <hi>Italy,</hi> he entred without resistance, and recovered the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Liberty, though the Tyrant held the Castle. After this the Worthy Man had the Reward which popular Estates use to give, and was forced to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the City, but returned twice from <hi>Leontium</hi> to assist them against the Castle, which gall'd them; and at last recovered the Castle, and was after mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by <hi>Cratippus,</hi> who shortly after was slain by the same Dagger. <hi>Dionysius</hi> after this recovered the City, and made many fiye to <hi>Icetes,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Leontium,</hi> who, with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> force <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:64357:188"/>
into the Castle, and besieged him. After comes <hi>Timolion</hi> with Forces from <hi>Corinth</hi> to free the City, who with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> forsake <hi>Icetes,</hi> wins the City, and hath the Castle rendred by <hi>Dionysius,</hi> which he beats down, calling it the Nest of Tyrants. <hi>Syracuse</hi> wasted by former Wars, is new Peopled with Ten Thousand <hi>Greeks</hi> by <hi>Timolion</hi>'s means, who also overthrew <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> but <hi>Amilcar</hi> coming with Seventy Thousand <hi>Africans,</hi> with Two Gallies, and One Thousand Ships of burthen, vanquish'd <hi>Icetes,</hi> and slew him and his Followers; suppres'd all the Tyrants in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and died in Peace and Honour. <hi>Sicily</hi> after Twenty Years Peace from <hi>Timolion</hi>'s death, falls under the Tyranny of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> who rising by degrees in the Field, came from a Beggar to be Praetor, and after Tyrant of <hi>Syracuse.</hi> Being Praetor, and in League with <hi>Amilcar</hi> the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> he entertain'd Five Thousand <hi>Africans,</hi> and many old Souldiers, pretending to besiege <hi>Herbita,</hi> but indeed sets upon the Senators, the Rich, and all his Enemies, dividing the Spoil among the Poor, and giving liberty to the Souldiers to Plunder, Murther, and Ravish, calling it a violent Remedy for the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Disease of the Commonwealth, pretending now to reduce the Oligarchy to the ancient and indifferent Democracy. But having left none fit for Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he knew that those whom he assisted in their Murders and Outrages would need his aid to protect them, and therefore would make him King, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they did. This <hi>Amilcar</hi> was content with, in hope that upon his wasting the Island all would fall into the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> hands; but the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> upon complaint send another <hi>Amilcar</hi>; upon which, the former chose rather to destroy himself, than to give an account to <hi>Carthage. Agathocles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> came, had made the better part of <hi>Sicily</hi> his own, and defeating the first Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that they returned, and so encountred the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,

One misfortune is enough to overthrow a Tyrant, without great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection; as it was with him, who after one great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat was glad to retire home, and being there besieged with that wicked Rabble which had been Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Tyrannous Entrance, he to prevent the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which was like to follow, Shipped himself with as many as he thought convenient, leaving the City. <hi>Antander</hi> his Brother went to Sea when the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Fleet was going out to seize on certain Ships coming with Provision; these seeing <hi>Agathocles,</hi> made toward him, who hasted toward <hi>Africa,</hi> while the Provision got into the City; but before he got to Land the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Fleet is fatigu'd by endeavouring to overtake him and was beaten and routed by him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing landed, after many plausible Speeches to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as if he were Master of all the Riches in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> he burnt all their Ships, except one or two, to use for Messengers. In this heat of resolution he winneth two Cities, and demolish'd them, to the great amazement of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who sent out against him <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> which were his profess'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, of whom <hi>Agathocles</hi> cut <hi>Hanno</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in pieces, the other looking on. This Success drew an <hi>African</hi> King to joyn with him, as did <hi>Ophellas</hi> King of the <hi>Cyrenians,</hi> to whom he promised to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver what he wan in <hi>Africk,</hi> but indeed treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously murthered him, and entertain'd his Army. After this he made a start to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and appeased some Eruptions, returned to <hi>Africa,</hi> pacify'd his Souldiers in mutiny for want of Pay, and might have brought <hi>Carthage</hi> to buy Peace, and give over all in <hi>Sicily,</hi> if his thoughts of the Conquest of <hi>Carthage</hi> had not deceived him, by an impression, which as light an accident as a flash of fire caused to vanish; for upon two Fires in the Night, kindled by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both Armies fled, each afraid of other. <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles</hi>

After this he went into <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> subdued the <hi>Brutians,</hi> made the Isle <hi>Lipara</hi> buy Peace for a hundred Talents of Gold; but in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with Eleven Ships laden with Gold, all was lost, and all the Fleet but his own Galley, which brought him to a more miserable end, by grievous torment in his Sinews and Veins, over all his Body, in which he was forsaken of all, and dyed basely as he began.

THE <hi>Carthaginians</hi> thus quit of <hi>Sicily</hi> and the Islands about it, have now leisure to think how to help themselves in a following War, rather than to be content with the present Peace; for that the Conquerors give and the Conquered receive Laws. But <hi>Rome</hi> forgot in this Affair what had been answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Senator, demanding what Peace <hi>Rome</hi> may hope for, or be assured of, if they quitted the present Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over them? It was Answered, <hi>if the Peace you give us be good and faithful, it will hold; if it be ill, it will not.</hi> The Senate approved the Answer as manly and free; for who will believe that any People will endure an over-hard Condition longer than Necessity compells.

The Governors on the contrary put them off, 'till all were come; and to avoid the disorders of such lawless Guest, sent them to <hi>Sicca</hi> to prevent their coming to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</hi> Then <hi>Hanno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">§. 2. Tyranny must use the help of Mercenaries, which commonly are as false, as the War against Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants is Cruel. Tyranny is a violent Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; respecting the Commanders pleasure, and not the good of Subjects. Violent it is, seeing no Man can yield willing Obedience, where his Life and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64357:194"/>
is not regarded. Tyrants which are most Cruel seem mild sometimes to some for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but in large Dominions, where they cannot take such particular knowledge of Men, he who cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the face of one so honest, as will put him in mind of moderation, will not bound his desires. The sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Oppression from a few, inflames his appetite to spare none, seeing there is no cause to respect one more than other; and Covetousness is never satisfied. Having squeez'd from all, yet believing every one could have spared more, and he knows many pretend want without cause; and therefore deviseth new tricks of Robbery, which please him as much as the gain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the recreation of his Spirit: He knows he is hated for it, and therefore seeks to turn hatred into fear, by cruelty against the suspected, whether justly or no, so that the Conspirator can be no more fearful of his Tyranny than the Inocent.

The one Consul with his part of the Army, which was four Legions, and thirty thousand Foot of the Allies, and two thousand Horse, met them in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> where, by a plain stratagem of shew, to flag the Gauls, they slew six thousand; but upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Lucius Emilius</hi> the other Consul, they resolve upon Retreats.

War rather while their State was in good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to stay 'till being fallen into distress, the Enemy should begin it. <hi>Hannibal</hi> well understood this, as also the advantage in getting the start, and therefore thought long 'till he was dealing with them, before they should have notice of his purpose, which could not be conceal'd if once he came to Action; besides the hinderance by slow and timerous proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein. Before therefore he would provoke the <hi>Romans</hi> by attempting <hi>Saguntum,</hi> he wisely ended the Conquest of all that lay between, as the <hi>Olcades</hi> near <hi>Tagus,</hi> and <hi>Vaccai</hi> in Old <hi>Castile,</hi> where they took <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and <hi>Arbu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he that is as a Chrystal for every Eye to see through, makes himself an Ass for every Man to ride or drive; whereas wise and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Men, in that which is Just and Virtuous, are like Coffers with double Bottoms, which shew not all at once. Before he was General, he was of all Men the most venturous, which doth not always become a General; and therefore he now dissembles Fear, and draweth back from the River, as fearing to ford it, by that means to draw his Enemies into it. But when he saw them pushing disorderly into the swift Stream, he turned his Camels to entertain their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pressing in with his Horse above and beneath upon them, made a great slaughter, which amazed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on that side the River of <hi>Iberus.</hi> The <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntines</hi> post their Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> who pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Rome</hi> storms at the News, and will be revenged. She sends to <hi>Carthage</hi> to know whether <hi>Hannibal</hi> had their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; which question <hi>Carthage</hi> calls insolent, and gives them an impertinent answer; forgetting, as <hi>Polybius</hi> thinks, to charge <hi>Rome</hi> with breach of Oath in taking <hi>Sardinia</hi> from them: But in the end both sides resolve upon War, as that which both desire. This is plain dealing, and no wrangling about breach of Covenants, which they only stand about, who are unwilling to fight. For Kings understand the obligation of a Treaty by the Condition of their own advantage, and commonly the best advised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the Sword, and then with the Trumpet, as the <hi>Arrogonois</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> taking all our Ships in his Ports. <hi>Hannibal</hi> besides the forwardness of <hi>Carthage,</hi> had also been sworn by his Father to pursue <hi>Rome</hi> with immortal hatred, being but Nine Years old, which I doubt not but some Kings not at peace with us, were charged with by their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, to declare themselves our Enemies when their Coffers were full.</p>

Then he sends to the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene</hi> Mountaineers and <hi>Gauls</hi> for a quiet passage, and in the Spring passeth over <hi>Iberus</hi> Ninety Thousand Foot, and Twelve Thousand Horse, with which he Conquer'd <hi>Spain</hi> on the East of that River, and left one <hi>Hanno</hi> with Ten Thousand Foot, and One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse to Govern it. At the Borders he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that desired it, and so with Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thousand Foot, and Nine Thousand Horse, he entred <hi>Gaul,</hi> and by fair words and gifts passed to <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> where the <hi>Vivaretz</hi> to be rid of them gave way and directed him; yet he was put to some trouble on the other side, and in passing over his Elephants on Boughs of Trees covered with Turffs, and towed over. Then the <hi>Cisalpine Gauls</hi> in <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> lately revolted from <hi>Rome,</hi> and came over to him, and gave him Guides over the <hi>Alps</hi>; yet was he exceedingly molested by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiards,</hi> and put to loss both of Carriages and Men, besides Fifteen Days tedious March over the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the beginning of Winter.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. The <hi>Cisalpine Gauls</hi> before <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had revolted from <hi>Rome,</hi> and besieged the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Commissioners in <hi>Modena,</hi> when they could not force <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Placentia,</hi> two <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies; but seeming weary, and desirous of Peace, <hi>Rome</hi> sent Ambassadors, whom they detain. <hi>Manlius</hi> the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who lay in those parts with an Army, coming to relieve the Besieged, is overthrown by the <hi>Gaul</hi>'s Ambush in a Wood, and <hi>Atilius</hi> his fellow Praetor sent with another supply was beaten, <hi>&amp;c.

dreaming that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> after so many indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities slavishly endured, would grow so brave as to look into <hi>Italy,</hi> had sent <hi>Titus Sempronius,</hi> one of their Consuls, with an Army, and Two Hundred and Sixty <hi>Quinqueremes</hi> into <hi>Africk,</hi> and <hi>P.

But he hearing at <hi>Massilia</hi> that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was past over <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> sent his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Curius Cornelius Scipio</hi> with the greatest part of the Forces to try <hi>Asdrubal</hi>; and himself with some choice Men hastened after <hi>Hannibal</hi> by Sea to <hi>Pisa,</hi> and so to <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> where he gathered together the broken Troops of the beaten Praetor.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Hannibal</hi> after Five Months tedious Journey, and having past the <hi>Alps,</hi> hath but Twenty Thousand Foot and Six Hundred Horse left of those he muster'd at <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> as the Monument he raised in <hi>Iuno</hi>'s Temple witnesseth, besides the <hi>Gauls, Lycurgians,</hi> &amp;c. lately joyned. In <hi>Piemont</hi> he forced the City <hi>Turine,</hi> which had refused his Alliance, which drew many <hi>Gauls</hi> and others to joyn with him, and prepared o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which yet held off, hearing of the Consul <hi>Scipio</hi>'s coming; which wavering made both Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals to hasten the Trial. <hi>Ticinum</hi> was the place where they exhort their Armies, and where <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> set before his "the desperate sight of his <hi>Savoy</hi> Captives which he had used so miserably, that he who was slain by his Fellow thought he succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well, though he which overcame had Liberty, with an Horse and Mony. This he shewed his Souldiers was their case, whose Life without Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory will be a bondage worse than Death, but with Victory will be well rewarded." <hi>Scipio</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his Men by the Victories of their Ancestors even over the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>; that these were but a declining Troop of Rebels, feeble by hard travel, and many wants. In the Battle <hi>Scipio</hi> was dangerously wounded, and left in the place, if his Son (after Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:64357:200"/>
                  <hi>Africanus</hi> had not brought him off. The Consul seeing his Horsemen beaten, and the rest discouraged, made his retreat to <hi>Placentia. Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> after two Days got over <hi>Ticinum,</hi> and presented himself before <hi>Placentia,</hi> but no Man looks out; whereupon the Consul's <hi>Gauls</hi> fell from him to <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> who sent them home with kind usage, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to persuade their Nation to confederacy. The Consul steals away in the Night, but had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horsmen, if they had not stayed to plunder his Camp, while he recovered the Bank of <hi>Trebia,</hi> where he fortified himself, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fellow Consul. The <hi>Gauls</hi> come over dayly to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who is in want of Victuals, but relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himself by taking <hi>Chastidium,</hi> in which all the <hi>Roman</hi> Store and Ammunition lay, which was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. <hi>Rome</hi> hearing of these Disasters, will revenge it by <hi>Sempronius</hi> the other Consul, with his Armies at <hi>Ariminum,</hi> which being brought to <hi>Trebia,</hi> where <hi>Scipio</hi> lay of his Wounds, <hi>Sempronius</hi> will have the honour of the day before the other recovers, or his Office now almost out should expire; neither can he be dissuaded. <hi>Hannibal</hi> by the <hi>Gauls</hi> in their Camp understanding it, conceal'd his Brother <hi>Mago</hi> within an Ambush in a low place overgrown with Reeds, who pressing the Enemy in the Reer, while the other charged them in Front and Flank, Twenty Six Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of the <hi>Romans</hi> were slain. <hi>Sempronius</hi> erred, First, Fighting in a Champion Country, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Elephants. Secondly, in not discovering the Ground. Thirdly, In leading his weary hungry Men through the River, immediately to fight with fresh and well-fed Men.</p>

and five Sons of the Senators, of which he kept the <hi>Romans</hi> in miserable Bondage, but sent home their followers. Having wearied those <hi>Gauls</hi> where he wintred, when the Year was well advanc'd he pass'd the <hi>Appenine</hi> Mountains with such difficulty, that he chose to take through the Fenns, in which he lost his Elephants, and the use of one Eye with the severity of his March, and so came to <hi>Aretium,</hi> where wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting all the Countries, about Sixteen of which he set on fire just by <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Consul, an hot-headed popular Orator, who intending to quench it with <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Blood, fell unadvisedly into <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s Troops, between <hi>Cortona,</hi> and the Lake <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samene,</hi> where he and Fifteen Thousand of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were slain, and Six Thousand escaped to the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now he had Fifteen Thousand <hi>Italian</hi> Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of which the <hi>Romans</hi> he kept to hard meats, but freed the rest, in hopes to make the <hi>Italians</hi> his Allies; but an ancient Reputation is not so soon lost. <hi>Servilius</hi> the other Consul not knowing what was done, sent <hi>Centronius</hi> with Four Thousand Men to encrease the Army; but <hi>Maherbal</hi> intercepted them, slew half, and the rest yielded, the News whereof made <hi>Servilius</hi> hasten to the defence of <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus we discern the fruits of popular Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie in changing the Commanders in War yearly, which endangereth the growth of the Empire. For the best Wit in the World cannot inform it self in the compass of one year of all the good helps requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the prosecution of War to the best effect, as <hi>Caesar</hi> did in <hi>Gaul</hi> by Ten Years continuance.</p>

and create a Dictator, whose Office was above a Consul, and scarcely subject to any controul. The People as having Supream Authority, chose <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> the best Man of War in the City, who chose <hi>M. Minutius Rufus</hi> Master of the Horse, which is as his Lieutenant. <hi>Fabius</hi> began with Reformation in Religion, a commendable beginning if the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had been good. The <hi>Sybil</hi>'s Books were herein consulted, which directed Vows to <hi>Mars,</hi> a Sacrifice to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and a Temple to <hi>Venus,</hi> which Trumperies prove the Books written by an ill Spirit. <hi>Fabius</hi> sets out with four Legions, and received <hi>Servilius</hi>'s Army, and sent him to Sea to pursue the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Fleet, which had intercepted the Supply sent to <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Spain. Hannibal</hi> in the mean time refreshed his Men, armed the <hi>Africans</hi> after the <hi>Roman</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and so Coasted toward <hi>Apulia,</hi> not to take any City by long Siege, which breaks the force of a great Army; but seeking to weaken the <hi>Romans</hi> reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, desired to be Master of the Field, which would soon open the Gates of Cities. Therefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented <hi>Fabius</hi> Battel as soon as he saw him, but he would not bite; knowing the difference between old Victorious Souldiers and Novices, whom he would acquaint with dangers, and to look upon the Lyon afar off, before they set foot upon his Tail. <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> had a contrary disposition, fiery, like <hi>Flaminius,</hi> taxing <hi>Fabius</hi> with Cowardise; but that moved not this well-advised Commander, who knew the danger of pursuing misfortune, which wasteth it self by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, sooner than by Opposition. It is the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Army that desires Battel, and <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s was also Victorious, therefore <hi>Fabius</hi> suffered him to fall upon the Rich Territory of <hi>Campania,</hi> himself keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hills, being much weaker in Horse. But Winter drawing on, <hi>Hannibal</hi> cannot stay in the wasted Country, and could not get into a fresh, but must pass by the Dictator, who presumed he now
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64357:202"/>
had him fast, but was deceived; for <hi>Hannibal</hi> in a dark Night tying Faggots to the Horns of Two Thousand Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His Success in the Encounter was good, having taken such advantage that he dared <hi>Hannibal</hi> in his Camp, and came off with the better. The Army applauds <hi>Minutius,</hi> but the People of <hi>Rome</hi> more, and by motion of <hi>Metellus</hi> a Tribune, seconded by <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> a Popular Fellow, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Nobility, and who had been Praetor the last year, <hi>Minutius</hi> is joyn'd in equal Authority with <hi>Fabius</hi>: When they met <hi>Fabius</hi> divided the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with <hi>Minutius</hi> by Lot, which the other likes not so well as to Command the whose by Course, but took his Lot, and incamped a mile and a half from the Dictator, as desirous to have occasion to Fight, as <hi>Fabius</hi> to the contrary. <hi>Hannibal</hi> design'd to try <hi>Minutius</hi>'s Courage the next day, and in the Night conceal'd an Ambush of Horse and Foot in spacious Caves in the Vallie, and early in the Morning gave occasion to <hi>Minutius</hi> like the former, which he gladly took, but succeeded worse, and had lost all, if <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> had not come to rescue him.</p>
               <p n="7">§. 7. <hi>Fabius</hi> is commended by the principal Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; but the inferiour sort cry out against his cold protracting the War, doing nothing of Consequence all his year. <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> took advantage to put in for the Consulship, which far exceeded his own worth, without the favour of the Multitude, which supply all his wants, especially having <hi>Bibilus Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> a Kinsman, Tribune of the People, who by his
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:64357:202"/>
Place might speak what he pleas'd to assist him. This bold Orator inveighed against the Nobility, as the Causes which drew <hi>Hannibal</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> who now could not be expelled without a <hi>Plebeian</hi> Consul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Fathers labour to hinder this, first by choice of a Dictator, which held not; and by an <hi>Inter-Regnum,</hi> which was a Government of Ten of the Fathers for Five Days; in which the heat of the Multitude might be assuaged, and all begin again; but after five Days no other but <hi>Terentius</hi> will be heard of; so that to bridle this violent Person, <hi>Lucius Paulus Aemilius</hi> a Worthy Honourable Man is chosen the second Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul, and a great levy of Men, which made up the Army under the old Consuls Eighty Thousand Foot, and Six Thousand Horse. While this preparation and other businesses are ordering at <hi>Rome, Hannibal</hi> who Wintred at <hi>Geryon</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> took the Castle of <hi>Canne,</hi> where much of the <hi>Roman</hi> Provision lay, but <hi>Servilius</hi> the old Consul could do nothing 'till the new came. At their departing, <hi>Fabius</hi> gravely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>Aemilius</hi> not only to play the Man against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> but also in bridling the rashness of his Collegue; who answer'd, He would do his utmost for his Country, but would rather adventure upon the Enemie's Sword, than the Citizens malice.</p>
               <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>Aemilius</hi> with his Collegue being come to the Camp, took occasion to encourage the Souldiers by the Consideration of old Victories against the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> and other more warlike Nations, the present great numbers, even all that <hi>Rome</hi> could make. <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>'s Success was by Slight, not Valour; and they saw how destitute he was of the helps they had. They conceive all this, and the happiness of following such a Leader as they knew him to be; but mistook him, as if they should lose the Patience of waiting a Convenient Season, and only presume upon their advantage. But indeed there hapned an inconvenience, than which few are more dangerous, when they consider not the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64357:203"/>
of their Chief Commanders, while <hi>Varro</hi> upbraideth <hi>Aemilius</hi>'s Advise to decline such an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to savour too much of <hi>Q. Fabius</hi>; and <hi>Varro</hi>'s hast by <hi>Aemilius</hi> is compared to <hi>Flaminius. Varro</hi> in his Day of Command removed into the Plains chose by <hi>Hannibal; Aemilius</hi> the next Day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trencheth, and will not stir, and sent part of the Army to the East of the River <hi>Aufidus,</hi> intrenching them. The want of skill in <hi>Varro,</hi> and his obstinate Resolution against his Fellow Consuls prudent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, was great in suffering the <hi>Roman</hi> Army to be drawn along by <hi>Hannibal</hi> to fight in a place of the Enemies most advantage for his Horse, and in ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Army in form, good against Elephants, which the Enemy had not, but unprofitable against Horse, in which the Enemies had the advantage. The Battle began by <hi>Asdrubal</hi> upon <hi>Aemilius,</hi> whose <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen were over-matched in number and Horsemanship by the boisterous <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who forced them to give back, so that <hi>Aemilius</hi> put himself on foot among the Legions, while <hi>Asdrubal</hi> pursued, and slew almost all his broken Troops; the <hi>Equites</hi> riding about him, who rescued him, did also alight with him to help their distressed Foot, which <hi>Hannibal</hi> esteemed a yielding. <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> his Collegue in the Left Wing, is troubled with <hi>Hanno</hi> or <hi>Maharbal,</hi> when Five Hundred <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse came in and threw down their Arms in token of yielding, whom he order'd to rest behind the Army 'till all were done. But these crafty Adventurers Arm'd under their Cloaths with short Swords, spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their time, fell on the hindermost of the <hi>Romans</hi> to their great terrour, which, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> having slain the <hi>Roman</hi> Troops, highly increas'd, by joyning with these <hi>Numidians,</hi> and so forced <hi>Terentius</hi> to trust to his Horses heels. The <hi>Numidian</hi> Light-Horsmen pursue him, while <hi>Asdrubal</hi> with the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Horse fall upon the backs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64357:203"/>
disorder'd by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who had environ'd them on three sides; they being in a manner surrounded, a miserable slaughter was made of them, wherein it is probable that <hi>Aemilius</hi> dyed, and not that he got out wounded, as <hi>Livy</hi> reports; he was found with <hi>Lentulus</hi> in his flight, offering him his Horse, which he refused. All the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, except Four Thousand Foot and Two Thousand Horse, fell in this Slaughter with <hi>Aemilius</hi>; as for <hi>Terentius,</hi> he esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to <hi>Venusia,</hi> with Seventy Foot almost, and about Two Thousand became Prisoners to the <hi>Numidians.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Camps were a while defended, but in the end yielded, Eight Thousand of which became Prisoners, though <hi>Livy</hi> tells us but of Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, and Three Hundred Horse taken Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Hannibal</hi> lost but Five Thousand Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot, and Two Hundred Horse; and had he pursued his Victory, as <hi>Maharbal</hi> persuaded, and forthwith marched to <hi>Rome,</hi> it is little doubted but the War had ended, as he was told, <hi>He knew how to get, but not to use a Victory.</hi>

This Fruitful Country of <hi>Campania,</hi> and <hi>Capua</hi> the Head, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to open to him in <hi>Fabius</hi> the Dictator's days, if his nearness had not hindred it, which after the Victory at <hi>Cannae</hi> was taken away; yet having Three Hundred principal Gentlemen serving at <hi>Sicily</hi> under the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they desire to recover before they fall off, they sent Ambassadors to Consul <hi>Terentius</hi> to sound him, formerly offering their Service. But
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64357:204"/>
he little bewailing the <hi>Romans</hi> misfortune, which had now lost all, said, <hi>Campania</hi> must now not help <hi>Rome</hi> only, but also make good the War against the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The <hi>Campanians</hi> hearing this of their Ambassadors, presently make a League with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> only <hi>Decius Magius</hi> opposed it to <hi>Capua</hi> where <hi>Hannibal</hi> came, and Condemned him as a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but to prevent the envy of his Execution, sent him to <hi>Carthage.</hi> Other Towns depending upon this, ran the same course; though the next Cities, as <hi>Nola, Nuceria,</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> stood out for <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet was at this time in extream fear of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>'s coming, so that <hi>Terentius</hi> was called home to name a Dictator. At his coming it was wisely done to give a good welcome, to cover their fear, and prevent the lamentations of the multitude, which would have bred contempt of the Governours, and not out of Greatness of Spirit, as <hi>Livy</hi> would have it. <hi>M. Iunius</hi> is named Dictator, and <hi>T. Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Master of the Horse, who presently raised four Legions, and One Thousand Horse, being forced to press Boys. To these were added Eight Thousand sturdy Slaves, encouraged with promise of Liberty upon deserts; Men also in Debt, and others in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death for Capital Offences, are freed, if they will serve in this War. To Arm these, they took down the Spoils of Enemies heretofore hung up in their Temples and Porches. About this time Ten Agents sent by the Prisoners to Treat with the Senate about their Redemption, came, with whom <hi>Carthalo</hi> is sent by <hi>Hannibal</hi> to sound their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Peace, whom they will not see, neither will redeem their Prisoners; pretending their Folly in not escaping by flight as others did, but their wants was the true Cause; for when such as escaped came, they condemned them to serve in <hi>Sicily,</hi>

the Field with twenty five Thousand Men, with whom he spent his time in <hi>Campania</hi> I know not how, while <hi>Hannibal</hi> made many idle Journeys between <hi>Nola</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi>; but <hi>Nola</hi> was forc'd to call for <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> a <hi>Praetor,</hi> with his Legion to hinder the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from opening to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> Failing thus of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> he got <hi>Nucera</hi> by composition; and returning to <hi>Nola,</hi> knowing the Affection of the Multitude, he sought to draw <hi>Marcellus</hi> out, but was out-witted by him. After this, hearing the Dictator was about <hi>Casiline,</hi> he went to seek him, not liking his being so near <hi>Capua,</hi> where he design'd to Winter; there he attempted <hi>Casilines,</hi> and won it by composition, and upon the Inhabitants departure, put in seven hundred <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for defence of the Campaign, and went to Winter at <hi>Capua.</hi>

               <p n="10">§. 10. <hi>Mago,</hi> Son of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> is sent to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to make report of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s proceedings and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and demand Supplies, which <hi>Hanno,</hi> his old E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy hindred what he could; yet it was agreed to send him Forty Thousand <hi>Numidians,</hi> forty Elephants, and a great store of Silver; and in <hi>Spain</hi> to levy twenty thousand Foot and four Thousand Horse; which Aid was not so well compleated; for only the Elephants and some of the Money was sent.

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64357:205"/>
run over; among other Arguments of improbability, that <hi>Scipio</hi> vanquish'd <hi>Asdrubal</hi> is that Objection of <hi>Fabius,</hi> cited and unanswer'd by <hi>Livy</hi>; if <hi>Asdrubal</hi> were Vanquish'd, how could he invade <hi>Italy</hi> with more than sixty Thousand? In running over the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Actions of <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> I will not insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any that are uncertain. After <hi>Curius Scipio</hi> had done Wonders by Sea and Land, and taken in one hundred and twenty Estates, and driven <hi>Asdrubal</hi> into a Corner to hide himself; and that the <hi>Celtibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> had slain fifteen Thousand, and taken four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> came in with Supplies to help his Brother. These again beat <hi>Asdrubal</hi> by Sea and Land; so that he is forced to write to <hi>Carthage</hi> for Succours; but without any he is commanded to lead his Army forth into <hi>Italy,</hi> which Journey he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for, by great Impositions upon the Spaniard, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing much Treasure. But he cannot so pass, for at <hi>Ibera</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> beat him, take and pillage his Camp, and upon this event, all <hi>Spain</hi> falls off from him, so that he hath small hopes of safety in <hi>Spain,</hi> and much less of Travailing into <hi>Italy.</hi> Of these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, Advertisements are sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Senate, that they have neither Money, Apparel nor Bread for Fleet or Army; so that for want they must leave the Province. These Contents of the Letters suit not well with the Advertisements of such Exploits; and came unseasonably to <hi>Rome,</hi> scarce able, after the loss at <hi>Cannae,</hi> to help it self at home. Yet forsooth, they are supplyed, and again beat <hi>Asdrubal</hi> twice, tho' he had sixty Thousand Men, and with sixteen Thousand, slew forty six Thousand. But according to <hi>Livy,</hi> the next Year, tho' all <hi>Spain</hi> had been twice gotten from the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and that they lost so many thousands, and plunder'd of the Treasure gathered by <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> yet is he able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> and set down by him at <hi>Mons Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriae,</hi> and after removeth to <hi>Illiturgis,</hi> which he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegeth

After all this, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> take <hi>Saguntum,</hi> and destroy the <hi>Turdetans,</hi> which argueth the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were too weak to disturb them, or rather, the <hi>Romans</hi> took it by surprize; for as the many Sieges made by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> argue them Masters of the Field, so the <hi>Romans</hi> consuming a whole Year after, in gaining the <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> and that by express Condition of a great Sum of Money, to make War against the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>; yet if we will believe it, these <hi>Celtiberians</hi> had some Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given Hostages to <hi>Scipio.</hi> With the access of thirty Thousand <hi>Celtiberians,</hi> the two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s seek out the so oft beaten <hi>Carthaginians</hi> (if all former Reports were true) not far off nor so broken, having three Armies led by <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> Son of <hi>Amilcar, Mago,</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> Son of <hi>Gesco; Curius Scipio</hi> undertakes the first; <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> makes haste to the other two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Five Days March off, lest they should run away upon the Report of their Fellows overthrow. But <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Scipio,</hi> with two parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, is met with, and forced to keep his Trenches; and yet not safe in them, steals out by Night, leaving <hi>Fonteius</hi> his Lieutenant with a few to keep the Camp, while he hoped to intercept seven Thousand five hundred <hi>Suessetans,</hi> but being pursued by the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse, was slain. His Brother, twenty seven days after, meeting with <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> is forsaken of his <hi>Celtiberian</hi> Mercenaries, after a violent Flight in which he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken, lost his Life, some few escaping to <hi>T.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> About the same time <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> entred into League with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> of mutual and Personal assisting; the one in Conquest of <hi>Italy</hi> for the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian,</hi> the other of <hi>Greece</hi> for <hi>Philip</hi>: But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposing of Kingdoms is justly controuled by the Divine Providence.

               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> takes in many Towns, some by force, others by surrender, for all the Subjects of <hi>Carthage</hi> wavered: and <hi>Carthage</hi> it self durst not exact Taxes of them whom
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64357:213"/>
they had so often overburthened. It is therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to Fortifie the City, to send for <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and to set out the Fleet against that of <hi>Scipio</hi> before <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>; who perceiving it, hastened thither from <hi>Tunis</hi> to defend them; so they returned, having gotten only six empty Hulks from the <hi>Romans.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Masanissa</hi> recovers his Kingdom, and with <hi>Laelius</hi> proceeds against <hi>Syphax,</hi> who quickly raised as great an Army as his first, which he also lost as soon, with himself and his Kingdom. For being taken, <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi> carried him bound to <hi>Cirta,</hi> his chief City, which presently opened, where <hi>Sophonisba</hi> yielded her self, intreating she might not be delivered to the <hi>Romans</hi>; which suit her Youth and excellent Beauty so recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, that <hi>Masanissa</hi> Married her presently. <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> were afterwards offended with this Marriage, and persuaded <hi>Masanissa</hi> to give her over, for fear she should draw him into the same courses she had drawn <hi>Syphax. Masanissa</hi> to prevent her falling into the <hi>Romans</hi> hands, sent her a Cup of Poison with which she ended her Days: And he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after to prevent the effects of Melancholy for that fact, is comforted by <hi>Scipio</hi> with a Crown, and Proclaimed King.</p>
               <p n="19">§. 19. <hi>Carthage</hi> hearing this bad News, and seeing <hi>Scipio</hi> returned to <hi>Tunis,</hi> are so astonish'd, that they send Thirty of the Princes which were of the Privy Council of the City unto <hi>Scipio,</hi> to beg Peace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, kissing his and his Councils Feet, humbly acknowledging their fault in breaking the former Peace. <hi>Scipio</hi> considering the poor case that <hi>Rome</hi> was in, and the Wealth and Strength of <hi>Carthage,</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the submission, on Condition <hi>Carthage</hi> should call home her Forces in <hi>Italy,</hi> relinquish all the Islands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up all their Ships of War but Twenty, all Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Fugitives, meddle no more with <hi>Spain,</hi> pay a great Sum of Mony, and certain Hundred Thousand Bushels of Corn. These Articles are approved, a
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:64357:213"/>
Truce granted, 'till they send to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Masanissa</hi> sent home to his new Kingdom, as if all were ended; but it appeared after their Ambassadors were come to <hi>Rome,</hi> they only sought to gain time 'till <hi>Hannibal</hi> were come, by whom at least they hope to get a better Peace; the Senate therefore refer all to <hi>Scipio</hi>: But before their return, <hi>Carthage</hi> had seiz'd on the <hi>Roman</hi> Ships, with Provision from <hi>Sicily,</hi> scatter'd by storm, and sought to surprize <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Ambassadors in their return from <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">§. 20. <hi>Hannibal</hi> after his loss at <hi>Metaurus</hi> remained among the <hi>Brutains,</hi> expecting aid from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Mago</hi> with Forces raised in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Liguria,</hi> who also solicited the <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> which caused the <hi>Romans</hi> to employ Three Armies in those Three Countries. <hi>Mago</hi> near <hi>Milan</hi> met with the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces, with which he fought, like a Son of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> but with the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fortune, losing Five Thousand, and himself wounded to death, was forced to retire to <hi>Liguria,</hi> where he found Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to call him home immediately, which he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, but died by the way. <hi>Hannibal</hi> receiv'd the like Message of return, which he heard with such impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that he gnash'd his Teeth, and hardly refraining from Tears, he cried out, that not <hi>Scipio,</hi> but <hi>Hanno</hi> had overthrown the <hi>Barchines</hi> with the ruine of <hi>Carthage</hi>; so he departed, as if it had been to Exile. <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain of his departure, appoint an Holy-day for Thanks to the Gods; but <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> rejoyc'd lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, being in doubt of the issue in <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">§. 21. <hi>Hannibal</hi> Landed in <hi>Africk</hi> at <hi>Leptis,</hi> almost an Hundred Miles from <hi>Carthage,</hi> that marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long he might gather Horses, which he wanted; and <hi>Scipio</hi> sends to <hi>Masanissa</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Company with him to make speed to him, who brought Four Thousand Horse, and Six Thousand Foot. <hi>Laelius</hi> also is returned with the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ambassadors from <hi>Rome,</hi> at which time <hi>M. Baebius</hi> kept the Camp in <hi>Scipio</hi>'s absence. He laid hands on the Ambassadors,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:64357:214"/>
and sent word to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who orders their good u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and sends them home; to shew that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> were less honourable than the <hi>Romans</hi>: Yet he made more cruel War upon them than before, Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Towns he took, refusing all Compositions. <hi>Carthage</hi> hearing this, hasted <hi>Hannibal</hi> to fight; who thereupon Encamped at <hi>Zama,</hi> sent Spies into <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Camp, who being taken, were carried up and down to see what they would, and so sent back. <hi>Hannibal</hi> at this, admir'd his Enemie's brave Courage, and sent to desire an Interview, which <hi>Scipio</hi> granted; but being met, refused to yield to the Peace which <hi>Hannibal</hi> propounded, seeing the Conditions of it were gainful to them, who had so lately broke a Peace made upon other Conditions. So they brake off, and prepare for Battle, which was the next day to try both Skill and Courage, especially of these brave Commanders. They are both in the Field early, set their People in order, and exhort them to Fight; a Noble Match, and seldom seen, whether we regard the two Generals, their Cities, the import of the Battle, and the Armies; though <hi>Hannibal</hi> was over-matched in number, and goodness of Horses, and had only his Rereward of trained Men, which were those brave Souldiers which had follow'd him in <hi>Italy</hi>; all the rest being untrained boisterous <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> except Four Thousand <hi>Macedonians.</hi> The issue was the overthrow of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> of whom Twenty Thousand were slain, and as many taken, with the loss of Fifteen Thousand <hi>Romans</hi> and upwards: Yet the singular Skill that <hi>Hannibal</hi> shewed in this his last Fight, is highly commended by <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi> and was acknowledg'd by <hi>Scipio,</hi> as <hi>Livy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. <hi>Hannibal</hi> with a few Horse came to <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> whence being sent for, he went to <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he tells them plainly, there was no way left but such Peace as could be gotten. Presently after, <hi>Vermina</hi> Son of <hi>Syphax,</hi> who held a good part of his
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64357:214"/>
Father's Kingdom, coming to help when all was lost, was encountred by part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, which slew Fifteen Thousand, and took Twelve Hundred. <hi>Scipio</hi> being come to <hi>Tunis,</hi> is Adored by Thirty <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Ambassadors, in more pitiful manner than before, but less pitied for their former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. Nevertheless <hi>Scipio</hi> considering the tedious Siege of so strong and large a City, and the desires of the other Consuls to get the Honour of ending what remained, he was content to hear them, and to propound such Conditions as he thought good: As delivery of Prisoners, Fugitives, and Renegadoes, all their Gallies but Ten, and all Elephants; make no War without Licence from <hi>Rome,</hi> restore to <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi> what they held from him, or his Ancestors; find Corn for the Army, and pay for Auxiliaries 'till the Peace was Concluded; pay Two Hundred Talents yearly, for Fifty year, and One Hundred Hostages of Choice Men for observance of Conditions. The Conditions were declaim'd against at <hi>Carthage,</hi> but upon <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Speech, Necessity forced them to yield, and send to <hi>Rome,</hi> who sent Ten Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to joyn with <hi>Scipio</hi> to Conclude the Peace, though the Consul <hi>Lentulus</hi> opposed, desiring to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the War in <hi>Africk.</hi> At their coming to <hi>Carthage</hi> all is agreed upon, and the first Two Hundred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to be paid out of private Mens Purses. This was grievous to them, and made some Senators weep, whereat <hi>Hannibal</hi> laughed, as being no cause to weep, in consideration of other Conditions, which touched their Freedom more, tho' less felt by them, and would make them hereafter confess that it was the least part of their Misery for which they now shed Tears. <hi>Scipio</hi> having concluded at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and brought <hi>Masanissa</hi> into the Army, and Honour'd him, he consign'd over to him all the Towns of King <hi>Syphax</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> held, and so left <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Landed in <hi>Sicily,</hi> from whence he went

through <hi>Italy</hi> with part of his Army, in Glory no less than Triumph, with the greatest joy that ever any did, and had the Title of <hi>African</hi> given; which kind of Honour from a Conquer'd Province, grew afterwards in use for less Merit.</p>

               <p n="1">§. 1. SImilitude in Worldly Events, ariseth from limitation of Matter, to which Nature is confin'd, which being <hi>finite,</hi> cannot always produce variable effects, especially in Actions which seem to depend on the Will of Man, which is over-ruled with the same Affections. The <hi>Assyrians</hi> invading the <hi>Medes,</hi> and not prevailing, within a while were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by them; thus it fell out between the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Romans.</hi> For after <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> the <hi>Epirot</hi> had braved the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that they found their Virtue was a Richer Metal than the shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Valour of <hi>Greece,</hi> it was not long before they durst venture upon <hi>Greece,</hi> having beaten him, which in a Year made himself Lord of it, and of <hi>Macedon. Teuta</hi> the <hi>Illyriana</hi> Queen wasting <hi>Greece,</hi> without the least provocation, gave the first occasion, that <hi>Rome</hi> sought acquaintance with <hi>Greece,</hi> offering to Protect it. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> set up <hi>Philip</hi> Son of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> about Seventeen Years Old, who succeeded King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of <hi>Achaea,</hi> and most part of <hi>Greece,</hi> two Years before the second <hi>Punick</hi> War began. In the beginning of his Reign, the <hi>Aetolians</hi> addicted only to War, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the <hi>Messenians</hi> and other parts, and <hi>Peloponesus</hi> twice; of which complaint was made to <hi>Philip,</hi> then
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:64357:215"/>
at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> are accused as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring it in spite of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> and <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> The <hi>Aetolians</hi> declining to appear, War is decreed against them; and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> seem to be excused, but are not trusted. <hi>Philip</hi> prepareth, and draweth those <hi>Illyrians</hi> from the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> which aided the Invasion: The <hi>Achaeans</hi> Proclaim the War, and send to other States to do the like: But the <hi>Epirots, Lacedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Messenians</hi> put it off; and in the end the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who had long Conspired to shake off the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> concluded a League with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and chose new Kings, which they had not done since <hi>Cleomenes</hi> Departed; of these, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was one, who bribed the <hi>Ephori</hi> to Elect him. He Invades the <hi>Argives,</hi> takes two Cities from them; and gains upon the <hi>Arcadians. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> while the <hi>Aetolians</hi> are busie in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> brings his Army to their Borders with the <hi>Epirots,</hi> where to procure a Peace, which the <hi>Epirots</hi> desire, he spent so long a time as broke the Force of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with which he might have ended the War. While he was busie in <hi>Aetolia,</hi> the <hi>Aetolian</hi> Praetor <hi>Scopos</hi> over-ran <hi>Thessaly,</hi> broke into <hi>Macedonia</hi> as far as <hi>Dium,</hi> which he rased; the <hi>Dardanians</hi> also Bordering on the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> hearing of his absence in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> brake into Spoil, as their manner was, which drew him Home. <hi>Demetrius Pharius</hi> chased out of his Kingdom by the <hi>Romans,</hi> met him, and was entertained as his Chief Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor: After which, he stole a Journey into <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponesus</hi> in Winter, while the <hi>Aetolians</hi> and <hi>Eleans</hi> were abroad, and Surprised Two Thousand, took many Towns from the <hi>Eleans,</hi> and <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and their Confederates, and so went to <hi>Argos.</hi>

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64357:216"/>
                  <hi>Philip.</hi> The King, by the grave admonition of <hi>Aratus,</hi> and the example of <hi>Amphitamus,</hi> an <hi>Elean</hi> Captain, discovers <hi>Appelles</hi>'s Malice, who failing of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, designs to be King himself, as the Spider made a Web to take the Swallow which drove the Flies out of the Chimney. He enters upon a Plot against the King how to check the good Success of his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and draws <hi>Leontius</hi> one of the <hi>Targenteers,</hi> and <hi>Megale</hi> the King's chief Secretary, into the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: But the Reward of their Treason was their own Ruin. After this a Peace is Solicited by several Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, to which <hi>Philip</hi> condescended by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of <hi>Demetrius Pharius</hi>; who also persuaded him to a League with <hi>Hannibal.</hi>

               <p n="4">§. 4. <hi>Philip</hi> before his <hi>Italian</hi> Expedition, thought fit in Policy to bring the <hi>Greeks</hi> Associates under a more absolute Form of Subjection, as <hi>Apelles</hi> had formerly advised; but <hi>Demetrius Pharius</hi> could bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter observe the Kings humours, and without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention supplanted <hi>Aratus</hi> with the least Appearance, which <hi>Apelles</hi> could never do by more forceable means. In a Faction between the Nobles and Commons of the <hi>Messenians, Philip</hi> was intreated to compose the difference, of which occasion he was glad, designing to assume the Government into his own hands. But being discovered, he pretended a Sacrifice in the Castle of <hi>Ithome,</hi> and purposed to seize upon it, which <hi>Demetrius</hi> called a <hi>Kingly point not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, for so he should hold the Ox by both his Horns</hi>; meaning that <hi>Ithome</hi> and <hi>Acrocorinthus</hi> were the two Horns of <hi>Peloponesus.</hi> Yet <hi>Philip</hi> asking <hi>Aratus</hi> his Judgment, he was told by him, <hi>that in taking that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle he should lose his strongest Castle, which was his Credit</hi>; upon which he gave over his purpose; but
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64357:216"/>
with secret disgust of <hi>Aratus</hi> and his Son. Next he seized on <hi>Oricum,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Epirots,</hi> his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and besieged <hi>Apolonia,</hi> and so instead of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Country, he kindled that Fire which could never be extinguished till it l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After that, he Invaded the <hi>Messeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with open Force, but in vain; in which At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt he lost <hi>Demetrius</hi>; and afterwards out of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical humour, the worse he sped, the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry he grew against those who seemed not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his injurious doings, as particularly against Old <hi>Aratus</hi> and his Son, whose Poisoning he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured. This was the recompence <hi>Aratus</hi> got for bringing the <hi>Macedonians</hi> into <hi>Peloponesus</hi> in spite of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> his Countryman, and a Temperate Prince.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5.

At this time <hi>Machanidas Lycurgus</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> who entred the Country of the <hi>Mantinaeans,</hi> was Courageously received by <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> and slain with his own hand, and four Thousand with him, and as many taken Prisoners.</p>
               <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>Philip</hi> having made Peace with the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Aetolians,</hi> prepares to invade <hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> Son of <hi>Attalus,</hi> the younger Brother of <hi>Philetarus</hi> the Eunuch, the Treasurer of <hi>Lysimachus</hi> King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> from whom he fled for fear of his Tyranny, and seized upon <hi>Pergamus</hi> and nine Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Talents of <hi>Lysimachus</hi>'s, and Reigned twenty Years, as <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Brothers Son did after him twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two Years, and <hi>Attalus</hi> after him, an active Prince, Bountiful and Valiant. He made use of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> then setled in <hi>Asia,</hi> in that part which is called <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi>;
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:64357:217"/>
and Quarrels with <hi>Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> whose Ancestors began to Reign some Generations before the Great <hi>Alexander.</hi>

               <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>Attalus</hi> and the <hi>Rhodians</hi> solicite <hi>Rome</hi> against <hi>Philip</hi>: So did <hi>Aurelius</hi> their Agent in <hi>Greece</hi>; but <hi>Rome</hi> was not in Condition till <hi>Hannibal</hi> was Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, when the River of <hi>Styx</hi> was dried up, that is, when the necessity of Peace with <hi>Philip</hi> was taken away. <hi>Attalus,</hi> and the <hi>Rhodians</hi> meet the <hi>Roman</hi> Embassadour, while <hi>Philip</hi> winneth <hi>Abidos</hi> in <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">§. 9. <hi>Rome</hi> hearing the Calamity of <hi>Abidos</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling that of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> could not ground a Quarrel thereon, but thinking of another <hi>Saguntum</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> a Confederate, formerly wronged by <hi>Philip,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring their aid, which yet the People denied, till <hi>P.

The King hereupon removed to <hi>Magnesia</hi> on <hi>Sypylus,</hi> and Fortified himself, being followed by the Consul, who offered him Battle, which he would not accept; till at last fearing to dishearten his Men, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul took the Field and set his Men in order, he also did the like, which made an admirable Show for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and variety, through the different manner eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nation used. It is shameful to relate, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to believe, how little resistance this brave Show of <hi>Asiatiques</hi> made, suffering themselves to be slain like so many Beasts, to the Number of Fifty Thousand Foot, and Four Thousand Horse, besides Prisoners, with only the loss of three Hundred <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, Twenty four Horse, and Twenty five of <hi>Eumenes</hi>'s Men. <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> sends from <hi>Apamea,</hi> whither he was fled, an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour with full Power to submit to what the Consul would require, to which <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leave to Answer, because it should be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He requireth Fifteen Thousand Talents to be paid at set times; That <hi>Antiochus</hi> shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all on this side <hi>Taurus,</hi> pay <hi>Eumenes</hi> four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

But in both they were deceived, being unfurnished with Arrows or Slings, or defensive Armour, and so in the end were forced to throw themselves off the

                  <hi>ANtiochus</hi> being Overthrown, <hi>Philip, Eumenes,</hi> and all <hi>Greece</hi> seemed to be Free Men, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by their own Laws; but indeed were absolute Vassals to <hi>Rome,</hi> which of the five Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of an absolute Monarch, or Sovereign Power, <hi>viz. To make Laws, Magistrates, Peace and War, Coyn Money, and receive Appeals,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> had assumed four, especially the greatest, which is Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, and in the other three, interposed her self at Pleasure. Yet <hi>Eumenes</hi> living far off, and the Neighbour Nations not well subdued, and obedient to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was long unquestioned of any thing; as was also <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanissa. Philip</hi>'s Temper was more noble, as he which had not forgot his own former Greatness, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Family, and the high Reputation of his Kingdom. His Magnanimity is construed Want of Reverence to the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness: so that upon the complaint of <hi>Eumenes</hi> and the States of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> he must depart, leaving even those places he had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, by the Consent of <hi>Rome. Lisimachia</hi> the chief City in <hi>Thrace,</hi> having been assistant in <hi>Philip</hi>'s U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation, was destroyed by the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> after he had won <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> both which the <hi>Romans</hi> bestowed upon <hi>Eumenes</hi>: To these <hi>Aenus</hi> and <hi>Maronea</hi> had belonged, both got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Philip,</hi> and Fortified for Guard of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom against the Barbarous <hi>Thracians,</hi> which now <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> beggeth; but the People of these places endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their own Freedom from both. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the <hi>Maronites</hi> so provoked <hi>Philip,</hi> that by <hi>Cassander,</hi> one of his Men in <hi>Maronea,</hi> directed by <hi>Onomastus</hi> his Warden of the Sea Coast, the <hi>Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were let into the Town, which was sackt by

them: And when <hi>Cassander</hi> at the <hi>Romans</hi> demand, was to be sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to be examined about it, he was Poisoned by the Way, according to <hi>Machivel</hi>'s Rule. <hi>Philip</hi> hereby grew further into question at <hi>Rome,</hi> but sent <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Son, who had been Hostage there, and obtained the favour for him to answer. In the mean time the <hi>Roman</hi> Embassadour which had judged between him and his Neighbours, passing through <hi>Greece,</hi> hears of a Controversie between the <hi>Achaeans</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which <hi>Lycortus</hi> the <hi>Achaean</hi> Praetor, told <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> boldly, that it was strange, that the <hi>Romans</hi> should call their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Allies to account, as if they were Vassals. <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> answered like a <hi>Roman</hi> Lord, and threatned to force them, and shortly after, the Senate made void all Judgments of Death, or Banishment given by the <hi>Achaeans</hi> against the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>: And made it a question whether <hi>Lacedemon</hi> should not be made a free State, as of Old: Into this Slavery, had the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> brought all the States near them, which had desired their Patronage, and made them groan under the Yoke. <hi>Demetrius</hi> returned to his Father with desired Peace; more for his own sake than his Fathers, as they wrote to <hi>Philip,</hi> which made the Son insolent, and the Father to hate both them and him.</p>

                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> about the same time was with <hi>Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> to whom <hi>T.

Had <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whose Tragedy we have endeavoured only some hints of, been Prince of <hi>Carthage,</hi> able to command such supplies as the War he took in hand required, it is probable he had torn up the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire by the Roots. But the strong Cowardly Factions of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Home, made his great Virtue (wanting Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Force to sustain it) to dissolve it self in his own and Countries Calamity.</p>
               <p>From such Envy of Equals, or jealousie of our Masters, whether Kings, or Commonwealths, it is, that no Profession is more unprosperous than that of Generals; besides the Rapes, Slaughters, Devasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are so hateful to God, <hi>That were not the Mercies of God infinite</hi> (as <hi>Monluc</hi> Marshal of <hi>France</hi> confessed) <hi>it were in vain for those of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to hope for any portion thereof,</hi> such Cruelties being permitted, or committed by them. And true it is, that as the Victories obtained by so many of the greatest Commanders, are commonly ascribed either to Fortune, or to their Followers, or Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of the vanquished, so the most, whose Virtues have raised them above all Envy, have in the end

After this, the Furies enter his own House, and Vengeance was poured upon him from Heaven in his own Children, as was thought by the jealousie he had of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Younger Son, and the fear <hi>Prusius</hi> had of him for his Interest in the <hi>Romans</hi> Affections.

                  <hi>Masanissa,</hi> had heretofore taken the Country of <hi>Emporia</hi> from <hi>Carthage,</hi> and about this time he took other Land from them by force, about Seventy Towns and Castles, of which, when the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> complained by their Embassadours, prostrate with Tears before the Senate, desiring Right, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to defend themselves against him, or at least to know how far <hi>Masanissa</hi> should be allowed to proceed: And if none of these would be granted, that then the Senate it self would inflict upon them what they thought meet, rather than to keep them in continual fear of this <hi>Numidian</hi> Hangman.

The fear of <hi>Greece,</hi> grew from the timerous demeanour of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus,</hi> whom they secretly affected, but saw his want of resolution would betray them all that declared for them, if he could make his Peace, which even then he sought, when he was in the Field, and his Enemy not in sight.

In this Skirmish <hi>Perseus</hi> slew two Hundred, and took as many, with little loss, and might have distressed the Consuls Camp, if his fear had not baffled his Incouragement by this Success: For the Consul was glad to Decamp at Midnight, to a stronger Place beyond the River. Of all the advantages he had, this weak spirited Man made no other use, than to hope for Peace; though <hi>Licinius</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily told him he should look for none, without an absolute yielding both Person and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

I have considered (saith <hi>Solo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It was Death which forced the Conscience of <hi>Charles</hi> 5th. and made him enjoyn <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, to restore <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>; and <hi>Francis</hi> the First, King of <hi>France,</hi> to command justice to be done upon the Murderers of the Protestants in <hi>Merindol</hi> and <hi>Calabries,</hi> till then neglected. Death alone can make Man know himself; the proud and insolent, that he is but abject, and can make him hate his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past Happiness: The rich Man he proves a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Beggar, which hath interest in nothing but in the Gravel that fills his Mouth; and when he holds the Glass before the Eyes of the most Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, they see and acknowledge their Deformity and Rotteness.
