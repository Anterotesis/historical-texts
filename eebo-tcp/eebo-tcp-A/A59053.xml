            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Know very well the danger of Writing in such an age where the best Wits Chose rather to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erson, then expose their stock of reputation to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick censure. Nor did I design any to my self by this Play: It was originally <hi>Maenanders</hi> in the Greek, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>'s in the Latin; whose great names gave me a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity to try how I cou'd make it run in English: A Friend came to my Chamber as I was upon the first Act, he seem'd to approve my design: I told him I found it extream easie to go through with: And that if he cou'd get it Acted under his own or anothers Name, I wou'd finish it for him: But for I know not what reasons he cou'd not do it; and I was oblidg'd to own it my self, or my friend had lost his third day The whole Play runs upon a Rape committed by a Lover under the disguise of an Eunuch, and an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Keeper, govern'd and Jilted by his Imperious Mistress, which parts were so essential that they cou'd
<pb facs="tcp:62802:3"/>
not be omitted, nor well fitted to our Stage without some expressions or Metaphors, which by persons of a ticklish imagination, or over-quick sense that way, seem'd too lascivious for modest Ears; I confess after the Plays I have seen lately Crowded by that fair Sex: the exception did not a little surprise me; And this suddain change of theirs made me call to mind our English weather, where in the same day a man shall Sweat in Crape, and wish for a Campagn Coat three hours after. I am very unhappy that the Ice that has borne so many Coaches and Carts, shou'd break with my Wheel barrow: I confess to have taken my Idea of Poetry more from the <hi>Latin</hi> than the <hi>French:</hi> and had rather be accus'd of some Irregularities, than tire my Reader or Audience with a smooth even stream of insipid words and accidents; such as one can neither like nor find fault with. But Reader between what will not please, and what will not pass at this time; there is so little left to be said on this or any other Subject, that I will keep thee no longer at the Door. Go in and Judge for thy self, see what the Modesty of this year takes offence at, and I am confident thou wilt with me congratulate the happy change. And yet absolve both the Poet and the Translator from any unpresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented indecency.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Isa.</speaker>
                  <p>And will they Lye too, when they have Sworn?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
                  <p>Most certainly; but we that have experience, mind words no more than they themselv's do, and only regard their Presents. Say a kind thing! every pitiful Fellow can do that: give me a Man that will do a kind thing.</p>

                  <speaker>Dang.</speaker>
                  <p>What ever was bravely perform'd in the Army, I still had the Honour on't; the General wou'd have it so: to others he was not so Favorable.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Smooth.</speaker>
                  <p>He that has your Wit, will make a small Service go a great way; and often Reap in safety, the Fruit of other Mens dangers</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dang.</speaker>
                  <p>Right: Not but I venture my Body as bravely as the meanest Soldier, when the General will let me, but, to say the Truth he seldom will, he loves me so Intirely,</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>'Tis my Comfort, that he that Shoots one Bullet into me, may chance to drive another out. The General wares me next his Heart, and often Trusts the Army to my single Conduct.</p>

                  <speaker>Dang.</speaker>
                  <p>And if at any time he's Tir'd with Impertinence of Suitors; the Noise and tumults Incident to his great Charge; he steals away with a Friend or two to me, there he unfolds his Wrinkled-Brows and Steeps his Cares in Wine within my Tent.</p>

                  <speaker>Dang.</speaker>
                  <p>No Man better. The Officers began to Envy me, and Mutter some od things; speak out the Boldest of'em dare not. How does this Feather become me?</p>

                  <p>Nothing: the whole Company Laugh'd on my side; and he sneak'd away like a Dog, with a Bottle at his Tail.</p>

                  <p>The more I think of <hi>Bellamira</hi>'s sending after me in this manner, the more I am to seek what she means. When I went first to her, she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd me with a deal of Discourse, far fetch'd, nothing to the purpose: At last she ask'd me, how long my Father and Mother had been Dead? I told her, a great while; then if I had not a Seat in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> near the Sea? which I have. May be she has a mind to it, and thinks to get it of me. At last, if I had not lost a young Sister? who she was with, and what she had about her when she was lost? What she ask'd all these Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions for, I cannot guess; unless she wou'd put her self upon me for that Sister, but if she be alive, she cannot be above seventeen; and <hi>Bellarima</hi> is as old as my self. Now she shall speak her mind ploinly, or trouble me no more. Is your Mistress within.</p>

                  <p>There was this day a young Maid given her by <hi>Dangerfield</hi> my Brothers Rival, the finest Creature that ever my Eyes beheld; not above seventeen, a man flying for his Life wou'd stop to gaze upon her.</p>

                  <p>To see her, and be alone sometimes with the Divine Creature: Do you count all that nothing? In short, I was presented to <hi>Bellamira,</hi> and received with great Joy, and without the least Suspicion, she left me at home, and recommended this beautiful Creature to my sole care.</p>

                  <p>You seiz'd the rest somewhat too rudely here:</p>

            <l>LIke a young Wench that cou'd not well forbear,</l>
            <l>And yet is loath her Lewdness shou'd appear.</l>
            <l>Our modest Poet wou'd have made away</l>

            <l>We bid him lay the Bantling at our door</l>
            <l>And for th'event concern himself no more.</l>
            <l>Poets of late with humane Sacrifice</l>
            <l>Have feasted you like Heathen Deities.</l>
            <l>In every Play they serv'd you up a man</l>
            <l>Nay some at Parties and whole Factions ran?</l>
            <l>After such fare, how flat must <hi>Terence</hi> taste?</l>
            <l>Yet his plain Tales have had the luck to last.</l>
            <l>While your fam'd Authors, in their life time wast.</l>
            <l>Ye all cry out the art of Writings lost</l>
            <l>Yet nicer Judgments in perfection boast.</l>
            <l>Strange Stars; malignant to Poetick strains</l>
            <l>Yet so productive of Judicious brains.</l>
            <l>What if you Judge, as ill as others Write?</l>
            <l>And only loath for want of appetite;</l>
            <l>No <hi>Jew</hi> into the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> might come</l>
            <l>That had no Issue of his own at home.</l>
            <l>For barrenness supposes cruelty</l>
            <l>No Childless man, might others Children try.</l>
            <l>This wholesome Law wou'd save us from the spight</l>
            <l>Of all the furious Wits that cannot Write.</l>
            <l>And you that do, we shou'd not fear your doom</l>
            <l>If you'd Judge here but as you Judge at home;</l>
            <l>Now Gallants most of you are so well bred</l>
            <l>
               <hi>French</hi> has long since chas'd <hi>Latin</hi> from your head</l>
