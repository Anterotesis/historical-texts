            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>COme on ye Doctors, if yé are in the right, then give answer to the Spirit; What do you think stood in the place of this world before the time of the World? <hi>2ly,</hi> Out of what do you think the Earth and Stars came to be? <hi>3dly,</hi> What is that in man that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaseth God so much, that he tormenteth and afflicteth man so, being he hath created him? And <hi>4thly,</hi> That he imputeth Sin to man, and condemneth him to eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? <hi>5thly,</hi> Why hath he created that wherein or wherewith Man committeth sin? <hi>6thly,</hi> What is the cause or the beginning, or the birth and geniture of Gods fierce Wrath, out of or from which Hell and the Devil are come to be? <hi>7thly,</hi> Or how comes it that all Creatures in this world do bite, scratch, strike beat and worry one another, and yet sin is imputed only to man? <hi>8thly,</hi> Out of what are the venomous and poysonous Beasts, and Worms and all manner of Vermine come to be? <hi>9thly,</hi> Out of what are the holy Angels come to be? <hi>10thly,</hi> What is the Soul of man? And <hi>lastly,</hi> What is the great GOD himself, and how is he in Love and Wrath?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:39064:4"/>If you can demonstrate that God is not in the Stars, Elements, Earth, Men, Beasts, Worms, Leaves and Grass, also in Heaven and Earth; also, that all this is not God himself, &amp; that my Spirit is false and wicked, then I will be the first that will burn my Book in the fire, and recall and recant all whatsoever I have written, and will accurse it, and in all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence willingly submit my self to be instructed by you.</p>
            <p>I do not say, that I cannot err at all; for there are some things which are not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, and are described, as it were, from a glimpse of the great God, when the Wheel of Nature whirled about too swiftly, so that man with his half dead and dull capacity or apprehension cannot sufficiently compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</p>
            <p>Now it concerns every one that will speak or teach of divine Mysteries, that he have the Spirit of God, and know in the Light of God those matters which he will give forth for true, and not suck or draw them from his own reason, and so without divine knowledge run upon the bare Letter in his opinion, and drag the Scriptures (as it were) by the hair of the head, to prove it, as is usually done by reason.</p>
            <p>From this, so exceeding many Errors are arisen, in that the divine knowledge hath been
<pb facs="tcp:39064:5"/>
sought in mens own wit and art, and so men are drawn from the Truth of God in their own Reason.</p>
            <p>And though I search sublimely and deep, and shall set it down very clearly, yet this must be said to the <hi>Reader,</hi> that without the Spirit of God it will be a Mystery to him and hidden from him: Therefore let every one take heed how he judgeth, that he fall not into the judgment of God.</p>
            <p>Every one will not understand my Writings according to my meaning and sense, but every one according to his gift for his benefit, one more than another, according as the Spirit hath its property in him.</p>
            <p>For the spirit of God is often subject to the spirits of men, if they will that which is good or well, and seeth or looketh af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>For if God should be angry in himself, then the whole Nature would be on fire, which will come once to pass in the last day in Nature, and not in God. But in God the triumphing Joy will burn; it was never otherwise from Eternity, nor will it ever be otherwise.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, Prince <hi>Lucifer</hi> this high and mighty glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beautious King lost his right Name in the fall. He was created according to the quality, beauty and condition of God the Son, and was bound to and united with him in Love, and his Heart also stood in the centre of Light, as if he had been God himself, and his Beauty and Brightness well transcended all. For his circumference Conception or chiefest Mother was the Son of God—his Court, Province, Place or Region wherein he dwelt with his whole Army or Company, and wherein he is become a Creature, and which was his Kingdom, is the created Heaven, and this World wherein we dwell with our King Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>For our King sitteth in divine Omnipotence, where King <hi>Lucifer</hi> did sit, and on the kingly Throne of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and the Kingdom of King <hi>Lucifer</hi> is now become his.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Lucifer</hi> had still been an Angel, if his own Will had not introduced him into the Pires Might, desiring to domineer in the strong fiery Might.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>URIEL</hi> is a gracious aimable blessed Prince and King, he hath his Name from the flash, or going forth of the Light, which signifieth rightly God the holy Ghost.</p>

                     <p>These three Kingdoms together contain such a deep. as is not of any human number, nor can be measured by any thing; yet you must know, that these three Kingdoms have a beginning and end; but that God that hath made these three Kingdoms out of himself, is infinite and hath no end.</p>
                     <p>And the three Kingdoms are circular, round about the Son of God, neither of them is further or nearer to the Son of God, for the one is equally as near about the Son of God as the other.</p>
                     <p>From this Fountain, and from all the Powers of the Father goeth forth the Holy Ghost, together with the Light and Power of the Son of God, in and through all Angelical Kingdoms or Dominions, and without, beyond, and besides all the Angelical Kingdoms, which no Angel or man is able to search or dive into.</p>
                     <p>Neither have I any purpose to consider of it further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much less to write; but my Revelation reacheth even into the three Kingdoms, like an Angelical Knowledge.</p>

                     <p>VVe understand that evil and good Angels dwell near to one another. and yet there is the greatest immense distance [between them] for the Heaven is in Hell and the Hell is in Heaven, and yet the one is not manifest to the other; and although the Devil should go many Millions of Miles, desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>For we know that every Substance sigheth after that out of which it had its first Original; and so our Will sigheth after such a Flesh as God created.</p>
                     <p>So we clearly understand that we are gone forth out of the Eternal into the Corruptible: For <hi>Adam'</hi>s imagination hath drawn the earthly Quality of the Stars and four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the Limus, and the Stars and Elements have drawn in the longing Malady of the Earth. And thus the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Matter of the heavenly Flesh became earthly.</p>
                     <p>The true <hi>Ens</hi> of the Soul, which the Word assumed in the Name Jesus, was of us men from the Female tincture, <hi>viz.</hi> from the true <hi>Adamical</hi> Soul, yet from the Property of the Light, which was severed from <hi>Adam</hi> and put into the Woman, that this Property of the Light might transmute or change the fiery Masculine property again into the Love and divine Humility, and that the Masculine and Feminine property might be quite changed into one Image again, as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his <hi>Eve,</hi> when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Therefore Christ took his Soul from a Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> from a Virgin, and yet was a Man; so that he rightly stood in the <hi>Adamical</hi> Image, and brought the averted severed Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Life, in which our Will had broken it self off from God again into the temperature and union. <hi>viz.</hi> into that one.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Adam</hi> turned his Will from the only Will of God, and Jesus Christ took our Soul again into the only Will of God, and turned the will of our Soul in our Humanity, which he assumed into the only will of God again.</p>
                     <p>We poor Children of <hi>Eve</hi> should not in Eternity, as to the Body, have returned again, but our Soul would have eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued in God's anger, source or quality with all Devils.</p>
                     <p>But the becoming Man, or Incarnation of Jesus Christ is become a powerful Substance or Matter to us; for, for our sakes is God become Man, that he might bring our Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity out of Death into himself, and redeem or release our Soul out of the Fire of God's anger.</p>

                     <p>Also it is plain and clear enough, that [as Jesus ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Heaven, so] he will come again in the same Form at the last Day with a divine and glorified Body, as a Prince of the holy Angels, which shall be the men Angels.</p>
                     <p>Also, we know the becoming Man, or Incarnation of Christ to be natural, as of all the Children of men, the Lord gave himself to be under the Servant, that the Servant might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come living, and is in like manner in nine Months become a perfect man, and also continueth a true God—become born into the world through that way and passage as all men are.</p>

                     <p>Consider the first four Forms of Nature, and you will understand what the Devil's Mansion is; for before Christ came, he kept the Soul captive in the <hi>Turba</hi> with the Fire, and though he had not the Spirit of the Soul, yet he had the Root of it in the <hi>Turba,</hi> but then he was commanded to cease.</p>

                     <p>The Soul eats spiritual Meat, namely of the Spirit, of the Image of the Complexions, not altogether their Essence, but magically; it is the kindling of their Fire.

Now the Fire must have fewel, <hi>viz.</hi> either the outward Complexion, or a divine Essentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of God's Nature, of one of these must it eat or dye, but 'tis not possible for it to perish, seeing it is a desire, and where there is a desiring there is also a beeing, the desire makes a beeing to it self.</p>
                     <p>By this we understand, whence ariseth such a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Wills and Actions of men: For what the Soul eats, and wherein its Fire-life is kindled thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, doth the life of the Soul exercise its Regiment.</p>
                     <p>If the Soul goes out of its Complexion, into God's Love-fire into the heavenly Essentiality [which is Christ's corporiety, according to the Angelical light-world] then it eats of Christ's heavenly Flesh, of his eternal Essentiality, of the mildness of the majestick Light, in which the Fire of God the Father in the glance [resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Light] makes a Tincture in the same Essentiality in the Water-fountain of everlasting Life, whereof Christ speaks, saying, that he would give us such water to drink.</p>
                     <p>When the Soul eats of God's word, the Complexion, according to the outward Life, becomes powerful, and as it were captive, though it live in it self. But the Soul is so stedfast and faithful before God's love, which alone comes to help it [in the combat] that oft when it eats of God's love and essence, then it induceth a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and a divine taste into the Complexion it self, that the whole Body begins to be rouzed up into a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and height of Joy, as if <hi>Paradise</hi> were now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching; but his condition proves not durable, for the Soul is shortly after over-shadowed with something of another Nature, which is insinuated into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion by the outward imagination, by the Spirit of the great World, whereof the Soul makes a Looking-glass. and begins to contemplate in it with its outward Imagination.

                     <p>THe great <hi>Turba</hi> [or <hi>Turba Magna</hi>] is the stirred and awakned wrath of the inward ground, when the foundation of Hell is made manifest in the Spirit of this world, from whence great Plagues &amp; Diseases arise; and it is also the awakned wrath of the outward Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as may be seen in great tempests of Thunder and Lightning, when the Fire is manifested [or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated] in Water: In brief, it is the effusion of the anger of God, by which Nature is disturbed.</p>
                     <p>Often times the Children of God have been forced to carry the Sword of the <hi>Turba</hi> in them; a great example whereof we see in <hi>Sampson,</hi> and also in <hi>Joshua</hi> with his Wars, and likewise in <hi>Abraham</hi> [and many other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets] how the zeal of God did enkindle it self in them, that they in the Spirit of Zeal have often-times awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the <hi>Turba Magna</hi> in the anger of God, and raised great Rebukes, Judgments and Plagues upon whole Countries, as <hi>Moses</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> did with his Plagues upon the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>

From hence have proceeded those various and innumerable <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But I, perswaded by Reasons of another nature, do verily believe, that there is nothing more pernitious, nothing more destructive to the well-being of men, or to the Salvation of our Souls, than the Arts &amp; Sciences themselves—all Sciences are as well evil as good, &amp; they bring no other advantage to excel as <hi>Deities,</hi> more than what the Serpent promised of Old, when he said, <hi>Ye shall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</hi> Let him therefore glory in this Serpent, who boasts himself in Knowledge, which we read the Heresie of the <hi>Ophites,</hi> not a little unbeseemingly to have done, who worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a Serpent among the rest of their Superstitions, as being the Creature that first introduced the knowledge of Virtue into <hi>Paradise</hi>—But suppose there were no other inventors of Arts than men themselves, yet were they the Sons of the worst Generation, even the Sons of <hi>Cain,</hi> of whom it is truly said, <hi>The Sons of this World are wiser than the Sons of Light in this Generation</hi>—But if God and just men be the professors of Knowledge, than Arts and Sciences may probably become useful to the publick-weal, though they render their professors no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more happy. Nor doth it follow that the Sciences themselves have any thing of Virtue, any thing of Truth in them, but what they reap and borrow from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors and Professors thereof; for if they light upon an evil Person, they are hurtful, as a perverse <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian,</hi>

                        <hi>Next, I considered the twelve Constellations or Signs of the</hi> Zodiack, <hi>and finding each Sign to be made up by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Stars, which Stars, though fixed, in respect to the distance from each other, yet they in general have such a motion as moves them a Degree in about 70 Years (as I remember) by means of which motion the Signs consequently are much altered from what they were in the time of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and yet Astrologers in this Age retain the same limits, for the beginning and end of each Sign, as the Antients did, for they now begin the Sign ♈ at the Vernal</hi> Equinox, <hi>though 'tis apparent to all Astronomers, that the Sign ♈</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Ram, <hi>is removed near the length of a whole Sign from the said</hi> Equinox, <hi>and the Sign</hi> Pisses, <hi>viz. the Constellation of the</hi> Fishes <hi>is got into the place of the</hi> Ram <hi>(or limits of ♈ afore said.) Now ♈</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Ram <hi>is termed hot and dry,</hi> Cholerick Masculine, <hi>and</hi> Pistes <hi>the</hi> Fishes <hi>cold and moist,</hi> Plegmatick Feminine <hi>(two opposite Qualities) hence that place in the Heavens limitted for the Sign ♈, must be cold and moist, because the</hi> Fishes, <hi>from whence the said li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit assumes its Nature, is got into the limits of the Sign ♈, and yet Astrologers following Tradition, or something else as bad, call it hot and dry; the like is to be understood of others of the Signs: Here I began to perceive the cause of the manifold Errors of Astrologers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But while I was searching learned Authors, to find whence this Art did arise, I found <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> (in his Vanity of Sciences, before mentioned) to assert that the twelve Signs, with the Northern and Southern Constellations, got all into the Heavens by the help of Fables and Fictions, invented by the <hi>Poets;</hi> which asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Agripp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I will now leave, and come next to the Table of essential Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Planets, invented ('tis said) by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and acknowledged for rational by our <hi>English</hi> Astrologers; he there places the Planet ♂ in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:39064:67"/>
essential Dignities more then he hath in any other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and yet I know no reason for it; for Reason tells me, that ♂ is more essentially strong in fiery Signs as being agreeable to his own Nature. Other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars I could instance of this Table, as being groundless, but let these motions stir up the more Judicious to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Now 'tis very probable that hence might arise those srivolous Inventions of consulting the Figure of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception with Revolutions, Prosections, &amp; <hi>c.</hi> which have no rational Foundation; for finding their Judgment fail, they fell to inventi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>THe greatest Trust between man, is the Trust of giving Counsel. For in other Confidences, men commit the parts of their Life, their Lands, their Goods, their Child, their Credit, some particular Affair. But to such as they make their Counsellors, they commit the whole; by how much the more they are oblig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d to all Faith and Integrity. The wisest Princes need not think it any deminution to their Greatness, or derogation to their Sufficiency to relie on Counsel. God himself is not without, but hath made it one of the great Names of his blessed Son. The Counsellor <hi>Solomon</hi> hath pronounced, <hi>That in Counsel there is safety.</hi> Things will have their first or second Cogitations: If they be not tossed upon the Arguments of Counsel, they will be tossed upon the Waves of Fortune, and be full of Inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, doing and undoing, like the reeling of a drunken man. <hi>Solomon's</hi> Son found the force of Counsel, as his Father found the necessity of it. For the beloved Kingdom of God was first rent and broken by ill Counsel: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel there are set for our Instruction, the two marks, whereby bad Counsel is forever best discerned, that is, young Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel for the Persons, and violent Counsel for the Matter. There is, that are in their Natures faithful, and sincere, and plain, and direct, not crafty and inva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ued: Let Princes above all, draw to themselves such Natures. The true composition of a Counsellor is to be rather skilful in his Masters business, then in his Nature; for then he is like to advise him, and not to feed his Humour. It is of singular use to Princes, if they take the opinion of their Council, both seperately, and together; for private Opinion is more free, but Opinion before others, is more reverent. In private, men are more bold in their own Humours; and in Consort, men are more Obnoxious to others Humours. Therefore it is good to take both; and of the inferior sort rather in private, to preser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

Respect. It is in vain for Princes to take Counsel concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matters, if they take no Counsel likewise concerning Persons; for all matters are as dead Images, and the life of the execution of Affairs resteth in the good choice of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Books will speak plain, when Counsellors blanch. Therefore it is good to be conversant in them, especially the Books of such as themselves have been actors upon the Stage.</p>

                  <p>AFfected Dispatch is one of the most dangerous things to Business that can be. Therefore measure not Dispatch by the times of sitting, but by the Advancement of Business. I knew a wise man had it for a By-word, when he saw men hasten to a Conclusion: <hi>Stay a while, that we may make an end the sooner.</hi> On the other side, true dispatch is a rich thing; for Time is the measure of Business, as Money is of Wares; and Business is bought at a dear rate, where there is small dispatch. Give good hearing to those that give the first Information in Business, and rather direct them in the beginning, then interrupt them in the continuance of their Speeches: For he that is put out of his order, will go forward and backward, and be more tedious by parcels, then be could have been at once. But sometimes it is seen, that the Moderator is more troublesome then the Actor. Iter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are commonly loss of time, but there is no such gain of Time as to iterate often the state of the Question; for it chaseth away many a srivolous Speech, as it is coming forth: Long and curious Speeches are as sit for dispatch as a Robe or Mantle, with a long Trane, is for a race. There be three parts of Business, the Preparation, the Debate or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and the Perfection. Whereof if you lock for Dispatch, let the middle only be the work of many, and the first and last the work of few.</p>

For whereas it hath been well said, That the Arch-flatterer, with whom all the petty Flatterers have Intelligence, is a man's self; certainly the Lover much more. For there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself, as the Lover doth of the Person loved; and therefore it was well said, That it is impossible to love, and to be wise. Neither doth this weakness appear to others only, and not to the Person loved, but to the loved most of all, except the love be Reciproque. For it is a true Rule, that Love is either rewarded with Love again, or with an inward and secret Contempt. By how much the more men ought to beware of this Passion, that loseth not only other thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This Passion hath its Floods in the very time of weakness, which are great Prosperity, and great Adversity (though this later hath been less observed) both which times kindle Love, and make it more fervent, and therefore shew it to be the Child of Folly. They do best that make this Affection keep Quarter, and sever it wholly from their serious Affairs and Actions of their Life; for if it check once with Business, it troubleth mens Fortunes, and maketh men that they can be no way true to their own ends.</p>

                  <p>A Man that is young in Years, may be old in Hours; if he have lost no time: But that happens rarely. Generally, Youth is like the first Cogitations, not so wise as the second: for there is a Youth in Thoughts, as well as in Ages. Natures that have much Heat, and great violent Desires and Perturbations, are not ripe for Action till they have past the meridian of their Years: But reposed Natures may do well in Youth: As on the other side, Heat and Vivacity in Age is an excellent composition for Business.

The Errors of young men are the ruin of Business: But the Errors of aged men amount to this, That more might have been done, or sooner. Certainly, it is good to compound Imployments of both for that will be good for the present, because the Virtue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Stars of natural Inclination are sometimes obscured by the sun of Discipline and Virtue. Therefore it is good to consider of Deformity, not as a sign, which is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable, but as a cause, which seldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ailteh of the Effect. Deformed persons are extream bold; first, as in their own defence, as being exposed to scorn; but in process of time by a general Habit. Also it stirreth in them Industry, and specially of this kind, to watch and observe the weaness of others, that they may have somewhat to repay. They will, if they be of Spirit, seek to free themselves from Scorn, which must be either by Virtue or Malice; and therefore they prove either the best of People, or the worst, or strangly mixed.</p>

The ingagement of Words are not so forceable as Custom: A man would wonder to hear men profess, protest, engage, give great Words, and then do just as they have done before, as if they were dead Images and Engines, moved only by the Wheels of Custom. 'Therefore since Custom is the principal Magistrate of man's Life, let men by all means seek to obtain good Customs. Certainly, Custom is more perfect when it begins in young Years, this we call Education, which is nothing but an early Custom.

Nature is often hidden, sometimes overcome, seldom extinguished; Force maketh Nature more violent in the return: Doctrine and Discourse make Nature less importune, but Custom only doth alter and subdue Nature.

And the most frequent of external Causes, is that the Folly of one man is the Fortune of another; for no man prospers so suddainly as by others Errors. If a man look sharply and accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, he shall see Fortune; for though she be blind, yet she is not invisible. Certainly, there be not two more fortunate Porperties, then to have a little of the Fool, and not too much of the Honest. Therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream lovers of their Country or Masters, were never fortunate, neither can they be. For when a man placeth his Thoughts without himself, he goeth not his own way. All wise men, to decline the envy of their own Virtues, use to ascribe them to Providence and Fortune, for so they may the better assume them.

                  <p>STudies serve for Delight, for Ornament, and for Ability; their chief use for delight, is in private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and retiring: for Ornament, is in Discourse: and for Ability, is in Judgment. For expert men can exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute men, but learned men are fittest to judge and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

Read not to contradict, nor to believe, but to weigh and consider. Some Books are to be tasted, and others to be swallowed. Reading makes a full man, Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence a ready man, and Writing an exact man: And therefore if a man Write little, he had need have a great Memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present Wit; &amp; if he read little, he had need have much Cunning, to know that he doth not. Histories make men wise, Poets witty, the Mathematicks súbtil, natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy deep, Morral grave, Logick and Rhetoricks able to contend. There is no stand or impediment in the Wit, but may be brought out by fit Stud es, like as Diseases of the Body may be apropriate Exercises. Shouting is good for the Lungs and Breast, gentle walking for the Stomach, Riding for the Head and the like. So if a man's Wit be wandring, let him study the Mathematick; if his Wit be not apt to distinguish, or find differences, let him study the School-men; if it be not apt to bear over matters &amp; to find out Resemblances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>HE that is only real, had need have exceeding great parts of Virtue. To attain good Forms, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not to despise them, for so shall a man observe them in others; and let him trust himself with the rest. For if he care to express them, he shall lose their grace; which is to be natural and unaffected. Not to use Ceremonies at all, is to teach others not to use them again, and so diminisheth Respect; especially they be not to be omitted to Strangers, and formal Natures. Amongst a man's Peers, a man shall be sure of Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and therefore it is good a little to keep state. Amongst a man's Inferiors one shall be sure of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and therefore it is good a little to be familiar. He that is too much in any thing, so that he giveth another occasion of Society, maketh himself cheap. It is a good Precept generally in seconding another; yet to add somewhat of one's own; as, if you will grant his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, let it be with some distinction; if you will follow his motion, let it be with condition; if you allow his Counsel let it be with alledging further Reason. Men had need beware how they be too perfect in Complements.

                  <p>IT is generally better to deal by Speech, then by Letter, and by the mediation of a third, then by a man's self; Letters are good when a man would draw an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer by Letters back again, or when it may serve for a man's Justification, afterwards to produce his own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or where it may be danger to be interrupted, on heard by pieces. To deal in Person is good, when a mans Face breeds regard; as commonly with Inferiors, or in tender cases, where a mans Eye, upon the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of him with whom one speaketh, may give him a direction how far to go; and generally, where a man will reserve to himself Liberty, either to disavow or to expound. It is better to sound a Person with whom one deal afar off, then to fall upon the Point at first, except you mean to surprise him by some short Question. It is better dealing with men in Appetite, then with those which are where they would be. In choice of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments [for dealing] it is better to chuse men of plainer sort that are like to do that that is committed to them, and to report back again faithfully the Success, then those that are cunning, to contrive out of other mens Business somewhat to grace themselves, and will help the matter in Report for satisfaction sake. All Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is to discover, or to work. Men discover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Trust, in Passion, at unawares and of necessity when they would have somewhat done, and cannot find

If you would work any man, you must either know his Manner and Fashions, and so lead him or his ends, and so perswade him or his weakness, or disadvantage, and so awe him, and so govern them.
