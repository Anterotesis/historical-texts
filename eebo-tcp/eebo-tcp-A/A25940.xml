            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the Sentence which paſt upon TITUS OATES (Upon Conviction of Horrid Perjuries) At the Kings <hi>Bench-Bar,</hi> 
               <date>Saturday <hi>May 16th.</hi> 1685.</date> ALSO, <hi>A Relation of his Behavior in the</hi> Kings Bench-priſon <hi>ever ſince his Convictions,</hi> (viz.) <hi>May</hi> 8, <hi>&amp; 9.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>YOu lately had ſome account of his <hi>Convictions for Perjury,</hi> and alſo the clear proof that was againſt him; But here (together with an account of his <hi>Puniſhment,</hi>) is a true Relation of his Behaviour both Then, and ſince, <hi>(viz.)</hi> He was firſt brought by Coach from the <hi>Priſon</hi> with a ſtrong Guard, and carry'd to the <hi>Sun Tavern</hi> in K. <hi>ſtreet,</hi> where he ſtaid till the Court ſat; then to the <hi>Hall</hi> where (during the whole Tryal) he behav'd himſelf moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently: Then he return'd to the ſame Houſe, and refreſht himſelf; From thence he took Coach for his return to <hi>Priſon,</hi> but the Rabble ſoon eſpy'd him, and follow'd him with huge Exclamation, crying aloud, <hi>Hang the Rogue, let him go no further; O the bloody Villain that hath been the death of ſo many Innocent Men, beſides the Ruine of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor Families;</hi> and ſo continued till they came to <hi>Ivey bridge</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> where they began to abuſe the very Officer that guarded him from their Fury, inſomuch, that with hazard of their own lives; they got him out of the Coach, and clapt him into the next <hi>Boat,</hi> and ſo got him ſafe to the Priſon; where he no ſooner came, but he again began his old way of Railery againſt the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was in ſo great paſſion, that for that Night he ſlept little; And the next morning being brought up by Water, (for they would not venture themſelves by Land,) and catry'd to the ſame Houſe, he ſtill retain'd his old Impudence, and carry'd it along with him even into the very <hi>Court,</hi> as appear'd by his <hi>impertinent Queſtions,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi> upon thoſe worthy Perſons who gave Teſtimony againſt him. Upon the ſecond Conviction, he withdrew again to the <hi>Sun-tavern,</hi> where, to avoid the tumult, they ſtaid ſomewhat late, then ſlipt him into a Boat, and ſo conduct him ſafe to the Priſon; where he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſullen, and more abuſive than ever, his old Cronies hardly eſcaping his ill language, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He held up his Table daily to Two good Diſhes, and a plentiful ſupply of good Liquors, often ſaying, <hi>They ſhall never make him refrain his Meat and Drink,</hi> &amp;c. He is grown very malitious, inſomuch that they watch him every night, leaſt he may have hid a remnant of the <hi>Poiſon</hi> he gave the Keepers Dog; But as for the 35 Fathom of Rope, That is reſerv'd for him, againſt he has occaſion to make uſe of part of it.</p>

            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>16th.</hi> inſtant, this famous <hi>ſwearing-maſter</hi> was again brought by Water to the <hi>Sun-tavern,</hi> and as ſoon as the Court ſat, was brought in; where he ſeem'd ſomewhat abated of his former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, and pretended Four ſeveral <hi>Errors,</hi> (as he would have them) and beg'd time for 3, or 4, days to Argue them; But was Anſwer'd he had longer time than the Court uſually allow'd; Then he beg'd till <hi>Monday,</hi> but that the Court did not allow, being altogether Impracticable; Then the <hi>L. C. J.</hi> moſt Learnedly ſet forth the Sin of <hi>Perjury,</hi> as alſo the <hi>dreadful Conſequences,</hi> and Dire Effects it lately wrought upon theſe 3 Kingdoms; telling them, that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, <hi>Perjury</hi> was preſent Death; But after (for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,) was mitigated to <hi>cutting</hi> the <hi>Tongue,</hi> &amp;c. But ſince That, it was again mitigated, not but the Crime was as great as ever; It ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being ſuppos'd that any Perſon could be ſo damnably Impudent, as falſly to <hi>ſwear</hi> any Man out of his very <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Eſtate.</hi> When this was ended, they pronounc'd Sentence, which was thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he ſhould for ever be Degraded, and forthwith ſtript of all his Prieſtly Habits.</p>
