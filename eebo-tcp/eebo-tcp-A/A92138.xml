         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is ſaid, <hi>That all this is but a Plea for a Dominion of an higher Nature, even over the Conſciences of men by Cenſures.</hi> But why a Dominion? Becauſe a power of Cenſures?

            <p>If the will of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> may carve out any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that ſeems good to him, and the Word of God in this plea be laid aſide, as perfect in Doctrine, but imperfect and uſeleſſe in Government, we fall from the Cauſe.

And whether doth the Head of the <hi>Church Chriſt, in laying Judgement to the Line, and Righteouſneſſe to the Plummet,</hi> uſe the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> Sword for a Spiritual and Supernatural end of the Service and Miniſtery of his Church; or doth he ſend Paſtors and Teachers as his Ambaſſadors for this end? <hi>But if you were not Diſputing your ſelf, and not Chriſt</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>to make Preachers the Alpha and Omega of mens Conſciences, and the Circle which beginneth and endeth at it ſelf, you would be ſatisfied, if Scandals be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate: Is not the Magiſtrate a Chriſtian as you are?</hi> Paul <hi>was glad</hi>

               <hi>that the Goſpel was Preached, he made no account by whom.</hi> But I ſhould be grieved that ſuch a hard concluſion ſhould be drawn out of ſuch innocent Principles: This were to extract Blood out of Milk, a <hi>Domination</hi> out of a meer <hi>Miniſtery;</hi> and I confeſſe, <hi>Self</hi> is a great Sophiſt in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and that any man is inclinable to miſcount him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to think he may ſtand for an hundred, when the product is ſcarce one, if not a cypher. I conceive nothing is here taught, that may reach a blow to the Honour and Majeſty of the <hi>Godly Magiſtrate.</hi> The <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> as well as the <hi>Preacher;</hi> and in ſome ſenſe, ſo all <hi>the People were holy, as were Moſes, Aaron</hi> and the <hi>Levites. Uzziah</hi> who burned Incenſe was a Member of the <hi>Church of the Jews,</hi> and Circumciſed no leſſe then the Sons of <hi>Aaron:</hi> Yet I hope theſe ſtretched themſelves beyond their line, when they uſurped what was due to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites.</hi> Its another thing to puniſh evil doing with the Sword, the Magiſtrate is to do this. But there is a Spiritual removing of Scandals, by <hi>the ſaving of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the day of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 5. Matth. 18. 15. 2 Cor. 10. 8. and a gaining of the Soul of an Offender. This Spiritual removing of Scandals, doth only bring Chriſt and the Goſpel in requeſt, in the hearts of both ſuch as are within and without the Church; as Scandals raiſeth up an evil report of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Truth.</hi> Now the Sword can never this way remove Scandals; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath appointed Spiritual means, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Cenſures, to reſtore the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> to his Honour, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. It is preſumption (with all ſubmiſſion I ſpeak it) for men to horſe out, and decourt ſuch Cenſures Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual as the Apoſtles in the Spirit and Wiſdom of Chriſt uſed as moſt ſutable to that end, and which the Lord commandeth in the ſecond Command, and to ſubſtitute

in their room, nothing but a Sword void of all activity on the Conſcience.</p>
            <p>I do alſo here plead for the perfection of the Word of God againſt Humane Ceremonies, which are deſervedly by the Honorable Houſes of Parliament, and Reverend Aſſembly laid aſide; <hi>Religion</hi> needeth not any ſuch Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except men would make the Worſhip of God, when naked, under ſhame, and ſo under ſin (for Juſtice Married ſhame and ſin once.) But as Roſes, Lillies, the Sun, and other glorious Creatures, are moſt beautiful without Garments, and not capable of ſhame; ſo is the Worſhip of God. I confeſſe, Ceremonies were the Seas and Rivers that Prelats delighted to ſwim in; and if their Element be dried up, they have the leſſe pleaſure to live: But if they would repent of their bloody Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, that their Souls might be ſaved, no matter. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as they have nothing of Chriſt in them, ſo have they been injurious to Magiſtrates. It is but a Ceremony that the Emperour kiſſe the ſole of the Popes foot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is indented on it a curious Crucifix. And when Prelacy was yong, and its beard not grown, a Deacon was ſent to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor by the Prelats to chide him, becauſe he preſumed to ſit in the <hi>Chancel,</hi> a place too holy for Lay-men.</p>
            <p>What I have here ſaid againſt <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> a friend too dear to worthy <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Rodolp. Gualther,</hi> (often we love both the Friend and his Error) I humbly ſubmit to the Judgement of the Godly and Learned: But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I am unwilling that Error ſhould lodge with me willingly; and I profeſſe I am afraid, that wrath is gone out from the Lord againſt the Rulers, if they ſhall after a Reformation obtained with the Lives, Blood, Tears and Prayers of ſo many of the Saints, whereof a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:113466:17"/>
is both the time of Worſhip, and Worſhip it ſelf. So there is place of Worſhip, and there is ſuch a Religious place, <hi>The holy of holieſt,</hi> the Temple. A habit is a meer accident of Worſhip, the perſon, <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Thomas,</hi> is alſo an accident; but if God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuch an <hi>Ephod</hi> as <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Prieſts were to wear, this is not a meer circumſtance; that the perſon who adminiſtreth the Lords-Supper, be <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Thomas,</hi> is a meer circumſtance; but that this perſon be a called Paſtor, not a private man, is more then a circumſtance. And therefore theſe circumſtances, taken in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and their Univerſall nature, are meerly <hi>Phyſicall circumſtances;</hi> but taken in their particular and determinate reſtrictions, as ſuch circumſtances, they may be meerly Morall circumſtances, ſuch as are the common adjunct of the time of Worſhip, the place, and the Sabbath time and the Temple for Iewiſh Worſhip. The former are circumſtances meerly Phyſicall, the latter meerly Morall; I mean, as they are reſtricted other wayes: The Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſerved as our meeting places do, to ſence off the injuries of Heaven and Sun; but that is as a place, not as ſuch a place.</p>
                     <p>3. There be ſome <hi>mixt circumſtances,</hi> as theſe ſame Phyſicall circumſtances, clothed with their own ſeaſonable conveniences; ſo time for Worſhip, and due and convenient time is required, there may be ſome Scandalous and Superſtitious time for Worſhip. A ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit in the Preacher is required, and that a grave one; a place is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for private Worſhip, and a fit place, ſuch as is not the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſtreet for private Praying; the inconveniency of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may vitiate the Worſhip.</p>
                     <p>I did ſay that <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> hath ſet down in the Word, a perfect Plat-form of Church-Government, <hi>in all Morals;</hi> I ſay <hi>in all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi>

Scriptura talia non ponit, ſed ſupponit:</hi> The Scripture ſaith not, That the Worſhip of God muſt have a time, a place, when, and where its to be performed, a perſon, who is to perform it, a habit, or garments on the perſon that Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth; the Scripture teacheth none of theſe, but ſuppoſeth that they are and muſt be; becauſe nature teacheth, that without time, place, perſon, habit, geſture, its unpoſſible that theſe or any humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be; and therefore Prelaticall Formaliſts, do without all ſenſe or reaſon, require that we ſhould prove by Scripture, the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113466:17"/>
of <hi>time, place, perſon, habit, geſture</hi> in Gods Worſhip; for theſe are preſuppoſed in all actions, Naturall, Civill, Religious, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, Publike, Lawfull, unlawfull, in acts of Arts, Sciences, of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall converſing and all; yea, there is as good reaſon, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Scripture to prove he muſt be a living man, who hath a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul, and ſenſes, and is born of a woman, who Preacheth and Adminiſtrateth Sacraments, which is preſuppoſed by nature.</p>
                     <p>When the Heretick willeth me to prove from Scripture that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is very man; it is a vain thing he ſhould demand of me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to prove by Scripture, that <hi>Christ</hi> is ſuch a one alſo as can laugh, weep, admire, ſing, ſigh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe are preſuppoſed to follow mans nature; and if Scripture prove <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a true man, it preſuppoſeth by natures light, that he can laugh, he can weep, and that in ſome time, ſome place, in ſome habit, in ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, ſo he be a man; for that is preſuppoſed by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and known by the moſt Barbarous who never heard of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore there is no greater reaſon to put us to prove all the naturall and unſeparable circumſtances of Worſhip, ſuch as <hi>time and place,</hi> without which it is impoſſible any action at all can be performed; then that we ſhould preſſe Prelats to prove by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that <hi>Iames <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> is born of Engliſh or Iriſh Parents, for ſenſe and nature can prove all theſe without Scripture: But becauſe their Ceremonies of Croſſing, bowing to Altars, Feſtivall dayes, Oyl, Salt, Spittle, Maſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> clothes, are nothing warrantable by natures light, and muſt have Morall and Symbolicall influence in Worſhip, as poſitive Religious obſervances, having ſome ſpirituall ſignification and uſe, (except they be reaſonleſſe fancies) we have juſt reaſon to demand a warrant and ſpeciall Charter for all Morals, and ſo for their Ceremonies in the Scripture, and to call their <hi>&amp;c. humane Ceremonies and the like, a blind:</hi> For if Prelats can prove theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to be from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and warranted by his Teſtament, we ſhal yield that their natural circumſtances of <hi>time, when</hi> you ſhould Bow to Altars, and Croſſe a Baptized Infant, and <hi>where,</hi> or <hi>in what place</hi> you ſhould wear Surplice; and that the perſon that uſeth Oyl, Spittle, Salt, in Baptiſme, muſt do it in ſome habit, and with ſome geſture, either ſitting, ſtanding, lying, or kneeling, are all warrantable and lawfull from the light of nature; for if Gods light of Scripture, warrant wearing of a Surplice, as it doth warrant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113466:18"/>
Sacramentall eating and drinking, the light of nature muſt warrant theſe concreated, naturall, and unſeparable circumſtances of time, place, perſon, habit, geſture uſed in both the former and the latter.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe I ſaid that circumſtances of time and place have a<note place="margin">Time and place of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies need not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> threefold conſideration, <hi>Phyſicall, Morall,</hi> and <hi>Mixt:</hi> and I have ſpoken onely of theſe circumſtances in a Phyſicall or naturall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; therefore in the other two conſiderations there being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved ſome Morall goodneſſe, and becauſe there is no Morall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe imaginable, but it muſt have its eſſentiall form and being from a Law or word of God; therefore all the former circumſtances, as they are clothed with either morall conveniency and expediency, or with ſome Religious poſitive goodneſſe, muſt be warranted by the Word of God, or the Rules of ſinleſſe and ſpirituall Prudence, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deviate from the word of God: For circumſtances clothed with Religious Poſitive goodneſſe, ſuch as are the Sabbath day, the holy of Holieſt, the Temple; theſe are not meer circumſtances, but worſhip it ſelf: So a Religious habit, as an <hi>Ephod</hi> or a <hi>Surplice,</hi> is not a meer circumſtance, or a meer habit, but a worſhip, or ſuch a part or limb of worſhip as muſt be warranted by the word of truth, elſe it is nothing but a will-device, and a forgery, and ſo to be rejected. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of Prudence, they are things properly mixt, as at what hour Sermon ſhall begin in ſuch a Church, at eight, or nine, or ten of the clock; how the worſhip ſhall be ordered, whether you ſhould begin the Worſhip with a word of Prayer, or a word of Praiſing, or a word of Exhorting to ſtir up for the duty of the day, is a matter of Prudence; and becauſe God hath not laid the band of a Precept on us, to begin with either of the three; therefore it would ſeem, that though the things themſelves be Morall, and muſt be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by a <hi>Word of God;</hi> yet the order is not Morall, but Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, and ſo cannot fall under a command of the Church; for to me it is hard, that men and the Church ſhould lay on a tie or bond of a Precept where God hath laid on no ſuch bond; The Church, in theſe mixt things, where the Morality is not clear, at fartheſt, can but go on to directive adviſes, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 6. 12. Not to impoſing of Laws, nor to injunctions or Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the pain of Church-cenſures; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt bind and ratifie in Heaven, all Church-cenſures on earth, and ſo the Church cannot command nor cenſure, but as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf would command or cenſure.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Prynne: <hi>To the Argument of Moſes his doing all according to the patern ſhown in the Mount, It is Anſwered: 1. The Tabernacle wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> no part of the Church of the Iſraelites; but only the place of meeting for Worſhip, anſwerable to our Churches and Chappels, and ſo was the Temple; But I pray you, God preſcribed the height, length, bredth, form of Tabernacles, Ark, Altar, of every Pin, Ergo, Hath Chriſt as punctually preſcribed to all Chriſtians, and Nations, in expreſſe words, the form, matter, dimenſions of all Chriſtian Churches, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Chappels, Tables, Challices, Pulpits, Pews, not varying in one</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:113466:41"/>
                     <hi>pin. 2. God named the men,</hi> Bezaliel, <hi>and</hi> Aholiah, <hi>who ſhould make the Tabernacle and all the implements thereof. 3. God expreſſed the frame, faſhion, colours, of the holy Garments of</hi> Aaron <hi>and his ſons: ſhall it follow, Ergo, only the Artificers whom God nameth, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and none but Embroyderers, Goldſmiths, Carpenters, &amp;c. Not Paſtors and Elders are to build up the spirituall Churches of Chriſt, Ergo, The form, matter and colour of Miniſters, and Elders garments are particularly ſet down in the New Testament. 4. The Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Temple were corporall things made by mens hands, not spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all buildings of mens ſpirits. 5. All theſe of the patern were delivered to</hi> Moſes <hi>the Temporall Magiſtrate, not to</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt; Ergo, the Church under the Goſpel is not a ſpirituall building, whoſe maker and builder is God; and all is to be ordered by the Civill Magiſtrate, and Lay-Artificers, not by Pastors: I wonder alſo you alledge not</hi> Noahs <hi>Ark: And all in the New Teſtament, are not ſo particularly ſet down, as in the Old. Anſ.</hi> The Tabernacle was no part of the Church; but being a Type and the implements of it, to the leaſt pin, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expreſſed by God to <hi>Moſes;</hi> far more muſt we have from God an expreſſe for every Ceremony, not to retort this alſo, that a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Cap,</hi> or a <hi>Surplice,</hi> is no part of the Church, and is indeed a teaching ſign, and ſo ſhould not be counted a Poſitive of Church-Policy. 2. Moſt falſe it is that the Tabernacle and Temple were nothing but a meeting place of the people for Worſhip, as our Churches or Chappels, are, 1. Becauſe it is to Argue the Holy Ghoſt of want of wiſdom, to ſpend ſo much Canonick Scripture in ſetting down things idely, not tending, at all to edification, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching us nothing of God, and in ſpecifying the <hi>Form, Height, Length, Bredth, Curtains, Candleſticks, Sockets, Rings,</hi> of naturall places that contained their bodies; for what ſhould it edifie us, if God ſhould deſcribe ſo particularly all the Churches and meeting places of the people under the New Teſtament? Now certain it is, <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things were written afore time, were written for our Learning, Rom.</hi> 15. 4. 2. Many things in the <hi>Tabernacle, as Candles in day light, Rings, Sockets, Shew-bread,</hi> belonged nothing to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall place, as our <hi>Chappels,</hi> or <hi>Meeting houſes</hi> do. 3. Expreſly the Scripture maketh them more then places; to wit, Holy, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Typicall ſignes of Divine inſtitution; as the <hi>Tahernacle</hi> was a Type, <hi>Heb. 8. 2. 5. Heb. 9. 1, 2. &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. And the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:113466:41"/>
                     <hi>Temple</hi> a Type of <hi>Chriſts body, Ioh. 2. 19. Ioh.</hi> 1. 14, 15. And all theſe were Types <hi>and ſhadows of Heavenly things, Heb.</hi> chap. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Gal. 4. 1. 2. &amp;c. Col.</hi> 2. 16. 17. Which our <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chappels</hi> are not, being only places common to ſacred and Civill actions. 2. God therefore can no more in expreſſe words ſet down, the form, matter, dimenſions of Chriſtian Churches and Chappels, then of the Synagogues of the Iews which had no Morall uſe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification and inſtruction. 3. Yea, becauſe the <hi>Tabernacle and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and their implements, were teaching <hi>ſhadows of good things to come,</hi> and our Churches and Chappels are not ſo, nor have they any Morall or Religious uſe or influence on our ſpirits as the <hi>Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Temple</hi> had; therefore the Lord, who is expreſſe in all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, which of their own nature do teach and edifie; he behoved to name <hi>Bezaliel,</hi> and <hi>Aholiah,</hi> and the form and colour of the Prieſts garments, which alſo are Typicall, and could not name our Elders, or the colour or form of their Garments. 4. All theſe weak retortions, ſuppoſe that the Tabernacle and Temple were types of our meeting houſes for Worſhip, which is a meer conjecture; they were no more types of our Chappels, then of the Iewiſh Synagogues; we may not expound types at will, but as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to us in the New Teſtament: And this is a conjecturall Expoſition, and a dream to make <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiah,</hi> types of Embroyderers and Tradeſmen.</p>
                  <p>5. We know the Tabernacle and Temple were corporall things made with hands, and that they are things different from the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things that they ſignifie; as the ſign and the thing ſignified; as therefore the Lord is expreſſe in the elements and Rites of the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> becauſe all of them, <hi>Bread, Wine, taking, eating, breaking, pouring out the Wine, drinking,</hi> are teaching and edifying ſignes; and our Lord never left it to the wiſdom of men, to deviſe ſignes to teach themſelves: ſo in like manner, ſhould the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſpecifie all the teaching and ſignifying ſignes in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; and as <hi>Moſes</hi> might deviſe none of his own, but was tyed to follow the patern, which the <hi>Lord himſelf ſhewed to him in the Mount:</hi> So are we now under the New Teſtament, tyed to the patern of that ſame will revealed in the Word; and it is laid on us, <hi>Not to be wiſe above that which was written;</hi> and it is of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall equity: The ſupream Law-giver, never left it to the wiſdom
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:113466:42"/>
of <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> or <hi>Prophet, Apoſtle</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> to ſerve and Worſhip God as they thought good: But he himſelf particularly preſcribed the way, ſignes, and means: And becauſe God hath not been pleaſed in the New Teſtament to ſpecifie types of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and come in the fleſh already; therefore are we obliged in Conſcience to believe, and practiſe no more, <hi>either in Doctrinals, or teaching types, or Poſitives of Church-Policy,</hi> then our <hi>Patern in the Mount,</hi> the Scripture hath warranted to us, to be the will of God, and in this and this only, ſtandeth the force of the preſent Argument unanſwered by paterns of unwritten Traditions, and not in theſe looſe conſequences, that we under the New Teſtament ſhould have theſe types and Policy that the Church of the Iews had, which is the Doctrine of Papiſts and Formaliſts following them, not ours; for they prove their Pope and Prelat from the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſh High Prieſt,</hi> their <hi>Surplice,</hi> from the linnen <hi>Ephod</hi> of <hi>Jewiſh Prieſts;</hi> their <hi>Humane Holidayes,</hi> from the <hi>Iewiſh dayes;</hi> their <hi>kneeling to bread,</hi> from their <hi>bowing toward the Ark.</hi> 6. It is not true, that the Tabernacle and Temple were meer corporall things, no more then bread and wine in their ſpirituall relation, are meer corporall things: The Lords end, uſe and intent, in the Tabernacle and Temple, was, that they ſhould be to the people Images, <hi>and ſhadows of heavenly and ſpirituall things, Heb. 8. 5. Heb.</hi> 10. 1. 7. That all the things of the Tabernacle, were delivered to <hi>Moſes</hi> as a <hi>King,</hi> and not as a <hi>Prophet</hi> and writer of Canonick Scripture, <hi>Heb. 3. 5. Heb. 8.

                     <p>Morall Obedience reſolved ultimately in Scripture.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FOR farther light in this point, it is a Queſtion: What is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall object of our obedience in all our our Morall actions? that is, Whether is the Faith practicall of our obedience, &amp; the obedience itſelf, in all the externals of Church Government reſolved in this ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately and finally. <hi>This and this we do, and this point of Government</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Whither our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>policy, be ultimately reſolved in <hi>this ſaith the Lord,</hi> or in <hi>this</hi> ſaith the church.</note> 
                     <hi>we believe and practiſe: becauſe the Lord hath ſo appointed it, in an immutable Platform of Government in Scripture:</hi> or becauſe the Church hath ſo appointed, or becauſe there is an intrinſecall conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency in the thing it ſelf, which is diſcernable by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Queſtion is near of blood to the Controverſie between Papiſts and us, concerning the formall object of our faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, Whither are we to believe the ſcripture to be the Word of God, becauſe ſo ſaith the <hi>Church:</hi> or upon this objective ground, becauſe the Lord ſo ſpeaketh in his own Word: Now we hold, that ſcripture it ſelf furniſheth light and faith of it ſelf, from it ſelf; and that the Church doth but hold forth the light: as I ſee the light of the Candle, becauſe of the light itſelf, not becauſe of the Candleſtick. Hence in this ſame very Queſtion, the Iews were not to believe, that the ſmalleſt pin of the Tabernacle, or that any officer, <hi>High-Prieſt, Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Levite,</hi> were neceſſary, nor were they to obey in the ſmalleſt Ceremoniall obſervance; becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prieſts or Church, at their godly diſcretion, without Gods own ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall warrant ſaid ſo: But, <hi>becauſe ſo the Lord ſpake to Moſes,</hi> ſo the Lord gave in writing to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon, 1 Chron.</hi> 28. 11. 19. And ſo muſt it be in the Church of the New Teſtament, in all the Poſitives of Government; otherwiſe, if we obſerve <hi>Saints<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,</hi> and believe <hi>Croſſing and Surplice,</hi> hath this Religious ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe the Church ſaith ſo; then is our obedience of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience finally reſolved in the Teſtimony of men ſo ſpeaking, at their own diſcretion without any warrant of ſcripture. 2. To believe and obey in any Religious Poſitives, becauſe it is the pleaſure of men ſo to Command, is to be ſervants of men, and to make their will the formall reaſon of our obedience, which is unlawfull. If it be ſaid, that we are to believe and Practiſe many things in naturall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as to eat, move, ſleep, and many circumſtantials of Church-Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, becauſe the Law of naturall reaſon ſaith ſo; and becauſe there
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113466:58"/>
is an intrinſecall conveniency, and an aptitude to edifie, &amp; to decore and beautifie in an orderly and a decent way the ſervice of God, and not ſimply, <hi>becauſe the Church ſaith ſo,</hi> nor yet <hi>becauſe the Lord speaketh ſo in the Scripture,</hi> and therefore all our obedience is not Ultimately and finally reſolved into the Teſtimony of the Scripture. I Anſwer, That there be ſome things that the Law of Nature commandeth, as to move, eat, ſleepe; and here with leave I diſtinguiſh <hi>Factum,</hi> the common practiſe of men from the <hi>jus,</hi> what men in conſcience ought to do, as concerning the former, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and naturall mens practiſe is all reſolved in their own carnall will, and luſts, and ſo they eat, move and ſleep, becauſe nature, and carnall will, leadeth them thereinto, not becauſe God in the Law of nature (which I humbly conceive to be a part of the firſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and principles of the Morall Law, or Decalogue, and ſo a part of Scripture) doth ſo warrant us to do; and therefore the moving, eating, drinking of naturall <hi>Moraliſts,</hi> are materially lawfull and conforme to ſcripture, for God by the Law of nature commandeth both Heathen men, and pure <hi>Moraliſts</hi> within the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, to do naturall acts of this kinde; becauſe the Lord hath revealed that to be his will in the Book of nature: But theſe Heathen do theſe acts, becauſe they are ſuitable to their Luſts and carnall will, and not becauſe God hath commanded them ſo to do in the Book of nature; and this is their ſin in the manner of doing though materially, <hi>Et quod ſubſtantiam actus,</hi> the action be good; and the ſame is the ſin of naturall men within the viſible Church, and a greater ſin; for God not only commandeth them in the Law of nature, but alſo in Scripture to do all theſe naturall acts, becauſe God hath revealed his will in theſe naturall actions, as they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to naturall men within the viſible Church, both in the Law of nature, and in the ſcripture, and <hi>De jure</hi> they ought to obey, becauſe God ſo commandeth in both, and in regard all within the viſible Church, are obliged to all naturall actions in a ſpirituall way, though their eating, moving, ſleeping be lawfull materially, <hi>Et quod ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam actus,</hi> yet becauſe they do them without any the leaſt habituall reference to God, ſo commanding in natures Law and ſcripture, they are in the manner of doing, ſinfull; otherwiſe <hi>Formaliſts</hi> go on with Papiſts and Arminians to juſtifie the actions of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, as ſimply Lawfull and good, though performed by them with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:113466:59"/>
no reſpect to God or his Commandment: 2. As concerning actions of <hi>Church-Policy,</hi> that cannot be warranted by the light of nature, and yet have intrinſecall conveniency and aptitude to edifie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently to Accomodate the worſhip of God. I conceive theſe may be done, but not becauſe the Church ſo commandeth, as if their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment were the formall reaſon of our obedience, but becauſe partly the light of the Law of reaſon, partly ſcripture doth warrant them; but that Croſſe and Surplice can be thus warranted is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied: Again I conceive that there be two ſort of poſitives in the externals of Government or worſhip: 1. Some Divine, as that there be in the Publique Worſhip, Prayers, Praiſing, Preaching, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and theſe are ſubſtantials; that there be ſuch Officers, Paſtors, Teachers, Elders and Deacons; that there be ſuch cenſures, as rebuking, Excommunication and the like, are morally Divine, or Divinely Morall: and when the <hi>Church</hi> formeth a <hi>Directory</hi> for worſhip and Government, the <hi>Directory</hi> it ſelf is in the Form not ſimply Divine. And if it be ſaid that neither the Church of the Jews, nor the <hi>Church Apoſtolique had more a written Directory, nor</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Two things in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worſhip. 1. Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials. 2. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentals.</note> 
                     <hi>they had a written Leiturgy or book of Common Prayers or Publick Church-ſervice:</hi> I anſwer, nor had either the Iewiſh or <hi>Apoſtolick Church</hi> any written Creed or ſyſteme, written of fundamentall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſuch as is that, which is commonly called the <hi>Apoſtolick Creed;</hi> but they had materially in the ſcripture the Apoſtolick Creed; and the Directory they had alſo the ſame way, for they practiſed all <hi>the Ordinances directed,</hi> though they had no written <hi>Directory</hi> in a formall contexture or frame: for Prayers, Preaching, Praiſing, Sacraments and Cenſures never Church wanted in ſome one order or other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though we cannot ſay that the Apoſtolick Church had this ſame very order and forme: But a Leiturgy which is a commanded, impoſed, ſtinted Form, in ſuch words and no other, is another thing then a Directory as an unlawfull thing is different from a Lawfull: 2. There be ſome things Poſitive humane, as the Ordering of ſome parts, or worſhip, or Prayer, the forme of words or phraſes, and ſome things of the Circumſtantials of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as what Cups, Wood or Mettall, in theſe the Directory lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a tie upon no man, nor can the Church in this make a <hi>Directory</hi> to be a <hi>Church Compulſory</hi> to ſtrain men: And this way the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory is not ordered and commanded in the frame and contexture,

as was the <hi>Service-Book;</hi> and the Paſtor or people in theſe, are not properly Morall Agents, nor do we preſſe that ſcripture ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate men in theſe.

                  <p>As the profeſſion, whither actuall or habituall, in a locall and bodily approach, or in verball titles of Honour, in which we Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour great perſonages, by bowing to them, <hi>in proſtration</hi> and <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is an act in its ſtate Civill, not Religious, we intending (I preſſe not the neceſſity of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lination of the body tending to the Honour of God is a Religious act. Now bodily proſtration of it ſelf, is a thing in its nature indifferent, and according as is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſo is it either Artificiall: as if one ſhould ſtoop down to drive a wedge in an image; or civill, if one bow to Honour the King; or Religious, when God and Divine things are the object thereof: But with this difference, the intention of the minde, added to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall proſtration to a creature reaſonable, may make that proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion idolatrous, and more then civill honour. Thus bowing to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113466:62"/>
though there be no intention to bow to God; for bowing to God hath from the object, that it is a Religious bowing, though you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to direct that bowing to God, as bowing to <hi>Jupiters</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict, is a Religious Worſhipping of that Portraict, though you intend not to worſhip the Portraict: for the act and Religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject together, maketh the act of proſtration or kneeling, to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially Religious, though there be no intention to bow to theſe; indeed the intention to bow to God, maketh kneeling to God to be more Morally good, laudable and acceptable before God, then if therewere no ſuch intention, but the want of the intention, maketh it not to be no Religious worſhip, nor can it make it to be civill worſhip. Hence let this be obſerved, that intention of bowing can, or may change that bowing which otherwayes were but civill (if there were no ſuch intention of over-eſteeming the creature) into a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bowing, but neither our over or under-intention can change a Religious kneeling to God, or to an Image into a civill kneeling, becauſe civill or naturall bowing to creatures, is more under the power of an humane and voluntary inſtitution of men, then Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bowing, which hath from God without any act of mans free will, its compleat nature.

For a meer dedication or Civill deſtination of any thing to its end and uſe: As when a houſe is builded, a garment is firſt put on, when we refreſh our ſelves with a draught of water, we may pray for a bleſſing on theſe, and on all the Creatures for our uſe, and the very habituall intention of the builder of an houſe to dwell in, is a Civill dedication of it to that uſe for which it is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. Prayer added to it for a bleſſing of it in the uſe, maketh not a Conſecrated thing; for then my clothes every day put on, my ſleep, my dayly walking in and out, my Phyſick, my meals, my horſe, my ſhip I ſail in, ſhould all be Holy, Conſecrated, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious things, which I were to Reverence as Religious things; for all theſe may be bleſſed in their uſe: But here is that we condemn<note place="margin">Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches condemned</note> in Religious dedication of Churches: 1. That the end being ſacred, to wit, the habituall worſhipping of God in that place. 2. The praying for the Church or houſe of worſhip, to ſay nothing of the vain Ceremonies uſed in the dedication of Churches: Theſe two are applyed to make the Church holy, and to denominate it the houſe of God, and capable of Religious veneration, and ſalutation: Then certainly, all the Synagogues of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſhould be Religiouſly holy, as was the Temple. 2. And Prayers ſhould be more accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113466:64"/>
to God in the Synagogue for the houſes ſake, then prayers in any other place. 3. God ſhall binde himſelf by promiſe to hear prayers in the Synagogue, or made with the face toward the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, as he did toward the Temple: we were obliged in the New Teſtament to pray with our faces toward the Churches or meeting places in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and we ſhould have one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and celebrious Church for all Iews and Gentiles, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then all the little holy Temples now conſecrated as holy places, and where ſhall this be?

                     <hi>ſtrange, that God ſhould have made ſuch ſtore of glorious creatures on earth, &amp; leave them all to be conſumed on ſecular vanity, allowing none but the baſer ſort to be imployed in his own ſervice: 4. Rareſt and moſt gorgeous treaſures are too little for earthly Kings. 5. If the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Temples of the holy spirit are to be ſerved with rich almes, what ſhould be done for houſes to edifie the living Temples redeemed by Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> To all which I ſay: 1. The Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in its glory, proportion and beauty, was a Poſitive worſhip, and ſo muſt be warranted by the poſitive Warrant of the Word, and the like Warrant muſt all our Churches in the New-Teſtament have: 2. If we muſt extend our liberality and bounty towards God to the higheſt, and to teſtifie the greatneſſe and Almightineſſe of him whom we ſerve: then did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> in both fail, there were more glorious and rich houſes on earth, and divers times have been builded to the honour of falſe gods, and to declare the Royall mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of mortall Kings: God never for his own honour appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a banquet as <hi>Ahaſureoſh</hi> did, to continue for an hundred and fourſcore dayes, <hi>Eſther</hi> 1. 4. More might, and ought to have been done by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> if it had been a morall ground to build a houſe, <hi>to be a witneſſe of Almightineſſe:</hi> 3. And God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſacrifices, and Sacraments in both Teſtaments, as Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the great <hi>Lord Ieſus;</hi> yet in baſe and obvious creatures; we may not deviſe Symbols or witneſſing Images of the Almightineſſe of that God whom we ſerve, at our pleaſure: 4. If our Lord <hi>love mercy better then Sacrifice,</hi> eſpecially under the New Teſtament, when his worſhip muſt be more ſpirituall: Then the Argument may be ſtrongly retorted, we are to beſtow more on feeding

All theſe Arguments are broadly uſed by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for Images and rich <hi>Churches:</hi> Nor doth <hi>Hooker</hi> give us any Argument for this, but what <hi>Papiſts</hi> gave before<note place="margin">The place 1 Cor 11. <hi>Have ye not houſes,</hi> &amp;c.

It is an untruth that non-eating was only a bodily loſſe, for non-eating Phyſicall, is a bodily loſſe, but <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth non-eating morall, to eſchew the fall of one <hi>for whom Christ died.</hi> 6.

                  </p>
                  <p>2. What is negatively Lawfull here, cannot be admitted; If<note place="margin">What is only nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> Rulers may Command one thing that is negatively Lawfull, they may Command all things; becauſe what they Command un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this formall reaſon, as not againſt Scripture, they ſhould not adde nor deviſe new worſhip, though they Command all of that kinde: But the latter is abſurd, for ſo they might Command in Gods worſhip. 1. The actions of ſole imagination, the lifting of a ſtraw, and all idle actions that cannot edifie. 2. They might Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a new Ark to repreſent Chriſt incarnat, as the Jews Ark did repreſent him to be incarnat, a new Paſſeover, to repreſent the Lambe already ſlain, and all the materials of the Ceremoniall Law
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113466:76"/>
with reference to Chriſt already incarnat, dead, and riſen again: For all theſe are by Formaliſts Learning negatively <hi>Lawfull;</hi> Shew us a Scripture where they are forbidden, more then Surplice, Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, except becauſe they be not Commanded. If it be ſaid, They do not Command things negatively Lawfull, as ſuch, but as they edifie and teach: Well then, 1. As they edifie and teach, they are poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively good, and apt to edifie, and ſo muſt be proved by the Word as Commanded, and ſo not negatively Lawfull, and not as beſide, but as Commanded in the Word. 2. Yet it will follow, that all theſe may be uſed in Faith, that is, out of a ſure perſwaſion that they are not contrary to Gods Word, and ſo Lawfull. I might dance in a new linnen <hi>Ephod,</hi> before a new Iewiſh Ark, repreſenting Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready incarnat, and that in the negative Faith of Mr. <hi>Sanderſon, Hooker,</hi> and <hi>Jackson,</hi> for this Ark is not againſt Scripture, yet this Ark is not Commanded, and ſo not forbidden. 3. Idle actions that have no uſe or end, might be Lawfully Commanded by this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not forbidden, yet are ſuch unlawfull, <hi>Quia carent juſtâ neceſſitate et utilitate,</hi> as <hi>Gregorius</hi> ſaith: I prove the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe an action Morall, ſuch as (<hi>to Sign with the Croſſe</hi>) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Subject of Chriſts viſible Kingdom, for Gods glory and edification of the Church, which yet is neither Commanded nor forbidden by God, nor Commanded by natures light (for none but thoſe that are beſide reaſon will ſay this) nor light of Gods word, or the habit of Religion, hath no more reaſon, then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or forming a Syllogiſme in <hi>Barbara,</hi> which of it ſelf cometh only from Art; and as ſuch hath no Morall uſe, and by as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may the Church Command dancing before a new deviſed Ark; yea, ſuch an action involveth a contradiction, and is Morall, and not Morall: for of its own nature it tendeth to no edification, for then it might be proved by good reaſon to be edificative, and an action cannot be edificative from the will of men, for Gods will, not mens will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giveth being to things.</p>
                  <p>4. What is beſide Scripture, as a thing not repugnant thereunto, wanteth that by which every thing is eſſentially Lawfull: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is not Lawfull. The Conſequence is ſure, I prove the Antecedent: Gods Commanding will, doth eſſentially conſtitute a thing Lawfull, Gods Commanding will only maketh eating and drinking bread and wine in the Lords Supper Lawfull, and the Lords forbidding
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:113466:77"/>
will ſhould make it unlawfull; and Gods forbidding to eat of the Fruit of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, maketh the non-eating obedience, and the eating diſobedience. As the killing of <hi>Iſaac</hi> by <hi>Abraham,</hi> is Lawfull, and that becauſe God Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; and the not killing of him, again is Lawfull, when God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth it. But things negatively Lawfull and beſide the word of God, wanteth Gods Commanding will; for God Commandeth not the materials of Jewiſh Ceremonies to repreſent Chriſt already come, and ſuch like: for if he ſhould Command them, they ſhould be according to the word of God, and not beſide the word of God: If it be ſaid they have Gods Commanding will, in ſo far that he doth not forbid any thing not contrary to his own word; but hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Church</hi> Authority to adde to his worſhip, things not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his word, as they ſhall ſee they do promove godlineſſe, or may edifie the <hi>Church:</hi> But then if the <hi>Church</hi> muſt ſee by the light of reaſon, and naturall judgement, aptitude in theſe to promove godlineſſe, they are Commanded by God, who hath even ſtamped in them that aptitude to edifie, and ſo are not beſide Gods word. 4. Our Divines condemne all the Traditions of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome; as Purgatory, Prayer for the dead, Imagery, Adoring of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,</hi> all the <hi>Croſſing, Holy water, Chriſme, Oyl, Babies, Bells, Beads, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe God hath no where Commanded them, and ſins veniall and beſide the Law, and ſins mortall and contrary to the Law, we condemne; becauſe, as what is capable of ſeeing, and life,<note place="margin">Opinion of ſanctity &amp; Divine neceſſity, not eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to falſe worſhip.</note> and hearing, and yet doth not ſee, live, nor hear, that in good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we call blinde, dead, and deaf; all beſide the word are capable of Morall goodneſſe, and yet not Morally good, becauſe not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Gods word, therefore they muſt be Morally evil.</p>
                  <p>III. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> Opinion of Sanctity, holineſſe and Divine neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is not eſſentiall to falſe worſhip. Formaliſts will have their Ceremonies innocent and Lawfull, ſo they be not contrary to the word of God. 2.

                  <p>For 1. <hi>Aaron</hi> in making a Calf, and Proclaiming a Feaſt to the Calf, committed falſe worſhip; but <hi>Aaron</hi> placed not holineſſe, juſtice, or merit in that worſhip: Becauſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 22. for fear of the people who in a tumult gathered themſelves together againſt him, he committed that Idolatry; <hi>Ergo,</hi> neceſſity of Sanctity, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Divine obligation, is not eſſentiall to falſe worſhip: <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> Committed Idolatry in ſaying, <hi>Theſe are thy Gods O Iſrael;</hi> but he placed no efficacy or merit therein, becauſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 27.

And ſo fail againſt inward worſhip due to God, ſhould think that the denying of God were ſervice and meritorious ſervice to God; and that <hi>Peter</hi> denying Chriſt, and Iudaizing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 12. for fear, thought and believed he did meritorious ſervice to Chriſt therein: <hi>Pilate</hi> in condemning Chriſt; <hi>Iudas</hi> in ſelling him; the Souldiers in ſcourging him, did diſ-worſhip to their Creator, the <hi>Lord of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> Shall we think that <hi>Pilate,</hi> who for fear of the people did this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believed he was performing neceſſary, Divine and Meritorious worſhip to God? 2. If opinion of neceſſity Divine, of Merit and ſanctity, as touching the conſcience, were eſſentiall to falſe worſhip; it were impoſſible for gain and glory, to Commit Idolatry, to preach lies in the Name of the Lord for a handfull of barley, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 19. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 5. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22. 6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>1, 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 11.

Preach <hi>Arrianiſme, Turciſme, Popery,</hi> againſt the light of the minde only for gain; and yet to think that in ſo doing, they be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming meritorious ſervice to God: Yea, they who deviſe will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, know their own will to be the Lord-carver of that worſhip, at leaſt they may know it; yet ſhall we think they hold themſelves neceſſitated, by a Religious obligation ſo to do? Elſe it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that men could believe the burning their Children were will-worſhip, indifferent and Arbitrary to the worſhippers, which is open war againſt reaſon: Now a worſhip cannot be falſe, wanting that which is eſſentaill to falſe worſhip. 3. Falſe worſhip is falſe worſhip by order of nature, before we have any opinion, either that there is Religious neceſſity in it, or meer indifferency: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Such an opinion is not of the eſſence of falſe worſhip. 4. By that ſame reaſon, opinion of unjuſtice, or opinion of doing juſtice, ſhould be of the eſſence of unjuſtice; <hi>Cains</hi> killing of his Brother, ſhould not be Man-ſlaughter, except <hi>Cain</hi> placed ſome divine Sanctity in that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fact, which is againſt all reaſon; and the reaſon is alike in both Gods Commanding will and his forbidding will. They Anſwer, Gods will conſtituteth Lawfulneſſe in eſſentiall worſhip, and mans will in things arbitrary; but this is to beg the queſtion, for when we ask what is eſſentiall worſhip, they ſay, it is that which God commandeth, and what is accidental or arbitrary, it is that which human authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, &amp; this is juſt, Gods wil is the eſſentiall cauſe of that worſhip whereof it is the eſſentiall cauſe, &amp; mans will is the eſſentiall cauſe of that, whereof it is the eſſentiall cauſe. 5. All the materials of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh</hi> worſhip, might be appointed for right worſhip, ſo we held them to be Arbitrary. 6. God cannot forbid falſe worſhip, but in that tenure, that he commandeth true worſhip; but whether we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it true, or not, holy, or not; he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth true worſhip, <hi>Erg.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

There be oddes betwixt the kiſſing of a wife by a ſtranger, and the kiſſing by her own husband, and oddes betwixt an act of Royall Majeſty performed by the King, and that ſame Act performed by a Traitor faining the ſame Act, as there be oddes betwixt money ſtroken by a Tinker, and by the Kings maſter of Coyne; will this diſtinction ſerve the whoriſh woman, the kiſſes of a ſtrange man be Arbitrary, indifferent and accidentall: but the kiſſes of my own husband be eſſentiall and kindely. And the Tinker might ſave his head for his falſe coyne, the Kings money is eſſentially Legall and currant, but money ſtroken by me, is Arbitrary and of leſſe Authority, then the Kings Lawfull Coyn. 2. If it be neceſſary and good to honour God by decency and order, the particular goodneſſe and holyneſſe of Surplice and Croſſing is alſo good and holy. But God hath parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Shewed thee what is good O man; Ergo,</hi> he hath alſo ſhewed what is particularly holy. But God hath not ſhewed us in his Word any goodneſſe in Croſſing, Surplice, becauſe they are of mans deviſing: If it be ſaid, the particular goodneſſe of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice and Croſſing is good and ſhewed to us in the generall. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:113466:79"/>
goodneſſe of indifferent <hi>Rites,</hi> is, <hi>Repugnantia in adjecto,</hi> and a flat contradiction, as who would ſay, cold fire, indifferent is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor evil, neither Lawfull, nor unlawfull: 2. Then God hath not ſhewed us all Morall goodneſſe in his word, becauſe he hath not ſhewed to us the goodneſſe of Ceremonies. 3. Lawfulneſſe is an eſſentiall property of Divine worſhip reſulting from Gods particular approving will in his word, as is clear, <hi>Hoſea 8. 5. 1 Chro. 15. 13. Lev. 10. 1. 2 Sam. 7. 7. Ier. 7. 30. Act. 15. 24. Ergo,</hi> Arbitrary worſhip muſt have Gods approving will, commanding it, elſe it is not Lawfull: I prove the Antecedent from the cauſes of worſhip: 1. The end of worſhip, which is the honouring of God maketh not worſhip Lawfull; Idolaters may intend to honour God in their Idolatry, as well as true worſhippers. 2. The matter of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is not eſſentiall to Lawfull worſhip, for Lawfull and unlawfull worſhip may have the ſame common matter, as <hi>Solomons</hi> Calves in the <hi>Temple</hi> were lawfull, becauſe <hi>ordained of God,</hi> and <hi>Samaria's Calves</hi> were unlawfull, becauſe they were from men, the matter of both might be one and the ſame mettall, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 8. 3. The Form of worſhip in generall, is not the eſſentiall and ſpecifice Form of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worſhip, as the ſpecifice Form of a living creature is not the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifice form of a man, the ſpecifice form of a man is not the ſpecifice form of a juſt man, as juſt. Alſo I may conceive Sacramentall eating in generall, and not conceive whether it be Lawfull or unlawfull: For if Lawfulneſſe were the ſpecifice form of worſhip, I could not conceive worſhip, but I behooved to conceive Lawfulneſſe in it. Now then Gods commanding will, being wanting to Arbitrary worſhip, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Lawfull; <hi>Ergo,</hi> unlawfull. If it be anſwered, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are negatively lawfull, not poſitively lawfull, and the Argument proceedeth of Lawfulneſſe poſitive, which is commanded in the word. But this is, 1. a begging of the queſtion. 2. Negative Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, is from mans will, which ſhould not be a Creatrix of the goodneſſe of things or of Lawfulneſſe, nor can it Create goodneſſe, except you make man to be God: 4. Arbitrary goodneſſe and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe hath either a particular warrant and cauſe of its goodneſſe, and Lawfulneſſe from Gods expreſſe Commandment, or 2. From the light of nature, or 3. From the ſole will of men, or 4. partly from natures light, partly from mans will, but any of theſe wayes it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

The deviſers of them are either Brutiſh, or void of reaſon, and the practicers are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of men, becauſe they ſerve will, or rather luſt of men, without any reaſon Commanding. 3.

Alſo, if there be goodneſſe and aptitude to edifie ſouls in Ceremonies by natures light, ſound reaſon, or the Word of God, they cannot be Arbitrary or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent worſhip: but muſt be eſſentiall worſhip, having warrant and Commandment from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what natures light, or Scripture Commandeth, that God himſelf Commandeth, and what God Commandeth is eſſentiall, not Arbitrary worſhip. 2.

If Arbitrary goodneſſe and Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Ceremonies be thus warrantable, becauſe nor contrary to the word, and eſteemed Arbitrary; I might fail againſt the firſt four Commandments, by ſuperſtition and idolary: ſo I eſteem theſe, to wit, Idolatry and ſuperſtition Arbitrary, and not of Divine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and yet in ſo doing, I ſhould neither ſin, nor commit acts of falſe worſhip; becauſe ſuperſtition and Idolatry are indeed forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but ſuperſtition and Idolatry, with the opinion, that they have neither holineſſe, merit, nor Divine neceſſity, but are meerly Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, are no where forbidden in the word. Let Formaliſts by their grounds, ſhew us a Scripture for it; for they cannot by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be forbidden as falſe worſhip, ſeeing they want that which eſſentially conſtituteth falſe worſhip (as they teach) for they (as the Argument ſuppoſeth) want opinion of neceſſity, Divine merit and holineſſe. 6. If the <hi>Churches</hi> will, commanding Croſſing, and Surplice, make them Lawfull; then their forbidding them ſhall make them unlawfull, and mans will ſhall be a Pope and God. 7.

Commandment; why? becauſe it is a doctrine of men, and one of the Phariſees Traditions: For whether they placed operative ſanctity in preferring mens Commandment to Gods or not; none can deny but <hi>Chriſt</hi> reaſoneth againſt theſe evils, becauſe they were <hi>mens Traditions,</hi> otherway <hi>Formaliſts</hi> ſhall be forced to ſay, that if the <hi>Phariſees</hi> have eſteemed them Arbitrary, and of no operative ſanctity, mens Commandments had not been vain worſhip; Chriſts Argument from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. ſhould prove nothing, for falſe gloſſes and corrupting the fifth Commandment is not vain worſhip, becauſe it is a doctrine of men; for Doctrines of men as only coming from men, and eſteemed Arbitrary, are not vain, ſaith <hi>Formalists;</hi> yea, except they be contrary in the matter to Gods Law, and proffered or equalized in the opinion of ſanctity to Gods Law, they are not a whit vain, becauſe they come from men, or are doctrines of men. 4. Chriſt defendeth his Diſciples practice in abſtaining from exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall not-waſhing; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he eſteemed the externall waſhing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: But if the Diſciples abſtinence was becauſe of the impiety of waſhing, and the opinion of ſanctity put upon waſhing, otherwayes Lawfull; he ſhould have defended his Diſciples in a thing unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; for to diſobey the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Church-guides,</hi> who ſate in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes's</hi> chair, and were to he obeyed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 2, 3. in an externall indifferent act of waſhing not contrary to the waſhings comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> and ſo negatively conforme to Gods Law, is Lawfull, as <hi>Formaliſts</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> both teach; but Chriſt defended his Diſciples in their non-obedience externall, for they were not challenged, for denying the opinion of operative holineſſe to theſe Ceremonies: Chriſt who commanded obedience to ſitters in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chair in all things Lawfull, would have obeyed himſelf, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Diſciples in ſo far, as they ought to obey, or not to obey. 5. <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſayes, <hi>Theſe Traditions were unlawfull, becauſe they were invented, Sola voluntate hominum abſque ratione, by the ſole will of men without reaſon.</hi> But ſo are Popiſh Ceremonies, for if they can be proved by the word of God, and the light of nature, they are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall parts of Gods word, and not accidentall, nor left to the

It is good then the Ieſuit confeſſeth the Church from ſole will, and ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> and Prelat can make no Laws, but either Scripture or natures light muſt warrant them, and ſole will cannot rule them: 3. They had as good reaſon in generall from <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings, and the Law-waſhings, as <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Prelats</hi> have for their Traditions. But ſaith <hi>Vaſquez, Chriſt complaineth of theſe traditions, becauſe they held them to be, Summam Religionis, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of Religion, and took no care of Gods Law. Anſ.</hi> That will no more prove them to be vain worſhip, and that the Diſciples were to be juſtified in their non-conformity to theſe Church waſhings, then that Gods Diſciples, and ſound believers under the Old Teſtament ſhould abſtain from keeping Gods Sabbaths, his new-Moons, and from offering Sacrifices, becauſe the people placed all holineſſe in theſe of old, and neglected works of mercy and juſtice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 11, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4, 5, 6.

becauſe Religious bowing doth not convey honour to the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which ye bow by your free will, but by God and natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, even as weeping naturally expreſſeth ſorrow, laughing, gladneſſe, ſo doth Religious bowing ſignifie Religious honouring, without any act of the free choice of the worſhipped intervening. It is impoſſible to adore God, in and through an Image, and give no Religious reverence to the Image at all; as it is impoſſible to hear the word and tremble at it; and yet none of that Religious trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling be bounded and terminated upon the Word; as it is impoſſible to kneel to the Kings Ambaſſador conveying all and whole that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill honour to the King, but ſome honour muſt redound to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador; a father cannot love the Doctor for his ſons cauſe, but ſome love he muſt confer really upon the Doctor, if not abſolute, yet relative, for his ſons cauſe. <hi>Jacob</hi> could not kiſſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> his ſons coat, and yet refer that whole expreſſed affection to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the coat, for then ſhould there be no reaſon, why he ſhould kiſſe the coat, rather then the skin of the beaſt ſuppoſed to be the devourer of his ſon; if therefore the Communicant ſhould kiſſe the <hi>Sacramentall Bread,</hi> as he boweth Religiouſly before it, as the object of his <hi>Sacramentall worſhip,</hi> which he receiveth, I hope it would be thought very like the kiſſing of the <hi>Calves of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> and a Religious expreſſion of love to the bread, and by the ſame caſe, Religious bowing to God, by the interveening of bread a repreſentative object, muſt be an expreſſion of Religious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of Bread, but no Religious honouring by Religious bowing can be expreſſed, but Adoration of bread; for as I have proved, it is not in our free Election that Religious kneeling ſignifie what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we pleaſe, as if it were in our power, that Religious kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignifie Religious, or civill honour, or more, or leſſe Religious honour, but our will or thoughts cannot change the nature of things; kneeling is eſſentially Religious, as <note n="a" place="margin">Ioannes de Lugo, de myſtei incarnat, <hi>diſp. 13.

The Image and the elements in any conſideration, either as creatures, or as the honourable act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation is put upon them, are but creatures; for the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation is a temporary Godhead, and maketh them but Time-Gods; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they cannot be Adored. 2. If there be two Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here, one given to God, and another to the Image, and if both be divine honour, there muſt be two collaterall Gods; if Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prove Chriſt to be God, two divine honours put upon things, one upon God, and another upon the Creature; there muſt be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:113466:99"/>
two Gods, or then the Creature remaining a Creature, muſt have Communion with Gods high honour, which is Idolatry. 3. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and elements are either worſhipped for themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or for ſome other thing; if for themſelves, they are God, for only God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is worſhipped with Divine honour; if for God they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, then it is an inferiotr, and improper worſhip, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be worſhipped as memorative objects. 4. Images and elements, if they partake of externall worſhip proper to God: Why may not Sacrifices and Incenſe be offered unto them, and faith and hope fixed on Images? They do not partake of internall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: for as <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſaith well, inward worſhip conſiſteth in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſione primi principii, &amp; in motu ad illud; in apprehenſion of the firſt Author and Creator of all things, and in the wills motion toward it.</hi> But this apprehenſion cannot be put upon Images or elements, therefore they be here ſignificant objects only.</p>

Chriſt might have changed bread and wine, in fleſh, and milk, or water, will it hence follow, we are not to imitate Chriſt in bread and wine? And that bread and wine are occaſionall?

Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he reaſoneth with us, as if Table-ſitting inferred an equality betwixt us, and that Lord who is the head of men and Angels; we reaſon for an honour of fellowſhip, not equality. <hi>David</hi> ſet at King <hi>Saul's</hi> Table, is not made equall with <hi>Saul,</hi> but in Table-ſitting, he doth partake of Table-honour to feaſt with his Prince.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt ſhould have ſitten and cauſed his Diſciples riſe and waſh his feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that he could not have ſaid, (<hi>I have put the honour of Table-fellowſhip on you, for you ſtand and waſh my feet, and I ſit</hi>) this (I ſay) had been no table-honour, but moſt contrary to it: It had
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:113466:120"/>
been indeed ſervant-honour, <hi>Luk</hi> 22. 27. and more then ſinfull men are worthy of. To kneel to Chriſt is an honour, but to kneel at Tabling with him, as kneeling, is no more an expreſſing ſigne of table-honour, nor ſtanding and ſerving Chriſt, while he did eat is an honour of table-fellowſhip. Now if any ſhall take away eating with Chriſt, at that table, he taketh away table-honour, as Papiſts do in taking away drinking with <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the people, yet eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Chriſt maketh us not equall to Chriſt, but take away eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and you take away Table-honour, ſo take away ſitting at Table, and you take away (<hi>eatenus</hi>) in ſo far the Table-honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But by this mean</hi> (ſay they) <hi>you make it neceſſary to ſit, and of Divine neceſſity.</hi> I anſwer, Table ſitting is not ſo neceſſary, as that the want thereof doth annihilate the Sacrament, and make it to be no Sacrament at all, but it is (as I think) many wayes neceſſary, as firſt it is morally or Theologically neceſſary, as being geſture ſanctified by the practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, upon Morall grounds, and ſo to be imitated by us: 2. It is neceſſary, by neceſſity of expediency, as free from hazard of Idolatry, of which crime kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this act, is guilty. 3. It is neceſſary, ſacramentally, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Sacrament, as ſignifying our honour of Table-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip. 4. It is by natures grounds neceſſary, that as this banquet is materiall, having bread, wine, taking, breaking, diſtribution, eating, drinking, ſo the externall ſolemnity of a banquet, ſuch as is table-ſitting, requireth the ſame. And 5. which is our 4. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">4. Arg.</note> it is neceſſary by neceſſity of Divine precept (<hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me</hi>) that this is included in the precept we certainly believe: 1. Becauſe nothing in reaſon can be excluded, from the precept of the firſt pattern, but what is meerly occaſionall, ſuch as ſitting is not.</p>
                  <p>2. The practiſe of Chriſt and the Apoſtles cannot be a will-action, and therefore muſt fall under a precept: ſitting cannot be occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, upon the reaſon that it was continued through occaſion of the paſſeover; for if this be good, then eating and drinking, and the Analogy betwixt the ſigne and Chriſt, ſhall be occaſionall, and the ſinging of a Pſalm, as was at the Paſſeover, ſhall be occaſionall: for Chriſt retained what did equally belong to the Supper of the Iews, and this Chriſtian Supper, as concerning the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſacred Feaſts.</p>

                  <p>What the Civill, or <hi>Church-Ruler</hi> can command muſt be good, neceſſary, apt to edifie, and not indifferent, or neither good nor evil; Ceremonies are acknowledged by their Fathers to be indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and neither good nor evil; <hi>Ergo,</hi> They are ſuch as cannot be lawfully commanded. The Propoſition is clear; the Ruler muſt command for good, <hi>Rom. 13. 4. He is the miniſter of God for thy good,</hi> and <hi>all for edification, 1 Cor. 10, 23. 1 Cor. 14. 3. v.</hi> 12, 17, 26. And therefore all means injoyned for this end, <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> muſt conduce thereunto of their own nature, and not by the will of men, elſe they edifie not. But that this may be further cleared, it is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, if humane Lawes binde the conſcience: for which conſider,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſt.</hi> 6. The queſtion is not, whether we be obliged in conſcience to obey ſuperiors in things Lawfull, or whether we be obliged in conſcience to obey Superiors, when they are ſole authoritative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters and carriers of Gods expreſſe Law to us, for then they bring nothing of their own, to lay upon us, and in theſe caſes their laws are rather Gods Laws delivered by Superiors to us, and binde the conſcience.

There is another goodneſſe that cometh from the will of authority, &amp; ſo only divine authority muſt make things good; the will and authority of Rulers findeth objective goodnes in them, and therefore enacteth Laws of things, but becauſe they enact Laws of things, they do not therefore become good and Lawfull, It is the will of the Creator of all beings which is the meaſure, rule, and cauſe of the goodneſſe of things, as <hi>Adams</hi> not eating of the tree of knowledge is good and gratefull obedience, from Gods forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding will, and it ſhould have been as gratefull obedience to eat of that tree, if God had commanded ſo. Men cannot make worlds; nor can their will create goodneſſe in acts indifferent, nor can their forbidding will illegittimate or make evil any actions indifferent, and therefore things muſt be morally good, and ſo intrinſecally good without the creative influence of humane Authority, and from God only are they apt to edifie, and to oblige the conſcience in the termes of goodneſſe morall.</p>

for this were to make a man a trangreſſor before God, for a word, a ſtraw, a toy, which is unjuſt: Becauſe the juſt weight of the matter is the only juſt ground of the Laws obligation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the will of the Lawgiver, except he make a moat a mountaine, cannot lay an obligation of neceſſity on man. 2. It were a fooliſh law, and ſo no law to oblige to eternall puniſhment, and the offending of 2. God for a light thing, for this were to place the way of ſalvation in that wherein the way conſiſteth not. 3. Such a law were not for edification, but for deſtruction of ſoules. 4. This was the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> fault, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. to lay on intollerable burthens on mens ſoules. 5. The law of God and nature freeth us in poſitive lawes from guilt, in caſe of neceſſity, as <hi>David</hi> did lawfully eat Shew-bread. 6.

                  <p>2. Excommunication is not done by mans will, but by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the keys for a mortall ſin deſerving excommunication, and ſo eternall wrath.

Poſitive, What he ought to do, for the opening of the former: We are to cleare whether or no all externall ſcandalls Eccleſiaſticall, as well as civill, are to be puniſhed by the Civill Magiſtrate; and that as in Civill ſcandals, that diſturbeth the peace of the Common-wealth, the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> hath a twofold power, one to command what is good and juſt, another to reward and puniſh; ſo the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> in his Kingdom, hath not onely a directive power to teach and forbid, but alſo a power, by way of Diſcipline, upon the external man eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtically to reward and puniſh, to binde and looſe, in an externall Court on earth. It is granted by the Adverſaries, that Chriſt as King hath a power of binding and looſing, but meerly internall, purely ſpirituall, in regard of the Conſcience, by the Preaching of the Word; but for any externall power to take in and caſt out of the Viſible Kingdom of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> his Viſible Church, This they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo refuſe all externall Eccleſiaſticall cenſures of receiving into the boſome of the Church, and caſting out by rebukes, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; and therefore that there is no externall Court in the Church to puniſh Eccleſiaſticall ſcandals, all ſcandals and externall offences of the Church, are to be puniſhed by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Magiſtrate onely: In oppoſition to which error, I ſay,</p>

And of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor only, he applying the Word by way of Preaching to ſuch and ſuch offenders, and cloſing the Gates of the Kingdom of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impenitent ſinners, which is acknowledged by the Adverſaries: But there is alſo a <hi>Church-rebuking</hi> by way of cenſure, which muſt preſuppoſe an Eccleſiaſticall Court, and a rebuking of a Publique ſin, put forth by many; whereas one only, not a <hi>Church</hi> or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may Preach the Word, and ſo rebuke by way of Preaching, which I make out from the Word of God, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 6.

And by the Repreſentative <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> gathered together <hi>with Pauls ſpirit and the power of the the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. And ſo preſuppoſeth a Court or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of many inflicting this puniſhment. 2. The Adverſaries who deny that there is ſuch a thing as Excommunication, ſay it was onely a rebuke; but if it was Excommunication, it muſt include a rebuke coming from the many who do excommunicate. 3. It is ſuch a rebuke as muſt be taken off and pardoned by many, as ver. 7. <hi>So that contrariwiſe, ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>To whom ye forgive any thing, I alſo forgive.</hi> So here is a rebuking put upon an offender by many convened in a Court, who did rebuke by way of judiciall Authority, and the <hi>power of the Lord Ieſus; Ergo,</hi> it was ſome higher cenſure which was inflicted by many, and taken off by many; then that which was inflicted by one by way of Preaching, where there is no neceſſity that many either rebuke, or comfort the rebuked: for one Paſtor is to give out the ſentence of Death or Life, rebuking and comforting, toward any one offender, or a perſon Repenting, whether many be convened to conſent and joyn or not.

And this not any one ſingle man could do in an ordinary way, except we ſay that it was an idle and unneceſſary remedy which the Apoſtles uſed to quench the ſire, as if any one man might have done all this, or as if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked theſe men publikely, not having heard and convinced them by the Word of God; or as if an offence touching converſation and againſt the ſecond Table, had riſen betweene Church and Church, no leſſe then in the preſent caſe of an offence in matter of doctrine, that the Apoſtles would not have taken the ſame courſe, all which are not to be imagined.

Becaſe Chriſt labours to decline this, that one ſhall be both his brothers judge to put him in the condition of <hi>an Heathen</hi> and <hi>Publican,</hi> and binde his brothers ſins in Heaven and Earth, and alſo, that he ſhould be his party and accuſer: Now Chriſt will have the private brother do no more perſonally, but admoniſh his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and gain him. 2. If that prevail not, then he is to admoniſh him before two or three witneſſes: See here, the brother is not both party and judge; but witneſſes have place. 3. If that prevail not, the buſineſſe is to aſcend higher, even to the <hi>Church,</hi> which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is an Organicall body, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28.

Whereas two or three private Chriſtians are not a Church, but an homogeneal body: Now who would believe that Chriſt is to bring down the buſineſſe which is ſo high, as before the Church, to the loweſt ſtep again, to a private binding and looſing to one brother, who both as judge and party judgeth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yea, and may do this, though there were no Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the place, <hi>1 Corinthians 5.</hi> doth evince that Excommunication is an Ordinance of God.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Argument for Excommunication may be thus framed, from<note place="margin">That Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is proved by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. If <hi>Paul</hi> command that the inceſtuous <hi>man ſhould be delivered to Satan</hi> ver. 5. <hi>purged out of the Church, leaſt as leaven he ſhould corrupt the Church,</hi> ver. 6, 7. <hi>That they ſhould iudge him,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>And put him avvay from amongſt them,</hi> ver. 13. <hi>So as they vvere not to eat vvith him,</hi> ver. 9. 10. Then is there a divine command for Excommunication; for the Commandments of the Apoſtles <hi>are the Commandments of the Lord, 1 Cor. 14. 37. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 2. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is true: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the latter.</p>
                  <p>There is no ground or ſhadow of reaſon to expound this expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the inceſtuous man by the preaching of the word without any Church-cenſures, for all that is required in Excommunication is here; 1. This putting out was not done by one ſingle Paſtor, as putting out by the preaching of the word is done, but by a company and Church, ver. 4. <hi>In the name of the Lord Ieſus, vvhen ye are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and my spirit. 2. Paul</hi> ſhould have written to any one Paſtor to caſt him out by preaching; but here he writeth to a <hi>Church:</hi> 3. He forbiddeth company, or eating with ſuch like men, <hi>v.</hi> 10. Now this is more then rebuking by preaching. 4. This is a judging of the inceſtuous man, and a caſting of him out of their ſociety, which is another thing then preaching the word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eraſtus</hi> and others expound the giving to <hi>Satan,</hi> of a delivering<note place="margin">To deliver to <hi>Satan</hi> is not mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> of the man to <hi>Satan,</hi> to be miraculouſly killed, as were <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Act.</hi> 5. 5. And becauſe at this time there was no Chriſtian Magiſtrate to uſe the ſword againſt the man, therefore he writeth to the <hi>Church,</hi> that they by their prayers would obtain of God, that <hi>Satan</hi> might take him out of the midſt of them.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This inſolent interpretation wanteth all warrant of the word: For 1. To deliver to <hi>Satan,</hi> hath no Scripture to make this ſenſe of it, to pray that <hi>Satan</hi> would deſtroy the man. 2. It wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

an example in the old or new Teſtament, that the whole <hi>Church</hi> are fellow-Agents and joynt cauſes in the bodily deſtruction of any, or in working of miracles, ſuch as was the killing of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira:</hi> The Apoſtles wrought miracles, and that by their Faith and Prayers, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Prophets; but that the Believers, who ſhould have mourned for this ſcandall, 1. Who were puffed up: 2. Who were in danger to be leavened with the mans ſin, and had their conſent in Excommunication, ſhould joyn in a miraculous delivering to <hi>Satan,</hi> is an unparalleld practiſe in the word. 3. To <hi>deliver to Satan,</hi> cannot be expounded here: but as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. Where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he had delivered <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Satan,</hi> now that was not to kill them, but <gap reason="foreign">

Paul</hi> rebuketh this as a morall fault amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſuch as is not to mourn for this mans fault, and to keep him as leaven in the midſt of them, and not to caſt him out: Whereas in all the Scripture you finde none ever rebuked, becauſe they put not forth in Acts an extraordinary and miraculous power to work miracles; working of miracles came upon perſons called thereunto, by extraordinary rapts, and were in men not as habits under the power of free-will, but as immediate Acts of God, even as fire-flaughts are in the Aire: So I conceive, while I be better informed. 6. And ſhall it not follow, that now when the Churches have Chriſtian Magiſtrates, it is the will of our meek ſaviour, that they kill with the ſword all the Drunkards, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, and all that walketh unorderly; which ſhould make the Church of Chriſt a Butcher-houſe, whereas we are to <hi>admoniſh all ſuch as brethren, 2 Theſſ.</hi> 3. 15.

But the bodies of the godly are ſaved no leſſe then their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in the day of the Lord. 8. And for many of the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by delivering to Satan, cannot be meant a miraculous tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the body by Sathan, with the ſaving of the life; Such as we read was the caſe of <hi>Iob;</hi> for the delivering to Sathan, is to caſt out of the Church, and declare ſuch an offendor to be of the number of the wicked world, of which Sathan is Prince, <hi>Ioh. 12. 31.

And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things: But ye have ſet keepers of my Charge in my Sanctuary for your ſelves. 9. Thus ſaith the Lord God, no ſtranger uncircumciſed in heart, nor uncircumciſed in fleſh ſhall enter into my ſanctuary, of any ſtranger that is among the children of Iſrael:</hi> Here is a complaint, that thoſe that have the charge of the holy things, ſhould ſuffer the holy things to be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: I grant it cannot bear this ſenſe, that none ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Members of the Viſible Church under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but ſuch as are conceived to be regenerate; except it can be proved that the Sanctuary was a type of the viſible Church: 2. That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> conſtituted their Churches thus; but we read not in all the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of any admiſſion of Church Members at all: but only of baptizing of thoſe who were willing to be baptized, and from this reſulted the capacity of a Church Relation in all Churches viſible: Nor, 2.

                  <p>But the former is true; <hi>Ergo;</hi> ſo is the latter. The Propoſition is clear: As the word ſhould not be divided aright, if wrath ſhould be Preached to believing Saints, and life and ſalvation offered to the obdurate and wicked, ſo neither ſhould the <hi>Stewards cut the ſeals</hi> of the word aright, if the Supper were given to wicked men: If they ſhould ſay, <hi>This is the blood of the Covenant, ſhed for the</hi>

It is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtion, whether by the Miniſter, or by the Church any ought to be debarred, and whether there be any ſuch Cenſure as debarring from the Seals; and its another queſtion, by what power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the power of order, or by the power of juriſdiction, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may debar the ſcandalous from the ſeals; I conceive by both powers, they may keep the Ordinances pure; and if it belong to the Magiſtrate to debar any more then to preach the word, and by the way of <hi>Eraſtus:</hi> The Magiſtrate by his office, as he is a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate only is deputed of Ieſus Chriſt to Steward the ſeals to whom he pleaſeth: <hi>Ergo,</hi> (ſay I) to cut the word aright to whom he pleaſeth, muſt be his due.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Arg.</hi> As the diſpenſers of the word muſt not partake of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſins, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. ſo neither ſhould they diſtribute to wicked and ſcandalous men, ſuch Ordinances, as they ſee ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be judgement and damnation to them, and as maketh the Communicants <hi>guilty of the body and blood of our Lord:</hi> Now that the Stewards Communicate with the ſins of theſe manifeſtly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, to whom they adminiſtrate the Supper: I prove: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that <hi>ſow pillows under the head</hi> of the openly wicked, preaching peace to theſe <hi>who ſhould die, do hunt ſouls, Ezech.</hi> 13. 20. and partake of their preſumption, <hi>and they that heal the wound of the people with ſmooth words,</hi> are falſe dealers, and concurreth to the wound of the people, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 10, 11. As the Prophet that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth lies partaketh of the peoples preſumption; which believe thoſe lies, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 14, 15, 16. 2.

                  <p>3.

Now the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion applied to the word, is moſt falſe, (as it is applied to the Lords Supper, it is moſt true) for the Word is Ordained by ſpeciall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be Preached to Dogs and Lions, that thereby they may be made <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. 4.

It is true, They'll trample the Pearl of the word; but we are Commanded to offer the word to all, even while they turn Apoſtates. 2.

ſome holy things, the word to be given to Dogs; and yet his precept cannot be obeyed, if we give them the Sacrament. 3. By what Doctrine of Scripture will <hi>Erastus</hi> have theſe that trampleth on Ordinances, and turn again to tear us, debarred from the Supper? For in his <hi>Theſ.</hi> 26. 27, 28, 29. he holdeth it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to debar any <hi>Judas</hi> from the Supper; doth he think there be no Dogs in the Viſible Church? <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>There be ſuch Dogs as have known the way of truth,</hi> and turn to their vomit; and ſuch may promiſe amendment, confeſſe their ſin, and deſire the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Arg.</hi> Thoſe <hi>who will not hear the Church,</hi> but doth ſcandalize, not only their Brethren, but alſo a whole Church, and are to be eſteemed as Heathen and Publicans, are not to be admitted to the higheſt priviledge, and to feaſt with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when the <hi>Church</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth they want their wedding garment: But there may be, and are many in the <hi>Church</hi> of this ſort; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſuch ſhould not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: For the Major, I ſet down the words of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> granting<note place="margin">Eraſtus, <hi>Confi. theſ. l. 3. c. 3. pag. 207.</hi> Qui mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra externae volunt ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, illi non calcabunt Sacramenta nec offere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it is a vain collection, that therefore externally ſcandalous are not to be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Supper, and Excommunicated: The Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. did preach that Heathens remaining Heathens were excluded out of the Kingdom of God; yet Heathens cannot be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated; and yet (I hope) <hi>Eraſtus</hi> dare not deny, but Chriſt hath forbidden, that Heathen remaining Heathen be admitted to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: Though I dare provoke any <hi>Eraſtian,</hi> and atteſt them by their new Doctrine, to ſhew me a warrant from Chriſts Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, why the Church ſhould refuſe the Seals to a <hi>Turke;</hi> they

                  </p>
                  <p>But I anſwer, Though a Turk be unwilling to receive the Seals; What if he ſhould be willing, and require to be Baptized, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ignorant of Chriſt and the Goſpel we ſhould not Baptize him: Now by the Doctrine of <hi>Erastus,</hi> we have no more re warrant to deny the ſeals to him, then to deny them to <hi>Judas;</hi> we deſire a Scripture from the adverſary, which will not conclude with equall ſtrength of reaſon againſt the giving of the ſeals to any ſcandalous member of the Church; it is true, a Turk ignorant of Chriſt, though he ſhould deſire the ſeals is uncapable, and he is unwilling vertually, in regard he as yet refuſeth the knowledge of the Goſpel, and ſo is the ſcandalous profeſſor no leſſe uncapable (though we may grant degrees of incapacity) for he is vertually unwilling to receive Chriſt in regard he is unwilling to part with his idol-ſins: 2. Though a Turk ſhould be unwilling (as its like enough he will be) yet we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a Scripture, why we cannot make offer of the Sacraments to a Turk, and yet we may Preach the Goſpel and make offer of Chriſt in the word to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. And this Scripture ſhall alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, we are not to admit ſcandalous perſons to the Sacraments, being both uncapable of them, as alſo becauſe they can but trample on theſe pearls,, no leſſe then the Turk ſhould do; the Argument then is juſt nothing: We exclude many from the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whom we do not excommunicate on earth; But he ſhould ſay, we Excommunicate many, whom we do not exclude out of Heaven.</p>

                  <p>3. The Text ſpeaketh of eating in their houſes: could they caſt the man out of his own houſe, and from his own Table? they had no power ſo to do.

The Argument will conclude, that not onely the Church or Magiſtrate ought to admit thoſe that have fellowſhip with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to the Table of Chriſt, but they ought to command them to come, it being Chriſts will they ſhould be admitted, and that they themſelves who are Communicants are obliged, though keeping fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Devil, to come, and eat their own damnation: for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, by this reaſon in the place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.

It is not to a purpoſe, for if the Church debar only from externall ſociety, from the Church and externall Seals; this debarring being ratified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.

And I will be a Father unto you, and yee ſhall be my Sonnes and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> This is a manifeſt Expoſition of the Ceremoniall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and cleanneſſe, commanded in the booke of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> for
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:113466:161"/>
after the Lord hath given them a number of Lawes, about eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of uncleane things, he ſaith in generall, <hi>Lev. 26. 3. If ye walke in my Statutes, and keepe my Commandements, and doe them.</hi> 11. I <hi>will ſet my Tabernacle amongſt you, and</hi> I <hi>will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.</hi> And it is a cleare alluſion to <hi>Numb. 19. 11. He that toucheth the dead body of any man, ſhall be unclean ſeven dayes. 16. He that toucheth one that is ſlaine with the ſword, in the open field, is uncleane. 22. Whatſoever the uncleane perſon toucheth ſhall be uncleane:</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> Tit. 1. 15. <hi>To them that are defiled and unbeleeving, nothing is pure, but even their minde and conſcience is defiled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Prophets expound it ſo, <hi>Ezek. 36. 25. Then will</hi> I <hi>ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle clean water upon you, and yee ſhall be clean. From all your filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all your Idols will</hi> I <hi>cleanſe you.</hi> Hath he not a cleare reference to the water of Separation, <hi>Num.</hi> 19.? With this water the unclean perſon, and his clothes were waſhed, yea, the Tents and the Veſſels, ver. 17, 21. According to which, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Having therefore theſe promiſes (dearly beloved,) let us cleanſe our ſelves, from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit:</hi> Here a cleare Alluſion to Ceremoniall filthines bodily, and of the fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of Tents and Veſſels, <hi>Heb. 10. 22. To both theſe waſhings there is a reference. Let us draw neere, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water.</hi> And <hi>Heb. 9. 13. If the blood of buls and goates, and the aſhes of an heifer</hi> (min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with running water, <hi>Num.</hi> 19. 17. which purged veſſels that were but capable of Ceremoniall uncleanneſſe) <hi>ſprinkling the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh. 14. How much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt,—purge your conſcience from dead works?</hi> It is cleare alſo, that the unclean were ſeparated and the Leper put out of the campe, ſo as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might not touch any thing Ceremonially unclean, and all uncleane perſons were put out of the Congregation. Hence the Hypocrites word allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſeparation, <hi>Eſa. 64. 5.

God could not forbid in every time and place the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dead, onely God commanded the polluted to be purified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law: God vvould have his people neere their dying friends, but God never gave leave to any to live vvickedly. 3.

But <hi>the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes of God is wiſer then men.</hi> 1. We ſay not, that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of legall and morall uncleanneſſe is all one every way, and alwayes; it is enough for our purpoſe that God will have thoſe who are legally uncleane ſeparated from holy things, while they bee purified, and little ſinne and guiltineſſe ſeeme to bee in legall uncleanneſſe, as when bodily Leproſie came on perſons againſt their will, yet when God will have them puniſhed with being removed from the people of God, from the Sanctuary and the holy things, this could not be for it ſelfe; for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Doth God take care of Oxen?</hi> So we, doth God hate bodily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which are his owne juſt actions, not our ſinfull doings? ſince I ſay God hateth them not, and putteth not puniſhment on them for themſelves; therefore it muſt be to ſignifie what deteſtation and puniſhment the <hi>Lord our God,</hi> would have his Church to put upon morall wickedneſſe: So we thinke <hi>Eraſtus</hi> might have ſpared paper and paines, in proving a difference (which no Divine denieth,) between Ceremoniall and Morall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the puniſhment of the one and of the other, for it can never prove his concluſion. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Separation for legall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, cannot typifie ſeparation for Morall uncleanneſſe. I could give eight and twenty differences between <hi>Iſaac</hi> and Chriſt, as
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:113466:162"/>
                     <hi>Eraſtus</hi> giveth ſeventeen or eighteen between Legall and Morall uncleanneſſe, and the puniſhment of both: But I hope that ſhould never conclude againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb. 11. 17, 18, 19. Gal. 4. 28, 29, 30. Rom.</hi> 9. 9. that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was not a type of Ieſus Chriſt. 2.

                  <p>3. Theſe pollutions Legall cauſed by invincible ignorance, were types or ſymbolicall ſignes of our originall iniquity, and give me leave to doubt, if all actuall touching of things unclean, was no Morall ſinfulneſſe.

If the ſtanding beſide the dying friends be all one with touching the dead, I remit to the principles of Phyſicke, and if the touching of any dead be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Law Ceremoniall, let the learned judge. All the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther differences aſſigned by <hi>Eraſtus</hi> I leave, as not concludent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, they tend all either to blame God, who ſhould puniſh ſome legall uncleannes, that is, altogether againſt the will of man, with any puniſhment at all, as the three firſt differences inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate. Or, 2. that God puniſhed ſome Legall uncleannes more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely then homicide and Morall uncleannes, as the 5. difference doth inſinuate, and the 4. difference. And this is to challenge God, to whom I deſire to aſcribe a Soveraignty, both in puniſhing, or pardoning as he thinketh good: Or in puniſhing more ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more mildely theſe ſame ſinnes, or in puniſhing greater ſins with lighter puniſhment, and with a heavier rod lighter ſinnes.</p>

The latter way, is how we our ſelves may be freed from paſſive ſcandall, if our brother provoke us <hi>ſeven times, or ſeventy ſeven times a day:</hi> this muſt be by a private pardoning, and laying aſide all grudge, or hints of revenge toward our brother, and this is a great miſtake in <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> that he confoundeth thoſe two ſcandals, which by two Evangeliſts are diſtinguiſhed, for <hi>Peter</hi> upon occaſion of the former Church-ſcandals, propoſeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Mat. 18 21. <hi>then came Peter to him, and ſaid, Lord, how often ſhall my brother ſin againſt me, and I forgive him? Peter</hi> asketh nothing of gaining the offender, and Chriſt anſwereth nothing of gaining him, having ſatisfied them fully in that before: But <hi>Peter</hi> came in with a new queſtion, concerning private forgiving. 2. It is evident in the former, that Chriſt ſpeaks not of ſins, that one brother may forgive another; for then it were free to the offended, after two admonitions ineffectuall to gain the offender, to forgive and deſiſt, as he doth in the matter of forgiving: But it is not free to him to deſiſt; if the offender refuſe to be gained, and adde contumacy;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:113466:169"/>
the offended cannot pardon the puniſhment (he ought to remit the private grudge) he is under a command of Chriſt <hi>to tell the Church,</hi> that is one puniſhment, and if he yet be obſtinate, <hi>he is to be reputed as a Heathen and a Publican,</hi> that is another puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which a private man cannot diſpenſe with: 1. He cannot diſpenſe with Chriſts command. 2. He cannot omit all Lawfull means of gaining the ſoul of his brother; for the Law of nature tyeth him to it. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> will have it a matter of holding off of an injury, only by complaining to the <hi>Roman Emperour,</hi> a carnall way. Chriſt is on a higher and more ſpirituall ſtrain to gain a ſoul, as is clear, <hi>If he hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother,</hi> reſt there: <hi>But if he hear thee not,</hi> go yet on to gain him: <hi>Take with thee two or</hi>

                     <hi>three,</hi> then if he had been gained at firſt, a ſecond admonition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two or three were needleſſe.

Therefore this is moſt falſe, that Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of thoſe ſins which we may forgive: Who can believe that it is credible that our Saviour hath a more noble end, and more excellent then to gain a brothers ſoule? or that he doth teach us in theſe words to diſcend from ſuch a ſpirituall end, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of an offender, to a far baſer end, to hold off injuries by fleeing to a heathen Iudicature?</p>

I prove the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption by parts. 1.

Chriſt would never command that; yea, when Chriſt ſaith, ver. 16. <hi>If he hear not thee, then take with thee one or two more;</hi> Ergo, If he had heard him, he was not to take one or two more, and <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>If he ſhould neglect to hear them, he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was to tell the</hi> Church: <hi>Ergo,</hi> If he ſhould hear

them, he was gained, and was not <hi>to tell the Church;</hi> Ergo, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gaining muſt be Chriſts ſcope. 2. If to <hi>tell the Church,</hi> be as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> dreameth, to tell the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> and then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperour;</hi> this was no ſuitable mean to gain the mans ſoul; a club was never dreamed of by our Saviour to compaſſe the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall end, or neereſt <hi>ſcope of gaining any to repentance;</hi> for the end of the Magiſtrate, as a Magiſtrate, is to bring no man to repentance, but <hi>to take avvay evil out of the land,</hi> to cauſe <hi>Iſrael fear, and do ſo no more,</hi> to be <hi>an avenger of evil doing,</hi> far leſſe is there any ſhadow of reaſon to dream that Chriſt intended by <hi>Ceſars,</hi> or any Heathen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> ſword, to gain an offending brother to repentance, and that he commandeth the offended brother to uſe ſuch a carnal mean ſo unſuitable to ſuch a ſpirituall end.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is nothing but Grammatications that cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: it is true, that Chriſt ſpeaking of two, he ſpeaketh of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, but many will not grant ſo much, for they ſay, that by two the ſmalleſt number is meant, a Church of the feweſt, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> and two may be taken for a ſmall convention and number which doe literally exceed two, <hi>Jer. 3. 14. Rev. 11. 3.

The proportion is well kept, if two praying on Earth be ſo heard in Heaven, as by their prayers, they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that theſe be ratified in Heaven which they aske on earth; farre more is that ratified in heaven, which the Church in a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall and authoritative way, doth on earth, in <hi>the Name of Chriſt:</hi> for praying of private Chriſtians, and publike and authoritative binding of the Church doe both agree in this, that the Father of Chriſt ratifieth both in heaven, which is a due keeping of proportion, and not ſuch a crooked compariſon

as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> would make between an aged man, &amp; a <hi>rich &amp; good man</hi> 3.

But that the Apoſtles had before hand revealed to them all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles they were to work: I cannot believe by any Scripture, But that it was revealed to them upon occaſion only, by an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall immediate Revelation, <hi>Do this particular miracle, Hic &amp; nunc:</hi> And this I am confirmed to believe: Becauſe <hi>Eliſha, 2 Kin.</hi> 4. was miſtaken in ſending his ſervant with his ſtaffe to raiſe the dead ſon of the <hi>Shunamite</hi> (a Paſtor with nothing but a club and naked words cannot give life to the dead) <hi>ver.</hi> 31. and therefore the working of a miracle in particular <hi>Hic &amp; nunc</hi> was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes revealed to the moſt eminent Prophets, ſuch as <hi>Eliſha</hi> was; and ſo I beleeve, as working of miracles on this; and this man, came not from an habit in the Prophets and Apoſtles, far leſſe from a habit ſubject to their free will, but God reſerved that liberty to himſelf, to act his ſervants immediatly, both to pray by the faith of this miracle, <hi>Hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and to work this miracle, <hi>Hic &amp; nunc.</hi> Now to the Aſſumption: How can <hi>Eraſtus</hi> or any of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers aſſure our conſcience that God had given the Faith of miracles to <hi>all the ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus at Corinth,</hi> whom Paul ſo ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. That this being revealed to them by God, and they having the faith, that it was the will of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould kill, or (as ſome ſay) <hi>deliver to Satan</hi> this inceſtuous man to be miracuouſly tormented in the body or fleſh, as <hi>Iob</hi> was, that he might repent; is it like Chriſt would reveal more of his will, touching every particular miracle to be done by <hi>Paul,</hi> to all and every ſecure one in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> that were puffed up, and mourned not for this mans fall, then he revealed to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> themſelves? But I have proved that the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets knew not, nor had they the particular Faith of this, and this miracle, how then had all and every one of the <hi>Church of Corinth</hi> this Faith? Now they behoved to have this light of Faith of this miracle revealed to them, that this was <hi>Chriſts</hi> will, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould work a miracle for the deſtruction of the man; elſe the <hi>Corinthians</hi> could no more be juſtly rebuked, becauſe they prayed not to God, that <hi>Paul</hi> might work this miraculous deſtruction of the man (which yet he never wrought, as its clear, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. he
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:113466:180"/>
was not killed, but repented, and was pardoned) then becauſe they prayed not, that he miraculouſly might cure the criple man at <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra, Act.</hi> 14. or that he might work any other miracle. Now how was this revealed to all of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> that this was <hi>Chriſts</hi> will? If it be ſaid, they were to pray conditionally that God would either by a miracle take him away, or then in mercy<note place="margin">Delivering to Satan not mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</note> give him repentance to prevent deſtruction: 1. We have no ſurer ground for a conditionall and diſ-junctive Faith of miracles in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> then for an abſolute Faith: 2. If it was the will of <hi>Christ,</hi> that the man ſhould by himſelf be miraculouſly killed, why did not the Apoſtle immediatly by himſelf kill him? Why? It was the Apoſtles fault as well as the ſin of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the man remained as a leaven to ſowre and infect the Church; yea, it was more the Apoſtles fault then theirs, for he had only the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate power miraculouſly to purge the Church; ſome may ſay, as the Lord Ieſus was hindred ſome time to work miracles, becauſe of the peoples unbelief, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 58. So here <hi>Paul</hi> was hindred to work this miracle on the ſcandalous man, becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ. Paul</hi> could not profeſſe this; for he had not aſſayed to work any miracle of this kinde, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had done, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. But only ſheweth them of a report came to him of the fact, and of their ſecurity, and not mourning: 2. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have rebuked their unbelief, and not praying that God would miraculouſly deſtroy the man; but this <hi>Paul</hi> doth not. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh them, <hi>for not judging him, not putting him out of the midſt of them:</hi> Muſt that be <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning; <hi>pray to God that I may have grace and ſtrength immediatly from God, to kill him miraculouſly, and to judge him.</hi> Now they knew the Apoſtle miraculouſly thus judged thoſe that are without, as he ſtroke with blindneſſe; <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> who was without the viſible Church: I conceive the whole Churches were to pray, as the Apoſtles do with the Saints, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 29. 30.

What have</hi> I <hi>to do to judge them alſo that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> 4. It is directly contrary to <hi>Chriſts</hi> direction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:113466:180"/>
by removing his ſoule from his body, and by killing him. Yea, the Apoſtle writing of the cenſuring of thoſe in <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> who walked unorderly, and obeyed not the Apoſtles Word, which doth include ſuch as breake out in Inceſt, Adulteries, Murthers, is ſo farre from giving direction to kill them miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, that he biddeth onely keep no Church company, nor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an fellowſhip with them, but yet they are to be admoniſhed as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they were not to be miraculouſly killed, for then they ſhould be capable of no admonition at all being killed; And could there be worſe men then was amongſt the <hi>Phillipians, Enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God was their belly?</hi> Yet there was no blood in the Apoſtles pen, he chides not the <hi>Phillipians,</hi> nor the <hi>Galathians</hi> who had amongſt them men of the ſame mettall, <hi>Gal. 5. 7, 8, 9, 10.

then have warranted the whole Saints, Women and Children, to meet in a grand Jurie and Inqueſt, either to have the fact proved by Witneſſes, or to heare his owne confeſſion; elſe how could they pray in faith, if it was not ſure to their conſcience that the man <hi>had done this deed?</hi> Here is a Jury of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I am ſure unknowne to the Apoſtolique Church. 2.

contrary, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 9.

So that <hi>Paul</hi> is ſo farre from accuſing himſelfe for making them ſad, that by the contrary, he commends himſelfe for that, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth thereat. <hi>And if the matter had been Excommunication, while the man ſhould repent,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eraſtus) they knowing this ought to be in the Church, they ſhould rather have reioyced, then bin ſorry.</hi> And I anſwer, if the matter had been a miraculous killing of him, <hi>that his Spirit might be ſaved in the day of the Lord:</hi> ſhould they not reioyce at his ſaving in the day of the Lord, whether this ſaving be wrought by bodily killing, or by Excommunication? And ſo this conjecture may well be retorted. 2. They were not to bee ſorry at the mans repentance, but to rejoyce; yet were they to be ſorry at the violent mean of cutting him off from Chriſts body, as a father may be glad at the life and health of his childe, and and yet be ſorry that by no other mean his health can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, but by cutting off a finger, or a hand of his childe. 3.

Suſpended the working of Miracles, either on the prayers, or free conſent of the whole multitude of beleevers. 2. That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of a miraculous work, was committed to Deputies and ſubſtitutes under</hi> Paul, <hi>who had it in their power miraculouſly to kill him, or in their free will and Chriſtian compaſſion, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the miracle, and not kill. 3. That the Apoſtles in acts of miraculous juſtice, ſought adviſe of any, or might be broken by requeſts, to deſiſt from miracles as they ſaw the party repent, or not repent, or friends intercede, or not intercede. 4. So many circumſtances of the Text, laying a command on the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>to put him out and judge him, and yet the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a miracle. Theſe to me are riddles, if God had told us ſuch a Hiſtory, I could have beleeved it; but to gather theſe by uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conjectures. without any ground of other Scriptures, is a thing I can hardly beleeve. But ſince Excommunication is an ordinary cenſure, the Church might well, as they ſee the man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, or contumacious, caſt him out, or not, pardon, or not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>

This cenſure, though one private Brother may exerciſe it upon another, yea, a woman on a man, who yet hath no Authority over the man, is notwithſtanding in its riſe and efficient cauſe, a Church-cenſure. 1. If Chriſt will not have one Brother to condemne another, while firſt he rebuke him; and if he be not convinced, while he do the ſame before two or three witneſſes; and if he yet be not gained, one private Brother may not after conviction, before two or three witneſſes repute him <hi>as a Heathen,</hi> or complain of him before an Heathen Iudge, as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith; How ſhall we imagine any one ſingle Brother may withdraw Brotherly fellowſhip from another Brother, by his own private Authority, while he firſt be ſentenced before the Church? And the Church ſhall convince him to <hi>walk</hi>

For if this order were not in the Church, every Brother might take up a prejudice at his Brother, and ſo break all bands of Religious Communion, and Brotherly fellowſhip, and diſſolve and make ruptures in the Churches: Now certain it is, Theſe Texts, <hi>Rom. 16. 17, 18. 2 Theſ. 3. 11, 12, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in the letter, intimate no ſuch order as is <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. But it is preſuppoſed, as clear by other Scriptures, we are not to withdraw from an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Brother, but after ſuch an order: Now the places in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except we expound them by other Scriptures, do not bear that we are to rebuke our Brother, before we withdraw from him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. 2. If I am to withdraw from a Brother, all Brotherly fellowſhip by theſe places; then I am to eſteem him as a Heathen, and as a Brother in name, not in reality, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. Whereas once I eſteemed him a Brother, and did keep Brotherly fellowſhip with him; now this is materially Excommunication<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do no more in this kinde to one who is formally Excommunicated; yea, I am not ſo ſtrange to a Heathen; <hi>Ergo,</hi> This I muſt have done upon ſome foregoing ſentence of the Church, otherwiſe, I might un-Church and un-Brother the man whom the Church neither hath, nor can, un-Church and un-Brother. 3. Eſchewing of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly fellowſhip to any, is an act of Government diſtinct from the Preaching of the Word, tending to make a Brother that walketh diſorderly aſhamed, that he may repent, and of a Brother in name only, may become a Brother in reallity, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 14. But this act of Government belongeth not to the Chriſtian Magiſtrate; for every Brother (ſaith <hi>Eraſtus</hi>) may exerciſe it toward his Brother; <hi>Ergo,</hi> here is Church-Government that the Magiſtrate hath no hand in, contrary to the way of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and not in the hands of Paſtors, for it is diſtinct from Preaching; nor is it in a Colledge of Paſtors, Doctors, and Elders, for <hi>Eraſtus</hi> denyeth any ſuch Colledge; <hi>Ergo,</hi> here every one muſt govern another, the man the woman, and the woman the man; the ſon the father, if he walk unorderly, and the Father the Son; this can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the greateſt Confuſion on Earth. 4.

Becauſe, <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are helps of repentance. 3. Becauſe all are invited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come.</hi> Now here <hi>Eraſtus</hi> flyeth to another Queſtion: Whether the unworthy <hi>ſhould be debarred by Prieſts in the Old, and by certain ſelect and choſen Elders in the New Teſtament?</hi> This is a far other Queſtion: for let him anſwer our Arguments, by which we prove that pearls and the <hi>holy things of God,</hi> ought to be denied to all <hi>Dogs, Swine,</hi> and prophane men, whereas <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith, all
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:113466:204"/>
thoſe are invited to come; and then we ſhall yoak with <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> or any other, by whom, or by whoſe authority theſe pearls ought to be denied: whether by the Church, that is, by the Elders of the Church, and people conſenting, or by the civill Magiſtrate. Now this latter queſtion to <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> is no queſtion at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if none ought to be debarred from the Sacraments at all; but all muſt come promiſcuouſly, as their owne good or evill ſpirit inclineth them, it is a vaine thing for <hi>Eraſtus</hi> to make any queſtion at all, by whom they ought to be debarred; for it is all one, as to aske the queſtion, by whom ſhould thoſe who are to be gradued Doctors of Phyſick, be tryed and examined, whether by the faculty, and Colledge of of Phyſitians of the place, or by none at all: If you lay downe this ground, that there neither is, nor ought to be any graduated Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors at all in the world, the other of thoſe, who are to try thoſe who are graduated is vaine, if all be invited to a free banquet, poor, and rich, leaper, and clean: it is a vain queſtion, whether be there ſome Maſters of the houſe who ſhould try who are worthy, and to be admitted to the feaſt, and who unworthy, and to be debarred.</p>

It is denied, that all cauſes whatſoever came before the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Synedry at <hi>Jeruſalem, Eraſtus</hi> doth ſay this, but not prove it; for the place 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. doth clearly expound the place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. for the cauſes of the brethren that dwell in the Cities, between Blood and Blood, between Law and Commandement, Statutes and judgements are judged in the Eccleſiaſticall Synedrim at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> not in a civill coactive way by the power of the ſword. 1.

Two judicatures; one, <hi>v.</hi> 5. in all the fenced cities; another at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> v. 8? 2. What meaneth this, that the Kings matters are judged in the civill judicature, not by the Prieſts and Levites? (as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith) for the Ruler of the houſe of Iudah was preſident in theſe, and the matters of the Lord were judged by the Prieſts and Levites? and <hi>Amariah</hi> the chiefe Prieſt was over them? for then <hi>Amariah</hi> was as well over the Kings matters, as the Ruler of the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the Ruler of the houſe of <hi>Iudah</hi> over the Lords matters, as over the Kings; for if Prieſts and Levites judged as the Deputies ſubordinate to the King, and by the power of the ſword, the Kings matters are the Lords matters, and the Lords matters the Kings matters, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariah</hi> judgeth not as chiefe Prieſts, as he doth burne incenſe, but as an other judge, this truly is to turne the Text upſide downe. 2. The cauſes judged in the Synedrim at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> are ſaid to be
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:113466:218"/>
judged as controverſies, when they returned to <hi>Ieruſalem, 2 Chr.</hi> 19. 8. and matters too hard, between plea and plea, between blood, and blood, between ſtroke and ſtroke, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8. and ſo doubts of Law, and caſes of conſcience. Now <hi>Mal. 2. 7. The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth; for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſtes,</hi> and this way only the Prieſts and Levites judged, not that they inflicted death on any; but they reſolved in an Eccleſiaſticall way, the conſciences of the judges of the fenced Cities, what was a breach of the Law of God Morall or Judiciall, what not; what deſerved Church cenſures, what not, who were clean, who unclean; and all theſe are called the judgement of the Lord, the matters of the Lord; becauſe they had ſo near relation to the ſoul and conſcience, as the conſcience is under a divine Law. 3. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith, it is knowen that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites only were Magiſtrates in the Cities of refuge, but I deny it; <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſhould have made it knowen to us from ſome Scripture: I finde no ground for it in Scripture.</p>

But that <hi>Eraſtus</hi> does take from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, and give to the Magiſtrate a power to judge in an Eccleſiaſticall way, who are to be debarred from the ſeals, I argue on the contrary thus; thoſe who are to cut the word, and diſtribute it aright, are alſo to diſtribute the ſeals a right, to the worthy, not to dogs and ſwine, not to heathens and publicans, for it is evident that the right ſtewarding and diſtributing of ordinances doth eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially include the ſtewarding of them, with judgement and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

It is not poſſible that the Church can know whether the man be penitent, or no, except by witneſſes they know the fact, for they ſhall run a prepoſterous way, to work the man to a godly ſorrow, for that ſinne which poſſibly he never committed; now that of which the Church is to convince the man, and from which they are to gain his ſoul, that they are to find out. 2. This is againſt the way of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> who will have the Magiſtrate to exclude from the Sacraments, and none other. 3. The word knowes no ſuch thing, as that Miniſters ſhould be led in the acts of their Miniſteriall duties, to whom they ſhould diſpenſe the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel, and to whom they ſhould deny them; by the Magiſtrate? by a good warrant the Magiſtrate is to lay a tye on the conſciences of Elders, what they ſhould diſpence, as to whom they ſhould diſpenſe; ſure if the Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to Miniſters, to what ſort of perſons they muſt diſpence word and Sacraments, he muſt upon the ſame ground as a Magiſtrate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what Doctrine they ſhould preach to this man, not to this, whether Law or Goſpel; and ſo the Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate muſt be a Paſtor to cut the word aright, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 15.

The debarring any from the ſeals, muſt be proportioned to the end of all ſpirituall cenſures, that the man be gained, and his ſinne looſed in heaven, <hi>Mat. 18. 15. 18. that his ſoul may be ſaved in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor. 5. 4.

1. 20. But the Magiſtrates excluding of any from the Sacraments is no mean congruous to ſuch an end, for he can command nothing, but the diſobedience of which he can and ought to puniſh with the ſword; now a carnall weapon cannot be congruous and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a ſpirituall end. 6. If the Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate muſt ſo farre have the keys of Diſcipline, then as a Magiſtrate he muſt catechiſe, examine, and try the knowledge of the Communicants, and ſo watch for their ſouls, as thoſe that muſt give an accompt to God. 7. The Magiſtrate muſt have a Negative voyce in all the acts of the Church, and the man muſt be bound in heaven, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Magiſtrate will, and looſed in heaven, but not except the Magiſtrate will, for all muſt depend upon the conſent of him to whom Ieſus Chriſt has committed the ſupream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and higheſt and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power of governing the Church; now this is the Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate to <hi>Eraſtus.</hi> 8.

Now Gods Law never appointed any judge to condemn a man to die, whom the judge never did accuſe, heare, or ſee, this were extreame unjuſtice: Now this ſuppoſition is, and was to be proved and judged by the civill Iudge; and whereas <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith, the <hi>judge draweth the ſword with his owne hand againſt no man;</hi> 1. It is not to purpoſe, for the hangman is in Law the hand and inſtrument of the judge, but he is neither hand nor inſtrument of the Lawyer, of the Prieſts and Levites, who in matters criminall of life and death, judge of the Maior propoſition, and of the Law, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Eraſtus</hi> would have a Major propoſition to prove an Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which were to ſhame all Logick: For the Prieſt never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

Yea, for the fact and the judiciall condemning of the man, they were neither the higheſt judicature, nor any judicature at all, the civill Iudges of the high Sanedrim did that onely. It is true, he was to die who would not ſtand to the ſentence of the judge or Prieſt in the matter of Law, the man being judged to be guilty of the fact by the civill judge, but this ſhall never prove that the Prieſts were civill judges.</p>

to death, who did not ſtand to the ſentence of the Prieſt, though he ſhould ſtand to the ſentence of the civill judge; and ſo if hee was to be put to death, who ſhould ſtand to the ſentence of the Prieſts, and give an outſide of obedience to the Ceremoniall Law, if he ſhould not ſtand to the ſentence of the civill Judge, then were there at the ſame time theſe two ſentences in theſe two judicatures: but the former is true by the expreſſe Law of God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſo is the latter: when God ſaith, <hi>Goe up to the place that the Lord ſhall chuſe,</hi> he meaneth <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and one determinate place at once, and if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Goe up to the place that the Lord ſhall chuſe; or to ſome other place that the Lord ſhall not chuſe,</hi> then could I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre well, that at one and the ſame time, they might have gone to either places, or to both places, having two ſorts of cauſes, as there be ever two ſorts of cauſes in the Church, ſome Civill, ſome Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall. 3. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſhould have ſhewen a time when onely the Prieſt as the Prieſt did governe, and there neither was a civill Iudge, nor was that Prieſt who governed the civill judge: If <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus</hi> ſhew not this, he ſheweth nothing for his owne cauſe, which is to make one confuſed Judicature of civill and Eccleſiaſticall Iudges and cauſes, which the Scripture doth carefully diſtinguiſh. 4.

I grant, the King Commandeth the Painter, all the morall equity requiſite in Painting, that he endamage not the Common-wealth by proſuſe laviſhing of Gold; and in this, it is preſumed, there is more Iuſtice and morall equity by office in the King Commanding, then in the Painter Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: But if the King ſhould take on him to Command, <hi>virtute of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficii,</hi> that the Painter regulateth his actions of art, thus and thus, and direct and Command by his Royall office, as King, that the Painter

But <hi>Eraſtians</hi> teach that the Magiſtrate, when he ſcandalouſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, ſhould be threatned and rebuked; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Magiſtrates conſent is not requiſite to threatnings and rebukings of Paſtors. But the concluſion is againſt <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> for the Paſtors preach, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and threaten as the deputies and ſervants of the Magiſtrate, and as ſent by him; and the Magiſtrate preacheth, rebuketh, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all offenders, and himſelfe alſo in and through Paſtors as his ſervants, as <hi>Erastus</hi> teacheth; then he muſt conſent, that they threaten and rebuke himſelfe. 2. The propoſition is falſe, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, all the ſubjects do conſent to lawfull penall Lawes againſt ſorcery, murther, inceſt in the generall, and virtually, that they ſhall be put in execution againſt themſelves: yet the Sorcerer will never formally conſent, that he himſelfe be put to death, though he once, as a ſubject, conſented to the Law, that all Sorcerers be put to death: For when the penall Law againſt ſorcery was enacted, he conſented to this. 3. He whoſe conſent accumulative is requiſite, that ſcandalous offenders in generall be Excommunicated, but not that this or this man, poſſibly the Magiſtrate himſelfe, he is not to be Excommunicated, is moſt falſe; he whoſe conſent negative, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for Excommunication, he is not to be Excommunicated himſelf, the propoſition is true; But I aſſume, the Magiſtrates conſent nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is requiſite to Excommunication, there is nothing more falſe: For ſhall that which the Church bindeth on earth, not be bound in heaven, except the King, the Iuſtice, or Maſter Conſtable ſay Amen to it on earth? We ſay not that the Magiſtrates conſent as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, is requiſite, for the Excommunicating of himſelfe. For though as a Magiſtrate he ought to give his conſent to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate all offenders, and adde his civill ſanction, as one of the ſeven wiſe men of Greece ſaid, <hi>Patere legem, quam ipſe tuleris.</hi> Yet he is not Excommunicated as a Magiſtrate (except with Kata-baptiſts,

But how doth <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus</hi> prove this conſequence, if our Expoſition ſtand, and if we were to doe nothing in <hi>offering gifts at the Altar, except we bee firſt reconciled to our brother, and if God approve nothing which we doe, which deviates from this perfection, we ſhould doe nothing that is good and right, and ſo all muſt be excommunicated.</hi> 1. Is Chriſt here injoyning a work of perfection, and of ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation? Is <hi>Eraſtus</hi> popiſh in this? 2. As it is impoſſible not to offer gifts aright, ſo is it not to eate and drinke worthily, while firſt we be reconciled to our brother: <hi>Eraſtus</hi> was ſo ſurfetred with charity, as we heard before, that <hi>if any but deſire the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and profeſſe repentance, he thinketh he is obliged to beleeve he is fit for the Lords Supper;</hi> and here, if Chriſt require, but that the partie be reconciled to his brother, ere he offer his gift and come to the Sacrament, this is too great ſtrictneſſe, it ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate us all, and we ſhall ſo never doe any thing that is right and good. 4. It is falſe that Chriſt ſpeaketh here of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall acts onely, and of that which our minde injoyneth, for the Lord ſpeaketh of three externall viſible acts; 1. Of offering a gift at the Altar. 2. Of delaying and ſuſpending of the offering. 3. Of a previous viſible reconciliation to an offended brother. 5. He ſaith not, <hi>if the Presbyters bid you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>leave your offering;</hi> true, he ſaith not that in words; but ſuppoſing this, that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters know that the ſame very day that he bringeth his offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he had beene killing his owne ſonne to <hi>Molech,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 38. 39.

That a circumciſed <hi>Iew could by no Law be caſt out of</hi> Iudea, ſeemeth to ſay, that baniſhment was not a lawfull puniſhment: Surely <hi>David</hi> againſt all Law then did baniſh <hi>Abſolon, 2 Sam.</hi> 14. 13. and when the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> Ezra. 7. 25, 26. commandeth <hi>Ezra</hi> to reſtore judicatures, as at the beginning; It would ſeem that baniſhment was an ancient puniſhment amongſt the Iews: Therefore <hi>Eraſtus</hi> craftily ſaith, that no born Iews were ſo <hi>cast out of</hi> Iudea, <hi>that they were compelled to ſay they were not Iews.</hi> Surely we never dreamed of ſuch an Excommunication, that the excommunicated ſhould be compelled to lie, and ſay that though they were Iews and Chriſtians, yet they ſhould ſay they were not Iews or Chriſtians. 2. When the people was in <hi>Egypt, 2 Mac. they were killed who denyed themſelves to be Iews,</hi> and deſervedly, for they denied their Religion and their God. What is this againſt Excommunication? We plead not for ſuch an Excommunication, as was a locall extruſion of a perſon out of the land of <hi>Iudea,</hi> nor for ſuch a one wherey they denyed their Nation, that was a ſinfull lying. But ſuch, whereby Church priviledges were denyed to ſome for ſcandals. 3. Nor do we expound caſting out of the Synagogue literally, as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> doth, to be a caſting out of the Synagogue or from the Ordinances there, and from hearing the word or the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> for the Synagogue is the Church, and it was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the Temple, Paſſeover, and other Holy things, though theſe ſhould be tyed to one certaine place, to wit, to the Temple; and I doubt, if the excommunicated be to be debarred from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word; 1.

Well, <hi>Eraſtus</hi> will have one ſingle Miniſter to exerciſe externall dominion over the Magiſtrates, becauſe this is manifeſt out of the Word: but becauſe he would flatter Princes as much as he can, he denies that a Colledge of Elders may rebuke the Magiſtrate, or convene him before them, though he were the moſt flagitious Prince that lived; and yet one man may ſummon him before the Tribunall of Chriſt, and charge him to come to hear a Sermon, and rebuke him in the face of the Congregation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Iudgements of God againſt him openly. Is not this the Lord arming one ſingle man againſt the Magiſtrate, to put ſhame and confuſion on him for his ſins? And if many Paſtors convened ſhould do this, This were to <hi>arm the ſubjects againſt the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and to take the power from him that God hath given to him,</hi> as <hi>Erastus</hi> talketh.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> The agreement is but poore by your owne relation: But 1. Let <hi>Eraſtus</hi> anſwer, what if the Chriſtian Magiſtrate as <hi>Achab</hi> be a dog, and <hi>ſell himſelfe to do wickedly:</hi> What if he underſtand not the Doctrine of the Goſpel? Magiſtrates as Magiſtrates by vertue of the throne, or place, are not priviledged to be Orthodox and holy. Let one <hi>Iulian</hi> once a Chriſtian, yet turning a ſow, an enemy to the Goſpel be witneſſe, if we deſcend to the Iuſtices, and to Maſter Conſtables; it may be we finde even of thoſe dogs and ſwine in their converſation, though their place be a power, lawfull, and ordained of God; We thinke (ſaith <hi>Eraſtus) the cuſtome of the Church ſhould be obſerved:</hi> What? by the cuſtome of the Church onely, by no precept or command of Chriſt ſhould the holy things of God, the pearls of the Goſpel be denied to dogs and ſwine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Chriſts command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7? 2. <hi>Erastus</hi> muſt exclude the Magiſtrate out of the liſts of his diſputation in ſix books, and ſay, If <hi>the Chriſtian Magiſtrate be ignorant and ſcandalous, and yet deſire to uſe the Sacraments right, and profeſſe he will learne to know God, and</hi>

                     <hi>to beleeve ſoundly, and walke holily, Yet the Sacraments are not to be denied to him.</hi> Tell <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> in ſincerity who ſhould debarre the Magiſtrate? For in all your ſix books, you by theſe words, <hi>de illis ſolis,</hi> &amp;c. profeſſe that you plead not that he ſhould be admitted to<note place="margin">Magiſtrates if ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are to be debarred from the Sacrament.</note> the Sacraments; who ſhall exclude him? not he himſelfe; for his credites ſake he ſhall deſire to come to the Sacraments, as many for gaine and loaves follow Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. will they not follow him alſo to be ſeen of men, as the Phariſees prayed in the ſtreets? 2. Let <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſay, when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Give not holy things to dogs?</hi> Did he mean to accept the perſons of Kings and Iudges, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, though Kings and Iudges be dogs and ſwine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet deny not holy things to them? 3. Hath Chriſt appointed no way in the New Teſtament, as he did in the Old, to debarre unclean men from our Paſſeover? Or ſhall there be no Government, no charge in the Miniſters of the New Teſtament to keep the holy things of God from pollution? If Maſter Iuſtice be an inceſtnous man, a drunkard, a dog, ſhall he not be caſt out of the midſt of the Church? <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> though a King, yet for bodily leproſie was ſeparated from the people of God, and men of high places, though doggs and ſwine ſhall be admitted to all the holy things of God under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament?</p>
                  <p>2. Eraſtus <hi>will have all admitted who deſire to uſe the Sacraments right; As touching all externalls, of which onely the Church doth judge:</hi> But, 1. Where did we aſſert that the Church judgeth of internalls? and that they may debarre men from the Sacraments, for only heart-unbeleefe knowne to God only? This muſt lye on <hi>Erastus,</hi> as a calumnie, while he make it good from our writings and Doctrine, that we thus teach, exclude thoſe that are viſibly ſcandalous and prophane, and we are ſatisfied. 2. He that brings his offering to the Altar, and hath done a knowne offence to his brother, (for it is a ſinfull and viſible ſcandall, which ſcandalizeth one brother) <hi>He uſeth not the holy things of God right, even as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing externals;</hi> He that comes to the Lords ſupper deſiring, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>ordinance of righteouſneſſe</hi> (as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth amendment; and yet is openly ignorant and not ſound in the faith, he uſeth not aright the Sacraments even in externals, of which only the Church judgeth rightly: as he that in the ſame day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the temple to worſhip (now the very perſonall preſence of
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:113466:267"/>
a Iew in the Temple which was a Type of Ieſus Chriſt, was a worſhip and a holy thing of God, whereas our preſence in the place of meeting for worſhip is no ſuch thing) when he hath killed his ſonne to <hi>Moloch,</hi> prophaned the Temple, and the name of God, even in externals; for the Prieſts of old who were to put <hi>differences between the clean and the unclean,</hi> no more were to judge the inward thoughts and heart-diſpoſitions of men knowne to God only, then we can now judge them in the New Teſtament, 1 <hi>Chro. 29. 17. 1 King. 8. 39. 1 Chro. 28. 9. Prov.</hi> 15. 11. Hence, that is an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſpeach of <hi>Eraſtus, Quiſtatuit malus eſſe, non prodibit in eccleſiae faciem, ut ſe poenuere prioris vite teſtetur, ac meliorem promittat.</hi>

                     <hi>That man ſhall never come before the face of the Church, to teſtifie that he repenteth of his former wicked life, and promiſe amendment, who purpoſeth to be wicked:</hi> Will not men purpoſe not to be reconciled to their brethren, and ſuffer many ſuns to go downe in their wrath and malice, who come and bring their offring to the Altar; why did then Chriſt forbid offring at the Altar, without being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to an offended brother? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. might not the offending bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offer his gift? and were not the Prieſts to except his offring? He could ſay all that <hi>Erastus</hi> requireth: I <hi>acknowledge I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended my brother, I promiſe to crave him pardon, and I deſire to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer according to the Law.</hi> Then the Prieſt was obliged to beleeve he dealt ſincerely, and lay his gift upon the Altar, though he ſhould not obey the command of Chriſt, <hi>and go and leave his gift at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and not offer while he were firſt reconciled to his brother; and the like I ſay of one that hath killed his brother, and cometh with hot blood to the Table of the Lord, and goeth not to the Widdow and Orphanes, whoſe Husband and Father he had killed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled: Surely the man that ſhould thus offer, ſhould not come to offer, nor to eat at the Lords table rightly; even in regard of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals, which the Church may judge: for he ſhould omit this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, <hi>Be firſt reconciled to the Widdow,</hi> and then offer, and eat as Chriſt commanded. 3. It is againſt Scripture and experience, that a man that hath a purpoſe to kill his Father, and in the higheſt point of treaſon to invade King <hi>Davids</hi> throne, as <hi>Abſolon</hi> did, to ſay he will not profeſſe to pay his vows at <hi>Hebron.</hi> And might not <hi>Judas</hi> by his very eating the Paſſeover, profeſſe he beleeved in the Lambe of God that taketh away the ſins of the world, and that he

Excluſion from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is a Teſtimony of Excommunication, but not <hi>teſtimonium proprium quarto modo,</hi> for ſome that are not excommunicated, are to be debarred from the Sacraments as the thing it ſelfe will force us to acknowledge; ſhould any come with his ſword hot in blood, from killing his father and Paſtor to the Lords Table, I hope the Church knowing this would not admit him to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and yet he is not yet excommunicated, and I hope they would not preſently in the ſame moment that they debarred him from the Lords Supper, excommunicate him. There muſt be ſome time required to pray for him, to rebuke, convince, and lay open his ſinne before he be excommunicated, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me to thinke that there was neceſſity of expreſſe Scripture to prove Excommunication; but that abſtention (as Divines calleth it) or ſuſpenſion from the Lords Supper, may well be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by Analogie, by conſequent and by the nature of the holy things of God, and Pearles that are not to be given to the prophane. 3. A viſible ſcandall is a ſufficient ground of the leſſer excommunication, or debarring from the Lords Supper, and ſo we put a Teſtimony of one baniſhed from the holy things of God on him who hath committed a ſcandalous offence, which is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground thereof, though the offender be not formally excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. This Author ſaith, <hi>without the conſent of the Church, no man, though contumacious, ſhould be excommunicated;</hi> What this is againſt us, or for <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> I ſee not, we ſay the ſame.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, The Magiſtrate may chuſe ſome of the congregation to Excommunicate; which if he ſay, I conſent not to him, and ſee no warrant for it in Scripture: But I rather believe his ſenſe to be, That the godly Magiſtrate may command the Church to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:113466:268"/>
and puniſh them, if they be negligent in this. But hence it followeth not, that the Magiſtrate may Excommunicate them, as <hi>Eraſtus</hi> inferreth, no more then of old; it followeth, King <hi>Vzziah</hi> might command the Prieſts to burn incenſe to the Lord, and puniſh them; if in this they ſhould neglect their duty: <hi>Ergo,</hi> King <hi>Vzziah</hi> might lawfully in his own perſon burn incenſe to the Lord: <hi>Eraſtus</hi> himſelf will deny this conſequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith, It is evident this Author meaneth, <hi>That God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>

                     <hi>not a Presbytery to be, but that it is neceſſary for orders cauſe.</hi> But I had rather that he had proved it from the Authors words: And ſo I deny it, while <hi>Eraſtus</hi> bring his own words to prove it: I believe he fancies many things of this worthy Author, as that he ſubjects not the Magiſtrate to the Presbytery: And why? Becauſe he ſaith, <hi>None ought to be Excommunicated without the conſent of the Magiſtrate.</hi> Truly it is a weak reaſon; for if the Magiſtrate be a godly man, and a Member of the Church, it is neceſſary that his poſitive conſent be had, that he may in light and faith uſe the ſword againſt him, as againſt other evil doers. But I give him no negative voyce, nor any authoritative or Eccleſiaſtically judiciall voyce in Excommunication, which can be due to him as a Magiſtrate: So the Author doth not at all diſagree from us; <hi>Eraſtus</hi> is miſtaſten.</p>

Why, but then the whole judiciall Law of God ſhall oblige us Chriſtians as <hi>Caroloſladius</hi> and others teach? I humbly concieve that the putting of ſome to death in the Old Teſtament, as it was a puniſhment to them, ſo was it a myſterious teaching of us, how God hated ſuch and ſuch ſins, and myſteries of that kinde are gone with other ſhadows. <hi>But we read not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eraſtus) where Chriſt hath changed thoſe Laws in the New Teſtament.</hi> It is true, Chriſt hath not ſaid in particular, <hi>I aboliſh the debarring of the leper ſeven dayes, and he that is thus and thus unclean ſhall be ſeparated till the evening;</hi> nor hath he ſaid particularly of every carnall Ordinance and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Law, it is aboliſhed. But we conceive, the whole bulk of the judiciall Law, as judiciall, and as it concerned the Republick of the Iews only, is aboliſhed, though the morall equity of all thoſe be not aboliſhed; alſo ſome puniſhments were meetly Symbolicall, to teach the deteſtation of ſuch a vice, as the boaring with an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:113466:270"/>
ſuch; and in all theſe, the puniſhing of a ſin againſt the Morall Law by the Magiſtrate, is Morall and perpetuall; but the puniſhing of every ſin againſt the Morall Law, <hi>tali modo,</hi> ſo and ſo, with death, with ſpitting on the face: I much doubt if theſe puniſhments in particular, and in their poſitive determination to the people of the Iews, be morall and perpetuall: As he that would marry a captive woman of another Religion, is to cauſe her firſt pare her nailes, and waſh her ſelf, and give her a moneth, or leſſe time to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the death of her Parents, which was a Iudiciall, not a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law; that this ſhould be perpetuall, becauſe Chriſt in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular hath not aboliſhed it, to me ſeems moſt unjuſt; for as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that is Circumciſed becomes debter to the whole Law,</hi> ſure to all the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law: So I Argue, <hi>à pari,</hi> from the like, He that will keep one judciciall Law, becauſe judiciall and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moſes,</hi> becometh debter to keep the whole judiciall Law, under pain of Gods eternall wrath.</p>

It was <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne that he took not away the head of bloody <hi>Ioab</hi> when he killed <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa.</hi> 2. How doth <hi>Eraſtus</hi> prove that <hi>David</hi> neglected to puniſh the inceſt of <hi>Abſolon</hi> (his ſinfull neglect in not puniſhing his murther I yield) for <hi>Abſolon</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in <hi>Davids</hi> power to puniſh after he committed that inceſt; poſſibly he neglected to puniſh his owne Concubines, that is but a conjecture.

But if there be a Chriſtian Magiſtrate; what Scripture is there to warrant that he ſhould caſt out a Member out of Chriſts body?

May not God convert thoſe ſuddenly; as he did the thiefe on the croſſe, and <hi>Saul? Ergo,</hi> They ſhould not be caſt out. 2. The Magiſtrate cannot more cut off thoſe from being Members of Chriſts body; then he can remove their faith and internall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt. Now for this cauſe <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith, the Church cannot Excommunicate, <hi>pag. 1. 2 Theſſ.</hi> 3. and 4. 3. <hi>Chriſt and the Apoſtles</hi> did neither caſt out <hi>Iudas, nor Scribes, Phariſees, or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi> out of the Church, though they were worſe then idolaters. 4. <hi>No helps of ſalvation are to be denied even to idolaters, and to men that defend their owne wickedneſſe,</hi> but their remaining in the Church <hi>amongſt the godly, is a helpe of their ſalvation;</hi> and God inviteth them to repentance, and the ſtaying in the Church; And the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to <hi>Eraſtus</hi> means of repentance, and this caſting out muſt be to ſave them: for no power is given of God to the Magiſtrate or Church for deſtruction, but for edification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now to put them out of the Church, that they may be ſaved, is as <hi>Erastus</hi> conceiteth,

We deny not to him a power to examine Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and falſe Doctrine: 1. In order to bodily puniſhment with the ſword: 2.

3. With ſuch a judgement as concerneth his practiſe, leſt he ſhould in a blinde way, and upon truſt, execute his office in puniſhing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, whether they be ſentenced by the Church according unto, or contrary to the word of God as Papiſts dream. 3. We deny not, but the Prince may command the Paſtor to Preach, and the Synod and Presbytery to uſe the keys of Chriſts Kingdom accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of the Word: But this is but a Civill ſubjection, though the object be ſpirituall: But the Queſtion is not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chriſtian Magiſtrate have a care of both Tables of the Law. 2. Whether he as a blinde ſervant is to execute the will of the Church, in puniſhing ſuch as they diſcern to be Hereticks; we pray the Lord to give him eyes and wiſdom in his Adminiſtration. 3. Nor thirdly, Whether he may uſe his coercive power againſt falſe Teachers, that belongs to the controverſie concerning Liberty of Conſcience. 4. The Queſtion is not, Whether the Magiſtrate have any power of juriſdiction in the Court of Conſcience, they grant that belongeth to the Preaching of the Word: But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, touching the power in the externall Court of Cenſures. 5. The Queſtion is not, Whether the power of exerciſing Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be from the Magiſtrate, I mean in a free and peacable manner, with freedome from violence of men: we grant that power, and by proportion alſo, that exerciſe of Diſcipline is from him: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the intrinſecall power be not immediately from Chriſt given to the Church; this we teach, as the power of ſaying peacably from danger of Pirats and Robbers is from the King; but the Art of Navigation is not from the King. But the Queſtion is, whether the Magiſtrate by vertue of his office, as a Magiſtrate, hath Supream power to Govern the Church, and immediatly as a little Monarch under Chriſt above Paſtors, Teachers, and the Church of God, to Iudge and determine what is true Doctrine, what Hereſie, to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and remove from Church-Communion the Seals and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offices, all ſcandalous perſons, and that if Paſtors, or Doctors, or the Church, Teach or diſpenſe cenſures, they do it not with any immediate ſubjection to Chriſt, but in the Name and Authority of the Magiſtrate, having power from the Magiſtrate as his ſervants and delegates?</p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer negatively, denying any ſuch power to the<note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> Magiſtrate, and doe hold, that the Church, and Chriſts courts and

                     <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of <hi>Paſtors, Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> hath this power one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and immediately from Ieſus Chriſt, without ſubordination in their office, to King, <hi>Parliament,</hi> or any Magiſtrate on earth by theſe Arguments. 1.

what were thoſe two courts, ſo diſtinguiſhed by their two ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Rulers. <hi>Amariah</hi> and <hi>Zebadiah,</hi> the one a Prieſt, the other a Magiſtrate. 2. By the different formall objects, <hi>the matters of the Lord, the matters of the King,</hi> and confounded they muſt be; if the King and Ruler be a judge in the matters of God, except God make him both a civill judge and a Prophet, as were <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> which yet were differenced when the God of order eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his Church in <hi>Canaan.</hi> The Church convenes for a Church buſineſſe, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 18. 1. to ſet up the Tabernacle, but for a civill buſineſſe, to make war, the State conveneth, <hi>Ioſh. 22. 12. 15. 16.

Nor is it true, that the Prieſts had their government onely about Ceremonialls, for they were to judge of Morall uncleannes alſo, which even then debarred men from the holy things of God, as is cleare, <hi>Hag. 2. 12. Ezek.</hi> 44. 9. 10, 23, 24. and if any ſay that the Magiſtrate amongſt the Iewes did judge of Eccleſiaſticall things, and reformed Religion: We anſwer extraordinarily, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate might prophecie, and did prophecy, as did <hi>Samuel, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Solomon:</hi> Why do not <hi>Erastians</hi> bring thoſe examples to prove that <hi>Kings, Provaſts, Iuſtices,</hi> may now preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments, which yet is unlawfull to them by grant of Adverſaries, for the examples of the Kings amongſt the Iewes, is as ſtrong for preaching, as for governing; and becauſe Prophets did judge the people of old, yet no Proteſtant Divine<note place="margin">Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Officers now, as to the Prieſts and Levites of old.</note> will ſay, that now Paſtors may alſo uſurpe the civill Sword.</p>

Not directly by being the intrinſecall means, <hi>in actibus elicitis,</hi> in elicite and intrinſecall acts, promoting edification in both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Law, of which the Scripture ſpeaketh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 11. but a far other way: 1.

Not neceſſarily, as the Paſtors and Elders, without which Chriſt hath no externall viſible Kingdom on earth, whereas he hath had, &amp; often hath a compleat flouriſhing externall viſible Kingdom without Magiſtrates: yea, where Magiſtrates have been open enemies to the Goſpel. 3. Not directly the Magiſtrate doth this, but in ſo far as he admitteth (as <hi>Triglandius</hi> ſaith) the Church of Chriſt within his State, which he may, and often doth refuſe to do, and yet be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat<note place="margin">Trigland. de civi. &amp; Eceleſ. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. diſſer. <hi>Theolo. c. 4. p. 80.</hi>

gave for the Edifying of his Body the Church.</p>
                  <p>Two powers ſo different as ſpirituall and temporall: 2. As po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers<note place="margin">Arg. 3.</note> carnall of this world, and ſpirituall not of this world: And 3. Both immediatly ſubject, the one to God the creator, the other to Chriſt the Redeemer and Head of the Church, and ſo co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and ſupream both of them in their own kinde, cannot be ſo ſubordinate, as the temporall ſhould be the ſupream in the ſame kinde, the ſpirituall the inferiour and ſubordinate. But theſe two powers are ſo different, as ſpirituall and temporall, carnall of this world, ſpirituall not of this world, the one ſubject as ſupream im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly to God creator, the other ſupream immediately ſubject to God the redeemer; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Thoſe powers of Governing are not ſo ſubordinate as the Temporall ſhould be ſupream, the ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to it.</p>
                  <p>The Major is undeniable, for it involveth a contradiction that two ſupreame co-ordinate powers ſhould be two, not Supreame,<note place="margin">Civill and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call powers immediatly from God.</note> but ſubornidate powers: The ſame way I prove the Aſſumption. 1. The Magiſtrates power is ſupreame from God, <hi>Rom. 13. 1. The Powers that are be of God,</hi> Prov. 8. <hi>By me Kings reigne,</hi> for no Eccleſiaſticall power, nor any power on earth, interveenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God the Creator, and the power of the civill Magiſtrates; But God who giveth being to a ſociety of men, <hi>hoc ipſo,</hi> becauſe they are a ſociety of reaſonable men, hath given to them a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er immediately from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himſelfe, to deſigne ſuch and ſuch to be their Rulers: Shew us any higher power above the Magiſtrates, but God the creator making the civill power. Never man dreamt that the Spirituall power of the Church doth interveen as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe of the politick power. 2. By order of nature, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick power is firſt: men are firſt men in naturall and politick ſociety, ere they be in a ſupernaturall pollicy, or a Church; and Chriſt did not make a ſpirituall power by the intervention of a civill power. 2. The power of the two Kingdoms are diſtinguiſhed by Chriſt, <hi>Iohn 18. 36. Ieſus anſwered, my Kingdome is not of this World,</hi> (then the power thereof is not of this World,) <hi>if my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were of this World, then would my ſervants fight that I ſhould not be delivered to the Iewes.</hi> The one power is coactive by the Sword, the other free, voluntary by the Word. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> had no reaſon to infer thence that Chriſts Kingdome is onely internall and
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:113466:278"/>
inviſible, not externall and viſible, becauſe Chriſt oppoſeth his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to a fighting Kingdom, uſing the ſword to defend him from the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that he ſhould not be taken and crucified, as is clear in the words, but he oppoſeth not his Kingdome to an externall viſible Kingdom, for his Church viſible conſiſting of viſible Officers is his Kingdom, <hi>Eph. 4. 11, 12. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 13 &amp;c. The Word of the Kingdom is audible, and it is viſibly profeſſed, and Miniſters are viſibly and externally called to the holy Miniſtery, <hi>by the laying on of the hands of the Elders</hi> and voices of the People; but he oppoſeth his Kingdome to a Kingdome fighting with the Sword, and uſing the coactive power of the ſword to ſave him from being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and crucified by the <hi>Iewes:</hi> Now this is the Magiſtrates King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>for he beareth not the ſword in vain,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. and ſo Chriſt evidently proveth in theſe words, that the power that beareth the ſword, which is the very eſſence of the Magiſtrates office as a Magiſtrate, is not a part of his Kingdome, for his Kingdome is of another World, and Spirituall; but the Magiſtrates power is of this World, and uſeth worldly weapons, as the ſword. Then it is evident that the Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate, 1. Is not ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate<note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate not ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Chriſt as Mediator.</note> to Chriſt as Mediator and head of the Church. 2. That when it was ſaid, <hi>All power in heaven and earth is given to the Mediator Chriſt:</hi> The ſenſe cannot be, the power of the ſword was given to him as Mediator, to be a judge and a Ruler on earth, which he refuſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13, 14. (though as God he hath the power of the ſword.) 3. That the ſupream Magiſtrate as Magiſtrate is not the onely Deputie, Delegate, and Vicar of Chriſt as Mediator; for if Chriſt as Mediator have a ſubſtitute and Deputie, ſuch as the Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate, who beareth his bloodie ſword to cut off the enemies of the Church, and to fight for Chriſt: then 1. Chriſts Kingdome ſurely ſhould be of this World. 2. By the ſame reaſon, ſince as Mediator he is Prieſt, and a High Prieſt to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a ſacrifice to God, as all Prieſts muſt doe that are proper Prieſts <hi>Heb. 8. 3. c. 9. 7. c. 10. 14. c.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. there muſt be Prieſts under Chriſt properly ſo called, to offer ſome bloodie ſacrifice ſatisfactorie for ſinne, which is blaſphemie to ſay, I meane proper Prieſts; for otherwiſe in a figurative and borrowed ſenſe, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeevers are Prieſts to offer themſelves to God, <hi>Rom. 12. 1.

                     <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by the ſame reaſon he muſt have Prophets under him that are Vicars and Deputies, which is unpoſſible for Chriſt as Prophet and great Prophet, is eſſentially Lawgiver, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Cannonick Scripture, and he who really by a ſupernaturall power teacheth the heart, but ſo he hath no Deputies, nor any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters or Prophets, nor any under Law-givers, or under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which by an action or any active power communicated to them, can as under Lawgivers deviſe any part of Law or Goſpell or any other part of Cannonick Scripture, or have any active in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence ſupernaturall to make a new heart: Hence all our Divines ſay, Chriſt as Mediator and King of the Church hath no Deputies, neither King, nor High Prieſt, nor Pope, nor Saint. 4. It muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Magiſtrate who as Magiſtrate beareth the Sword, is not the head officer of the Church under the Mediator; for as Magiſtrate he muſt act with the ſword, upon the Church as the Church, and the Miniſters of the Goſpell as they are ſuch; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when the Magiſtrate doth act as Magiſtrate on the Miniſters with the ſword, he doth it on them as men erring and ſinning: But onely ſo he procureth as a Magiſtrate the ſpirituall good of the Church as the Church, indirectly and by the ſword, in driving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Hereticks and wolves from the flock.</p>

Yet here the Magiſtrate was no chief officer. 3. The adverſaries muſt prove <hi>Moſes, David, Solomon,</hi> and thoſe godly Kings, as Kings and Magiſtrates, and <hi>virtute officij,</hi> were ſupream rulers and Church-officers, and ſo that <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and all the godly <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> were, by vertue of their office, as Magiſtrates, all ſuch Prophets, as were <hi>Moſes, David, Solomon:</hi> for certainly, they as Prophets wrote Scripture, had the form and ſtructure of the Temple revealed to them of God, received Laws from God for the Prieſts: if our Kings as Magiſtrates now can do the like, we ſhall then ſay ſomething to their Headſhip over the Church. 4. And if they reformed Religion in the time of the defection of the Prieſts, when they were holy and zealous, and walked with God, and <hi>did right in the ſight of the Lord like unto David,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Jehoſhaphaet, Joſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> when the Prieſts were corrupt: we ſhall grant the like to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made up of <hi>Joſiahs</hi> and <hi>Ezechiahs;</hi> when the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines are corrupt, Heterodox, and all the Paſtors have corrupted their wayes. 5.

A ſealing to the ſenſes cannot be divided from the inward ſealing by the Spirit; neither in the intention of God, for the externall ſealing without the internall is Hypocriſie, and

God cannot intend Hypocriſie, nor can this diviſion be in regard of the nature of the Sacrament, for it doth ſeal to us our ſpirituall nouriſhment in Chriſt, except we ſinfully ſeparate the one from the other, and ſin is no ordinance of God. 4.

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:113466:285"/>
that which exhibiteth Chriſt to us as food, and ſealeth our ſpirituall growing and coalition in Chriſt: I ſay not this, as if the Church could give the Supper of the Lord to none but ſuch as are inwardly and really Regenerated, but to ſhew that the Church taketh ſuch as are externally called, to be internally called when they diſpenſe this Supper to them; &amp; that they are nearer Chriſt then thoſe that hear the Goſpel (which Heathen may do) ere they can be admitted to the Supper. And this <hi>Eraſt.</hi> every where, and Mr. <hi>Pryn, in terminis</hi> teach<note place="margin">Vindicat. pag 2. 3.</note> when they ſay, That <hi>thoſe that are</hi> recte inſtituti, <hi>rightly inſtructed, who earneſtly deſire the Lords Supper, profeſſe ſincere Repentance, and promiſe amendment, are only to be admitted to the Sacrament, and thoſe only excluded who are convicted to be groſſe and ſcandalous, and obſtinate offenders.</hi> Whence it is clear they profeſſe Repentance, and to the Church they are converts, who are to be admitted to the Supper before they come to the Lords Supper: Now this muſt be done by the word Preached, and received by faith in profeſſion; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this Supper in the Church-way, cannot be dreamt to be a mean of their firſt converſion, far leſſe <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> in Gods court, can men firſt receive the Lords Supper having never heard the word, and then be converted <hi>in foro Dei,</hi> really and inwardly, by receiving the Lords Supper; then might the Sacrament, before and without the word, be given, if it be a converting Ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to all to whom the word belongeth: For Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſaith, <hi>It can be denyed to none within the viſible Church.</hi> And what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if it be no leſſe the firſt converting Ordinance, but that it may be adminiſtred to thoſe that never heard the word, and are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church? And by this Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> cannot deny, but the Lords Supper ſhould be diſpenſed to infants and children, who cannot try themſelves, nor yet diſcern the Lords Body: Yea, thoſe that are convicted of obſtinacy in ſcandalous ſins, are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church; for how could they be judged, convicted and ſentenced, <hi>if they be not within?</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. <hi>Ergo,</hi> their being Members of the Church, is not enough to admit them to the Lords Supper, except they be to the Church otherwiſe qualified and fitted for it. And this doth clearly evidence, That the word of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may, &amp; ought to be Preached to many within the Church, that they may be converted to whom the Supper is not to be diſpenſed, that they may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verted, which is enough for our point to exclude
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:113466:285"/>
promiſcuous admiſſion of all to the Supper; and to prove ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualification muſt be requiſite, in thoſe that come to the Supper before the Miniſters, (without violation of the holy things of God, and being guilty of not diſtributing aright) can adminiſter the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this is another viſible qualification then is requiſite in thoſe that hear the word: For <hi>Eraſtus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> require, That all that come to the Supper <hi>be rightly inſtructed. 2. That they promiſe amendment of life:</hi> But they cannot ſay, none are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to hear the word, while they be qualified thus; you exclude the ignorant from the Sacrament, do you exclude the ignorant from hearing the word? Farther, I deſire to be reſolved, why <hi>Eraſtus</hi> and his require any qualification at all in the one, more then in the other, according to their way: For ſuppoſe perſons Baptized be only negatively blameleſſe, and not viſibly ſcandalous; yet <hi>Eraſtus</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> cannot deny the Supper to ſuch. Suppoſe they know not whether they be as ignorant of God as Indians, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they promiſe no amendment, and do poſitively profeſſe no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance at all: 1. Miniſters can deny no converting Ordinances to perſons, becauſe ignorant; for if the Supper of the Lord be a converting Ordinance, it ſhall convert men from their ignorance; and an Indian ignorant of Chriſt, ought to be Baptized, to the end, that Baptiſme may convert him from his ignorance. Now I think our Brethren cannot ſay this, and therefore they muſt yield, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters dare not admit all within the Church to the Seals, except they would be guilty of their ſin, in eating to themſelves damnation; and yet they dare not debar the ignorant within the Church from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, and ſo are no way compartners with them in the ſin of unprofitable hearing. 2. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> may here ſee ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants debarred from the Lords Supper; yet I hope he would not be ſo rigid as to Excommunicate all ignorants, becauſe ignorant: the moſt rigid <hi>Novatians</hi> would condemne that: and here is ſole ſuſpenſion without Excommunication, which Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſaith is not to be found in all the word of God.</p>
                  <p>I wondred much when I read thoſe words of the learned and<note place="margin">Vindicat. page 41.</note> reverend Maſter <hi>Prynne: That God, who beſtoweth no Ordinances on men in vaine, muſt intend in inſtituting the Supper, that viſible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall unregenerate Chriſtians, may be converted thereby, as well as reall Saints be confirmed:</hi> to which I reply: 1. Neither word nor
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:113466:286"/>
Sacraments, nor any thing on the part of the Almighty can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in vaine, though the end of the Ordinance be not obtained, I ſhould have expected ſome ſuch divinity from the pen of Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Socinians, who make God to intend the ſalvation of all, and every one in both the promiſes of the Goſpel, precepts and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet he falleth from this end: ſo you may read, in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius Anti-Perkins,</hi> pag. 60. that God is diſappointed in his end, in both Law and Goſpel, and God ſhooting beſide his mark miſſeth the ſalvation of many, ſay the Remonſtrants at the Synod of <hi>Dort, pag.</hi> 216. and in their confeſſion, <hi>c. 7. ſect.</hi> 3. and becauſe <hi>Socinus</hi> thought it hard thus to take from God wiſe intentions; he did no leſſe then blaſphemouſly deprive him of his omniſcience: So <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans contra puccium,</hi> c. 10. and in <hi>prelectionib. Theolog.</hi> c. 11. <hi>made all things that are contingently to come, uncertaine to God:</hi> But if you ſpeak of <hi>intentio operis, non operantis,</hi> that the Supper, in its nature, is ordained (this may rather be your meaning) that morall men like <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the like, (for all are alike in regard of the nature of the ordinances, and of that which is the genuine intention not of God, but of this Sacrament) then you ſpeak not of the ſupper as divided from the word, but as the word going before the Sacrament hath converted the man, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment following doth adde to and confirme in grace. So, Sir, you depart from the queſtion, for we grant that the Sermon going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſame day of the celebration of the Supper, may, and doth convert; and thus if an Indian heare a Sermon, to which the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Supper is annexed, if he be converted by that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (as you teach the heart in thoſe, is only knowne to God, the Church is not to judge) he may forthwith, ere he be baptiſed, come at the ſame time to the Lords ſupper, which were much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, little ſpeed, and ſo the word formally converteth, not the Sacrament; But if you mean that the Sacrament formally, as the Sacrament is of its nature a mean of converting a morall <hi>Seneca,</hi> you miſtake the nature of the ſeal, very farre, God never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that food as food ſhould give life to the dead, the Supper as the Supper is ſpirituall food, and preſuppoſeth the eater hath life, and how gate he life but by the word of God? 2. Doth the Sacrament as the Sacrament humble or ſpeak one word of the Law? doth the Sacrament ſay any thing here, but Chriſt died for thee, <hi>O Seneca,</hi>
                     <pb n="527" facs="tcp:113466:286"/>
and there is a pledge of his love in dying for thee; and the like it ſpeaketh to Iudas, as Maſter <hi>Prinne</hi> thinketh, and can this convert a morall man never yet humbled for ſinne? But I have gone thus out of the way in this purpoſe, I returne and deſire pardon for this digreſſion, not (I hope) fruitleſſe at this time.</p>
                  <p>If the Magiſtrate be the chiefe Church-officer, how is it that the Church was without Chriſtian Magiſtrates in the Apoſtles time? then is there no exact paterne of a Chriſtian Church, what it ſhould be, <hi>de jure?</hi> hath Chriſt in the New Teſtament not moulded the Church, the ſecond temple in all the dimenſions of it, as <hi>Moſes, David, Solomon,</hi> did by immediate inſpiration ſhew us the meaſure of the firſt Tabernacle, Sanctuary, and Temple? finally ſhould <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> ſuppoſe he had been a Chriſtian, have received impoſition of hands from the Elders, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Rom. 13. 4. Luk.</hi> 12. 13, 14. and all the Paſtors and teachers now in the exerciſe of diſcipline do uſurpe the ſword; Yea, if they be the deputies of the Magiſtrate in diſpenſing word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they muſt uſe the Magiſtrates ſword as Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for what ſervants do in the name of the ſupream ſwordbearer, that the ſwordbearer muſt principally do by the ſervants, ſo Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by this uſe both ſwords.</p>
                  <p>5. That the Magiſtrate cannot be the chief officer of the Church<note place="margin">Arg. 5.</note> is thus proved, he who is ſubject himſelf to heare the Church, and to ſubmit to thoſe that watcheth for his ſoul, and to be put out from amongſt the midſt of the Church; if he be ſcandalous, is not the principall Governour and head of the Church to command all:
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:113466:287"/>
But all Chriſtians, and ſo the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is ſuch, for if God accept not the perſons of men, thoſe places, <hi>Matth. 18. If he hear not the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 4, 12, 13. muſt tye the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, except God have excepted him; but God hath no where excepted the Magiſtrate, But as <hi>David</hi> had<note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Church.</note>

                     </gap>s; ſo the Magiſtrates now have ſome to watch for their ſouls. The propoſition is proved, becauſe if the Magiſtrate be ſupream to command Elders as Elders, both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and diſcipline, and in all Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, then the Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate cannot be under the Elders and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as ſuch, for that involveth a contradiction; that Paſtors as Paſtors ſhould watch over the ſouls of Magiſtrates that they erre not, and oppreſſe not in judgement, and that the Magiſtrate as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhould be over the ſouls of Paſtors to watch for them in the ſame kind; if any object that the Paſtors as Paſtors have ſouls, and therefore they muſt have ſome to watch for their ſouls; and therefore can neither be ſupream, nor excepted in thoſe places, <hi>Mat. 18. Heb. 13. 1 Cor.</hi> 5.

If the magiſtrate do only command the teachers and Paſtors to preach and determine ſynodically, in order to a temporall reward, and forbid them to abuſe their miniſteriall power in order to temporary puniſhment, by the temporary ſword; then ſurely the Paſtors and Teachers are not ſubjected to them in conſcience, after any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall way, for the power of commanding in magiſtrates as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates muſt be commenſurable to the power of puniſhing the tranſgreſſors of the command; if the one be in order to a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary good, the other cannot but be in order to an eternall ill; if miniſters command in the name of Chriſt, in order to an eternall reward, they cannot threaten the tranſgreſſors in order to a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary

Right and ſound preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and governing in Gods houſe, cannot from this be ſaid to bee ſubjected to the Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate, in regard that this is an accidentall hire, and an externall and acceſſorie good, which the Church as the Church, and the moſt faithfull Prophets, Apoſtles,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:113466:299"/>
and Paſtors have wanted, and yet have attained the end of a Church as a Church viſible, nor is this a promiſe made to the Church as the Church or the Miniſters thereof as ſuch, for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick church that was moſt poor, had neither thing, nor name, nor promiſe, but by the contrary, <hi>the Kings and Rulers did conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kingdome of the ſon of God.</hi>

The male adminiſtration of any office is accidentall to the office. 2. This ſubjecteth the erring perſon, not the teaching Miniſter to the civill <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi> Nor doth this make the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in the exerciſe of their office, properly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the Miniſters, but onely ſo farre as the <hi>ſpirits of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are ſubject to the Prophets.</hi>

                  <p>VII. <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> There is a twofold ſubordination of the exerciſe of Male adminiſtration of Miniſters; one civill, another Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: Theſe two differ, ſo as the former muſt be ſubordinate to the Magiſtrate who is to inflict bodily puniſhment, but the latter is onely ſubject to the Church.

                  <p>VIII. <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> The <hi>Miniſters</hi> are in no ſort the Ambaſſadors or ſervants of the Magiſtrate, but of Ieſus Chriſt, and immediately in their miniſteriall acts ſubordinate to the King of Kings. 1. They

If God have made the ſubordination of miniſters as miniſters, and ſervants of the magiſtrate as a magiſtrate, then the viſible Church hath no ordinary right, to Ordinances, Word, Sacraments, diſcipline, but by the magiſtrate; and all that the <hi>Churches</hi> did in the Apoſtles times, or the firſt three hundred yeers after Chriſt, being contrary to the magiſtrates will, muſt be either ſeditious, or then it was by no rule of the Goſpell, but by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſpenſation; and we ſhall have no warrant for any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing of the Word, and of Seals, or Government from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Church, becauſe all that muſt have beene beſide the rule and extraordinary. 6. From this pretended ſubordination, as the ſupream magiſtrate may doe all that the inferiour magiſtrate may doe, becauſe the King is eminently all that the inferiour <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> is, and ſomething more; ſo may he diſpenſe the Word and Sacraments, in regard that the King is by the ſame officiall power over the Church as the Church, <hi>in ſacris,</hi> in all matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as in civill things, and containeth in him, in a high and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner, all that the Church and <hi>Paſtors</hi> can doe, as they are ſuch, and becauſe the King hath the ſame power, in all Arts and Trades, then by his Royal power he might (if he had time and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) build houſes, becauſe of his royall Eminency over all Trades, he might ſit at the helme of any ſhip, and ſteer and rule it, he might

but the externall peace of the common-wealth; hence in a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Church, the Magiſtrate is not to proceed with the ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the body of any Member of the Church, while the Church firſt try and attempt how to ſave his ſoul; therefore the Magiſtrate is to ſentence none as puniſhable by the ſword, while firſt he be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured on by the Church, and upon a previous ſentence of the Church; then muſt the Magiſtrates judging of a ſcandalous Church-member be ſubſequent, and the Churches judging antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: But, 2.

The former concerneth peace with men and edification, to be procured by a mean extrinſecall to edification, to wit, by the ſword; the latter concerneth peace with God, by a ſpirituall ſword, the Word of God. 3. The former is carnall, and of the Kingdome of this world; the latter ſpirituall and of Chriſts other Kingdome, that is not of this world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18. 36. 4. The former worketh by coaction and bodily violence; the latter by removing unwillingneſſe and making a rebellious ſoul obedient. 5. The former is an act of juſtice not terminated on repentance, or the mans turning to God, as an end; for whether this end be obtained, or no, the Magiſtrate is to uſe the ſword, the other is terminated on repentance, as its end: <hi>He that is not with Chriſt, is againſt Chriſt, and with the Devil;</hi> Its true, in all profeſſors of the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as profeſſors, no man, but he muſt

be either on the one ſide, or on the other, either for, or with Chriſt, or againſt him: But it is not true with every reduplication; <hi>thus Miniſters as Miniſters are ſubjects of, or to the King, and to obey him in the Lord, and ſo with Chriſt, hath this ſenſe, Miniſters eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and formally are ſubjects of, or to the King to obey him in the Lord;</hi> ſo as Miniſters do loſe the eſſence and formality of the office of the Miniſtery; if they be not the Kings ſubjects, and with Chriſt; this is moſt falſe, for <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould not be a Miniſter of Chriſt then, in that he was not ſubject to the Law of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> that is, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and diſciple ſhould be for, and under his maſter and Lord, it only followeth; <hi>Ergo, Iudas</hi> was not a godly Miniſter, but under the Devil, not under Chriſt; Magiſtrates do neither eſſentially as Magiſtrates cleave to Chriſt, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> knoweth that we ſpeak of the office of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate as a Magiſtrate, not under the accidents of Chriſtian, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh; there was no reaſon he ſhould apply his Argument to the Parliament, except to make us odious, as if we did not as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or pray for the Parliament and King, as himſelfe: But it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth equally againſt all Magiſtrates, and let him ſee it in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate: for a heathen Magiſtrate as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, doth either manage his office under Chriſt, and for Chriſt, or under the Devil, and for the Devil. This I and Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> alſo ſhall deny, for a heathen Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate, doth not manage his office under, or for Chriſt, as mediator; becauſe he is utterly ignorant of Chriſt, for he hath no more, but what God as creator and nature gave him, ſaith Maſter <hi>Coleman,</hi> pag. 20. and the other horne of the Argument, is as weak for this, <hi>The heathen Magiſtrate as ſuch manageth his office under, or for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> is blaſphemous, for ſo Magiſtracy and the office ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecally unlawfull, and for the Devil: But it is intrinſecally the Ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and apply this to God as creator, it ſhall appear of force. The Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate, doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manage his office under, and for God creator, or under, and for the Devil. The former part is true, becauſe God creator and nature made the office of Magiſtracy, apply it to a heatheniſh huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Father, Maſter, Muſitian, Painter, under theſe reduplications and it ſhall make the relation of Husband Deviliſh, or this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:113466:306"/>
                     <hi>(a Husband, a Father as a Father, and a Husband, manage their office, under, and for Chriſt the mediator, or under, or for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil)</hi> is moſt falſe and blaſphemous: the former part is falſe; for there ſhould have been, and was Father and Husband which did manage the duties of theſe relations, for God creator, not for Chriſt mediator; though Chriſt had never taken on our nature, never been mediator, never been King and Prieſt of his redeemed Church. The latter part is blaſphemous, for then <hi>Adam</hi> had managed the part of Husband and Father under the Devil, and for the Devil, even before he fell in ſinne, and in the ſtate of Innocency. 3. Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> meaning is, that the Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate, and by office is under Chriſt mediator, as his ſupream and immediate vicegerent as mediator; now in this ſenſe, Chriſts ſaying (<hi>he that is not againſt us, is with us</hi>) ſhall not prove the truth of the propoſition, which muſt be this, and is moſt falſe, to wit, that (The Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate, by office, is either under Chriſt mediator, as the ſupream and immediate vicegerent of him as mediator, or he is by office under the Devil.) This we deny, for one might argue thus of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was either as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle for Chriſt, or againſt Chriſt; <hi>Paul</hi> as an Apoſtle is either under Chriſt the mediator, and his ſupream and immediate vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, having power of both Swords, or he is under the Devil: The propoſition is moſt falſe; for <hi>Paul</hi> is neither of them, ſo ſay we here; the Magiſtrate doth neither manage his office, as a Magiſtrate under Chriſt mediator, as his Vicar, and a little head of the Church; nor yet doth the Magiſtrate manage his office under, or for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, God ſave the Magiſtrate, <hi>datur tertium,</hi> he is for Chriſt as a Chriſtian, and as a Chriſtian; but as a Magiſtrate he is not for Chriſt as mediator, that is, as having his office of Chriſt as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and being from Chriſt a Magiſtrate, that is, as M. <hi>Coleman</hi> expoundeth it an officer, <hi>having power of both the Swords:</hi> for Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſaith, <hi>p. 20. Chriſtian Magiſtracy is an Eccleſiaſticall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration;</hi> Ergo, he hath the power of the Spirituall Sword, and <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. ſaith, he hath from God the power of the other Sword: Yea, we cannot ſay that a Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate, or a Miniſter as a Miniſter, are either redeemed and ſaved in Chriſt, nor no redeemed, or no ſaved in Chriſt, but in another reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate, is not redeemed, but as an
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:113466:306"/>
elected man; nor is he damned, or not redeemed as a Magiſtrate, but as a reprobate and an unbeleeving man; and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay of a Miniſter, he that is not with Chriſt, as his immediate and ſupream ſwordbearer, is not againſt Chriſt, for ſo all the world except the Prince, ſhould be againſt him.</p>

Thoſe that think the Magiſtrate bear the ſword lawfully, yet do confine him to the defence of the halfe of Gods Law, the duties of the ſecond Table, and not to theſe all, but to ſuch as border not directly on conſcience; for if ſome ſhould ſacrifice their children to <hi>Molech</hi> and Devils, as ſome do, the Magiſtrate were not to puniſh them, it being a joynt of their Religion and a matter of conſcience: and all theſe will be found to give to the Magiſtrate as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, juſt as little as Ieſuits do in the matters of Religion, and that is right downe nothing, except poſſibly the Magiſtrate be of their Religion only, whom he Governs only as a Chriſtian man; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath more with theſe, then with Papiſts. 4. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> giveth all in Doctrine and Diſcipline, both in power and exerciſe to the Magiſtrate, even to the diſpenſing of Word and Sacraments. 5. Others forſaking <hi>Eraſtus</hi> in a little, But following him in the main, deny power of order. 2. Power of internall juriſdiction granteth to him all the externall government of the Church. 6. We hold that the Magiſtrate keeps both Tables of the Law, and that he hath an inſpection in a civill coactive way, in preſerving both Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Law; but that he is not as a Magiſtrate a member of the Church, but as a Chriſtian only.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The exerciſe of Diſcipline is one thing, and the exerciſe of it, (as the modus) the way of exerciſing of it, either in relation to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall conſtitutions, or in relation to the politick and civill Laws of a Common-wealth, is a far other thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>As the Church is to approve and commend the juſt ſentence of the civill judge in puniſhing ill doers, but only conditionally in ſo far as it is juſt, ſo is the magiſtrate obliged to follow, ratifie, and with his civil ſanction to confirme the ſound conſtitutions of the Church: But condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, not abſolutely, and blindely, but in ſo far as they agree with the Word of God.</hi>

                  <p>9. We grant when any complaineth to the Magiſtrate, that they are oppreſſed in judgement by the Church, that the Church is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to give an account of their doings, but that from common charitie to remove the ſcandall, and that they owe to all Chriſtians, as may be evidently collected from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. but this will not prove a ſubordination to common Chriſtians as to Iudges, nor yet to the Magiſtrate. 2. The Magiſtrate, when his judging is dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſcandalous, is to give an account to the preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who watch for his ſoul: as King <hi>Saul</hi> gave an account to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> (with a falſe Apologie, I grant) that he had obeyed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord; but if <hi>Saul</hi> had been faultleſſe in ſparing <hi>

But that will not prove that King <hi>Saul</hi> was ſubordinate to <hi>Samuel</hi> to be judged of him, becauſe Prophets are but ſervants and Miniſters to declare Gods will, yet is it all the ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we require in this, according to that, <hi>And the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the Lord and Moſes.</hi> Now all the Arguments before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove that Paſtors as Paſtors are not ſubordinate in their paſtorall acts to the civill Magiſtrate, do alſo prove that there is no appeal from the Church in an Eccleſiaſticall buſineſſe to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtrate: For 1. If two Painters contend touching any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie in the myſterie of their Art, they cannot appeal to the King as Iudge; the King then ſhould formally be a painter, and which is abſurd, not by accident; but as a King and ſo here, if the King were the judge, to whoſe determination we might appeale from the Church in a Church controverſie, ſure the King as King ſhould be a Church Officer: if the Prieſts in controverſie <hi>touching burning incenſe,</hi> or offering ſtrange fire to God, ſhould appeal to the deciſion of the King as the King; ſure the King in that as King ſhould be an eminent High Prieſt, and right of burning incenſe to the Lord, ſhould belong to him, in as farre as the Kings lips in that <hi>controverſie ſhould preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law from his mouth,</hi> which is proper to the Prieſts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22, 26. and 44. 23, 24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 11.</p>
                  <p>2. The Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſhould have appealed to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> if he had been a Chriſtian, in the controverſie touching circumciſion; he ſhould have determined who were perverters of ſouls, who not, and ſhould have ſaid by his office, as Emperour, It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and to me. 3. We have not any practiſe, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or promiſe in the Old or New Teſtament, for any ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, except they ſay, all hard queſtions belonging to the Prieſts office were to come before <hi>Moſes</hi> as a civill Magiſtrate, and not as the great Prophet to whom God revealed his minde. 4. If ſo, then all Church controverſies in doctrine and diſcipline, ſhould be ultimately reſolved into the will of the Magiſtrate, ſpeaking according to the word, and faith in moſt points ſhould come by hearing a Magiſtrate determining againſt <hi>Arrius,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt is God conſubſtantiall with the Father,</hi> and all binding and looſing in Earth as in heaven, ſhould be from the Magiſtrate as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, he ſhould forgive and retaine ſins, and Chriſt ſhould have

It was a buſineſſe for which the Sanedrim ſought <hi>Pauls</hi> life and blood, for which they had neither authority nor Law by divine Inſtitution, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſought the helpe of <hi>Felix, Feſtus</hi> and the <hi>Roman Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> ſo <hi>Lyſias vvrote to Felix,</hi> Act. 23. 29. <hi>I perceived</hi> Paul <hi>to be accuſed of queſtions of their law, but to have nothing layd to his charge worthy of death, or of bonds:</hi> Now it is clear the <hi>Roman De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties</hi> thought not any accuſation for the Iewiſh Religion a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of death and bonds, and therefore <hi>Gallio</hi> the Deputie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> Acts 18. 14. ſaith to the Iewes, <hi>if it were a matter of wrong and wicked lewdnes, O yee Iewes, reaſon were that</hi> I <hi>ſhould bear with you. 15.

Neither againſt the Law of the Iewes, neither againſt the Temple, nor yet againſt Ceſar have</hi> I <hi>offended any thing at all.</hi> Therefore <hi>Act. 24.

<pb n="590" facs="tcp:113466:318"/>
Iews knew ſedition and treaſon againſt <hi>Ceſar</hi> behooved to do the turn, and <hi>Paul,</hi> ſeeing they purſued him for his life, appealed to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> to be judged in that. Now, except the adverſaries prove that <hi>Paul</hi> referred the reſurrection of Ieſus, and of the dead, and his preaching Chriſt, and the aboliſhing of ſacrifices, the Temple, the Ceremoniall Law, to be judicially determined by <hi>Nero</hi> as by the head of the Church, they prove nothing againſt us: Hence their chiefe argument is ſoone anſwered; <hi>in what cauſe</hi> Paul <hi>was accuſed of the Iews, in that he appealed to</hi> Ceſar: <hi>But he was accuſed not for his ſedition, but for his Doctrine,</hi> Act. 26. 18. Ergo, Paul <hi>appealed to</hi> Ceſar <hi>in the cauſe of Doctrine, not of ſedition:</hi> For, 1.

When the adverſary ſhall anſwer this argument with equal ſtrength made againſt preaching and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, they will anſwer their owne argument made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Church-government. 3. This argument is made againſt Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods Popiſh, that cannot erre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as our Proteſtant Divines object; and therefore the adverſarie is Popiſh here, not we: Thus they are ſervants and ſlaves who are obliged to follow the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Councels abſolutely, without limitation; and becauſe they ſay it, whether they warrant their decrees by the word of God, or not, that is a true Major propoſition: But now the aſſumption is moſt falſe, for neither Magiſtrates nor any other, are to follow the judgement of the Church abſolutely without limitation, and becauſe they ſay it. The other part is, they are ſervants and ſlaves, who are to follow the judgement of the Church and Councels, with a reſerve, and a condition, and limitation, in ſo far as they agree with the word; now the Major is falſe.</p>

The Magiſtrate as ſupream head of the Church, is by office, to judge what government of the Church is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word, what is ſinfull, Antichriſtian, and tyrannicall; and the Magiſtrates lips in thus judging, as he is a Magiſtrate, and not the Paſtors are to preſerve knowledge; and both Paſtors as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and the people as members of the Church, and as they may worſhip and ſerve God in this government, or may ſin, are to ſeek the Law at the Magiſtrates mouth, and directions for their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from him, as from a Magiſtrate, and not as from a Chriſtian, not from Paſtors as Paſtors that handle the Law.

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. In Anſwer to which, I draw a fourth Argument; All the Heathen Magiſtrates who never heard of the Mediator Chriſt and the Goſpel, cannot by office be the Deputies and Vicars of the mediatory Kingdom, for they are not the profeſſed ſubjects of<note place="margin">The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries muſt teach univerſall Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Chriſt as Mediator, nor given to him <hi>as his poſſeſſion and inheritance,</hi> neither actually, nor in Gods decree; for thouſands of them lived and died without Chriſt or any obligation to beleeve in, or ſerve the Lord Ieſus as Mediator, for if Chriſt be not their rightfull King as Mediator, nor their King at all as Mediator, they cannot be his ſubjects as Mediator, far leſſe can they be his Deputies and Vicars by office of his Kingdome; but Chriſt is not King as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in any ſort or title of ſuch as are Heathen Magiſtrates, for as Mediator he is neither King, <hi>titulo &amp; jure acquiſitionis,</hi> nor <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caci applicatione,</hi> neither <hi>merito,</hi> nor <hi>efficacia,</hi> he neither gave a price as Mediator to buy them, becauſe the adverſaries then muſt ſay, that Chriſt is ſo King of the whole earth, as he hath died for all and every one of mankind: nor are they his ſubjects ſo much as in the profeſſion of the word of his Kingdom, for they never heard it; if the Adverſaries can ſay that Chriſt died for all and every one of mankinde, and ſo for theſe Heathen Kings, I can refute this Article of Arminianiſme; and though Chriſt had died for them, yet are they not ſubjects in ſo much as in profeſſion, and ſo in no capacity nor obligation to ſerve with their ſword, Chriſt as Mediator, for they are not in that ſtate obliged to beleeve in him, nor to know him as Mediator; how then are they obliged by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſerve him as Mediator, except he had revealed himſelf to them in the Goſpel? Hence I need not prove that Chriſt is their King by efficacious applying of the merits of his death to them, nor can any ſay this Argument may prove that Paſtors by office are the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, becauſe they are not all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Chriſt given to him as Mediator, either in the decree of Election, nor actually redeemed; for many Paſtors who are by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt as Mediator, are Reprobates, as was <hi>Iudas</hi> and others; for the Argument is not drawn from any ſaving claime that heathen Princes who never heard of Chriſt
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:113466:328"/>
hath to Chriſt, but it is drawn from no claim at all, no not ſo much as in profeſſion; now this claim in profeſſion all Paſtors have, elſe they cannot be Paſtors.</p>
                  <p>It is doubtſome that Maſter <hi>Coloman</hi> ſaith, and not to a purpoſe, That Chriſt granteth not a liberty to the greateſt part of the world, to remain infidels and enemies to him and his Government: For thus he giveth them a liberty negative, ſo as they are not obliged to believe a Goſpel that they never heard, nor is their negative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity a ſin, for which they are condemned: they are condemned, <hi>Becauſe they glorifie not the Creator as God,</hi> Rom. 1. 21. <hi>And do not the things of the Law, that are written in their hearts,</hi> Rom. 2. 12. 14. Mat. 25. 42, 43, 44. And in this ſenſe God giveth to them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to remain infidels, but he giveth them not liberty poſitively to remain infidels and enemies to Chriſt, that is, he willeth not <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſigni;</hi> that they ſhould live in a ſinfull courſe of unrenewed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but they are not poſitively enemies to Chriſt and to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who never by the leaſt rumour heard of Chriſt or his Kingdom or Government: Hence all our Divines ſay, that priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unbeliefe of thoſe that hear the Goſpel, doth condemn, but not the negative unbeliefe of thoſe who never heard the Goſpel: Thus the adverſaries muſt ſay, except they with Arminians, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with <hi>Moſes Amyrald</hi> teach, That there be two wayes of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Chriſt, and two ſorts of faiths in Chriſt, one of thoſe that hear the Goſpel, and another of thoſe who are to believe in Chriſt, though they never hear of, or know any letter of the Goſpel, who yet by the book of creation and providence are obliged to believe in Chriſt, which were an irrationall obligation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>

The Magiſtrate without any ſpirituall power judges what is the true Church and true ordinances, ſetteth them up by his ſword; he doth ſet them up only for a civill end, becauſe they conduce moſt for the peace and flouriſhing condition of the civill ſtate, whereof he is head, not that the members of his ſtate may attain life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; for the Magiſtrate intendeth life eternall to his ſubjects in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a true Church, and true Ordinances, not as a Magiſtrate, but as a godly man: As the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> brought out the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> that they might receive Chriſt in their heart by ſaith, as ſhe had done: But as a Magiſtrate he intendeth not life eternall to his ſubjects; ſo a Maſter as a Maſter, hireth a man to ſerve who is a believer, and as a Maſter he judgeth ſuch a one will be moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and active in his ſervice; now the Maſter judgeth him not to be a Saint, that he may be a fit member of the Church: The Church only as the Church is to judge ſo of this ſervant, nor doth he judge him a believer, that he may obtain life eternall, nor doth he love and chuſe him as his ſervant, that he may obtain life eternall; Chriſtians as Chriſtians, judge and love one another that way: So the Husband as a Husband doth chuſe a believing woman for his Wife, judging ſhe will perform the duties of a Wife, better then an unbelieving Wife, he judgeth her to be a believer as a Husband, and loveth her with a Husband-love as a Husband; but if he love her becauſe the image of God is in her, and as an heir of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:113466:336"/>
then he loveth her as a Chriſtian man, not as a Husband, and it is a Chriſtian love he hath to her, ſuch as he hath to other godly women that are alſo co<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heirs with himſelf of life eternall; and this is a lawfull and a Chriſtian love: But if this Husband ſhould bear a Husband-love, ſuch as he doth to his own Wife, to all other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wives, it ſhould be an adulterous and unlawfull love: So the Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate, judges, loves, chuſes, and ſetteth up true Ordinances, a true Church, as means of a flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of externall Peace, and pulleth down the contrary as means deſtructive to the peace and ſafety of his ſubjects: But he judgeth not in a ſpirituall manner, and with any ſpirituall power of the ſword, of thoſe as fitting and conducing to life eternall, and inward peace of conſcience with God; but as a juſtified and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Saint, he judgeth, chuſeth, and loveth Ordinances, and the true Church in this conſideration, and no wiſe as a Magiſtrate: If thoſe Relations of Magiſtrate and Chriſtian had been conſidered by the Author, he had not compared the Magiſtrate puniſhing ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to the Dragon, and the godly Paſtors who exhort the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to puniſh falſe teachers to the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, who maketh war with the Lambe: For the godly magiſtrate who advanceth the throne of the Lambe, is praiſe worthy; he doth cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 8. and doth this as a Magiſtrate, that his Kingdome might have peace and well grounded proſperity; but as a man according to Gods heart he doth it formally ſet on high the throne of the Lambe, nor would he have compared thoſe worthy and dear brethren of New <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the Saints of the moſt high, eſpecially reverend Maſter <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to the frogs that proceeded out of the mouth of the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 3.

Its a diſtinction void of Scripture and reaſon, for the Apoſtolick Churches by it muſt have no Government as Churches at all: for to publiſh the Goſpel which is made the one half; Yea, all Church-government (for this punitive part is a dream) is not Church-government, nor any part thereof.</p>
                  <p>1. Maſter <hi>Coleman</hi> deſires that the Parliament would give to preachers Doctrine and power of preaching and wages, learning and competency: as for Governing of the Church, let the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate have that, Miniſters have other work to do, and ſuch as will take up the whole man. Sermon, <hi>Pag.</hi> 24, 25. Then preaching the Word to the Church, cannot be any part of Governing of the Church.</p>
                  <p>2. Becauſe Church government is properly acted by the Church, with the power of the keyes, to bind and looſe in earth, as in Heaven by Church-cenſures, and pardoning of an offender, and committed to many, to the Church, to a ſociety gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Mat. 18. 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But publiſhing of the Goſpel is done by one ſingle Paſtor, even to the end of the world, even where there is no Church, even in the hearts of the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 33, 34. of <hi>Felix, Act.</hi> 24. 25. of the Iayler not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 29, 30, 31. of the <hi>woman of Samaria,</hi> Ioh. 4. 28, 29, 30. The Goſpel exerciſeth a doctrinall and externall government on thouſands, the like without the Church viſible: yea, and who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are members of a viſible Church; is this any Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which we now ſpeak? and in all the Scripture a power of the keyes to govern the viſible Church, was never committed to any one ſingle man by Ieſus Chriſt; if an Apoſtolick-priviledge of <hi>Pauls</hi> excommunicating his alone be objected, I can eaſily anſwer,
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:113466:339"/>
Apoſtles continue not to the end of the world. 2. This doctrinal publiſhing of the word, is the plants and flowers of the Gardens but Church-government is the hedge, and thoſe two are not to be confounded. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> differenceth them as two diſtinct qualities of a Preacher, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. while he will have him apt to teach, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. one that can rule the Church of God well; and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. ruling well, is diſtinguiſhed from labouring in the Word and Doctrine as a charge worthy of leſſe honour, from a charge worthy of double honour. 4. All Proteſtant Divines diſtinguiſh Doctrine and Government, the former belonging to the being and eſſence of a viſible Church, as an eſſentiall note thereof, I mean the publike and ſettled publiſhing of the Goſpel; the other is only a thing belonging to the well being of the viſible Church, and an accident thereof; ſo it is a heedleſſe tenent to make the former a part with the latter. 5. When we ſwear a conformity of Doctrine and worſhip in one Confeſſion, one Catechiſme, one Directory, we do not ſwear the ſame over again, when we ſwear to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the neareſt uniformity in Church-government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we cannot but do, if the Doctrine and Worſhip be nothing but a part of Church-government; or if it be all Church-government: n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now how Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> did ſwear to indeavour the neareſt uniformity of a <hi>Chimera,</hi> and a thing that is juſt nothing, let himſelf conſider.</p>
                  <p>As for Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> punitive part of <hi>Church Government</hi> by the Magiſtrate, this by his way is done by the power of the ſword of the Magiſtrate, ſaith he, and therefore citeth <hi>Rom. 13. He beareth not the ſword in vain,</hi> &amp;c. Hence either the Apoſtolique <hi>Church</hi> had no cenſures at all, and ſo no viſible government and order, but preaching of the Word was all; and except we would adde to our pattern, and be more wiſe then the Holy Ghoſt and the Apoſtles, we ought to have no <hi>Church Government,</hi> but onely preaching the Word; or then the Apoſtles, Paſtors, and Teachers medled with the ſword of the Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> in diſcharging the punitive part, for with no other inſtrument doth the Magiſtrate puniſh ill-doers, but with the ſword, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4, 5. This text Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> citeth to make bloody <hi>Nero</hi> a Church-governour: But no ground is for this in the Word, that <hi>Paul, Peter, Timothy, Archippus</hi> meddled with the Emperours ſword, or that the weapons of their warfare
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:113466:339"/>
were carnal; or that <hi>Paul</hi> was the Miniſter of God, bearing the ſword for the puniſhment of evil doers: I think <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh<note place="margin">That the Magiſtrates puniſhing with the ſword, ſeandalous perſons ſhould be a part of Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonleſſe conceit.</note> of civil bodily puniſhing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and no violence greater can be offered to the Word of God; for if that power be an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal adminiſtration, every ſoul, and ſo the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, is to be ſubject to this Eccleſiaſtical and Church power; and if ſo, then to the Church: If Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> deny the conſequence, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be ſubject to the Magiſtrate, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. to be ſubject to the power civil, that is, of God: If the Magiſtracy be an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ordinance and a vicegerent power of the mediator, as they ſay it is; then to be ſubject to the Magiſtrate, is to be ſubject to this Church power, and to be ſubject to the Church. 2. The puniſhing power of the Magiſtrate as ſuch, doth not bind and looſe on Earth, and open and ſhut Heaven; for then <hi>hoc ipſo,</hi> becauſe the Magiſtrate doth judge and puniſh evil doers, the mans ſin ſhould be bound in Heaven; now ſo the judging and puniſhing power ſhould take hold of the conſcience: But it is certain, the Magiſtrate as judge may take away the life of a Capital Delinquent, when he knoweth the man repenteth and believeth, and findeth mercy with God; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this magiſtratical power is not Eccleſiaſtical; for if the man to the knowledge of all repent, the Church hath no power to bind his ſin on Earth, nor will God bind his ſin in Heaven; but yet the Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate is to puniſh; <hi>Ergo,</hi> this puniſhing power is no Eceleſiaſtical power, nor any part of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>3. The punitive power of the Magiſtrate hath influence on men as ill-doers, whether they be within the Church or without the Church, and worketh on men as Members of the Common wealth, whether Chriſtians, or Heathens, Indians, or Americans: But no punitive power of the Church, is or can be extended to thoſe that are without the Church, but Paſtors and the Church leaveth them to be judged of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. nor can they be caſt out of the viſible Church, who were never within it.</p>
                  <p>4. The punitive power of the Church as ſuch, floweth from Chriſt as Mediator, Head and King of the Church; becauſe Chriſt as Head and Mediator, hath appointed a ſhepheards ſtaffe, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or rebukes, Church-cenſures, and Excommunication for his ſheep, his redeemed ones, family, and people, for whom he is Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:113466:340"/>
his Scepter and Rod muſt be congruouſly and ſutably propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to his Crown, and ſpiritual Royal power: But the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power of Magiſtrates floweth from God the Creator, as the whole world is the family of God; ſo for the preſervation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, the Lord hath been pleaſed to appoint Magiſtrates, and the punitive power of them by the ſword, to correct ill-doers for the peace, good, and ſafety of humane ſocieties.</p>
                  <p>5. All punitive Church-power is for edification, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 8. That the mans ſpirit may be ſavdd in the day of the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 5. that the party may be gained by private and publike Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, <hi>Mat. 18. 15.

Theſe Divines difference the Magiſtrate and the Church, in cenſures, power, function. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> confoundeth them, and ſaith as the Anabaptiſts of old did; againſt whom, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Bullinger, Gualther, Lavater, Muſculus, Wolfius, Aretius, Simlerus,</hi> diſputed, that the civil Magiſtrate may lawfully diſpence the Word and Sacraments. 4. They never condemned the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of <hi>Geneva; Eraſtus</hi> doth. 5. They acknowledge there was in the apoſtolick Church, an Eccleſiaſtical Senate or Presbytery: <hi>Eraſtus</hi> ſaith, this is a deviſe wanting Scripture. 6. They denied Excommunication to be exerciſed by all the Church, as a deviſe of the Anabaptiſts: <hi>Bullinger</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. a dilectis ad hoc homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.

                  <p>2. <hi>Bullinger</hi> and <hi>Gualther</hi> do think, that the Lords Supper, which is an action of publike thankſgiving and communion, ſhould

Is not the union of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in a Church-body a ſweet bound? is this communion tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to a baſtard end, unknown to Chriſt and the Apoſtles? becauſe the inceſtuous man is caſt out of that Communion? This is as who would ſay, the Table of the Houſe is a ſymbol of a ſweet Communion of all the children of the Houſe; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Table is turned from its native Uſe, and is abuſed, if a flagitious and wicked ſon be turned out at the doors and removed from the Table. I think the contrary is true; the Lords Table ordained for children, is converted into an Uſe not known to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, when the Table is prepared for dogs and ſwine; and this argument is againſt Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. as much as againſt us. 2. By this the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated caſt out of the Houſe, is not debarred from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Houſe. What ſenſe is here? the offender is caſt out from amongſt the children of the Lords family, and yet is admitted to the Table of the family?</p>
                  <p>3. Theſe great Divines teach, that in the dayes of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, there was ſuch an ordinance as excommunication, and that the Church who worketh not miracles, for any thing that we read, and received a precept from the Holy Ghoſt for Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as a moral and perpetual mean to remove ſcandals, to<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſupply the place of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> humble and ſhame an obſtinate offender, to preſerve the Church from contagion, and to edifie all, as is clear, <hi>Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 2 Theſ. 3. 14, 15.

Whereas Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> and others ſay, that by the preaching of the Word, not by Church-diſcipline, men are converted to Chriſt, as witneſſe the many thouſands of godly people in <hi>England</hi> where there have been no government,

The Magiſtrate by puniſhing drunkenneſſe, or fornication or extortion (for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take away the life for theſe) doth not keep the lump of the whole Church from being leavened and infected with the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of ſuch: The Church by removing and caſting out ſuch an one, muſt do that; and the perſonal ſeparating from ſuch as walk inordinately, cannot be an act of the Magiſtrate, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a perpetual and moral mean or ordinance that the Church is to uſe, not only when they have not a Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but perpetually; for we are to withdraw from thoſe that walk inordinately, and are not to be corrupted with having intire fellowſhip with wicked men, whether the Church have a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrate or no: I am to gain my brother by rebuking, and by telling the Church, and to eſteem one that heareth not the Church, as an Heathen, or a Publican, that I may gain him: Whether there be a Chriſtian or an Heathen Magiſtrate in the Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it can be proved, that the Magiſtrate as the Magiſtrate, is to gain ſouls to God: Yea, <hi>Muſculus, Bullinger,</hi> and <hi>Gualther,</hi> have alike reaſon to ſay, there is no need that we rebuke privately a treſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing brother, <hi>and that we forgive him ſeven times a day,</hi> when the Church hath a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, as they can ſay there is no need of Excommunication: for if the ſword can ſupply the room of one ſpiritual ordinance of God, why not of another alſo? and the text will bear us out as well to ſay, we are not to eſchew the company of a ſcandalous brother, for ſhaming of him, and for the danger of being leavened by him, becauſe the Magiſtrates ſword
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:113466:345"/>
may ſupply the want of that mean of edifying, as well as it may ſupply the want of Excommunication: Yea, they may ſay there is no need of publike rebukes by the Word, the ſword may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe alſo.<note place="margin">C. 18.</note>

But I hope they are not indifferent in your meaning, as are Surplice, Holydays, &amp;c. For you will not ſay the Church may make Laws that no Prayers be but in the Fields, no Preaching except the Preacher be cloathed with a Cloak. 2.

If it were morally indifferent to marry, or not to marry, Rulers might make Laws either commanding all to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or none to marry, or ſome to marry; ſome not to marry, which were no ſmall tyranny, and the very doctrine of Devils. 2. The gift of Continency, is to ſome a commandment of God, that they marry not, and burning is to ſome a commandment, obliging them in conſcience to marry, elſe they ſin; therefore to marry, or not to marry, is neceſſary to all men, or then unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſo not indifferent, as our <hi>Divines</hi> teach againſt Papiſts, their Supererogatorie Works.

For the libertie that the Widow hath there, is not, that it is indifferent to her to marry, or not to marry; for ſince our Adverſaries teach, That Rulers may make Laws in things indifferent; they might then make a Law that no Widows ſhall marry, which were vile tyrannie. But the libertie <hi>that the Widow hath to marry whom ſhe will,</hi> is oppoſed onely to a Law and Obligation Matrimonial, that ſhe was under, while her Husband did live.

An action individual, that is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indifferent, and ſo without ſin may be performed, without ſin, or omitted without ſin, cannot be an action of Faith referred to Gods glory: For what may be done without ſin, and may not be done without ſin, is a will-action, and wanteth all neceſſitie of reaſon, and ſo is an idle and ſinful action; but a ſinful action may be done in fancy, but in Faith it cannot be done; it may, in the vain intention of the doer, be referred to Gods glory, <hi>In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentione erronea operantis,</hi> but <hi>ex conditione operis,</hi> according to the nature of the work it ſerveth not for Gods glory. This way to caſt ſtones in the water, ſhould be of Faith, and referred to Gods glory: But ſhall I beleeve I am doing in Faith, and glorifying God, when I am caſting ſtones in the water, and I have as good reaſon not to caſt at all? If one wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action that may be done, and may not be done, may be of Faith, and referred to Gods glory, then may they all be of Faith, and referred to Gods glory: This is a laughter, rather then Divinitie. 3. I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that an action that hath as good reaſon to be omitted, as to be done, can be acceptable to God, becauſe I have no ground for my Faith; for my Faith here leaneth neither on Scripture, nor on Reaſon, but there is no reaſon why the action ſhould rather be, nor not be, becauſe it is indifferent; yea, croſſing and kneeling of themſelves ſhall be of Faith, becauſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them to be of Faith: But it is a vain thing to ſay, that Faith maketh its object. 4. There are no actions in the World, but they have all their Moral neceſſitie from their intrinſecal goodneſſe: For from whence is it neceſſary to love God, but from the intrinſecal goodneſſe, that the love of God hath from Gods command? For there is no neceſsitie an action to be at all; yea, it is idle and ſuperfluous, if there be no goodneſſe in it at all. If then croſsing and kneeling, (laying aſide the respect of Humane Laws commanding them) have no neceſsitie Moral, from any Commandment of God, why they ſhould be at all, their neceſsitie muſt be all from mans will: this is tyranny in Rulers, for their ſole pleaſure to command, under the heavieſt pain, things that have no neceſsitie at all, but their will. 5. Neither is it any yoak to mens conſcience, to ſquare all

                  <p>3. In things indifferent, from whence ariſeth a Scandall there be <hi>two</hi> things. 1. The uſe of the thing it ſelfe. 2. The uſe of it, with the non-neceſſitie of exiſtence in it. As the cauſey ſtones are not ſcandalous, if any fall on them, nor the layer of the cauſey to be blamed therefore, becauſe cauſay ſtones be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, but if any lay an huge block in the way, which hath no neceſſary uſe there, he who doth ſo is the cauſe of the fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he contributeth to the fall, that which is the occaſion, and ſo the cauſe of the fall, for every occaſion is a certaine cauſe. 2. Becauſe he contributeth ſuch an occaſion as hath no morall neceſſitie of exiſtence, ſo the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> having loſt its vertue of curing and being adored as <hi>God,</hi> is formally a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous object, and the Prince ſuffering that to remaine, when it is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113466:359"/>
not neceſſarie, and withall occaſioneth the idolatrie of many, doth culpably ſcandalize, and ſo theſe who for ſole will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth ſuch things as the worſhip of <hi>God</hi> may want, doe alſo ſcandalize. They object, <hi>Chriſt might have healed on another day, then the</hi> Lords. <hi>Ergo, the non-morall neceſſitie maketh not the object formally ſcandalous, nor doth the contributer thereof culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſcandalize.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould cure on the Sabbath, was moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary. 1. If it were but from his owne will, but mens will cannot make things neceſſary. 2. It was neceſſarie to ſhew, <hi>that the Sonne of man was</hi> Lord <hi>of the Sabbath.</hi> 3. That the Sabbath was made for man. and not man for the Sabbath. 4. To ſhew, that workes of mercy are to be preſerred to workes of Ceremonies, and that <hi>God</hi> loveth mercie, rather then Sacrifice,</p>
                  <p>When the dutie is onely poſſible, and the good leſſe neceſſary, then the good of non-ſcandalizing, then we are not, for hope of a poſſible dutie, and leſſe neceſſarie, to doe that from whence a Scandall doth ariſe.

To contribute helpe for the doing of that, which of it ſelfe is neceſſarie, which I know, an other in reſpect of humane frailtie, will abuſe to ſinne is no active ſcandall. So to lay hands on a qualified Paſtor is not ſinne, though I foreſee through humane frailtie, he will abuſe his power in ſome things to ſinne. So, for an Artificer to make ſwords, though he know ſome ſhall abuſe them to murthering the innocent, is no ſcandalous work.

of the heart to evill, and therefore no information of Paſtors can remove the ſcandall of the weake; For then <hi>David</hi> in committing adulterie, <hi>Noah</hi> in drunkenneſs, <hi>Lot</hi> in his ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous folly with his owne daughters, <hi>Peter</hi> in denying his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, ſhould not have cauſed others within, or without the <hi>Church</hi> to ſtumble, nor have culpably ſcandalized them; So <hi>David. Noah, Lot,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> had preached to all that heard of their fall, that adulterie, drunkenneſs, inceſt, and denyall of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were grievous ſinnes to be avoyded, and that it was ſin for any to be ſcandalized thereat, for ſuch information ſhould have given ſufficient literall information to beware of the like ſinnes. Yea, a father might incloſe in a chamber, his ſonne and a beautifull virgin, and if he ſhould ſufficiently informe his ſon of the guiltineſs, and puniſhment of harlotrie, he ſhould not lay a ſtumbling-block before his ſonne. Yet we all know, a ſtumbling-block may be layed before the inclination no leſſe, then before the blind minde, yea ſuppoſe, to warne a Traveller of a pit, in his way, might be ſufficient, to make the digger of the pit free of laying a ſtumbling-block in the way (as it is not) ſeeing to make a pit is not indifferent, yet it ſhall not free the Commanders of Ceremonies and the acts of <hi>Pearth</hi> Aſſemblie of active ſcandall, becauſe men naturally loving life and health, hate to fall into pitts, which may indanger their life, and ſo have no inward morall inclination to fall into a pitt; but men though informed of ſpirituall falls, and warned to beware of them, yet love and incline to Idolatrie, and therefore to warne them to beware, and yet ſet the powder neere the fire, is but to ſcorne the craft, and to mock men. Yea, in that they deſire and require, that the people beware of the Ceremonies, and require that Paſtours informe them of the danger; they grant that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are powder amongſt the pitchers, and yet they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and indifferent creatures, as if they would call them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different pitts, indifferent whoores to allure, beware of them; indifferent peſt-cloathes, ſee that your inclination touch them not. Yea, then <hi>Ezechiah</hi> had given no ſcandall, if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the brazen Serpent ſtill to ſtand, and had commanded the Prieſts to preach that the Serpent was not <hi>God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warned the people of their Idolatrie in burning Incence to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113466:365"/>
it, onely let it ſtand as a memoriall of <hi>Gods</hi> power in curing the people, who were ſtinged with Serpents in the Wilderneſſe. So if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould give their ſonnes and daughters <hi>to marry ſtrange women of the Canaanites,</hi> if they ſhould ordaine the Prieſts to teach carefully their married children, to beware, that they were not drawne away, by theſe idolatrous marriages, to ſerve the <hi>Gods of the Canaanites,</hi> they ſhould not lay a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block before their ſonnes and daughters. Yea, theſe who excell in light, may be weake in grace, and in hazard to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared, by the idolatrie and ſuperſtition of Ceremonies.</p>

But here the ſcandall is given in that, we muſt practiſe baſe Ceremonies, indifferent knots of ſtraws for mens pleaſure, though from thence many ſoules <hi>for whom</hi> Chriſt <hi>died,</hi> be deſtroyed. 2.

And ſo 5. I may invite <hi>Papists, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> and all the Patrons of the <hi>Pope,</hi> to thanke you, and kiſſe your pen, for theſe words <hi>we ſay that the lawfull Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Superiours</hi> (of Prelates commanding things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent) <hi>may make that ſcandall of our weake brethren not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us, which otherwiſe would be imputed unto us, as a matter of our guiltineſs.</hi> What ever (my brethren) may be imputed to you otherwiſe, &amp; before the law of <hi>Pearth Aſſemblie</hi> was made, as the <hi>matter of your guiltineſs,</hi> was your ſinne, for nothing can be imputed to Men or Angels, as <hi>guiltineſs,</hi> but fin. But if the Commandements of Prelates may make that not to be imputed to you, which <hi>otherwiſe</hi> and before, or without that law of Superiours, would have been imputed as the matter of your guiltineſſe, then the law of Superiours and Prelates may make that, which without that law, would have been ſinne, to be no ſinne at all.

It is wicked Divinitie, to mean, that we are not to eſchew the murthering of a weake brother for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> died providing we offend not, that is, diſpleaſe not our Superiours.

the ſecond Table; but this is not to our purpoſe, but every commandement of the fifth Commandement; yea, every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the firſt Table, is not above every commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſecond Table.

Yet it followeth not that every commandement of the fift Commandement, as when my father commandeth me to preach in a linnen Ephod, and to caſt a Character with my thumbe in the aire, as croſſing is, ſhall be of more obligation then this commandement of <hi>God (Thou ſhalt not deſtroy his ſoule for whom Chriſt died)</hi> 4.

It is true, <hi>theſe duties which we owe to others by way of juſtice, are more obligatorie then theſe which we owe only by way of charitie, caeteris paribus,</hi> When duties of the law of Nature, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, are compared together, then indeed the duties which we owe, both by the tye of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charitie,</hi> are more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, then the duties <hi>that we</hi> owe only by the tye of <hi>Charitie.</hi> As for example; My father is in danger, before my eyes, to be drowned, in one deepe water; and before my eyes alſo, my neighbour and friend is in danger of the like kind; the two tyes and bands of Juſtice and Charitie, both by the fifth and ſixth Commandements are more obligatorie, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and doe more ſtrictly obliege, that I run to ſuccour, and preſerve the life of my father, then the life of my neighbour, for the obligation to my neighbour, is only charitie, by the obligation of the ſixth Commandement, which obligation ceaſeth, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> at this time, when my fathers life is in hazard; and thus farre the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors argument goeth for ſtrong, as <hi>Schoolemen, Caſuiſts,</hi> and Divines teach. But it is not to a purpoſe for the Doctors; For all offices and duties generally, and univerſally, of what ever kind, which we owe by way of Juſtice, are not more obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, then duties which we owe, only by way of Charitie, as when duties of a poſitive commandement of <hi>God,</hi> enjoyned by our Superiours, and duties which we owe by charitie only, are compared together, then the Doctors major Propoſition <hi>is not cleare of it ſelfe,</hi> as they dreame, nor doe <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> or <hi>Ameſius,</hi> or Divines ſay with them, but truth, and all our Divines ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Let us ſuppoſe that the King, and Convocation, and Aſſembly of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> make a Canon according to Gods Word. <hi>That no manner of man preſume to eat ſhew-bread, ſave the Prieſts only.</hi> All men owe obedience to this, both becauſe it is <hi>Gods</hi> expreſſe Law, and by the band

of Juſtice, the Elders and Aſſembly of the Ancients have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it.

                        </gap>, blameleſſe. Now <hi>Davia</hi> was under a dutie by mercy, and love to his owne life, and he lives of his followers, to eat ſhew-bread, and he was under the band of Juſtice, by the law of the <hi>Ancients of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Gods</hi> law, not to eat. Therefore in ſome caſes, when our Superiours commandements are only poſitive Lawes, they are not more obligatorie, then duties of Charitie, only commanded in the law of nature. I cleare it further thus, I ſee my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in danger before my eyes of drowning, and my father commandeth me to goe and labour, or ſowe his farme in that time, while I am to preſerve the life of my neighbour in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger, to loſe his life, in a great water. By the Doctors maxime I am under the higher obligatorie tye of Juſtice, to obey my father, who commandeth a thing both lawfull and neceſſarie by vertue of the higher Commandement, to wit, the firſt of the ſecond Table, then I am obliged by the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and of charitie only, to give preſent ſuccour and help to my dying neighbour, ſo I muſt let my neighbour die in the waters, to give a dutie of juſtice to my father, of farre leſſe neceſſitie. I would not commit my conſcience to ſuch <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> as are the <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> But if the Doctors would ſee with ſome new light of reaſon; it is cleare, that not only the tye of Juſtice maketh the precept more obligatorie, but alſo the weightineſſe of the thing commanded; Yea, and if the poſitive Commandements of the <hi>Lord our God,</hi> who of Juſtice and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoveraigntie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath right to aske obedience of us above all earthly Superiours doe yeeld and cede as leſſe obligatorie, then commandements of love only, that are commanded in the law of nature. What doe our Doctors clatter and fable to us of a right of Juſtice, that mortall Rulers have to command in things indifferent, from which the deſtruction of ſoules doth ariſe? for theſe commandements of Rulers, <hi>(kneele religiouſly before bread, the vicegerent image of Chriſt crucified) (keepe humane holy-dayes) Croſſe the aire with your thumb above a baptized</hi>

But ſhall they be more obligatorie by a ſuppoſed band of Juſtice that Prelates have over us to command, ſuch toy's then this divine law of <hi>God</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom. 14.

I might wearie the reader here with citations, and bewilder my ſelfe alſo, but it is a point of Divinitie denyed by none at all. 3. What we owe of Juſtice to our Superiours, is indeed both a morall debt of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and a debt of juſtice, and law which Rulers may ſeeke by their place, and <hi>ex jure,</hi> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, but this right is limited, Rulers have no right to ſeeke abſolute obedience, but only <hi>in the Lord,</hi> not againſt charitie. And though the place of Rulers be authoritative, yet their commanding power, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter of what they injoyne is only Miniſteriall, and they cannot but in Gods place exact, that which is <hi>Gods due,</hi> and ſeeing <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, if he ſhould immediatly in his owne perſon command, he would not urge a poſitive commandement, farre leſſe the commandement of light and vaine Ceremonies, againſt and beyond the precept of love, not to deſtroy a ſoule for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> died. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Superiours under <hi>God,</hi> who bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all their right from <hi>God,</hi> cannot have a higher right then <hi>God</hi> hath. 4.

                     <hi>Whittakerus</hi> anſwer <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that <hi>Paul,</hi> Coll. 2. <hi>ſpeaketh againſt all Commandements of men,</hi> yea, <hi>hee ſpeaketh againſt Angel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worſhip, which is not a Jewiſh ſhadow, whereof Chriſt is the bodie.</hi> But they ſay it is a wide rule, <hi>that all things that may be wanting in Gods worſhip, are to be omitted in the caſe of ſcandall.</hi> I anſwer, there be three ſort of things here conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. 1. Things not commanded of <hi>God,</hi> as all religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances, theſe are utterly unlawfull, when the uſing of them ſcandalizeth. 2. Things that fall under an affirmative precept, and theſe cannot be totally omitted, for eſchewing ſcandall: for what ever <hi>God</hi> hath commanded is ſome way neceſſarie. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ſome wayes, and in ſome caſes, may be done, though offence be taken at it, but branches, or parts of affirmative precepts may be omitted, for eſchewing of ſcandall, as ſuch a particular kneeling in prayer, in ſuch a place: but Gods affirmatiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts leave not off to be alwayes ſcandalous actively though information be given, <hi>for where the uſe hurteth, the abuſe and ſcandall is not taken away by teaching,</hi> to teach how Images ſhould not be abuſed, make not Images to leave off to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous objects. 3. There bee ſome things of meere civill uſe, as Bells, Gownes, Pulpits, preaching on Tueſday or Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Theſe be conſidered two wayes. 1 As neceſſarie with <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of conveniencie ſimply.</hi> 2. With neceſſitie of convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. <hi>ſecundum prevalentiam graduum,</hi> as convenient in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of neceſſitie, or that morall, <hi>maximum quod ſit,</hi> in the firſt degree, what ſcandalizeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to be rejected; in the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they oblige, and if any be ſcandalized thereat, it is taken
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:113466:385"/>
and not given. It may be the Church ſees not alwayes the higheſt and ſuperlative conveniencie, in theſe Phyſicall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but they oblige not becauſe of the Churches authoritie, no more then the word of <hi>God</hi> borroweth authority from the <hi>Church,</hi> but they have an intrinſecall neceſſitie in themſelves, though right reaſon in the <hi>Church</hi> ſee not alwayes this neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, therefore that a ſigne be given for convening the people that the Preacher officiate in the moſt grave and convenient habite is neceſſarie, <hi>Jure divino, by Gods law,</hi> and that tolling of Bells, and a Gowne, a Pulpit bee as particulars moſt convenient for theſe ends, the Church Miniſterially doth judge, ſo as the obligatorie power is from the things themſelves, not from the will of humane Superiours. No neceſſitie of peace which is poſterior to truth, no neceſſitie of obedience to authoritie, no neceſſitie of uniformitie in theſe externals, ſimply, and as they are ſuch, are neceſſities obliging us to obedience: for things muſt firſt in themſelves be neceſſarie, before they can oblige to obedience. I muſt obey Superiours in theſe things of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent neceſſitie, becauſe they are convenient, and moſt convenient in themſelves, and ſo intrinſecally moſt neceſſarie, but they are not neceſſarily to be done in themſelves, becauſe I muſt obey Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, and becauſe I muſt keep uniformitie with the <hi>Church.</hi> The will of Superiours doe find in things neceſſitie, and good of uniformitie, but they doe not make neceſſitie, nor the good of uniformitie: We ſhould be ſervants of men, if our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence were <hi>ultimatè</hi> reſolved, in the meere will of Superiours, in any the leaſt circumſtance of worſhip: and what I ſay of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, holdeth in matters of meere cuſtome alſo.</p>
                  <p>But Maſter <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> D. <hi>Forbes,</hi> M. <hi>Paybodie, teach that we are not to regard the ſcandall of the malitious, as of Phariſees.</hi> To which I anſwer, We are to have alike regard, in caſe of ſcandall, to wicked and malitious, as to weake and infirme. For we are not to regard the paſſive ſcandall of the weake more nor of the wicked, for who ever ſtumble at the neceſſarie ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of <hi>God,</hi> they take a ſcandall, which is not culpably gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But that we are to regard the active ſcandall of all, even the moſt malitious, I demonſtrate thus, 1 <hi>Rom. 14. 15. Paul</hi> proveth that we are not to ſcandalize our brother, 1. becauſe it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113466:386"/>
is againſt charitie. 2. Becauſe we are not to deſtroy him, for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> died: but we owe love to the malitious, even to our enemies, and muſt not walke uncharitably toward him, as the law of <hi>God</hi> requireth. 3. A malitious man is one for whom Chriſt died, very often, as is cleare in <hi>Paul</hi> before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
                  <p>2. 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 32. Wherefore give no ſcandall, neither to the Jewes, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God. 33. Even as I pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking mine owne profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi> Here be many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for our purpoſe, <hi>All men;</hi> whether weake or wilfull, are either <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and none more malitious againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> then the <hi>Jewes,</hi> yet muſt we take heed that we give them no ſcandall.</p>
                  <p>3. If we muſt pleaſe all men, in all things indifferent, <hi>Ergo,</hi>

Now weakneſſe or malice in the ſcandalized is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to the nature of ſcandall active, for active ſcandalizing is to doe inordinately and unſeaſonably, that which <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> may be omitted, from which any is ſcandalized, either weake or wilfull, to lay a ſnare to kill a wicked man (except it be, by the authoritie of him, who beareth the ſword under <hi>God</hi>) is murther, no leſſe then to kill an innocent man. 6.

I anſwer 1. The poore, as the caſe was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. might eat Swines fleſh, and ſo ruine him, for whom <hi>Christ</hi> died, which is abſurd for their neceſſitie might require it. But certaine it is, <hi>Davids</hi> neceſſitie was layd on him by the ſixt Commandement as an act of mercie in the point of ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and if any poore <hi>Iew</hi> were in the like caſe, I conceive it ſhould have been ſcandalizing to that <hi>Jew</hi> to eat Swines-fleſh, before another weake <hi>Iew.</hi> Providentiall neceſſitie may make that which is a ſinfull ſcandalizing to bee obedience to the ſixt Commandement, but the will of Superiours can make no ſuch providentiall change as the <hi>D<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Aberdeene</hi> doe dreame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if the neceſſitie bee leſſe then the Neceſſitie in point of ſterving, it could juſtifie the poore <hi>Iewes</hi> eating of meats con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be againſt the law of <hi>God,</hi> as the caſe was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. But that the Church or houſe dedicated to a Saint, ſhould have no phyſicall uſe in the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> to defend us from the injuries of <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and yet have the ſame uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in common, for the poore to dwell in, wanteth all ſhadow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for how can it be proven that the ſame phyſicall uſe in the worſhip is unlawfull, and yet out of worſhip is lawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except there intervene ſome Ceremoniall and religious purging of the

houſe, by fire or ſome other way, which were Iudaical under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> for the neceſſity of the poor, is not like the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Davids eating of Shew-bread:</hi> Its certain, that the neceſsity of diſuſing the creature in a Phyſical uſage, in the worſhip, muſt have a warrant in Scripture, as well as the uſing of the ſame, in the ſame uſage, muſt have the like warrant.</p>

                           <hi>Object. 5.</hi> But Bels are more hurtful to the ſouls of Gods people, who are ſcandalized by them, then they are uſeful for the tymous and ſeaſonable convening of the people, and therefore they may well be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, being leſſe neceſſary, and neceſſary onely <hi>ad melius eſſe,</hi> for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordering of the Worſhip of God, and not ſimply neceſſary for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Worſhip. Now as the Lord our God will have a leſſer neceſſity to yeeld to any greater, a bodily neceſſity to give place to a ſoul-neceſſity (the ſoul being more excellent then the body) as is clear in that God would have his people to diſpence with the leſſer loſſe of the ſpoyl of the Amalakites of their Idols, gold and ſilver, that the greater neceſſity may ſtand, to wit, their not being allured, nor their teeth put a water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their heart to a luſting after the Idols of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo would he have us to aboliſh the Saints Temples, the gold of Popiſh Images, the Bels that are leſſe neceſſary (ſeeing the Sun may teach as well as the Bell) for eſchewing ſoul-dangers in laying ſtumbling blocks, both before our own ſouls, and others.</p>

It is denyed, that Bells which have a neceſſary uſe, though onely for the better ordering of the worſhip of God, are any active objects of ſcandal, and the meer paſſive ſcandal taken at any thing not indifferent, but phyſically neceſſary, and ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that without it ſinful inconvenients of either wearying in the ſervice of God, or ſinful neglect ſhould follow, is no ſinful ſcandal given, but meerly taken.</p>
                     <p>2. There be two neceſſities of things, one natural, and firſt in that regard, another religious, and in that regard ſecondary; the former neceſſity doth alwayes ſtand, except God remove it by ſome poſteriour commandment. Its neceſſary, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> eat of all things that God created for eating. God (I grant) may remove this neceſſity in ſome, and command either <hi>Adam</hi> to faſt for a time, or not <hi>to eat of the tree of Knowledge:</hi> So ſay I, warning by Bells hath a phyſical neceſſity, the uſe of the Temples in worſhipping hath the like neceſſity, ſo have Gold and Silver a

                     <p>3. That the <hi>Lord our God will have a bodily neceſsity as the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, to yeeld to a ſoul-neceſſity as the greater,</hi> is a ground not ſo ſure, but it ought to have been proved, except by a ſoul-neceſſity, you mean a neceſſity of ſaving the ſoul, and not ſinning againſt God, and oppoſe it to a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
