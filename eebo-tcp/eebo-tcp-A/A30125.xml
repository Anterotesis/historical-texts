            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Those that were Fools indeed, if not in Grain.</l>
               <l>And did it by <hi>their</hi> things, that they might know</l>
               <l>Their emptiness, and might be brought unto</l>
               <l>What would them save from Sin and Vanity.</l>

               <l>To Heav'n, for that's prepar'd for Girls and Boys.</l>

               <l>By fine-spun Terms that challenge might the Bays.</l>

               <l>Yea, God by Swallows, Cuckows, and the Ass;</l>
               <l>Shews they are Fools who let that season pass,</l>
               <l>Which he put in their hand, that to obtain</l>

                     <l>Well, with the day, I see, the Clouds appear,</l>
                     <l>And mix the light with darkness every where:</l>

                     <l>This done, they suddenly do watry grow,</l>
                     <l>And weep, and pour their tears out where they go.</l>

                  <l>More then can Candles set themselves on fire.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Candles receive their light from what they are not;</l>

                  <l>We manage Candles when they take the fire;</l>

                  <l>And biggest Candles give the better light,</l>
                  <l>As Grace on biggest Sinners shines most bright.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Candle shines to make another see,</l>
                  <l>A Saint unto his Neighbour light should be.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The blinking Candle we do much despise,</l>
                  <l>Saints dim of light are high in no mans eyes.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Again, though it may seem to some a Riddle,</l>
                  <l>We use to light our Candle at the middle;</l>
                  <l>True, light doth at the Candles end appear,</l>
                  <l>And Grace the heart first reaches by the Ear.</l>
                  <l>But 'tis the Wick the fire doth kindle on,</l>
                  <l>As 'tis the heart that Grace first works upon.</l>
                  <l>Thus both doth fasten upon what's the main,</l>
                  <l>And so their Life and Vigour do maintain.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Tallow makes the Wick yield to the fire;</l>
                  <l>And sinsul Flesh doth make the Soul desire,</l>
                  <l>That Grace may kindle on it, in it burn;</l>
                  <l>So Evil makes the Soul from Evil turn.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But Candles in the wind are apt to flare;</l>
                  <l>And Christ'ans in a Tempest to despair.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The flame also with Smoak attended is;</l>
                  <l>And in our holy lives there's much amiss.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Sometimes a Thief will candle-light annoy;</l>
                  <l>And lusts do seek our Graces to destroy.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>What brackish is will make a Candle sputter;</l>
                  <l>T'wixt sin and Grace there's oft a heavy clutter.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Sometimes the light burns dim, 'cause of the snuff,</l>
                  <l>Sometimes it is blown quite out with a puff;</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But Watchfulness preventeth both these evils,</l>
                  <l>Keeps Candles light and Grace in spight of Devils.</l>
               </lg>
               <l>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:43326:13"/>Nor let not snuffs nor puffs make us to doubt;</l>
               <l>Our Candles may be lighted, though pufft out.</l>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Candle in the night doth all excel.</l>
                  <l>Nor Sun, nor Moon, nor Stars, then shine so well.</l>
                  <l>So is the Christian in our Hemisphere,</l>
                  <l>Whose light shews others how their course to steer.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When Candles are put out, all's in confusion;</l>
                  <l>Where Christians are not, Devils make Intrusion.</l>
                  <l>Then happy are they who such Candles have,</l>
                  <l>All others dwell in darkness and the Grave.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But Candles that do blink within the Socket,</l>
                  <l>And Saints whose heads are always in their pocket,</l>
                  <l>Are much alike; such Candles make us fumble,</l>
                  <l>And at such Saints, good men and bad do stumble.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Good Candles do'nt offend, except sore eyes,</l>
                  <l>Nor hurt unless it be the silly Flies:</l>
                  <l>Thus none like burning Candles in the night,</l>
                  <l>Nor ought to holy living for delight.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But let us draw towards the Candles end,</l>
                  <l>The fire, you see, doth Wick and Tallow spend.</l>
                  <l>As Grace mans life, until his Glass is run,</l>
                  <l>And so the Candle and the Man is done.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The man now lays him down upon his Bed;</l>
                  <l>The Wick yields up its fire; and so is dead.</l>
                  <l>The Candle now extinct is, but the man,</l>
                  <l>By Grace mounts up to Glory, there to stand.</l>
