            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>OUR Late Account from <hi>Lisnegarvy</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> left his Grace the Duke of <hi>Schonbergh</hi> ſpeeding away ſeveral Detachments from the main Army, which is not encreaſed to 34000 effective Men, ſending ſome Regiments to reinforce the brave Colonel <hi>OWSLET</hi> with a diſcretionary Commiſſion to enlarge his Quarters, and attack the Enemy on the ſide of <hi>CAVAN,</hi> while Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General <hi>Douglas</hi> marches with a conſiderable Body into <hi>Connaught,</hi> to fall upon the Enemy in thoſe Parts: And, as a wife and experienced General, foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inconvenience of leaving an Enemy in a Gariſon behind them, which might incommode the march of his Forces, at leaſt haraſs and devaſt the Country, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to open the Campagne with the Siege of <hi>Charlemont</hi>: but the late Succors of <hi>Iriſh</hi> which were Introduced into the Gariſon, ſerved rather for the Loſs, than the Support thereof, bringing ſuch a ſlender Relief of Proviſions, that thoſe who were conſtrain'd to remain therein, did haſten the Conſideration, which the Duke underſtanding, ſo ſtrengthned the Blocade, that tho' they ſeveral times attempted to break through, yet were as often fruſtrated and driven back; and there being high double the Complement of Men therein, the number of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>00, they were greatly ſtraitned for Proviſion, they having eaten up above 10 ſalted Horſes, and began to feed upon Dogs and Vermin. Whereupon the Gariſon upon the 11th Inſtant beat a Parley, and after Hoſtages on both ſides were exchanged, 'twas Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticled and Agreed, <hi>That if they were not Relieved by the 14th, they would put that Gariſon into poſſeſſion of the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>with all the Cannon and Munitions of War. And are to match out with all the Enſigns of Honour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>There being no appearance or likelihood of its being Relieved by that time, 'tis not in the leaſt doubted but that it was actually Surrendred at the time appointed, which happy Beginning, without any thing of Bloodſhed, preſages a moſt Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Progreſs of King <hi>WILLIAM</hi>'s Arms the reſt of the Campagne. And that which adds a Furtherance to our juſt Proceedings, is the preſent mighty difference which occurs between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, being improved to that height, whereby we are aſſur'd that a great number of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers have thrown up their Commiſſions, as diſtruſting the Event, and retir'd to their reſpective Habitations, Foreſeeing that the <hi>French</hi> Forces betake themſelves to the Gariſons, deſign to leave the poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> to be cut to pleces by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> excluding their Retreat therein, and make terms for themſelves. The ſame Advice adds, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>have ſeized upon</hi> Tyrconnel, <hi>for diſclaiming againſt their Proceedings.
