            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

George Sommers, </hi>and Captaine<hi> Newport, </hi>by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous windes and forcible Current, were driuen ſo farre to the Weſt ward, that they could not in ſo conuenient time recouer Cape<hi> Henrie, </hi>and the Port in<hi> Virginea, </hi>as by the return of the ſame fleete, to anſwer the expectation of the aduenturers in ſome meaſure:</p>
            <p>By occaſion whereof, ſome few of thoſe vnruly youths ſent thither, (beeing of moſt leaud and bad condition,) and ſuch as no ground can hold, for want of good directions there, were ſuffered by ſtealth to get abord the ſhips returning thence, and are come for<hi> England </hi>againe, giuing out in all places where they come, (to colour their owne miſbehaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and the cauſe of their returne with ſome pretence) moſt vile and ſcandalous reports, both of the Country it ſelfe, and of the Cariage of the buſineſſe there.</p>
            <p>Which hath alſo giuen occaſion, that ſundry falſe rumours and deſpightfull ſpeeches haue beene deuiſed and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out by men that ſeeme of better ſort, being ſuch as lie at home, and doe gladly take all occaſions to cheere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the preuention of happy ſucceſſe in any action of publike good, diſgracing both the actions and actors of ſuch honourable enterpriſes, as whereof they neither know nor vnderſtand the true intents and honeſt ends.</p>
            <p>Which howſoeuer (for a time) it may deterre and keepe backe the hands and helpe of many well diſpoſed men, yet men of wiſdome and better reſolution doe well conceiue and know, that theſe deuices infuſed into the tongues and heades of ſuch deuiſors (by the Father of vntruths) doe ſerue for nothing elſe, but as a cloke to couer the wretched and leaud prancks of the one ſort, and the ſtupidity and backwardneſſe of the other, to aduance any commendable action that taxeth their purſe, and tendeth not wholly to their owne aduantage.</p>
            <p>And therfore thoſe of his Maieſties Counſel in this honourable plantation, the Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants intereſſed therein (rightly conſidering that as in all other good Seruices, (ſo in this) much loſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment may many waies ariſe and grow to the due meanes and manner of proceeding, which yet no way toucheth nor empeacheth the action it ſelfe, nor the ends of it, which do ſtill remaine entire and ſafe vpon the ſame grounds of thoſe manifold Chriſtian duties whereon it was firſt reſolued,) are ſo farre from yeelding or giuing way to any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance or impeachment of their cheerefull going on, that many of them both honourable and worſhipfull haue giuen their hands and ſubſcribed to contribute againe and againe to new ſupplies if need require.</p>
            <p>And further, they doe inſtantly prepare and make ready a certaine number of good Shippes, with all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, for the right honourable Lord<hi> de la Ware, </hi>who intendeth God aſſiſting, to be ready with all expedition to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the foreſaid Generals, which we doubt not are long ſince ſafely ariued at their wiſhed port in<hi> Virginea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for that former experience hath too dearely taught, how much and manie waies it hurteth to ſuffer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to diſburden themſelues of laſciuious ſonnes, maſters of bad ſeruants, and wiues of ill huſbands, and ſo to clogge the buſineſſe with ſuch an idle crue, as did thruſt themſelues in the laſt voiage, that will rather ſtarue for hunger, then lay their hands to labour:</p>
