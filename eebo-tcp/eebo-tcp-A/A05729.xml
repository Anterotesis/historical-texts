            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The fame of our anceſtours that diligently laboured to
bring vs, and in many things brought vs from ignorance to
knowledge, ſhall neuer be forgotten ſo long as thoſe things
wherein they laboured, be in eſtimation, and (in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
ſo farre forth as we may, we ſhould Imitate the ſteps of
them, for this plague of ignorance is ſo great, that neither
did they neither ſhall we finde ſo much: but that we muſt
leaue ſufficient, for our poſteritie to be found.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſeeing ſufficiently others to labour and trauell
in other Sciences, I thought good to beſtow my labour in
Muſicke, ſeeing that paines might ſo much preuaile, as by
the fruit of my labour may plainly appeare. I tooke the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand vpon this occaſion, though it were far diſtant
from my profeſſion, being deſired by a gentleman, to inſtruct
him in ſong, I gaue him ſuch rules as my Maſter gaue mee:
Yet could I giue him no ſong ſo plaine, wherein there chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
not ſome one thing or other, to which none of thoſe rules
could directly leade him. Marking then how in minde, I
did know what by rule I could not teach, I perceiued how
<pb facs="tcp:13499:3"/>
vnder the ſhade of rule, I attained to many things by rote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and how pleaſant, ſpeedie and ſure it is to runne by rule, I
tooke this labour in hand, and brought it to this paſſe. Olde
Muſitions laid downe for Song, manifold and crabbed,
confuſe, tedious rules, as for example: though there be in
all but ſixe names, Vt, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, hauing amongſt
them an eaſie order, yet could not they by rule declare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe ſhould bee attributed to euery Note, vnleſſe
they had firſt framed the long ladder or skale of Gam-vt,
to which ſome added, thinking the ladder too ſhort, ſome
hewed off a peece, thinking it too long. Then would they
haue the learner be as perfect in comming downe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as in going vp forward, leaſt in his practiſe he ſhould
fall, and breake his neck. Then must he learne, Gam-vt, in
rule, Are, in ſpace, b my in rule, C faut in ſpace, &amp;c. Then
muſt he know Gam vt, how many cleues, how many notes.
Are, how many notes, &amp;c. Then muſt he know b, quadrij,
proper chant and bemul, re in Are, whereby vt in Cfaut,
whereby mi, in Alamire, whereby &amp;c. And when all haue
done, after their long circumſtances of time, whereby they
ſhould be often driuen to millibi, for Notes ſtanding in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
places of Gam-vt, haue names that the place where
they stand comprehend not. Touching all the prolixe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
&amp; needleſſe difficulties, that they vſe, it loathes
me greatly that heere I ſhould write them: &amp; much more
would it grieue the Reader to learne them. Alſo many
things are vſed in Song, for which they giue no rules at all,
but committed them to dodge at it, harke to it, and harpe
vpon it. Now (Reader) th'effect of my pretended purpoſe,
and fruit of my finiſhed labor is this, where they gaue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe
<pb facs="tcp:13499:3"/>
rules, I haue giuen briefe rules, where they gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
rules, I haue giuen ſure rules, and where they
haue giuen no rules, I haue giuen rules. After all this that
I haue ſaid of their rules, I doe affirme that they deſerued
greater commendations aboue mee, for finding out the long
way, then I aboue others for laying down the ſhort way. For
had not they opened the gappe, touching mee, it might very
well hap that I ſhould in no ſort enter my ſelfe, and much
leſſe in any ſort inuite others: nothing can at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
be perſected, and therefore are they to bee holden ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
as the old verſe hath:
<q>
                  <l>But ere the Painter can ſure his craft attaine,</l>
                  <l>Much froward facion transformeth hee in vayne,</l>
                  <l>By rayſing ſuperfluitie, and adding that doth want,</l>
                  <l>Rude Pictures are made both perfect and pleaſant.</l>
                  <l>For ſuch things by negligence are left vndone,</l>
                  <l>That by good diligence might be wonne.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There be ſufficient, many, and firme prooues had of this
that I ſay, which may by my rules be done, of which I will
heere put downe ſome of them, though I get as little by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beleeued, as I ſhould looſe by being belyed.</p>
            <p>In a moneth and leſſe I instructed a child about the age
of eight yeeres, to ſing a good number of ſongs, difficult
crabbed Songs, to ſing at the firſt ſight, to be ſo indifferent
for all parts, alterations, Cleues, flats, and ſharpes, that he
could ſing a part of that kinde, of which he neuer learned
any ſong, which child for ſtrangeneſſe was brought before
the Lord Deputie of Ireland, to be heard ſing: for there
were none of his age, though he were longer at it, nor any
of his time, (though he were elder) knowne beefore theſe
<pb facs="tcp:13499:4"/>
rules to ſing exactly.</p>
            <p>There was another, that had before often handled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
but neuer practiſed to ſing (for hee could not
name one Note) who hearing of theſe rules, obtayned in
ſhort time, ſuch profit by them, that he could ſing a difficult
ſong of himſelfe, without any Inſtructor.</p>
            <p>There was another, who by dodging at it, hearkning to
it, &amp; harping vpon it, could neuer be brought to tune ſharps
aright, who ſo ſoone as hee heard theſe rules ſet downe for
the ſame, could tune them ſufficiently well. I haue taught
diuerſe others by theſe rules, in leſſe then a moneth; what
my ſelfe by the olde, obtained not in more then two yeeres.
Diuerſe other proofes I might recite, which heere as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
I doe omit, becauſe the thing will ſhew it ſelfe. Diuerſe
haue repented in their age that they were not put to ſing in
their youth; but ſeeing that by theſe rules, a good skill may
be had in a moneth: and the wayes learned in foure or fiue
dayes: none commeth too late to learne, and ſpecially if this
ſaying be true: <hi>That no man is ſo olde but thinketh he
may liue one yeere longer.</hi> As Ariſtotle in ſetting forth
his predicaments, ſaw many things requiſite to be entreated
off: and yet vnfit to be mixed with his treatiſe: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made ante predicaments, and poſt predicaments: ſo I
for the ſame cauſe (deſirous to aboliſh confuſion) haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to my rules, ante rules, and poſt rules. Vale.</p>

one of the foreſayde cleifes vpon ſome rule, and
whatſoeuer note ſtandeth vpon the ſame rule with the

that euery <hi>re,</hi> ſhould be named <hi>la,</hi> when you aſcend to

<hi>ſol,</hi> which two things are vſed <hi>euphoniae gratia,</hi> and
yet this name of <hi>vt,</hi> is moſt proper to the baſe or loweſt

                  <head>Obiection againſt the latter exception.</head>
                  <p>In the latter exception it is ſaid, that <hi>vt</hi> ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
changed into <hi>ſol,</hi> therefore ſeeing it is neuer vſed,
<pb facs="tcp:13499:7"/>
it is in vaine placed in all this former tractation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solution.</hi> It is placed in all this former tractation for
two cauſes, the one is, that it ſhould be diſtinguiſhed by
that name from the other <hi>ſol,</hi> and the other is, becauſe it
hath bene a name vſed from the beginning, and now
commonly changed into <hi>ſol, euphoniae gratia:</hi> it may
ſometimes neuertheleſſe be vſed, for (as I ſayd before)
the cunning ſinging man keeping euery note in his right
tune, may name it according to his pleaſure, for theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
names be no neceſſary accidents, for you ſee daylie that
when any ſong is lettred, theſe names be not attributed
to them, though then they be ſung in their owne order,
according to the opinion of many, yea very many. I
know I ſhould adde a third exception, that is to ſay, to
except alſo, that euery note hauing a ſharpe beefore it,
ſhould be named <hi>mi,</hi> as in this example,<gap reason="music">
                        <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                     </gap>
the third note. And becauſe that of that opinion there
bee ſo many, I will for them ſhew a probable reaſon as
by our principles may be ſhewed: then after by reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them, ſhewe what is moſt profitable, not refuting
the opinion as an errour, beecauſe that looking to the
matter, wee may finde that they may bee named as well
<hi>mi,</hi> as <hi>fa,</hi> inſomuch as the names (as I ſayd before) are no
neceſſary accidents, but neuertheleſſe, becauſe heere we
ſeeke the moſt apt name, it were vnfit to paſſe it ouer.
Wherefore the principall argument for them wee may
in this ſort forme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiection.</hi> We ſhould name all notes ſo neare as wee
can, according as ſuch notes are named in the <hi>gamvt,</hi> for
it is certain, that theſe are the names which are moſt fit,
<pb facs="tcp:13499:8"/>
for ſo in the beginning by the firſt inuentors of Muſick
they haue bene ſet downe: but no note that is ſharp in
the <hi>gamvt</hi> is named <hi>fa,</hi> therefore no note made ſharp by
a collaterall reaſon, ſhould bee named <hi>fa.</hi> Secondly,
throughout all the <hi>gam vt,</hi> from <hi>ſol</hi> to <hi>fa.</hi> Next vnder it
is a whole note, but from that <hi>ſol</hi> to that <hi>fa,</hi> if we ſhould
call it <hi>fa,</hi> is but halfe a note, therefore if we call it <hi>fa,</hi> wee
breake altogether the rule of <hi>gamvt,</hi> which wee ſhould
obſerue: thirdly euery place in the <hi>gam vt</hi> that is ſharp,
is named either <hi>mi</hi> or <hi>la.</hi> Therefore this note (beecauſe
not ſo aptly <hi>la</hi>) muſt be named <hi>mi.</hi> Before we fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
theſe arguments, one thing muſt neceſſarily be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en:
that is to ſay, that in naming the notes in <hi>gam vt</hi> the
firſt inuentors did obſerue two things, whereof the one
was, to name the notes according to the <hi>vt:</hi> the other,
to name euery note which is ſharpe (as the argument
proueth) <hi>mi,</hi> or <hi>la:</hi> and it falleth out ſometimes, when
notes flat by collaterall reaſons are made ſharp, that one
of theſe two muſt neceſſarily be violated, that is to ſay,
that eyther the note muſt not bee named according to
the <hi>vt,</hi> or a note ſharp muſt bee named <hi>fa,</hi> ſo that the
controuerſie lyeth in knowing, whether of theſe two
ſhould ſooneſt be obſerued: ſo according to this we anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
to their arguments. To the firſt, where they impute
a fault in vs for naming a note ſharp, <hi>fa,</hi> ſeeing that no
ſharp note in all the <hi>gam vt</hi> is named <hi>fa,</hi> we may impute
an other abſurditie to them, ſeeing they would haue the
next note vnder <hi>ſol, mi,</hi> which is not found in all <hi>gam vt,</hi>
which is the more abſurditie (as we will proue in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to the third argument) To the ſecond, the ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:13499:8"/>
is eaſie, that euen as euery <hi>ſol</hi> to <hi>fa,</hi> next vnder it is
a whole note: ſo from euery <hi>ſol</hi> to <hi>mi,</hi> next vnder it is
more: ſo that according to the <hi>gam vt,</hi> in that reſpect
none of them is true. To the third wee anſwere, that it
may bee as well <hi>la,</hi> as <hi>mi,</hi> becauſe that if ther were any
reaſon why it ſhould not be as well <hi>la,</hi> it might well be,
to eſchew this abſurditie, that then in two places toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there ſhould bee one name, becauſe the next vnder
it is alſo <hi>la,</hi> but by naming it <hi>mi,</hi> the ſame abſurditie
commeth in another place, therfore the one is as abſurd
as the other, as in this example, where two <gap reason="music">
                        <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                     </gap>
places together muſt according to them bee named <hi>mi,</hi>
but to name two places together with one name, there
is none but will think more diſſonant, then to name
them with diuers, whatſoeuer: for if a man did name
<hi>mi,</hi> ſix times together in one place, beeing quauers, the
one comming faſt vpon the other, would make them
ſeeme as though it were <hi>mim, mim, mim,</hi> as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<gap reason="music">
                        <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                     </gap> wherby it plainely appeareth
that this is moſt abſurd. But becauſe that it were as good
that our ſelues ſhould bring that, which others may do,
by ſharp grating vpon our ſolutions, in this ſort we may
frame a reply. Let vs ſuppoſe, that in the middle of a
ſong which had <hi>fa</hi> in <hi>C ſol fa vt,</hi> there came two notes,
one in <hi>C ſol fa vt,</hi> &amp; another in <hi>B fa b mi,</hi> hauing a flat
before it, then if the latter note in <hi>B fa b mi,</hi> hauing the
flat before it, be not called <hi>fa,</hi> it is againſt the order of
the <hi>vt,</hi> which by the ſolutions ſhould moſt be kept, if it
be named <hi>fa,</hi> then commeth the abſurditie proued in the
<pb facs="tcp:13499:9"/>
laſt example: that is, that two places together ſhould
haue one name, and likewiſe if ſixe quauers did come in
that ſort, the faſt comming of the one vpon the other,
would make them ſeeme to be <hi>faf, faf, faf,</hi> which is as
abſurd and diſſonant, as <hi>mim, mim, mim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſolution.</hi> Of the flat ſo comming, and of the ſharp,
there is not like reaſon, becauſe that the flat ſo comming
ſhould alter the <hi>vt,</hi> ſo that as many notes as had come
in <hi>C ſol fa vt,</hi> after the flat, ſhould be named <hi>ſol,</hi> and not
<hi>fa,</hi> but for the firſt note, &amp; the ſecond, they muſt be both
<hi>fa,</hi> neuertheleſſe becauſe there may not be many of them
together, as there may be of <hi>mi,</hi> &amp; becauſe that in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
twiſe <hi>fa,</hi> in that ſort likely neuer chanceth, the one
is not ſo abſurd as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Replication.</hi> It is graunted by the laſt ſolution, that the
flat ſo comming ſhould alter the <hi>vt,</hi> but to alter the <hi>vt,</hi>
doth alter the key (which is in muſick a great abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
therefore by the laſt ſolution, there is a great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
graunted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solution.</hi> It is graunted conditionally, that is to ſay, if
the like happened (as in the argument obiected) though
ſometimes in the middeſt of a ſong, to change the key,
and come into it againe, is allowed. Wherefore for the
names being the leaſt neceſſary and moſt troubleſome
accident, let this ſuffice.</p>

IN this Table or figure aforeſayde, foure things are
comprehendend, the places, the 6. figures of obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
belonging to them, the courſes and concords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
for them, for the ſeuen places, there be ſeuen words
in the blade of the Sword: the firſt word, <hi>Aggredior,</hi> is
alwaies for the firſt place: the ſecond word downward,
<hi>quo,</hi> is for the ſecond place downeward, &amp;c. And the
ſecond word vpward, <hi>mi,</hi> is for the ſecond place vpward,
&amp;c. This word, <hi>Iheſu,</hi> is cut off from the reſt, to ſignifie
that it beelongeth to another kinde, for in it the letters
numerable being 5. doe fignifie the firſt and ſecond fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of obſeruation, and it is written one way with the
verſe, to ſignifie that it goeth according to the woord
of the verſe, which is for the place, for it ſignifieth one
number with the word of the verſe, that ſtandeth for the
place, as if the world bee the fourth world of the verſe,
then it ſignifieth, 4. &amp;c. and 5. ſignifieth the fift num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to that, as the fift number to foure is 8. and ſo are
the firſt and ſecond figures of obſeruation found. Then
are the other foure figures of obſeruation to bee found
by the croſſe verſe, which ſayth: adde one to the place,
take one from the place, let the place ſtand, adde foure
to the place, and ſo ſhall you finde the third, fourth, fift,
and ſixt figures of obſeruation.</p>
               <p>Heere note, that if the place be the vnizon, becauſe
you cannot take one from a vnizon, take it from eight,
which is of the ſame kinde, when you haue thus done,
tourne the poynt of the Sword downe, and then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
woords, ſerueth for the ſeuen courſes in this order:
Firſt the word that ſerueth for the place, ſerueth for the

firſt courſe, the ſecond woord vpward, for the ſecond
courſe vpward: the ſecond woord downeward, for the
ſecond courſe downward, &amp;c. As the Sword now ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
compting about vpon the ſeuen words, when you
haue found what woord ſerueth for the courſe, looke
what vowels bee in it, and thereby you ſhall know the
concords, that ſerueth for that courſe, as if the vowell
bee A. it ſignifieth the vnizon. If it be E, it ſignifieth the
third, If it bee I, it ſignifieth the fift. And if it be O, it
ſignifieth the ſixt. Lo, thus are all the things expreſſed at
