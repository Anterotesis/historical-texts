         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

but not for me now living to vindicate from slander, I having
no ambition to repeate his merits, as an advantage thereby to
the dead, or to me, no otherwise than in duty I am bound, thus

Where he, at 30. yeares of age, married <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of

In all this time, Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> not qualified to keep

to compose and frame, that then admired double Sphear, presented by
<hi>Sanderson</hi> to Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> with a Manuscript of the use thereof; not
long since remaining in the Library of Saint <hi>Iames.</hi> He knowing my
Fathers affection to Arts, commended <hi>Bloys,</hi> a man of skill pretending
to the perpetuall motion, which was endeavoured at my Fathers house,
then at <hi>Islington,</hi> and brought to excellent observation, and at his
cost and charges. A mighty Wheel it was, of large Circumference,
erected upon Beams, with massy bolts of Iron, fastned to each spoke,
which being set on going, in their very declining &amp; descending of each
in turn, shot their Bolts from the Center to the out-Circle, with such
force in the fall, as raised the next spoke and bolt from his Center,
who performed his part as the last before; and so in course: which at
the first motion was of that might and swiftnesse, as, with horrour and
noise of clattering the bolts, affrighted the Prince and company, the
first that saw its motion: But then in an hour, lessening by insensible
degrees, the force weakned and wasting, the Motion at last stood still. It
was framed and set up in a very large Barn, no other room being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the Circle.</p>
               <p>What need I number up his affection to the Art and uses of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
to finde out the Longitude and <hi>Variation, of the Variation</hi>
of the Needle; as may appear by the work, the various intricate Maze,

3. And to the <hi>Last,</hi> I say, That it was most usuall and Legall,
where many Circumstances, as here, do conduce to the truth. It was
<hi>Raleighs</hi> policie to have but one Witnesse in the <hi>Conspiracie;</hi> thereby
he meant to escape, either that <hi>Cobham</hi> must accuse him, or none can,
and he but One, <hi>Raleigh</hi> might be safe. If <hi>A.</hi> conspire a <hi>Treason</hi> only
with <hi>B.</hi> and he with <hi>C.</hi> and he with <hi>D.</hi> who can prove this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
if not by One of them, and Circumstances also? If any one of
these confesse it, need we more Witnesse to accuse himselfe and the
other? A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Murtherer</hi> is met with a bloody sword, comming forth of

<hi>Cobham</hi> accuseth <hi>Raleigh,</hi> and he denies it: In Star-chamber, then,
and Chancery, now; for matters of Tittle, his Deniall or Oath does
not acquit him, in <hi>propria Causa,</hi> much lesse in <hi>Treason.</hi>

               <p>2. And to the <hi>Second,</hi> see <hi>Brooks,</hi> and <hi>Cobham's,</hi> and others Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
which confirme him a <hi>Traitor</hi> throughout; concluding,

wherein I protest; on my soul, to write nothing but the truth. I am now

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t thereof was,
to intreat me, to right the wrong I had don him, in saying, that I

His first Letter which was throwne in, in the same manner,
wherein he prayed me write to him a Letter, which I did. He sent me
word, that the Iudges were at Mr. Aturney's house, and there was
good hope, that the proceedings against us should be stayed. At <hi>Arem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>'s

1500l. a year, for which he promised, that no action should be done
against <hi>Spain,</hi> but he would give knowledge before hand. He told me,
that the States had audience with the King. He hath been the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
cause of my ruine, for I had no dealing with <hi>Aremburgh,</hi> but by
his instigation. He hath been the cause of my discontentment. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
me not to be overtaken with Preachers, as <hi>Essex</hi> was, and that the
King would better allow of a constant deniall, than to accuse any.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Raleigh</hi> being asked what he could say to this last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
writ with his own hand over night, from a dying condemned
man; He answered, I say, that <hi>Cobham</hi> is a base, dishonorable, poor
soul.</p>
               <p>I have been told, that <hi>Mr. Cary</hi> upon some pretence, was a suitor
to the Parliament for somwhat of Sr. <hi>VValters</hi> (no matter now for
what: I shall have time to tell him that, and more also, in another
place hereafter) and Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> was like to carry it, when a worthy
<hi>Member</hi> stept up, and laid in his way a Bar in Law, <hi>That Treason
taints the Issue:</hi> upon which, came out a Letter to the <hi>Committee,</hi>
which could never clear him, nor the Treason: If I be mistaken, let
him help me hereafter, when he shall hear more of that in due place
and time.</p>
               <p>But wherein [<hi>may one perceive my spleen against Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh.]</p>
               <p>For I remember, the first time that Mr. <hi>Cary Raleigh</hi> came to

whom I was very civill; for Mr. <hi>Lessells</hi> called him my <hi>Cosin:</hi> And
afterwards, an occasion was offered for me to do him kindenesse:
<pb facs="tcp:60632:9"/>
One <hi>Saintravy,</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> had affronted him at Court, which by
means of my noble friends, was examined, where <hi>Saintravy</hi> utterly
refused to submit, about the boxing. It was urged besides, that <hi>Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravy</hi>
called him, <hi>The Son of a Traitor:</hi> The Lords laughed (for Mr.
<hi>Lessells</hi> was by, who was said to be like him) and <hi>Saintravy</hi> being
rounded in the ear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> smiled, and said, <hi>That he was sorry to be mistaken;</hi>
and so made it the worse, and the wound wider, to those that were
told the meaning: However, my respects and service appeared to Sir

of the University of Cambridge.</head>
               <p>RIght Honorable, my very good Lord, and our only Patron, &amp;c.—I might take occasion of your Honours late
bounty to the <hi>University,</hi> but wanting no such occasion at any
time, I make bold to open my mouth in the cause of such extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as the wisest amongst men charges us not to be silent in: The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because it may be my <hi>words</hi> of <hi>triumph,</hi> in such late plenty of
<hi>Commencers</hi> (as the fashion is of <hi>Fathers</hi> when they <hi>create</hi>) hath
given some occasion of misreporting the <hi>Action.</hi> Truly, tender of

                     </gap>on;</hi> yea, and the indemnity of the
meanest of them, that belong to your <hi>Honour:</hi> for your <hi>Honours</hi>
own sake, I may boldly affirme, <hi>not any one unworthy,</hi> that I know,
either <hi>Doctor</hi> or <hi>Batchelor</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> or <hi>Commencer,</hi> in any
kinde; but sundry of them rather <hi>Paragons;</hi> only One, the most
suspected for insufficiency, yet, offered to give <hi>Caution</hi> to keep his
<hi>Acts;</hi> then which, nothing could be more required at the strictest.
When we consulted about them in the <hi>Consistory,</hi> the <hi>Names of
sundry were set down in Paper,</hi> for most allowable, even by them of
the <hi>Heads,</hi> that held backward most. Lack of <hi>Time,</hi> and lack of
<hi>Living,</hi> are too slender exceptions in my opinion, not only against
his <hi>Majestie</hi>'s Largesse at his coming, and glorifying of his <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs</hi>
all we could <hi>(The glory of the King, being the multilitude of
his people</hi>) but against <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>sufficiency,</hi> wheresoever such at any
time fail of <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Living.</hi> If your <hi>Honour</hi> had seen what past in
this kind under other <hi>Chancellors,</hi> and namely, in conferring the
<hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Arts Degree;</hi> yet, that <hi>Degree</hi> opens way to <hi>holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
in men, perhaps not otherwise worthy (a perilous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence)
Here, few <hi>Masters of Art,</hi> nor <hi>any unworthy;</hi> And for the
<hi>Graduates</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> they were all <hi>Ministers</hi> afore, and so no
<pb facs="tcp:60632:13"/>
danger of the foresaid ill consequence. We had but two <hi>Doctors</hi> now,
more then we had in the last sicknesse time, or rather three lesse,
as that number encreased soon after; yet then, his <hi>Majestie</hi> came
not at all amongst us.</p>
               <p>Now, both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> and all, deserves more and more
<hi>Schollars</hi> by far, than that time, which had nothing but wofull
necessity to excuse it. This for the generall, that your <hi>Lordship</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no regret upon <hi>Rumors,</hi> I have presumed (one of many) yet,
in my zeal to your <hi>Honour,</hi> wherein I come behinde none.</p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> in particular, a man of most usefull abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
That he hath not wronged your <hi>Honour,</hi> whatsoever some may
suggest, I am not only told, but do verily believe, that he never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
with any for that courtesie; and one of them at the instant afore
these flashes broke forth, told me as much of his own accord, Doctor
<hi>Grant</hi> by name; and, I think, the rest will say no lesse, if they were
deposed, as many have been: If afterwards they made him any vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
requitall for his service, which is more then I know, (yet,
the most that can be surmized) yet, neither any fee abated to the
<hi>University</hi> thereby, and the parties, in escaping other charges, think
themselves no doubt well dealt with, as well they may. So with
my prayers for your Honour, &amp;c.</p>

or heard what was said of it, when they went out by

(as the Scriptures say of <hi>Ieroboam's</hi> times I think) where it was so

                  </gap>ome
in the <hi>Superlative,</hi> these are the <hi>Batchellors</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> that I speak
of: As for the <hi>Doctors,</hi> I can say more of them, and more ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.
I was first in the <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>story,</hi> where the <hi>Agitation</hi> was freshest,
and not so hot, perhaps, as afterwards, when it came to younger mens
handlings: But sundry of them were approved then by all, even by
such as held back most; and their names taken, and set down in
writing, for men meet to passe; nor any just exception, that I can
remember, to any of them all. As for lack of <hi>Living,</hi> let them look
to it that affect that <hi>Degree:</hi> My best friend, that dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

almost with a curse, unlesse I obeyed him, was wont to say,
That <hi>Degrees</hi> were the reward of <hi>Learning,</hi> not of <hi>Living.</hi> I had
not a penny more, then a bare <hi>Fellowship</hi> of a <hi>Colledge,</hi> when I <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced.</hi>
As for lack of <hi>Time,</hi> truly if that be not fit for his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi>
to dispence with, what is fit? Doctor <hi>Caesar</hi> lackt time, but
first, he is a Privie-<hi>Counsellors</hi> son and, an <hi>Oxford</hi> man, and had
time more then enough there; and satisfied so well in his Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here of late (whereof I am witnesse, because I disputed upon
him) that but for lack of <hi>Time,</hi> he had gaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his <hi>Doctorship</hi> with
the same facility, that he did his other <hi>Degree</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> then.
Other exceptions I remember none.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> hath, in my opinion, done neither the University
discredit, nor the Church disparagment, nor his Lord, our Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
disservice or disreputation, nor swerved from his word given
to the Doctors, which was, that we should have sufficient men, and to
passe by head, as I take it they did, or in effect did, by most, or all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> indeed we lack, and <hi>Cautions</hi> were not given for them; but
are they kept when given, as of late in the sickness? does it not end
in a forfeit to the <hi>Proctors</hi> and <hi>Bedles,</hi> &amp;c? So then, it is all one for
the manifestation of the <hi>worth</hi> of the parties, or the young <hi>Schollars</hi>
profiting by their <hi>Acts,</hi> whether they had given <hi>Caution</hi> or no, if it
may end in <hi>forfeit,</hi> as it hath usually. One of the <hi>Commencers,</hi>
whose sufficiency was most suspected, offered <hi>Caution</hi> to keep his
<hi>Acts.</hi>
