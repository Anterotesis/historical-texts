            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words containe the proſperous and ſuccesfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtate of King <hi>Vzziah,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the time that he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſought the Lord; but as ſoone as ever hee fell foule with his God, hee fell downe from his happineſſe, and his proſperity went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with his pietie: juſt as you ſee your comets and Meteors that hang in the ayre, ſo long as they keep aloft in the firmament of heaven they gliſter &amp; ſhin, and make a glorious celeſtial luſtre in the eyes of all beholders, but if once they decline from that pitch
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21224:5"/>
and fall downe to the earth (as many times they doe) they vaniſh, and diſ-appeare, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Such is the caſe betwixt a man and his God; as long as a man holds in good termes with God, and hath his converſation in heaven, and ſets his affections upon things above, ſo long God will caſt his favour upon him, and he ſhall ſhine as a light in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation; but if once he decline from that pitch, and fall downe from a godly converſation, into any earthly, baſe, ungodly diſpoſition, tis a venture but his proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will vaniſh away, and his latter end prove worſe than his beginning. Here then is a worthy preſident for all that doe deſire to proſper; as I ſuppoſe tis every mans deſire ſo to doe, as one ſaid, <hi>Beatus vult homo eſſe, etiam non ſic vivendo ut poſsit eſſe;</hi> Every man would be bleſſed, though he take a courſe to be curſed, every man would goe to heaven, though he run the way that leads directly to hell; ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man would proſper, though hee take a courſe to periſh; but if a man doth deſire true proſperity, that God indeed ſhould proſper him, and give a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to all that belongs unto him, let him take the courſe that <hi>Vzziah</hi> ſometime did, let him ſeeke the Lord, and God will make him to proſper. <hi>So long as he ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words are two generall things to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ground and foundation of true proſperity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The bounds and limitation of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ground and foundation of true proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that is this; It muſt be built and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21224:5"/>
upon Religion and Pietie, God muſt be ſought unto, ere true proſperity can be attain'd to <hi>(He ſought the Lord, and God made him to proſper.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the bounds and limitation of proſperity, how farre it reacheth, and how long it laſteth, and that is, onely during the time that he ſerves and ſeeks the Lord, <hi>[So long as he ſought the Lord, ſo long</hi> (and no longer) <hi>God made him to proſper.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt obſerve two particulars, Mans dutie, and Gods mercy; Firſt, mans duty to ſeeke God; Secondly, Gods mercy to proſper them that ſeeke him. Now becauſe the whole hope of our proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and Gods ſucceſſe, depends onely upon our piety in ſeeking of God, I will therefore branch it out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foure circumſtances, which like the foure Rivers of <hi>Eden,</hi> ſhall (I truſt) water this Garden-plot of God, and make your ſoules proſper the better.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it is to ſeeke God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How, and in what manner we muſt ſeeke him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When, or what time.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where, or in what place we muſt ſeeke him; I meane ſo, as that wee may proſper by ſeeking him, for that is the <hi>baſis,</hi> the ground-worke of my whole Sermon, and ſhall (by Gods aſſiſtance) be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled, and interwoven into every point.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what it is to ſeeke God, ſo as a man may proſper by ſeeking him. To ſeeke God is nothing elſe but to ſeeke to pleaſe God, to ſeeke to get into favour with God, to ſeeke to get Gods good-will; as the <hi>Sidonians</hi> did with <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12. 20. when they heard that <hi>Herod</hi> was diſpleaſed with them, and intended to make warre upon them, they made
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21224:6"/>
friendſhip with <hi>Blastus</hi> the Kings Chamberlaine, and ſought by all meanes poſſible to get into favour with him againe; and why? Becauſe (ſaid they) our lands are nouriſhed by the lands of the King. This is our caſe, our lands, our lives, and all that wee have are nouriſhed and ſuſtained by the King of heaven; and therefore when wee know that he is diſpleaſed with us, as juſtly hee may (for as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>Wee provoke him every day,</hi> then let us doe as they did, as they made friendſhip with <hi>Blaſtus,</hi> ſo let us make friendſhip with Ieſus Chriſt, and deſire him to helpe us into Gods favour: And this is that we call the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God. Now this phraiſe of ſeeking God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that we are at a loſſe in this behalfe; and indeed ſo we are; we have all of us loſt the favour of God by our ſinnes, and except wee ſeeke to regaine and recover it by our prayers and repentance, wee muſt never look to proſper. Not proſper, may ſome ſay? Why, who proſper more many times than they that have leaſt care, and make leaſt conſcience to ſerve and ſeeke the Lord, they that live altogether by uſury and oppreſſion, by bribery and extortion, by fraud and ill dealing, that have not God in all their thoughts, who proſper more than they? I anſwer to that, and I hope I ſhall make it appeare, that a man that ſeekes not God may thrive in the world, grow rich, and gather goods, and yet not proſper neither. Wealth is one thing, proſperity another. A man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truely proſpers till hee come to have <hi>Gaius</hi> his proſperity, whereof you ſhall read in the third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of S. <hi>Iohn, verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>I wiſh above all things that thou maiſt proſper, even as thy ſoule proſpereth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:21224:6"/>
When a mans ſoule doth proſper in grace &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe inwardly, together as his eſtate doth proſper in wealth &amp; ſubſtance outwardly, that, &amp; none but that is true proſperitie. Againe, many times it falls out ſo, and a man in himſelfe ſhall finde it ſo, that his ſoule proſpers beſt, when his eſtate proſpers worſt. Many a man is like the Pine tree, of which they write, that if the barke be peeled off, it will laſt a long time, elſe it rots: ſo God ſees, that many a man if hee had his barke upon him, if he had the wealth of the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, it would rot him, and make him worſe, therefore God is faine to barke him, and peele him, to keepe him naked and bare, and poore, that his ſoule may proſper the better.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives two reaſons why it pleaſeth God to withhold outward proſperity from them that inwardly proſper, and to denie outward bleſſings to them whom he hath inwardly bleſt with grace; firſt, leſt wicked people ſhould thinke, <hi>ob has colendum Deum,</hi> that Gods ſervants did ſerve him onely for theſe things: as the Devill accuſed <hi>Iob chap.</hi> 1. 10. Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant <hi>Iob</hi> (ſaith God) how upright he walkes, and how carefully he ſerves me? I cannot blame him (quoth Satan) that hee ſerves thee, hee doth it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for his owne neede, to ſerve his owne turne, for thou makeſt ſuch an hedge about him, and ſo fenceſt him in with thine invincible protection, that none of all his enemies can make the leaſt gap to breake in upon him; doe but put forth thy hand (ſaith the Devill) <hi>manum laeſivam,</hi> (he meanes) thy puniſhing, thy vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive revenging hand, and touch him with that (as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21224:7"/>
the Spider toucheth the Bee) touch him to torment him, and thou ſhalt ſee <hi>Iob</hi> will turne another leafe, and in ſtead of bleſſing thee, will curſe thee to thy face. Yea, doſt thou thinke ſo (ſaith God) doe thou take him to doe, Ile give thee leave, puniſh him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict him, doe any thing to him, ſpare but his life, and thou ſhalt ſee <hi>Iob</hi> will ſerve me no leſſe than hee did before; and ſo it fell out. And the ſame mind doe all Gods faithfull ſervants beare, proſper or not proſper, thrive or not thrive, rewarded or not rewarded, all is one to them, they will and are reſolved to ſerve and ſeeke the Lord. Secondly, Leſt Gods ſervants ſhould beare a mercinary minde, and ſerve him onely to make a gaine of his ſervice, and ſo alwayes be looking and lingering after temporall favours; this would turne <hi>patientiam in avaritiam,</hi> Chriſtian patience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to carnall covetouſneſſe, and make men carnally min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their ſpirituall affaires: that were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) an affection of diſhonour, and would diſcover a kinde of baſeneſſe in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſeeke him onely for their owne ends; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſees it beſt in ſome caſes, to reſtraine proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity from them that ſeeke him, and that, <hi>alto conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> upon deepe advice, and great reaſon, as you ſee; Firſt, to convince the world of their miſopinion of Gods ſervants. Secondly, to rectifie the affection of them that ſerve him, that they may learne not to lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger after that which God in his wiſedome ſees good to hold them ſhort of.</p>
                  <p>But for the proſperity of wicked and ungodly men (to returne to that) of ſuch as ſeeke not the Lord, but rather mingle their wealth with wickedneſſe, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21224:7"/>
mixe their proſperity with blaſphemy, that ſet their mouth againſt heaven and ſay, as 'tis in <hi>Iob, chap.</hi> 21. 15. <hi>Who is the Almighty that wee ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have if wee pray unto him?</hi> Such men as theſe, the more outwardly happy they are; the more undoubtedly miſerable; that which wee count the felicitie and the happineſſe of ſuch men, is indeed their ruine and their bane, to thrive well by evill courſes. You know what God did to <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> that were as wicked wretches as the earth could beare; God let them alone, let them goe on and proſper and domineere over the poore people, ſent them no Croſſe, nor diſeaſe, nor judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to interrupt them, but let them take their ſwinge in the very height of their rebellions; Why would God ſuffer ſuch flagitious villaines to have their will without controule? God himſelfe is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give an account of it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>he would deſtroy them:</hi> this is the event and iſſue of a wicked mans proſperity. <hi>I have ſeene the wicked in great proſperity</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 37. 35.) <hi>flouriſhing like a greene bay tree.</hi> Why like a greene bay tree rather than like a greene oke-tree, or greene apple-tree? I will tell you what I think the reaſon is; The bay-tree (you know) is green all the winter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> long, when oke-trees, and apple-trees, and all other farre more profitable and fruitfull trees, do wither, decay, and ſhed their leaves, ſtand naked and bare, and looke as if they were rotten &amp; dead; then doth the bay-tree flouriſh and looks as freſh and as green as it were in the midſt of the ſpring; when other trees decay, that flouriſheth. So fares it with wicked men in ſuch Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-times
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21224:8"/>
of the world as we had the laſt yeare, times of dearth and ſcarcity, times of want and penury; when many a poore Chriſtian is faine to faſt and fare hard, and goe with many hungry meale to bed, then doe you uſurers, oppreſſors, corn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mongers, and ſuch others, thoſe <hi>mercatores humanarum calamitatum</hi> (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls them) thoſe that make merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of poore mens miſeries, then doe they proſper, then doe they thrive, then doe they flouriſh like greene bay-trees; when others decay, then doe they flouriſh, then is their ſpring, their flouriſhing time. <hi>[They flouriſh like greene bay trees.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but what followes in the next verſe? <hi>After a while</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I ſought him, but he could not be found;</hi> as if he had ſaid, I ſought on earth in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in his dwelling-place, thence hee was gone, there he was not to be found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afterward I ſought him in heaven, to ſee if I could finde him there among the Saints and bleſſed ſoules above, there hee was not to be found: Where was he then?

                     </gap>, gone downe to his owne place, gone downe to hell, there <hi>David</hi> might have found him, but there hee ſought him not. And this is the miſerable end of a wicked mans proſperity.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration whereof may be a ſtay unto us againſt that great temptation that troubled <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ieremy,</hi> and ſtill troubles them that are weake in faith, to ſee the proſperity of wicked men, to ſee it goe well with them that be evill, and ill with them that doe well. Doſt thou ſee an ungodly man laden with wealth, honour and eaſe? doſt thou ſee an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite

and an evill liver bleſt as <hi>Eſau</hi> was with the dew of heaven and the fatneſſe of the earth; doſt thou ſee a graceleſſe ruffin, one that feaſts without feare, drinkes without meaſure, ſweares without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and lives without God; and yet his body vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, his coffers plenteous, and his eſtate proſperous? in a word, doſt thou ſee them proſper that ſeeke not the Lord, but lie wallowing in that which God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors, and ſtand chargeable in their ſoules with that which ſeparates and divides betwixt man and his God? why, be not diſcomforted at it, be not diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted with it, do not fret thy ſelfe becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, neither be thou envious at evill doers; but conſider the end of thoſe men, that is the Apoſtles expreſſion, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 11. You know the patience of <hi>Iob</hi> and what end the Lord made with him, though he curſt him at firſt, yet he doubled his bleſſing upon him at laſt; ſo ſtay till you ſee what end God will make with theſe men: ſurely O God (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 73. 18.) <hi>Thou haſt ſet theſe men in ſlippery places, thou caſteſt them downe into deſtruction:</hi> a man that ſtands in <hi>lubrico</hi> in a ſlippery place, as on ice or glaſſe, ſhall have much a-doe to keepe himſelfe upright though no body touch him, but if one ſhould come upon him unawares and give him a ſudden juſtle, or a ſudden ruſh, he hath no power in the world to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold himſelfe, but muſt fall and that dangerouſly: and this is the caſe of wicked wealthy men, they thinke they are <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21224:9"/>
and it will not be long ere God ſend ſome death, ſome judgement, ſome evill angell or other to give them ſuch a ſudden juſtle, ſuch a ſudden ruſh, that without great mercy on Gods part, and great repentance on their owne part, they muſt fall ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably into the pit of hell. And this is the firſt point I deſire to have handled, namely, that the right way for a man to proſper indeed is to ſerve and ſeeke the Lord, whoſoever proſpers without ſeeking of <hi>God,</hi> his proſperitie in this world, ſhall be his ruine and perdition in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the manner how one that deſires to proſper muſt ſeeke the Lord, and that is to be done two dayes:

When the Arke of God was depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them, they lamented after the Lord: the beſt and trueſt lamentation in the world is to lament after the Lord, and a man hath never ſo juſt a cauſe to lament as when the Lord for ſinne is departed from him. We read in the ſtory of <hi>Micha, Iudg.</hi> 18. 24. that when the Souldiers had taken away <hi>Micha's</hi> gods, he ranne crying and weeping after them, as a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21224:9"/>
man diſtracted and deprived of all his comfort; the Souldiers hearing him, turned backe and asked him, what he ailed: ſaith <hi>Micha,</hi> Yee have taken away my gods, and doe yee aske me what I aile? can yee blame a man that hath loſt his gods to be out of quiet? If <hi>Micha</hi> could find in his heart to lament for the loſſe of a falſe god, a god of his owne making, as good gods as that lying at the backe of the fire, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a man or roaſting of meate, (as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes) ſhall a Chriſtian finde in his heart to loſe the true God, the God of all comfort and conſolation, and that by ſinne which is the worſt loſſe of all, and that not by any others taking away (as in <hi>Michas</hi> caſe) but by his owne act and wilfull default, and not be grieved, nay not moved a-whit; breake none of his ſleepe, none of his wonted ſports for it, as if he reckoned God as good loſt as found? God forbid. Certainely, hee that can lament for the loſſe of his goods, and cannot lament for the loſſe of his God, is worthy to loſe both his goods and his God for ever. God was angry with the carnall <hi>Iewes, Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14. becauſe they howled upon him for <hi>corne</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> but did not cry unto him with their hearts; they howled becauſe God had ſcanted them in his mercie, but they never howled becauſe they had ſcanted God in their duty; they howled for want of meanes not for want of grace, which is the greateſt want of all: obſerve therefore what a deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, contemptible terme God gives their prayers, hee cals them <hi>ululatus, howlings,</hi> like the <hi>howlings</hi> of a <hi>Dogge,</hi> or a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> which is a moſt harſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing note in the eare of a man; ſuch are the

When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ſtraighted at the red Sea; having the Sea before them, their enemies behind them, Rocks and Hils of each ſide of them; the text ſaith, The people cried, and made a dolefull howling and lamentation to the Lord, <hi>Moſes</hi> held his peace; and ſee the iſſue: <hi>Populus clamabat &amp; non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diebatur, tacebat Moſes &amp; audiebatur, The people cried and God heard not them; Moſes held his peace and hee was heard, Verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Why doſt thou cry unto me</hi> (ſaith God) when he uttered never a word, nor made any noiſe that we can read of, onely his heart cried, and that was it that God liſtned unto: and therefore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man find himſelfe to be <gap reason="foreign">

right, cry heartily and ſtrongly, what-ever ſhee is a doing ſhee will lay it aſide and run to ſtill her child: God is more compaſſionate and tender over his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than any earthly mother over hers; if hee doe but heare us cry heartily, cry in good earneſt, hee hath not the power to containe himſelfe but will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and have mercy on us; that is the reaſon our prayers want ſucceſſe, becauſe they want heart, their bleſſing is according to their vigor. You will ſay it were a good comfort for a man thus to cry &amp; lament and make his moane to God in this ſad and ſorrowful maner, if a man were but ſure to proſper ever the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for that I refer you to an inſtance in Scripture, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 9, 10.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the time when wee muſt ſeeke God, and that is to be conſidered in two Circumſtances,
<list>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Generally; <hi>Hee that deſires to proſper must ſeeke God at all times.</hi> As we ſay, <hi>Nullum tempus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currit Regi;</hi> ſo no time comes amiſſe to God, morning or evening, midday or midnight, all times are alike for that matter, a man can never come unſeaſonably with a ſuite to <hi>God, Exod.</hi> 18. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſate from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till night to heare the cauſes of the people, but he grew weary of it, and was faine to give it over; but there is one above, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous that ſits continually <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, on the right hand of Majeſtie on high to heare the cauſes and complaints of his poore people and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and preſent our petitions to the divine Majeſtie and is never weary of it, come when we will he is at leaſure to heare us. It is a prety obſervation that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes out of the parable propoſed by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. where he that knockt at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to borrow bread of his neighbour, found all the whole family aſleepe, onely the maſter of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21224:12"/>
houſe was awake, and he anſwered, and opened, and gave him that he craved, though it was at an unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable time; <hi>Nullus de janitoribus reſpondit,</hi> none of all the porters, none of all the ſervants, none of all the children made him any anſwer, they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, onely the maſter was awake, and heard him when hee called. Iuſt ſo it fares with us when wee knocke and call at the doore of heaven for any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, none of all the Prophets nor Apoſtles, none of all the bleſſed Saints departed make us any anſwer; alas, they heare us not, they ſleepe in peace and are at reſt from their labours, onely God Almightie, who is the Maſter and Maker of that bleſſed familie, hee, and onely hee doth heare and anſwer, at what time ſoever we cry unto him; <hi>Hee that keepeth Iſrael neither ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth,</hi> call when we will God is alway awake to heare and helpe: No time unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſeeke God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but more particularly, for one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to proſper, there is a choiſe time and ſeaſon to ſeeke the Lord above all the reſt, and that is early in the morning. 'Tis a pretty conjecture that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes make upon that ſaying of the Angel to <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 32. 26. <hi>Let mee goe for the morning appeareth.</hi> I take it the true reaſon was, becauſe <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhould not be too curious in looking and gazing upon that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, wherein this great Angel <hi>Chriſt</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for he it was that wraſtled with <hi>Iacob,</hi> but their conceit is, that the Angell which wraſtled with <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> all night, deſired to depart when the morning appeared, becauſe hee was now to goe to the reſt of the bleſſed company and quire of Angels, to ſing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21224:13"/>
their morning-hymne unto God. 'Tis but a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but we may apply it thus; We all hope to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, like the Angels in heaven, let us be like them on earth too, and how ever we are imployed at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, when the morning appeares let us haſten to God, and aske him bleſſing every morning, as our children doe us, and no doubt but God will bleſſe us the better all the day after. <hi>Iob</hi> 8. 5, 6. <hi>If thou wilt ſeeke unto God betimes, and make thy ſupplication to the Almighty, ſurely now he will awake for thee, and make thy habitation proſperous.</hi> I make no doubt but a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you are early riſers, that are up before the morning watch, I ſay, before the morning-watch, <hi>(i)</hi> before the day-ſtarre or the Sunne appeare: and 'tis poſſible for a man to be early up and never the neere, but hee that riſeth early to pray and ſeeke the Lord, ſhall be ſure not to loſe his labour, for he ſhall proſper the better all the day, <hi>If thou wilt ſeeke the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, but there's a place of Scripture that ſeemes to croſſe and contradict it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28. <hi>They ſhall ſeeke me early, but they ſhall not finde me.</hi> Is the Scripture contrary to it ſelfe? Doth God ſay in one place, <hi>If ye ſeeke me early ye ſhall finde me;</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>Though you ſeeke me early you ſhall not finde me?</hi> How ſhall we know which to beleeve, which to build upon? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p>There's a two-fold early, Gods early, and mans early; Gods early is to ſeeke him in the firſt place, <hi>Ante omnia adoremus Deum</hi> (was the old rule) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we eate or drinke, before we worke or play, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we doe any thing, doe that firſt; firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God, and that's Gods early. Mans early
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21224:13"/>
is at the beginning of trouble, the beginning of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the beginning of ſorrow, and then the wickedſt wretch upon earth will ſeeke the Lord, but then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he ſhall not finde him; hee that will not ſeeke him in peace, ſhall hardly finde him in trouble; hee that will not ſeeke him in health, ſhall not eaſily find him in ſickneſſe, yea, though he ſeeke him early, at the very firſt, at the very beginning of it, as <hi>Ioab</hi> fled to the Altar in his perplexity, but it ſaved not his life becauſe he never came at it in his proſperity to offer upon it. So that you ſee, if wee take mans early to ſeeke God, we may chance to miſſe him; but if wee take Gods early, we ſhall be ſure to finde him.</p>
                  <p>You then that deſire to proſper, remember Gods early; the firſt thing you do in the morning, let it be ſeeke God, never thinke your ſelves dreſt till that be done, let thy ſoules have a morning draught as wel as thy body, I mean a morning prayer to fence it againſt the infectious ayre of the world: <hi>Salomon</hi> gives the reaſon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>For who can tell what a day may bring forth?</hi> 'Tis a Metaphor taken from a wombe, when a woman is in travell, who can tell what ſhee will bring forth till ſhee be delivered, may be a ſonne, may be a daughter, may be a monſter; ſo when the wombe of the morning is in travell, who can tell what a day may bring forth, may be <hi>albus,</hi> may be <hi>ater dies,</hi> may be a white, a happy, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable day; may be a blacke, a diſmall, a dolefull day; wee doe not know what a day may bring forth, whether judgement or mercy, whether good or bad events (therefore to prevent the worſt, 'tis good to make ſure worke for our owne ſafetie, namely to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21224:14"/>
ſeeke the Lord in the morning and then come what will come, all ſhall be for the beſt, God will turne it all to good <hi>Omnia cooperantur, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>All things worke together for good to them that love God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He then that would be proſperous and ſpeed well, let him be religious and pray well, for he that prayes well can never ſpeed amiſſe: and therefore if you ſee one that followes his calling, and is not followed with Gods bleſſing, it may juſtly be ſuſpected, that ſuch a one <hi>reſtraineth</hi> prayer from Almighty God, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> told <hi>Iob</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 15. 4. Now 'tis juſt with God to reſtraine proſperity from them that reſtraine their prayers from him, 'tis juſt with God to withhold his bleſſing from thoſe that have not the care nor the grace to aske it. So much for the time and order of our ſeeking of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, where, or in what place wee muſt ſeeke <hi>God.</hi> Generally, wee are to ſeeke him every where, for <hi>God</hi> is <hi>omni-preſent,</hi> in all places to be found of them that ſeeke him faithfully; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith; <hi>Pſalme</hi> 139. 3. <hi>Thou art about my bed, and about my paths, and ſpieſt out all my wayes.</hi> We little thinke when wee lie downe in our beds as a dogge lies downe in a kennell, without any prayer, any ejaculation, any good motion to God-ward, we little thinke that <hi>God</hi> is ſo neere us that hee is about our beds, and doth <hi>obſervare excubias,</hi> watch our watchings, and obſerve our lying downe, and our riſing up.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when wee walke in <hi>Circuitus,</hi> walke the Devils round from one ſinne to another, from one vanity to another, from one ill company to another,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21224:14"/>
we little thinke that God is about our paths, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out all our wayes: but whether wee thinke it or no, ſo it is for certaine; and therefore to apply it the right way; In what place ſoever we ſeeke God, in bed or up, within doore or without, in the field or in the road, we ſhall be ſure to finde him to our comfort and protection. But more eſpecially, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per peculiar place appointed for Chriſtians to ſeeke the Lord in, and that is the Church of God, the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary or houſe of prayer, ther's his dwelling place, and thither muſt wee reſort to ſeeke him. We have an expreſſe law for it, <hi>Deut</hi> 12. 5. <hi>In that place which the Lord your God ſhall chuſe to put his name in, in that his habitation ſhall ye ſeeke unto him.</hi> Neither was this a law judiciall, or ceremoniall, that bound the Iew onely for a time, but morall and perpetuall, that bindes the Chriſtian for ever, to ſeeke the Lord where he is to be found, <hi>(i)</hi> in his Sanctuary; they that refuſe to come there, may juſtly be termed (as <hi>Eſau</hi> was) profane perſons, as being <hi>procul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> fano,</hi> farre from the Sanctuary, and conſequently out of Gods protection; for they that are thus out of the one, are out of the other alſo.</p>
                  <p>As S. <hi>Austin</hi> notes out of the parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 30. concerning the man that fell among theeves, and was wounded and left halfe dead, 'tis noted of him that hee was going down from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Iericho;</hi> from the Church I warrant you: <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was the Church of God, the holy Citie; <hi>Iericho</hi> was a curſed place, branded with an ancient curſe ſince the dayes of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and thither lay his journey: whereupon Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> notes, <hi>Si non deſcendiſſet, fortaſſe in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:21224:15"/>
                     <hi>non incidiſſet,</hi> had he not been deſcending and going downeward from God and from his Church, peradventure hee had not fallen into the hands of theeves. God would have protected him, the Lord would have ſafe guarded and defended him, that no ſuch evill ſhould have betided him; but becauſe hee was going from the Church to a curſed place, and like enough about a naughty buſineſſe; therefore God gave him over, and he fell into the hands of theeves. As many therefore as deſire Gods protection and bleſſing, let them reſort to the Church to ſerve and ſeeke the Lord.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, it were a good comfort for a man ſo to doe, if he were but ſure to proſper ever the better; but we ſee many that frequent the Church duely and daily, that yet proſper never the more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it be ſo, then ſurely tis to be feared, that ſuch came not to Church with a true intent to ſeeke God, but either for no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

If they doe not proſper outwardly, they ſhall proſper inwardly, if they doe not proſper in goods, they ſhall proſper in grace, and that is the better

proſperitie by farre. I ſay the better, and I will make it good out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of a better covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi> The words at the firſt ſight implie, that the covenant of the Goſpel is a better covenant than the covenant of the law: and againe, that the promiſes of the Goſpell are better promiſes than the promiſes of the Law: Now if you look into the old Teſtament, you ſhall finde that the promiſes of the Law were moſt of them, and the maine of them, temporall promiſes, promiſes of outward proſperity, that if they kept the commandements, and ſought the Lord, they ſhould dwell in the good land, the land that flowed with milke and honey, they ſhould have corne, and wine, and oyle in abundance, they ſhould lay up gold as duſt, and the gold of <hi>Ophir</hi> as the flints of the river, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 24. theſe and the like were the promiſes of the Law. Now looke into the New Teſtament, and you ſhall finde the promiſes of the Goſpell are cleane of another nature, moſt of them ſpirituall promiſes, promiſes of the pardon of ſinnes, the peace of conſcience, the joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and ſuch like: and theſe, ſaith the Apoſtle, are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, better promiſes than the other.</p>
                  <p>Hence I gather, that he that in theſe dayes ſeekes the face of <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in his Church, and is of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as becommeth the Goſpell, if he have not temporall proſperity, he ſhall have that that is better for him, hee ſhall have the pardon of his ſinnes, the favour of his <hi>God,</hi> the comfort of his conſcience, and the ſalvation of his ſoule, which are things of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worth than all the outward happineſſe under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

and will be a ſecret ſtay and comfort to the ſoule, when all that the earth affords will not yeeld a man one droppe of true refreſhing.</p>
                  <p>You know that the Priſoners in the Tower, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, and great men, and ſuch others, they are in worſe eſtate and condition than the pooreſt Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer in the Citie: for why? though they have good diet, good lodging, good attendance, fine roomes, ſoft beds, curious wal<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

No marvell then that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith. <hi>The righteous man is more excellent than his neighbour, Prov.</hi> 12. 26. he doth not deny but a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man may be poorer than his neighbour, yet he ſaith, he is more excellent, becauſe his excellency is intrinſecall, <hi>(omnis decor ab intus)</hi> the others is but outward and adventitious. Now he that ſhall count himſelfe more excellent than his neighbour, becauſe hee excels him in outward things, in wealth and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21224:16"/>
worldly goods, it is but (as one well compares it) as if a mud-wall that the Sunne ſhines upon, ſhould boaſt it ſelfe againſt a wall of marble that ſtands in the ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>What ſaith a Father, <hi>An ideo Angelus pauper, quia non habet jumenta?</hi> Shall wee count an Angell to be poore becauſe he hath not heards, and flockes, and droves of cattell, as worldly miſers have? No, their riches are in another kinde. So ſhall we count a Chriſtian poore and baſe becauſe hee wants the wealth of the world? No, they are rich in another kinde, what he wants outwardly, he hath it inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what he wants in meanes, he hath in grace, though he be not rich in the purſe, hee is rich in the faith; though he have not ſilver and gold, hee hath that which is better than either, hee hath the precious Pearle of Gods grace, which is of more value to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the ſoule, than all the gold and ſilver in the world.</p>
                  <p>The Goſpell (you know) compares grace to Pearls; now Pearls are of no value to dunghill-Cocks; but to them that know the worth of them, they are the onely riches in the world; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, they are portable riches: a man that hath a thouſand pound in Pearls, may carry them all about him, and never clog him, which he could not doe if his wealth lay in other things. So here, to one that hath no grace, to a godleſſe graceleſſe man, the

                  <p>And therefore for our owne parts, if we have any making, any promotion or proſperitie above our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, we muſt confeſſe with <hi>David: That it is God that hath made us, and not we our ſelves;</hi> it is God that

                  </p>
                  <p>But that is not all; the maine thing that I obſerve from hence is, the benefit that ariſeth to us by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, namely, that it turnes to our owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, our owne profit; God hath onely the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but the gaine is wholly ours, for it is a meanes to make us proſper; as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. ſaith, that in keeping of them there is great reward; no man ſhall be a loſer by keeping of Gods commandements, but a gainer, and a great gainer too, for in keeeping of them there is great reward; if we be not rewarded on earth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be the greater in heaven, <hi>In coelis repoſita eſt major compenſatio</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin)</hi> the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is reſerved in the heavens.

                     <hi>well with them and their children after them;</hi> not that I might be a gainer and you loſe, but that you and your children might reape the bene fit. So that as our Saviour ſaith of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that it was made for man, not onely for Gods ſervice, but for mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: ſo it is true of every Commandement, it was made for mans, that is, for mans good and benefit: therefore you have it ſo often repeated in <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> Theſe are the Commandements that I have given thee for thy wealth and for thy good.</p>
                  <p>It is a pretty obſervation of <hi>Cajetan,</hi> upon that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Moſes, Exo.</hi> 34. 1. <hi>Hew thee two Tables, Dola tibi, non mihi, ego enim non indigio tua dolatione:</hi> Hew to thy ſelfe, not for me, for I neede none of thy hewing, nor yet any of thy tables, it is for thy owne and thy peoples good that I bid thee hew them; ſo it is for our good that God bids us ſeeke him; God hath onely the glory of it, but the benefit is our own, for it is a meanes to make us proſper.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if we love our ſelves and deſire to doe our ſelves good, let us ſeeke the Lord. I know, that naturally wee all love our ſelves too much, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually wee all love our ſelves too little; for he that lives in ſinne, he doth not love himſelfe, for he goeth the way to undoe himſelfe both here and ever, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 24. 20. <hi>Why tranſgreſse ye the Commandements of the Lord that ye cannot proſper.</hi> We uſe to ſay of one that is of a good nature, but an evill husband, <hi>He is no mans foe but his owne;</hi> and it is true of every one that lives in any knowne ſinne, not grieving for it, nor ſtriving againſt it, not making conſcience to reforme it, he is his owne foe indeede, for he doth not onely anger God, but he hinders himſelfe that hee cannot
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21224:20"/>
proſper, <hi>Why tranſgreſſe yee the commandements of God that ye cannot proſper?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like ſpeech you have in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>Why will you die, O houſe of Iſrael? God</hi> doth not ſay, Why will you ſin, O houſe of Iſrael? but why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael? as preſuppoſing they might wel know, if they wil needs ſin, they muſt needs die; for death is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin, and followes it as the ſhadow followes the bodie. The Lord ſpeaks it with indignation, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> as wondring they ſhould love themſelves no better, but even to ſeeke their own death, by ruſhing into ſinne, as a horſe ruſheth into the battell: that's the expreſſion that <hi>God</hi> uſeth <hi>(Ier.</hi> 8. 7.) <hi>They ruſh into ſin, as a horſe ruſheth into the battell.</hi> And why as a horſe ruſheth into the battell, and not as a man ruſheth into the battell? I will tell you what I thinke the reaſon is; The horſe when he ruſheth into the battell, doth not know that thoſe whom he ruſheth on be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that they will hurt, wound and kill him, but he ruſheth on them without feare or wit, and ruſheth upon his owne death: ſo fooliſh men doe not know, at leaſt will not know <hi>(This they willingly know not,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes) that ſinne is ſuch an enemie to them, that it doth hurt, kill, and damne them, thereupon they ruſh upon ſinne without feare, and ſo runne upon their owne deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is a good meditation of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon that prayer of <hi>David, Deliver me, O Lord, from the evill man. Tu noli tibi eſſe malus, liberet te Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus à te,</hi> &amp;c. Be not thou an evill man to thy ſelfe, pray to God to deliver thee from thy ſelfe being an evill man, and of an evill man to make thee a good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21224:20"/>
man, that thou maieſt not hurt thy ſelfe, and then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feare any hurt that any other evill man can doe thee. Wee ſay, <hi>Nemo laeditur niſi à ſeipſo,</hi> No man takes any hurt but he may thanke himſelfe, his owne ſinne is the cauſe of it; were it not for ſinne, heaven could have no quarrell againſt us, hell could have no power over us; our ſinnes are they that hurt us, they are thoſe that undoe us.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture ſpeakes of ſinne lying at the doore, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>If thou dost ill, ſinne lies at the doore.</hi> Of all doore keepers in the world, ſinne is the worſt, for if that lie at the doore it doth a double miſchiefe, it keepes Gods bleſſing out, and it lets Gods judgement in: therefore if you deſire to dwell in ſaferie, and to proſper in your familie, let not ſinne lie at your doore; as long as that lies there, without repentance, you muſt never looke to proſper.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture ſpeakes of ſome that are ſonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> and daughters of <hi>Belial,</hi> (the ſonnes of <hi>Eli</hi> were ſonnes of <hi>Bel al, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Sam.</hi> 2. and 1. <hi>Hannah</hi> ſaith to <hi>Eli, Count not thy hand-maid for a daughter of Belial)</hi> Now a ſon of <hi>Belial</hi> is taken generally for one excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly wicked, the very child of the devill, that lives <hi>abſque jugo,</hi> without a yoake, without any feare of God before his eyes; but it ſeemeth to be derived of <hi>(Beli)</hi> which ſignifies without, and <hi>(jagnal)</hi> which is to be profitable, or to proſper; and ſo <hi>Belial</hi> noteth ſuch a one as is altogether unprofitable, and which cannot, ſhall not proſper. If any ſuch be here, or if any of you that be here finde your ſelves to be ſuch, that you are unprofitable members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that you doe, cannot proſper in your courſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21224:21"/>
of life, I will not ſay yee are ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> (what have I to doe to judge you?) onely this let mee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, that you would conſider with your ſelves what ſinne it is that lies at your doores, and keepes Gods bleſſing out.</p>
                  <p>Remove but that, drive but that a way by a ſincere repentance and reformation of life, and then there is hope to proſper. We ſee it is the nature of a ſtreame, if it be ſtopt in his courſe that he cannot make a way in his wonted channell, it will turne in upon it ſelfe and flow backe againe towards the fountaine, and to the place it came from; ſo when you finde your ſelves ſtopt in your proceedings, that you cannot make away into the world ſo proſperouſly, ſo ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as you deſire, then doe as the ſtreame doth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meate, flow backe, reflect, recoyle and turne in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelves, to ſee where the fault lies, what ſinne is the cauſe of it (for that's the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the object or barre that hinders good things from us) and when you have turned backe into your ſelves, then turne forward unto your God, deſire him to pardon and amend you, and that's the way to proſper.</p>
                  <p>I have not yet done with this point; I beſeech you give me leave, and I beſeech God give mee grace, that I may apply it ſeverally and effectually to your ſoules and conſciences; for application is the life of all inſtruction; a thing proved is true to all, but it is good to none but onely to them to whom it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Let me intreat therefore your patient attention yet a little longer, and you ſhall heare what I have to ſay unto you, not in any biting or galling manner (I never delighted in that ſtraine,) but in gentleneſſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21224:21"/>
and mildneſſe to teach you how to proſper.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you that are tradeſmen, Shop-keepers, Handicraftſ-men, that have nothing to betake to but what your honeſt labours and endeavours muſt helpe you to; doe you deſire to proſper in your trades and callings? then ſeeke the Lord before you ſet to worke, doe as they doe at Sea, that have <hi>oculos ad coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, manus ad clavum,</hi> their hand upon the helme, and their eye upon the heaven; ſo when a mans hand is upon his worke, and his heart upon his God, then is his buſineſſe like to proſper. Contrariwiſe, he that ſets to his worke before he ſeekes to his God, takes a prepoſterous courſe, and commonly thrives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. You know what <hi>Peter</hi> confeſt to Chriſt, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, we have laboured all night and taken nothing;</hi> and no marvell, for Chriſt was not with him in the Ship; as ſoone as ever hee had gotten Chriſt, immediatly he had good ſucceſſe. Beleeve it, brethren, except Chriſt be with a man in his Shop, as he was with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his Ship, there's no good to be done in any trade. What's the reaſon that ſo many Tradſmen breake and hide their heads, and runne away, but becauſe they have not ſought the Lord, nor gotten Chriſt unto them: they firſt breake with God, then breake with men; firſt loſe their credits with God, and then 'its juſt with God they ſhould loſe their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits with men: firſt leave their honeſtie, then loſe their proſperitie; if you deſire therefore that your dealings ſhould proſper, and your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hold and thrive, get Chriſt into your ſhops and hee will bring you in Cuſtomers, hee will bleſſe your takings, hee will uphold you that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21224:22"/>
you ſhall never breake: but if ye expell Chriſt out of your ſhops by your wickedneſſe, as <hi>Peter</hi> out of weakeneſſe would have had Chriſt beene gone out of his Ship (ſaying, <hi>Lord, goe from me for I am a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man)</hi> then farewell all good fortune, and never looke to proſper.</p>
                  <p>And if you would have Chriſt to keepe with you, to dwell and make his abode with you, and ſo to bleſſe and proſper you, then be ſure that you uſe a good conſcience in all your dealings; take heede you do not deale with your Cuſtomers, as the Prophet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> complaines of the dealers in his time, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. That they made the Ephah ſmall, and the Shekle great; that is, they made the meaſure little, and the price great: take heed of that, 'tis an abomination to the Lord, and hee that uſeth it ſhall never proſper. Remember the ſaying, <hi>Iob cap.</hi> 8. 5. 6. <hi>Seeke the Lord and be upright, and he will make the habitation of thy righteouſneſſe proſperous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 You that have occaſion to travell by land or by water, that have any journey to goe that you deſire ſhould proſper, then ſeeke to God before you ſet out of doores, take God along with you, requeſt his company, crave his conduct and guidance: pray as <hi>Eleazer</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 12. <hi>O Lord God of my maſter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, I beſeech thee ſend me good ſpeed this day;</hi> and God heard him, and granted his deſire, hee ſped as well as his heart could wiſh.

thee in the way, if God be not with thee to protect thee? but if thou haſt ſought to him, he will be a ſunne and a ſhield unto thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. a Sunne to direct and guide thee, a Shield to defend and ſave thee from all annoyances that may hurt thee; <hi>Hee will give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels charge over thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes;</hi> in <hi>viis, non in praecipitiis,</hi> in thy wayes wherein thou walkeſt with God as <hi>Enoch</hi> did; not in thy headlong courſes wherein thou runneſt without God: when thou run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in the Divels way, in the way of wickedneſſe and vanity, thou art out of Gods protection, and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looke to proſper: (out of Gods wayes, and out of Gods protection.) In all thy journies therfore do as <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kanah</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 19. He roſe up early in the morning to return to <hi>Ramath,</hi> but he durſt not ſet forward a foot, till he had worſhipped before the Lord: <hi>Moſes</hi> would not ſtirre a foot except Gods preſence went with him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 15. beare thou that mind, hold thou that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolution, and (my life for thine) God will make thy way to proſper.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 You that are as Souldiers and men of warre, if you be commanded to fight the Lords battels in <hi>cauſa Chriſti,</hi> againſt his and your enemies, and (as <hi>Tertul.</hi> ſpeakes) <hi>cruorem cruore reponere,</hi> to retaliate bloud with bloud, to ſhed your bloud for Chriſt that hath ſhed his bloud for you; doe you deſire that your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare ſhould proſper? then ſeeke to God before you ſet upon your enemies; it is God that muſt cover your heads in the day of battell, it is hee that muſt defend you from the danger of the enemie. Beleeve it, a man of warre without God is but a naked man though in the mid'ſt of all his harneſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 25. it is ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw the people were naked after their great

Thus it is ſtill, let a man be never ſo well cloathed, never ſo well armed, never ſo well guarded and weaponed, if he be ſtript of Gods protection by ſinne, hee lies naked and open to all diſaſters, and therefore if ever any of you come upon that ſervice, firſt ſeeke the Lord, and that is the way to proſper.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 You that are great projectors and plotters for your advancement in the world, let me onely admoniſh you in a word; that in all your plots you would beginne with the firſt mover, and ſeeke to God before you ſet upon the meanes; for it is a certaine thing, no project can proſper without God: when you have wrought a buſineſſe and ripened it, and (as you thinke) brought it to maturity, if God be not ſought unto, he can daſh it and blaſt it in a moment, that it ſhall prove abortive like the untimely fruit of a woman, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8. 10. <hi>Take counſell together and it ſhall be brought to nought, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a decree and it ſhall not ſtand, for God is with us.</hi> No good to be done without God. <hi>Hannah</hi> gives this counſell in her ſong, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Speake no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, let not arrogancy come forth of your mouth, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him enterpriſes are eſtabliſhed;</hi> for any man to thinke or ſay that he is able of himſelfe to bring an enterprize to paſſe, hee ſpeakes preſumptuouſly, hee takes more upon him than he is able to performe; for mortall man hath not the knowledge to looke through a buſineſſe, to ſee all

                  <p>I have but one thing more to move you in before I leave this point, and that is this, that you whom God hath already proſpered and bleſt and enabled to doe good, would be pleaſed and perſwaded to give ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21224:25"/>
out of your plentie to the poore, and pious uſes, according as God hath proſpered you; it is the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> own word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. He would have every one lay up in ſtore by him to beſtow on the poore and needy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God hath proſpered him; for the quantitie, God hath left it to every mans conſcience, onely in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall he is directed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. to doe as God hath proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered him: we ſhould doe therefore in this caſe, as the Iewes doe in another caſe, who becauſe they know not the preciſe time when the Sabbath ſhould begin and end, they beginne it an houre the ſooner and end it an houre the later: this they call, <hi>Additionem de propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no ad ſacrum,</hi> an addition from prophaneneſſe to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I will not diſpute the lawfulneſſe of that act in particular, but generally in ſuch caſes as this, it is good for every man to doe rather with the moſt than with the leaſt: <hi>Quantiſcumque ſumptibus constet, lucrum eſt piet at is nomine facere ſumptus.</hi> Whatſoever coſt a man is at for pious and charitable uſes, it ſhall be a gaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe. We finde 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 14 when <hi>David</hi> had beſtowed all his coſt in preparation for the Temple (a hundred thouſand talents of gold, a thouſand thouſand talents of ſilver) thus he expreſt it; <hi>Ecce in paupertate meâ,</hi> this (ſaith he) I have done according to my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; as if he had ſaid, if I had beene able to doe more, I would have done more, but this was as much as I could reach to, and this (I truſt) God will accept: ſay not then in thy heart, if I were rich, If I were able I would doe thus and thus, but doe as God hath proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee; if thou canſt not doe according to thy minde, doe according to thy meanes, and that is all that God requires: we read, <hi>Mat</hi> 21. when our Saviour came ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Ieruſalem, ſome ſtrewed their garments in the

You know the poore widdowes caſe in the Goſpell, that put her two mites into the poore mans box; our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt affirmed that ſhe gave more than all the reſt, becauſe ſhee gave all that ſhee had: which teſtified (as one ſaith) not only her liberality to God, but her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, that ſhe did verily beleeve though ſhee left her ſelfe nothing, ſhe ſhould not lacke: whereupon Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Divites largiuntur ſecuri de divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis, pauper ſecurus de Domino:</hi> a rich man gives and feares no want, becauſe hee knowes he hath enough at home: a poore man gives and feares as little, becauſe he knowes he hath enough above, there is one above will ſupply his wants.</p>
                  <p>Beleeve it brethren, he that gives any thing with a true intent to relieve the poore and to maintaine the diſtreſſed, ſhall doe himſelfe more good, than he doth them whom hee releeves; and I will prove it out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 7. 10. <hi>If there be amo<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

ſevere exacter of it at his hands when hee comes to judgement.</p>
                  <p>We have a preſident for it in the Goſpell, of the man that had a talent given him, and did not uſe it as hee ought; there came an extent from God, firſt upon the talent <hi>[Take away his talent from him]</hi> &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there came an extent upon his perſon too <hi>[Take away the unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervant, bind him, and caſt him into utter darkeneſſe.]</hi> As S. <hi>Peter</hi> told <hi>Simon Magus, Thou and thy money periſh together;</hi> it had beene happie for him if nothing but his money had periſhed, but there comes an extent from God againſt all, Hee and his money muſt periſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As the Idolater (as one ſaid of <hi>Iulian)</hi> ſhall burne in hell with that ſame wood and ſtone that he adored and made a god of on earth: So the Vſurer and money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, that hath no goodneſſe nor compaſſion in him, ſhall burne in hell with the ſame ſilver and gold that he made an idoll of here in this world. I will ſay no more but this, Shew mercy to the poore for Chriſts ſake, and Chriſt will ſhew mercy to you for the poores ſake. Doe good as God hath proſpered you, and then you fulfill the law of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I have done with the firſt generall point of my text, namely, the ground and foundation of true proſperitie, that it muſt be raiſed and built upon religion and pietie: God muſt be ſought unto, ere any true proſperitie can be attained unto. I will diſpatch the other part in a word or two, and ſo conclude. And that is the bounds and limitation of true proſperitie, how farre it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and how long it laſteth, and that is onely during the time that a man ſerves and ſeekes the Lord. <hi>So long as he ſought the Lord</hi> (ſo long, and no longer,) <hi>God made him to proſper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>So long.</hi> How long that was you may
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21224:26"/>
ſee in the words before my Text (Hee ſought the Lord in the dayes of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> who had underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the viſions of God.) That wiſe and holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zachariah</hi> was a happie tutor to the minority of K. <hi>Vzziah,</hi> and was alwayes at hand to counſel and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him, to advertiſe &amp; admoniſh him in things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his God and his governement, and by his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doctrine, and his holy life to guide and ſteere him the right way to happineſſe: now as long as <hi>Zechariah</hi> lived, during all his time he ſought the Lord and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered: but asſoone as <hi>Zechariah</hi> was gone and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his fathers, it ſhould ſeeme that <hi>Vzziah</hi> began to fall away, and his proſperitie ſunke as faſt as his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: juſt like the waters of <hi>Noah's</hi> floud, as ſoone as ever the fountaines and ſprings began to be ſtopt, preſently the waters began to abate: ſo when the ſpring of grace begins to be ſtopt up in a mans heart, and damd up with wickedneſſe and ſinne, it is a venture but his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie will abate and drie away, and his later end ſhall be worſe than his beginning. Here then (as in a mappe) we may ſee and bewayle the miſerable downe-fall of many Chriſtian ſoules, who during their minoritie and younger yeares, while they live under good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, good Tutors, and good Governors, they take good courſes and keepe themſelves in good order, but when ever they come to their owne hand, <hi>Sine cortice natare,</hi> to ſwimme without a corke, to ſaile without a ſterne, and to live without a guide and without a God; they runne many times headlong into ſuch deſperate licentious courſes, that a man that ſees them ſo bad at the laſt, would hardly beleeve they had ever beene good at the firſt. It is a good obſervation of a late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in the dayes of Popery and blindneſſe, the Divell it ſeemes walked very familiarly among them: hence
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21224:27"/>
we have ſo many ſtories of hagges and fayries, and of children taken out of cradles and others laid in their roomes, and thoſe they called changelings: ſince the ight of the Goſpell hath ſhined ſo cleerely, theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and fayries have not beene ſeene amongſt us; but ſtill there are changelings too too many in every place. Some the Prieſts and Ieſuites have changed from the true Religion, to Popery; ſome the world have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from good neighbourhood and good hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to all manner of baſeneſſe and miſerie; ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowſhip and the alehouſe hath changed from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and ſobrietie to prophaneneſſe and luxury; too many ſuch changelings there be in the world; God of his mercy change them againe, and transforme them into a better minde, <hi>ut mutati mutatum inveniant</hi> (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeakes) that they being changed in affection to God-word, may finde God changed in affection to them-ward, to ſpeake after the manner of men; for if you marke the courſe of the world, obſerve it where you will, you ſhall never find that ſuch kind of perſons do proſper; as thoſe other changelings never proſpered in body, ſo theſe never proſper in eſtate, God gives a ſecret curſe unto them, that nothing that they have ſhall proſper with them: But they are like a man in a conſumption, howſoever he may bolſter up himſelfe for a time with Phyſicke and Diet-drinkes, it will kill him in the end: ſo he that is in a ſpirituall <hi>Atrophy,</hi> a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall conſumption, that is fallen from God, hee may goe on and hold out for a time, but it will undoe him in the end. Iuſt according to the ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Ionas, Chap.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>They that follow after lying vanities, forſake their owne mercy:</hi> that is, they wilfully deprive themſelves of that mercy and proſperite, which if they had cleaved and ſtucke unto God, they might have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:21224:27"/>
beene as ſure of, as if it had beene their owne to beſtow upon themſelves, and that was King <hi>Vzziahs</hi> caſe.</p>
                  <p>For our ſelves therefore (to draw to an end) if wee deſire to goe on and proſper as wee have begun, that there may be no decay, no declining, no abatement, either in our pietie or in our proſperity, either in our inward graces or in our outward fortunes; let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for two things which King <hi>Vzziah</hi> wanted, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and humility.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, labour for ſincerity, be the ſame inwardly to God-ward, that you ſeeme to be outwardly to the world-ward, be like the curtaines of the Tabernacle, which they ſay were ſo wrought, that they were on both ſides alike; ſo be you alike on both ſides, in heart to the Lord, and in life to the world, elſe there is no hope of continuance; for <hi>nil fictum est dutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> nothing that is counterfeit, will laſt long; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Pearls &amp; Diamonds may gliſter and ſparkle, and make a faire ſhew for a time, but their luſtre will not laſt; ſo where there is only an outward forme of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and not the inward power of it, it cannot laſt long. If an apple be rotten at the core, though it have a fai e outſide, it will not continue ſo long, but rottenneſſe will poſſeſſe the outſide alſo; for this is the nature of things that are unſound, they ſt ay not there where the rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe began, but they putrifie and corrupt more and more: ſo thoſe that have rotten hearts to God-ward, may carry a faire ſhew for a time, but in the end the curſe of God will come upon them; and their very name ſhall rot, that is, their hypocriſie ſhall be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and their outſide made as rotten as their inſide: Beware therefor of hyrocriſie and labour for ſincerity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, pray for humility, that was another grace that King <hi>Vzziah</hi> wanted; it is ſaid of him, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21224:28"/>
of this <hi>Chap.</hi> That God helped him till he was ſtrong, and when hee was ſtrong, his heart was lifted up to his deſtruction, this was a lamentable thing, that a man in proſperity ſhould be ſo ſwolne with pride that hee ſhould even burſt againe; take heed of that, you whom God hath exalted above your fellowes; the Giants in old time were the goodlieſt men in the world, yet they are called in hebrew <hi>Naphilem</hi> of <hi>Naphel,</hi> to fall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as by their pride and preſumption they fell from God, ſo God in his juſtice tumbled them downe, that they fell without recovery into the pit of hell; thus (as the ſaying is) pride will have a fall, but humility ſhall have a riſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 29. <hi>When men are caſt downe, then thou ſhalt ſay,</hi> &amp;c. When a man caſts downe himſelf in a voluntary humiliation, then God exalts and lifts him up, but when in a proud preſumption he exalts and lifts up himſelfe, then God dejects and caſts them down: it is a good meditation of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon the words of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 138. 6. <hi>The Lord is on high and he beholdeth the lowly,</hi> &amp;c. ſee a ſtrange wonder (ſaith hee) <hi>God</hi> ſits aloft in heaven, and yet the higher a man lifts up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the further he is from <hi>God;</hi> the lower a man caſts downe himſelfe, the neerer he is to <hi>God.</hi> I will cloſe up all with that divine <hi>Epiphonema</hi> of holy <hi>Bernard: Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus deus, qui das gratiam humilibus, da gratiam ut ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In which words I will obſerve two generall parts, which may be reduced to two heads, and be thus expreſt. 1. <hi>Diſciplina pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> the diſcipline of peace, and that is to learne to be Content. 2. <hi>Pax diſciplinae,</hi> the peace of the diſcipline, or the profit of this learning, and that is, It armes a man and enables him to comply with all eſtates whatſoever. <hi>I have learned in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtate I am, therewith to be Content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Diſciplina pacis,</hi> the diſcipline of peace, ſo the Scripture termes it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 5. <hi>The diſcipline of our peace was upon him.

And to ſay the truth, A man can never attaine to a well-ſetled peace, nor grow up to a well-grounded contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till he have beene ſome way diſciplined by the hand of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8 it is ſaid of our Saviour, Though he were a Sonne (the onely begotten Sonne of God, full of grace and truth) yet he learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered: not that he was diſobedient before he ſuffered; but the meaning is, though he had the habite of obedience before, hee never learned the practiſe of it till then. For this leſſon of contentment is juſt like your leſſons of Muſicke, a man can never be ſaid to have learned them till he be able to practiſe them, for you muſt know that Chriſtians are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Some are <hi>ſilveſtres,</hi> or <hi>onagri,</hi> like wilde unruly Aſſes (ſo the Scripture termes them) <hi>Ioh</hi> 11, 12. I mean, unhumbled, untamed, unconverted ſinners, that never yet felt the Yoke of Chriſt, nor the hand of God, nor the heavineſſe of a wounded conſcience: theſe know no other Content, but what their ſports, their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke and merry company affords them; which is juſt ſuch a kind of Content as they that have the Itch doe take in clawing and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21224:34"/>
ſcratching their bodies, which pleaſeth them infinitely for the preſent, but makes them the ſorer and the rawer, and the worſer afterwards: For ſo all ſinfull pleaſure ends in paine, and if there be not <hi>Ingrata recordatio,</hi> an unpleaſing, a diſcontenting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of all ſuch pleaſing contenting vanities, the ſoule will rue for it in another place. Theſe may fitly be compared to the Lillies (which our Saviour ſpeakes of in the Goſpel, ſaying that <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his glory came not neere them) now the Lilly as long as it is faire, whole, and untoucht, it lookes beautifull, and ſmells pleaſantly; but let it be never ſo little nipt, or bruſed, or cruſht in a mans hand, it lookes ugly, and ſmells worſe: ſuch are all your joviall Gallants, and laſcivious youngſters, as long as they are healthfull and ſound and aile nothing, their onely care is to give themſelves content, by hunting and hawking, by dicing and carding, by drinking and drabbing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. <hi>ſico ſic juvat vivere,</hi> to ſome mens thinking, no ſuch contenting life in the world as theirs: till theſe men fall into the hands of God (as ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſhall ſurely fall) and God doth begin to nip them and bruſe and cruſh them in his hands with ſickneſſe of body, or ſorrowes of ſoule; alas, all their Content is vaniſht and gone, and they become like <hi>Naomi</hi> in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> neither pleaſing to themſelves nor others. Theſe contentments are worme-eaten like <hi>Ionas</hi> Gourd, that will faile a man when hee ſtands moſt in need of them, and theſe kind of men are farre from that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent which my Text ſpeaketh of.</p>
                  <p>But there are another ſort of Chriſtians, and they are <hi>ſubacti,</hi> or <hi>Ablactati,</hi> mortified, ſubdued or weaned Chriſtians, ſuch as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. 2. <hi>I have behaved my ſelfe like a child that is weaned, yea my ſoule is as a weaned child.</hi> A childe that ſucks, his whole delight is to be nibling at the breſt, nothing quiets, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contents him but that; but let him once be throughly weaned, and then though you ſhew him never ſo goodly a breſt, abounding with never ſo luſcious milke, and flatter him never ſo much, you ſhall not get him to take it, nor to touch it; for then his content lies in another kind, it is ſomthing els muſt quiet him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not that: So it is with a mortified and an unmortified Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, nothing contents the one but the breſt of the world; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

And this is the <hi>medulla</hi> the pith and marrow of that Chriſtian contentation, which is begun upon earth, and never ends in heaven. This is ſuch a happineſſe that none can attaine unto, but onely they that are <hi>Cribrati Chriſtiani</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> termes them) ſifted Chriſtians, they that have beene winnowed and fanned, and ſifted (as it were) by Gods afflictions, by the devils temptations, and by the worlds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſes; they that have beene toſſed and tumbled and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the world, and have found by their owne experience, that there is no content to be had in any eſtate but onely from God, and that there is no eſtate but God may be had in, if a man will himſelfe; theſe are they that have learned (with S. <hi>Paul) in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtate they are, therewith to be content.</hi> And ſo I come more nearely to the firſt principall part of my Text, wherein are three remarkable points to be obſerved.</p>

1. <hi>Singularitas perſonae,</hi> I have learned. Some may happily conceit that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes but this of his owne particular, that he for his part had learned to be Content, not that it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition of every privat Chriſtian to be thus qualified, thus contented: <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle (and you know hee was a great Apoſtle, <hi>Apoſtolus per Antonomaſian</hi> called by the name of <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> in all our quotations of him) I ſay, as he was an Apoſtle he had his <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, his peculiar gifts and graces proper to himſelfe, not attaineable nor imitable by us: but that he ſpeakes here, he ſpeakes it as a Chriſtian, as a Convert, as a contented man, and that a grace thats common to every true beleever. The Scripture ſpeakes of a <hi>Common faith, Tit.</hi> 1. 4. becauſe it is common to all the faithfull; and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of a <hi>Common ſalvation, Iude</hi> 3. becauſe it is common to all that ſhall be ſaved; which yet every Chriſtian muſt labour to make proper to himſelfe: ſo may this be called a <hi>Commmon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,</hi> becauſe it is ſuch as every common Chriſtian muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to himſelfe, and is bound in conſcience to learne and practiſe for his owne particular, for the comfort and diſcharge of his owne ſoule in the ſight of God. It is worth your obſervation that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 40. 6. where he ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>In the volume of thy booke it is written of me, that I ſhould do thy will;</hi> O <hi>my God I am content to do it:</hi> now let a man reade over the whole volume of Gods booke, he ſhall not find that tis written of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that he by name ſhould doe the will of God more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man. Why then doth <hi>David</hi> affirme this of himſelfe? Ile tell you what I thinke the reaſon may be: <hi>David</hi> found in the volume of Gods booke that it was thus written of men of his ranke and quality of Kings, Prophets, &amp;c. that they ſhould have a ſpeciall care to do the will of God, and to be exemplary in their lives to others, and this doth <hi>David</hi> appropriate and apply to himſelfe in particular as if it had beene thus written of him and none elſe but him. In like manner, when you reade in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of this booke that it is thus written of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he had learned to be Content, you muſt know that it is your caſe as well as his, and that you for your parts have as good cauſe, and as great reaſon (as ever <hi>David</hi> had) to apply this writing to your
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21224:36"/>
ſelves, and ſay for your owne particular <hi>It is written of me, that I ſhould be content, O my God J am content to be ſo.</hi> It was good counſell that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> gave to <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 27. <hi>Heare this, and know it for thy good,</hi> (ſo we tranſlate it) but in Hebrew it is <hi>(dang-lecha) know it for thy ſelfe.</hi> It is not enough for a man to know this in generall, that ſuch a thing muſt be, that every man muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his eſtate, becauſe God will have it ſo; but a man muſt apply this knowledge to himſelfe in particular, and labour to work himſelf to ſuch an <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ſuch an inward tranquillity and contentedneſſe of mind, that nothing that God ſends may come amiſſe to him. As S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of Almes, <hi>Qui vult ordinatè eleemoſynas dare, deb et a ſeipſo incipere;</hi> He that will give Almes in a right and orderly manner muſt begin with himſelfe. How is that? <hi>Mendicat a te anima tua, eſurit juſtitian,</hi> &amp;c. Thy owne ſoule lies begging of thee, it hungers after righteouſnes, it thirſts after grace, its naked and wounded for want of ſpirituall cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and comfort; firſt begin with thy own ſoule, cheriſh that, comfort that, ſave and ſuccour that, ſhew mercy firſt to thy ſelfe, then ſhalt thou the better know and underſtand how to ſhew mercy and pitty to the bodies and ſoules of others. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, He that would go the right way to true Contentment, muſt begin with himſelfe, firſt ſtudy his owne peace, ſubdue his own paſſions, quiet his owne mind, and content his owne ſoule; and when he hath done ſo, he may then happily make his own plaſter ſerve another ſores, and comfort others with the ſame conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith himſelf hath formerly been comforted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: but that can he never doe, till he be able to ſay of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, what S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth in my text: How ever others be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>I</hi> (for my part) <hi>have learned to be content.</hi> So much for the firſt particular, which is <hi>ſingularitas perſonae,</hi> the propriety of the perſon, <gap reason="foreign">

For as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid of Poetry that it was a profeſſion for all times, proſperity and adverſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for all ages, youth and old age; for all places, at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: ſo is this a leſſon for all times, all ages, and all places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and happy are they that have learned it aforehand, that they may not be to ſeeke when they ſhall ſtand moſt in neede of it, but have a ſalve in readineſſe for every ſore. Was not that a ſad and a lamentable diſtreſſe, that the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were driven to, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>That in the day of battell there was neither ſword nor ſpeare found in the hand of any of the people, ſave onely in the hand of Saul and Ionathan:</hi> how did thoſe unarmed people <hi>(inermes in armis)</hi> tremble and quake to meete their enemies in the faces.

You know, that which muſt keepe a ſhip ſtiffe and ſteddy on the ſea, muſt not be levers and ſhores without it but weight and ballaſt within it: ſo that, that muſt keepe a mans mind and conſcience ſteddy and upright, that it doe not <hi>vacil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare</hi> ſtagger and reele to and fro like a drunken man (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes) it is not wealth and meanes without a man, but grace and godlineſſe and contentment within him; A man ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet in his mind, never ſetled in his conſcience, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes toſſed and turmoiled with doubts and cares and feares, till he hath learned this leſſon of the bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>In whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtate he is, therewith to be content.</hi>

for this very thing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 8. that holy man knew that if the world afforded any perfect contentment, it was in a middle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, equally diſtant from penury and from exceſſe: he knew it was a hard matter for a man that is either very poore or very rich, to live contentedly: therefore he deſired of God to give him neither poverty nor riches, but to feede him with food convenient for him. That God would grant him ſuch an indifferent, ſuch a midling eſtate, that he might neither be ſo poore as to be deſpiſed, nor ſo rich as to be envied, but onely ſo happy as to be contented: this was the ſumme and ſubſtance of his prayer. Give mee leave, I beſeech you, to make a little digreſſion upon it; I hope it ſhall be no tranſgreſſion, neither to your patience, nor to my purpoſe, becauſe it is ſo agreeable and ſutable to my text.

                  <p>The firſt extreame, or enemie to contentment, is Poverty, though it pleaſe God to lay poverty upon ſome men (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) for their ſoules good; that by being poore in purſe they may learne to be poore in ſpirit, that ſo being wretched one way, they may come to be bleſſed another way: <hi>for bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit, Mat.</hi> 5.

Such is the corrupt heart of man, if Satan can but once faſten that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked roote of covetouſneſſe in a mans heart, &amp; water it as he will with ſuggeſtions, tis wonderful how it wil ſpread and grow and encreaſe continually more and more. Or ſecondly, ſome ſay it is called the Roote, becauſe it is with a man as with a tree in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ther's ſap and life in the roote, when ther's little or none to be ſeene in the branches. So in old and froſty age, when other vices and luſts decay, then covetouſneſſe holds life in the roote, and a man will be covetous when he hath not ſtrength to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayes vitious. But why is it called <hi>the Roote of all evill,</hi> for tis not the roote of prodigality, ryot, &amp;c. I take it, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, of all gainefull evils; if ſo be that ryot and prodigality were as gainefull evils as baſeneſſe and miſery, a covetous man would be as inclineable to the one as to the other.

                  <p>You have heard the two extreames of this vertue (Poverty and Riches) now the meane is that where true contentment reſts, that is, when God fits a man with ſuch an eſtate as is moſt meete, and moſt convenient for him <hi>(feed mee with food convenient for me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Agur,)</hi> when a mans heart and his eſtate doe <hi>convenire,</hi> doe meete, and agree and comply in one, ther's the contentment that my text ſpeakes of: when God faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a mans heart to his meanes, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 13, 14, 15. <hi>The Lord looketh downe from his habitation, upon the men of the earth, and he faſhioneth their hearts every one of them;</hi> as a ſute of cloathes is fitted to a mans body, ſo doth God faſhion a good mans heart to his eſtate, and makes it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, ſit and convenient for him, and this is it that gives him content: for when there is an unſutableneſſe, a diſproportion, a diſagreement, betwixt a mans minde and his meanes, he can have no content, no comfort in it; as we ſee by <hi>Ahab,</hi> and by <hi>Haman,</hi> and divers others, who wanted for no meanes, yet becauſe their hearts did not <hi>Convenire</hi> did not comply and agree with their eſtates, ſee how diſcontentedly they lived and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I anſwer, there is no way but one, and that's it my Text ſpeakes of, onely to learne <hi>to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> But yet there is a courſe to be taken for that, and it is this. <hi>David</hi> tells us in the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that it is God that maketh them that are in one houſe to be of one heart: if therefore any diſcontent ariſe in a family, the onely way is to have recourſe to heaven by humble and earneſt prayer, and God will worke a peace twixt man and wife. Wee ſee in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> as long as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> lived at one with God, they lived at one among themſelves; but ſo ſoone as they were divided from God by ſin, they became divided among themſelves by diſcord; <hi>Adam</hi> falls a blaming of <hi>Eve</hi> and accuſing her to God, in whom before he rejoyced as bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh: So marke it where you will, ſeldome doe man and wife fall out among themſelves, but firſt they are fallen out with God, and ſeldome agree except God hath a hand in it. The Hebrewes obſerve that Gods Name <hi>(Ichovah)</hi> and mans and womans name <hi>(Iſh</hi> and <hi>Iſhah)</hi> begin both with one and the ſame letter; now if you takeout the firſt letter of Gods name from a mans and womans name, nothing remaines but <hi>Eſh</hi> which ſignifieth fire. This is the true reaſon why there is ſo much fire, I meane ſo much unkinde and unnaturall flames of contention betwixt man and wife, onely becauſe God is left out, the Lord is not betweene them. Therefore the onely way to bring peace and unity into a family, is to bring God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the family; and the onely way to bring God into a houſe, is to bring him and draw him in by prayer. Draw neare to God, and God will draw neare to you (ſaith S. <hi>Iames.)</hi> Be not you wanting to God, and God will never be wanting to you; Alwayes remember the Apoſtles farewell to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For the firſt, ſay that Almighty God, who hath <hi>Ius vitae &amp; necis,</hi> the power of life and death in his owne hands, and can draw out, and cut ſhort our lives as it pleaſeth him, doe cut off thy child in the budding, in the blooming of his age, when he is, <hi>Aurorae filius</hi> (as the Poet ſpeakes) a ſonne of the morning, ſo that all thy joy, thy hope, thy comfort, ſeemes to periſh and die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be extinguiſht in him: yet learne to be content, for why?

But who can tell whether ſuch a child be ſaved or no, if I were but ſure of that (wil ſome ſay) I ſhould be the better content: though I know a good parent will abhorre ſuch a thought of doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet for the better ſetling of your minds in that aſſurance, doe but call to minde our Saviours ſaying, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, for unto ſuch belongeth the Kingdome of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> it is not only ſaid that they belong to Gods kingdome, but that Gods kingdome belongs to them, (as much as to ſay) if any have a right unto it, or may claime a part or portion in it, it is ſuch or none: in the Originall it is, <gap reason="foreign">

As <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene, Matth.</hi> 27. 32. ſubmitted himſelfe to beare the croſſe of Chriſt, becauſe hee was <hi>Angariatus</hi> compelled and forced to it (as the Text ſheweth:) this is a thankeleſſe and fruitleſſe contentment, <hi>virtus nolentium nulla eſt:</hi> God takes no pleaſure in forced pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; patience perforce hath ſmall thankes with God. But it is the <hi>voluntary contentment</hi> which proceeds <hi>ab intrinſeco</hi> from an inward working of grace, from that ſame <hi>free ſperit</hi> that <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. when a man doth voluntarily, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and of his owne accord endeavour to worke himſelfe to an <gap reason="foreign">

utter diſagreement betwixt them: then to be content without conſtraint, is thanke worthy with God. You ſee by experience, A man that comes to an Inne, if hee can get a better lodging and better attendance, he will; if he cannot, yet he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it; for why? Hee conſiders it is but for a night and hee is gone: thus wee come into the world as it were into an Inne, which is a place of paſſage, no place of abode; if we can get a better eſtate or a better condition, uſe it in Gods name; if not, yet <hi>learne to be content,</hi> for why? it is but for a night, for a ſhort ſpace, and you are gone. And ſo I come to the laſt caſe of all, and that is,</p>

In like manner, when a preacher comes into the congregation, and delivers his meſſage indefinitely to the whole aſſembly, thou muſt know that his errand is to thee, he comes with a meſſage ſent from God to thee, and thou muſt impropriate it to thy ſelfe, as if it pertained to none but thee: for this is that which fruſtrates all our ſermons, and makes all our preaching voyd and uneffectuall, becauſe men take our meſſages to be errands ſent from heaven to others,

                  <p>Furthermore, it is worth your noting, to ſee the conſtant diſpoſition of this holy man. <hi>Eliah</hi> was well knowne to be a hot ſpirited man in all his actions, exceeding zealous and earneſt in all his reprehenſions, both of the King, and of the people. Now here you may obſerve the equability the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Eliahs</hi> zeale; as he was earneſt in his reprehenſions, ſo he was as earneſt in his devotions; and as zealous in his prayers, as he was in his anger. There is many a man hot and fiery in his anger, but cold and luke-warme in prayers; ſuch zeale is never right. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>It is good to be alwayes earneſt in a good thing.</hi>

When a mans zeale is equable (like <hi>Eliahs)</hi> then it is right and pleaſing to God.</p>
                  <p>As Phyſitians judge of the ſtate of a mans body, <hi>Vniverſalia ſalutaria, particularia ex morb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>;</hi> as thus: if a man be hot in one part and cold in another; if the palmes of his hands burne, and the ſoles of his feet be key-cold, then all is not right; but if he be of an indifferent equall heate all over, that held a good ſigne of good health in the body. By the like rule, judge thou of the ſtate of thy ſoule, if thy zeale be equable and uniforme both in prayer and in anger, it is a good ſigne of grace and ſanctification in thy heart; but if it vary and differ, that there is too much heate in the one, too little in the other; all is not well within. It was the reaſon which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21224:82"/>
old Father <hi>Latimer</hi> gave, why men in theſe dayes doe not prevaile with God in their prayers, as <hi>Eliah</hi> and ſuch others had done in former times, <hi>Deeſt ignis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deeſt ignis, There lackes fire, there lackes fire;</hi> his meaning is, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers want that zeale, that heate, that earneſtneſſe, which they put into theirs. For as Incenſe without fire yeelds no ſmell, no more doth prayer without zeale and earneſtneſſe; and as Hony is no Hony, if it have loſt its ſweetneſſe; and Vinegar is no Vinegar, if it have loſt its ſharpeneſſe; ſo Prayer is no Prayer, if it be void of earneſtneſſe. <hi>Eliah</hi> prayed indeede, becauſe he prayed earneſtly.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to the ſubject, and matter of his Prayer which (I told you) was firſt for a judgement, and then for a bleſſing, firſt for a drought, and then for raine, as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>He prayed earneſtly that it might not raine, and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three yeares and ſixe moneths.</hi> Here are two weighty points to be conſidered. 1. What ſhould move <hi>Eliah</hi> to pray for a judgement. 2. Why hee made choiſe to pray for this kind of judgement, of drought and dearth, rather then for any other. I will tell you my opinion of both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Vpon what ground, or by what warrant did <hi>Eliah</hi> pray for a judgement.

The Husbandman in the Parable entreates his Maſter for the unfruitfull tree, that hee would ſpare it and not cut it downe, and doth <hi>Eliah</hi> differ from all the reſt, and bend his prayers againſt the people, and pray for the vexation and undoing of his Countrey? How
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21224:83"/>
could this ſtand with that good Religion, and that good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which ſo holy a man ſhould beare towards the people of God? Anſw. Three things there are (in my weake judgement) that may ſeeme to warrant and beare out <hi>Eliah</hi> in praying for a judgement.</p>

The moſt terribble wonders that ever our Saviour did, were but two, and thoſe no wayes prejudicious to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or life of any man, woman, or childe. The one was his <hi>curſing</hi> and blaſting of the <hi>barren Figge-tree;</hi> and this was but ſymbolicall, not done in any ſpleene to the poore tree; but onely to ſhew his indignation againſt all <hi>unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profeſſion;</hi> when men make an outward ſhew of piety to God; but when the poore and hungry come to them (as Chriſt came to that Figtree) hoping to pull ſome fruite of charity and mercy from them, there is nothing to be found but leaves, good words perhaps, and that is all: beleeve it, ſuch men are nigh unto curſing, and it is Gods infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, if hee doe not blaſt their eſtate (as Chriſt did the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree) that it ſhall never proſper to them nor theirs. The other wonder of Chriſt that did any hurt, was that, <hi>Mat. Chapter</hi> eight. <hi>The drowning of the Swine,</hi> and yet that was the devils doing, Chriſt onely gave way to theſe evill ſpirits (which ſeeke the deſtruction of man and beaſt) to carry them headlong into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Theſe are the two ſevereſt wonders that ever our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did, or ſuffered to be done; as for all the reſt (looke into the Stories of the Goſpel, which are the Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Ieſus Chriſt) you ſhall finde to be all gracious, all beneficiall, all healing and ſaving wonders. Never any man came to him for ſight, that went away blind; never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny came to him for hearing, that went away deafe; never any came to him for health, that went away ſicke. In a word, you ſhall never finde that ever any man or woman came to our Saviour for any help or mercy, that ever went away confounded or diſappointed of their hopes. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the ſame <hi>Ieſus</hi> ſtill, that then he was: <hi>Coelum non animum</hi> (as we ſay) though he have changed his place, he hath not changed his nature, but is ſtill as favourable, as indulgent to mankind as ever he was, if we doe but as truly ſeeke unto him for our ſoules health, as they did for their bodies.</p>
                  <p>So you ſee the nature of theſe wonders is altered from that they were in <hi>Eliahs</hi> times: the ſeverity of the Law ſuites not with the lenity of the Goſpel; and we muſt now imitate our Saviour in works of mercy, &amp; not follow <hi>Eliah</hi> in prayers for judgment. We ſee, <hi>Luk</hi> 9. 54. When the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fingers itched to be revenged on the <hi>Samaritans</hi> for their baſe diſcourteſie in not entertaining our Saviour; <hi>Maſter,</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>wilt thou that we command fire from heaven, and conſume them, as Eliah did?</hi> We have a preſident for it, it is a booke caſe, <hi>Eliah</hi> did ſo, let us doe the like, theſe men deſerve it, as bad or worſe than they with whom <hi>Eliah</hi> had to doe: <hi>No,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, the caſe is altered) <hi>ye know not of what ſpirit ye are;</hi> the ſpirit of the Law required ſeverity, the ſpirit of the Goſpel requires meekeneſſe and mercy. Farre is it from the good Spirit of Chriſt and of God to ſtirre up any mans heart to private revenge; not an Eagle, but a Dove was the ſhape wherein that holy and healthfull Spirit made choiſe to appeare. Let us therefore all that are called Chriſtians, follow no other preſident, but

                  <p>The third and laſt reaſon that may warrant <hi>Eliah</hi> in praying for a judgement, was,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Neceſſitas rei, the neceſſity of the thing it ſelf;</hi> that holy Prophet had ſpent his ſtrength in vaine, Sermon upon Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, warning upon warning, threatning upon threatning; and when he ſaw that nothing would worke them to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then he prayes for a judgement; not in a vindictive way to be revenged upon them, but as a deſperate remedy, knowing that, that or nothing would bring them to good, as it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Chron. ult.</hi> God ſent his Prophets, <hi>riſing early and ſending them,</hi> and uſed all gentle meanes to reclaime them, <hi>till there was no remedy,</hi> then he ſent deſtruction.

                  <p>Vpon theſe and the like grounds, I ſuppoſe <hi>Eliah</hi> might with a ſafe conſcience pray for a judgement: but then the next queſtion is, Why hee ſhould make choiſe to pray for this kinde of judgement, of drought and dearth, for want of raine; rather than any other.

When they had ſeene all the miracles and wonders of Chriſt, how hee cured the ſicke, &amp;c. they conceited that theſe things might be done by ſlight of hand, by art Magicke, by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> or by Conjuration, &amp;c but (ſay they) <hi>Shew us aſigne from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and then we will beleeve.</hi> They knew that a Magician or a devill might doe much upon earth, but he could doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in heaven; therefore (ſay they) <hi>ſhew us a ſigne from Heaven and we will beleeve.</hi> So here to prevent all miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites <hi>Elias</hi> prayed and procures a judgement from heaven; and that a convincing a cutting judgement; for you muſt know that the people at that time left off to worſhip the true God, and fell to worſhip <hi>Baall,</hi> the Sunne, the Moone, and all the Hoaſt of Heaven: truſting no doubt that theſe gods of theirs, would by their influence ſo moyſten and fatten the earth, that they ſhould not need to be beholding to God for any rayne: now (quoth <hi>Eliah)</hi> here is a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to try your gods withall, goe to the gods that ye have ſerved, let them helpe now or never, if they can doe any thing, they can ſend a ſhowre of rayne, if not, why doe ye ſerve them? I ſay it was a convincing judgement. <hi>Eliah</hi> did it on purpoſe, to let them ſee the vileneſſe of their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, what baſe, what impotent, what unworthy gods they ſerved, that could not helpe their clyents to a drop of raine. In like manner, whatſoever a man makes his god, beſides the true one; I meane, puts his truſt in, for helpe in time of neede; ſhall at length ſo deceive him, and ſo befoole him, that he ſhall be forced to confeſſe, as theſe people did in the end; <hi>The Lord he is God, The Lord he is God.</hi>

people were guilty of ſpirituall barrenneſſe, and God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued them with temporall barrenneſſe. No Nation under heaven was ſo husbanded, and manured of God, ſo watered with the dewes of heaven, I meane, with the meanes of grace and ſalvation, as they were, and yet none more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful in every good work: Now therefore <hi>Eliah</hi> fits them with a judgement ſutable and agreeable to their ſinne: hee prayes to God that it might not raine, that ſo their lands might be anſwerable to their lives, and their ſoyles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as barren as their ſoules. Thus it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleaſeth God many times to pay men in their owne coyne, to come home to them in their owne kinde, and to fit his puniſhments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſinnes. That as they that ſinne in their goods, by miſgetting miskeeping, and miſpending them, are many times puniſhed in their goods, by loſſes, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, by fire, by water, &amp;c. And as they that ſinne in their children, by miſloving, or miſnurturing them, are oft times puniſhed in their children, as <hi>David</hi> was in <hi>Abſolom</hi> and <hi>Adonijah;</hi> ſo they that ſinne in their lands; it is juſt with God to puniſh them in their lands: <hi>Salomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 4. that <hi>the plowing of a wicked man is ſinne.</hi> That is ſtrange; the husbandry and tillage of the ground is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held to be one of the moſt honeſt, the moſt innocent, the moſt harmeleſſe callings in the world; and ſo it is of it ſelfe; and yet we ſee, when a wicked man takes the plow in hand; when a man goes to his plow with an ill minde, and an ill conſcience, his very plowing addes to his ſinnes. And it is juſt with God, that that land which is plowed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhould thrive accordingly, and become as bad and as barren as the owner. <hi>A fruitfull land doth God make barren, for the wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein.</hi>

Even ſuch is the diſpoſition of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man of the earth (as <hi>David</hi> termes earthly-minded men) they doe not value nor care to be curſed from heaven, to be excommunicated out of the favour of God, and out of the bleſſed company of all faithfull people (which cenſure of excomunication if it be rightly carried with a <hi>Clave non errante</hi> (as the Schoolemen ſpeake) when there is no errour committed in the uſe of the Keyes, is one of the greateſt puniſhments under heaven.) But carnall men are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this, and therefore God will puniſh them in that wherein they are ſenſible, in their wives and children, in their corne and cattell, &amp;c. in ſuch things as are neereſt and deareſt to them: as when <hi>David</hi> ſlung his ſtone at <hi>Goliah,</hi> if he had ſtrucke him upon any part of his harneſſe, he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt the blow, but ſtriking him (as he did) in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which was naked and tender, that ſunke him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: ſo it is with carnall men, for ſpirituall judgements, they are harneſſed, their hearts are hardned, their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſeared, they have (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>By the way, if any man deſire to know the reaſon, why God is not thus marvelous in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as he was in <hi>Eliah,</hi> and thoſe other Prophets of the Law; why we that are his Evangelicall Prophets cannot doe ſuch wonders in our dayes, as they did in theirs?

When a ſoule is ſicke to the death, with a ſurfeit of ſinne, is recovered and revived againe by that ſame healthfull ſpirit of grace, which God together with his Word doth breathe into the ſoule, it is ſo great a marvell, ſo rare a wonder, that the Angels of heaven rejoyce to ſee it.</p>
                  <p>I have held you over-long in the former part of <hi>Eliahs</hi> prayer; which brought the judgment: heare now in a word or two, the Reverſing of the judgement, and I have done. <hi>[And he prayed again, &amp; the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her fruit.]</hi> It well becomes the Prophets of God to be mercifull; Good <hi>Eliah</hi> had not the heart to hold the people too long under a judgement, when hee ſaw hee had done enough to humble them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he deſires God to reverſe the judgement.

Thus did <hi>Eliah</hi> with this people; thus did <hi>Moſes</hi> with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that good man had not the heart to hold wicked <hi>Pharoah</hi> alway under a judgement, but upon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21224:89"/>
the leaſt entreaty made ſuit to God to reverſe it. So dealt the Prophet with <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13. 6. when he had ſmitten him with a judgment, and had him at the advantage, that his hand was withered, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was glad to ſubmit and ſay, <hi>Intreate now the face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be reſtored me:</hi> the man of God had not the heart to deny him, but immediatly, beſought the Lord, and the Kings hand was reſtored, and became as it was before. When a judgement comes, then Prophets are in ſeaſon. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is better than a King in this caſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 7. &amp; 17. <hi>Reſtore the man his own, for he is a Prophet, and he ſhall pray for thee;</hi> and ver. 17. <hi>Abraham prayed unto God, and God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Abimeleeh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.

When <hi>Peter</hi> had denounced a curſe on <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he was glad to crouch and cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Oh pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of theſe things which ye have ſpoken come upon me.</hi> Thus ye ſee that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and plagues will bring Prophets into requeſt: men commonly deale with their Miniſters, as boyes do by Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-trees, and other fruit-trees, in faire weather throw cudgels at us, in foule runne to us for ſhelter. In the dayes of peace and proſperity we are paſt over as ſuperfluous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of whom there is little uſe, and leſſe neede: but when the wrath of God falls on the naked ſoule, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is wounded within, and body pained without, then the Miniſter is thought on. I ſay no more, if you deſire their prayers, and that God ſhould heare them praying for you in your extremity, do not ſlight them, doe not wrong them in proſperity. Remember how <hi>Ahab</hi> and all Iſrael were glad to be beholden to <hi>Eliah</hi> to reverſe their judgment; and you doe not know how ſoone the caſe may be your owne: therefore as you love your ſoules, love thoſe that have charge of them.</p>

Therefore if thou ſtandeſt in neede of any temporall mercy, pray firſt for converſion, and all other good things ſhall be ſuper-added and throwne in unto thee; or if thou prayeſt for any child, or for any friend to doe him good indeed, pray for his converſion, and thou prayeſt for every thing: that one prayer is <hi>inſtar omnium, inſteed of all the reſt.</hi> If hee be in an ill way, deſire God to bring him backe, and for future things take no care.</p>

Here then (in a word) is the ready way to prevaile with God, either for raine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or for faire weather, or for any temporall bleſſing whatſoever, to doe as <hi>Eliah</hi> did, buckle our very heads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our knees, I meane, proſtrate our ſelves before the face of God, in the humbleſt, in the lowlieſt, in the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected manner, that we can device, and if any meanes under heaven will fetch downe mercy from heaven, that will doe it. <hi>Eliah</hi> prayed againe, and the heavens gave raine, and the earth brought forth her fruit.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE laſt time I was in this place, I preached you a Summer-Sermon (out of <hi>Eliahs</hi> prayer, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 17.) it being then a time of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heate and drought; I am now come up (through Gods mercifull preſervation) to preach you a <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Sermon,</hi> ſuch as the extremity of the weather, and the miſery of the waies hath even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced me to fall upon, beſides my purpoſe and intention; that ſo, by a kinde of ſpirituall <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> your ſoules may receive ſome warmth within, whiles your bodies are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21224:94"/>
encompaſſed with ſo much cold without, for this end, I have made choiſe of ſuch a text, as will teach us to make good uſe of all manner of winter weather; whether it be ſnow, or froſt, or Ice, or floods, or what ever elſe it be, there is ſtill ſome good uſe to be made of it, if men had but grace to apply their mindes and hearts unto it.</p>
                  <p>Which that you may the better doe, be pleaſed to obſerue with me foure generall points, which may bee reduced to foure ſeverall heads, and be thus expreſſed. 1. The provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, or the care that God hath to cloath and keepe warme the very earth as it were with a Garment of wooll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>(dat nivem ſicut lanam, He giveth ſnow like wooll)</hi> 2. The diligence of God (if I may ſo terme it) that in the cold and bitter evenings, when we are cloſe and warme by the fire, or when wee are at reſt and warme in our beds, then is our God abroad at worke, ſprinkling and ſcattering the hoary or the aſhy froſt for the health and welfare both of man and beaſt <hi>(ſpargit pruinam ſicut cinerem, he ſcattereth or ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the hoary froſt like aſhes.)</hi> 3. The ſeverity of God, whereby hee returneth men the ſame meaſure which they themſelves have mete unto others: becauſe for the moſt part mens <hi>morſels are like Ice,</hi> that is, they come hardly, and coldly, and cruelly from them, to the poore and hungry; therefore God comes home to them in their owne kinde, and payes them (as it were) with their owne coyne, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves them <hi>Ice like morſells,</hi> to be both a remembrance, &amp; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of their miſerable Inhoſpitalitie <hi>(proijcit glaciem ſuam ſicut buccellas, He caſteth forth his Ice like moſells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> 4. Laſtly, ſee the goodneſſe and the tender mercy of God; that when God ſeeth the weather is growne to that extremity, that people are not able to abide his cold, then he hath compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon mens infirmities, and (as it followeth in the text) <hi>emittit verbum, &amp; liquefacit &amp;c. Hee ſendeth out his word and melteth them, he bloweth with his winde, &amp; the waters flow.</hi> Theſe bee the ſeverall parts and branches of my text, of each whereof, I will endeavour to ſpeake, as briefly, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21224:94"/>
as effectually as God and his good ſpirit ſhall enable mee. And firſt of the providence of God in cloathing the very earth.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Dat nivem ſicut lanam, He giveth ſnow like woll.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt thing I obſerve from hence is this, that the ſnow doth not onely come by the courſe of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, or by the coldneſſe of the Climate, or by the vertue of any ſecondary meanes and cauſes; but it is <hi>Donum Dei, the gift of God;</hi> The ſame God that gave us theſe ſoules, is he that gives us theſe ſnowes, to bee a covering and a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the naked earth: farre bee it from us therefore to murmure or repine, or thinke our ſelves agreeved with God for ſending us ſuch ſnowie weather, to hinder our husbandry, to pinch our cattell, and to ſpend our ſtover, &amp;c. but let us learne of <hi>David,</hi> to give God the glory of all his gifts; and ſit downe and ſay as <hi>Elie</hi> did, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth him good,</hi> for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeemeth good to him, cannot but be good, how ever it ſeemes to us. Conſider (I beſeech you) wherefore is it, that the ſnow, and haile, and ſtorme and tempeſt are bidden and commanded to praiſe God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 8. and thinke with your ſelves, how or which way thoſe ſenceles inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate things can performe that honour to their maker, unles it bee by the Ejaculations and expreſſions of the heart and tongue of man, which is the onely <hi>Lyra animata</hi> the living harpe of God, to ſound forth his prayſes, and ſet forth his glory for all his gifts and benefits; Alaſſe thoſe liveleſſe creatures cannot doe it of themſelves, but they muſt doe it by us, or rather indeede it is we that are commanded to doe it for them. Wherefore elſe hath God given to man the uſe of the tongue with language and words to expreſſe himſelfe, which hee hath denied to all other creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, but onely that <hi>Man</hi> ſhould bee (as it were) <hi>The mouth</hi> of all his other creatures, to praiſe and glorifie God in their ſted, and in their behalfe. If any of us ſhall thinke much to do ſo little for our God, let us take heede that God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21224:95"/>
doe not doe by us, as hee threatned to doe by thoſe Prieſts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 2. Even to curſe our very bleſſings, and to make thoſe things which are bleſſings in themſelves, to bee little better then croſſes and curſes unto us. For God can give us bleſſings with ſuch a <hi>tang</hi> that the fruition ſhall differ little from the want, as he did to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when he gave them quailes; ſo God gives many a man children with ſo little grace, that they would have accounted it even a bleſſing to be barren: ſo God gives many a man wealth with ſo little comfort, that it had beene better for their ſoules, if they had begged their bread: ſo God can give us ſnow and raine with ſo little favour, that neither we, nor the earth ſhall receive any comfort or refreſhment by it. Therefore as we deſire to doe our ſelves good, and to have and to hold the good will of our heavenly father, that he ſhould proſper and bleſſe his bleſſings to us; then let us in no caſe withhold from God <hi>the Honour due unto his name,</hi> but returne him ſome glory for all his gifts; for what man will goe into a cold bed to warme it, but he lookes for warmth from it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: what man will give his friend a ring, but he hopes that he will weare it for his ſake, or give him a booke, but he hopes he will reade it for his ſake, or give him any token of love, but that he hopes he will accept it and keepe it for his ſake: and ſhall we thinke that God doth not looke for as much as this at our hands, when hee give us ſnow and froſts, &amp;c. beleeve it hee doth; and therefore if thou haſt beene defective this way, let me be thy monitour, to doe as <hi>Pharaohs Butler did, Gen.</hi> 41. 9. <hi>to call to minde thy fault this day;</hi> and to remember that it is thy part and duty to bleſſe God for all his bleſſings; as well for thoſe which thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeſt in common with others, (as good ayre, good wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.) as for thoſe that thou haſt in peculiar and proper to thy ſelfe; hath God given thee health? bleſſe him for it: hath he given thee wealth? bleſſe him for it; hath hee given thee children and friends, and peaceable dayes? bleſſe him for all theſe: but hath hee given thee his good
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21224:95"/>
word to inſtruct thee? Hath he given thee his good Spirit to comfort thee? Hath hee given thee his good grace to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keepe thy ſoule? Oh bleſſe him for this above all, for hee hath given thee with it, that which I pray God of his mercy to give us all. <hi>Health and ſalvation in Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So much for my firſt Obſervation, that the very Snow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, is <hi>Donum Dei, the gift of God.

Is it not ſtrange? that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Divines obſerve, that God was never called Lord in Scripture till he had created man, as you may ſee in the firſt of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>God created the heaven and earth;</hi> and <hi>God ſaid let there be light,</hi> &amp;c. only God without any other attribute; till he had made man, and then the text calls him the <hi>Lord God</hi> at every word, to intimate that God hath a ſpeciall Lordſhip and Dominion over man, and looks for more ſpeciall duty and ſervice from man, than from all

                  <p>Now theſe treaſures of grace are ſaid <hi>to be hid in Chriſt,</hi> not as <hi>Moſes</hi> body was hidden by the <hi>Angel,</hi> to the intent that it ſhould not be found; but as the <hi>woman</hi> in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. is ſaid to <hi>hide her leaven in the meale,</hi> that the vertue of it may be diffuſed and diſperſed into every bit of her bread.

                  <p n="1">1. For ſlipping, ſo the Fathers call the ſinnes of the godly by the name of <hi>Lapſus,</hi> ſlippings, becauſe (like men on Ice) they ſlipt and fell ere they were aware of it. And <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the men of this world, <hi>Pſa</hi> 73. <hi>that God hath ſet them in ſlippery places.</hi> Now a man that walkes in a ſlippery place, had neede walke very circumſpectly and very warily, leaſt he get a ſlip unawares that he cannot rciover himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt and danger: So the Apoſtle adviſeth all good Chriſtians to ſee that they <hi>walke Circumſpectly, Ephe.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>not as fooles, but as wiſe.</hi> A foole will venture to runne head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on the Ice, as if he were upon firme ground, but a wiſe man will be very circumſpect and wary, and take heede to every ſteppe hee takes, becauſe he knowes the danger. So ſhould a Chriſtian take heede to his wayes, and if he finde himſelfe going, that he is ready to ſlip and fall from God into any ſinne, or to be carried headlong by the ſtrength of his owne corruption, or other temptation into any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or wicked action; let him then call unto the Lord as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 117. <hi>ſuſtenta me, &amp;c. ſtay thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe;</hi> like a man ready to fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he prayes God to uphold and ſtay him up. For it is certaine, a man hath not any power of himſelfe to ſtay himſelfe, but that, as <hi>Hanna</hi> tels us in her ſong. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 9.

For breaking, many a one we have knowne and heard of, that have ventured confidently on the Ice upon the Thames till it hath broken under them, and they have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed irrecoverably; ſo have many made a great ſhew in the world, have beene in great dealings, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beene confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their fortunes, till the Ice hath broken, their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits have crackt, and they ſunke on a ſudden.

So whereſoever there is a veyne of truth, I meane, where the word of God is faithfully preached, there is <hi>vehiculum ſpiritus,</hi> an Artery for the ſpirit of God to accompany and goe along with it to mollifie and intenerate that ſame <hi>ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum ferreum</hi> (which the Prophet ſpeakes of) that <hi>Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>w</hi> of unbeliefe, and to make the word effectuall for the melting and thawing of the frozon hearts of ſinners. Now if you looke backe upon this kindly Thaw that God hath ſent us, after ſo long and lamentable a time of Snow and Ice and cold, you ſhall ſee in it a lively reſemblance of the inward and ſpirituall thaw and melting of a hardned heart, that hath beene frozen a long time in the dregges of ſinne, and beene utterly uncapable of any grade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untill ſuch
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21224:105"/>
time as God doth ſend out his Word and melteth him, and bloweth upon his ſoule with that ſame truely ſo called <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus favonius,</hi> that favourable winde of his holy Spirit that makes the waters of repenting teares fall downe from his eyes. I will but name the particulars and ſo conclude.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Thaw is alwayes accompanied with a change of weather; the skie which before was faire and cleare and bright, doth then grow cloudy and ſad and darke with fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie miſts and vapours, that a man hath no pleaſure to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in it. And thus it is with a repenting ſoule, when God ſends this Spirituall thaw, a man ſhall finde a change of weather in his heart, his joy will be changed into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, his mirth into melancholy, his ſongs and merry tunes, into ſighes and ſobbes, and hee ſhall ſenſibly perceive the foggy vapours of his ſinnes ariſe out of his heart into his head, and come trickling downe in teares at his eyes. It is ſaid in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> that therefore the wicked feare not God, becauſe they have no changes, but ſtill continue in one eſtate of proſperity and pride, and ſo think to paſſe <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciys ad delicias,</hi> from the joyes of earth to the joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but that will not be, if ever God intend to ſave their ſoules, he will finde a time to ſend a thaw into their hearts, and then let them tell me, if they doe not finde a change of weather in their conſciences.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it chance to thaw and then freeze againe the next day, this makes the wayes and paſſages worſe than they were before. So when a mans heart ſhall melt a little on the Sonday, and freeze againe all the weeke after; as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> melted for a time, and then preſently hardned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; this relapſe is worſe than the former: as water having beene once heate, and then cooled againe, growes colder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than before. Wee ſee, that even marble in ſome wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſtand on drops, and yet retaines its wonted hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſo did <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, and <hi>Sauls,</hi> and <hi>Ahabs,</hi> ſeeme to give, and melt for a time, but they grew hard againe too ſoone. Take heede of that, if thy heart begin to thaw, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21224:106"/>
God to follow thee with his grace, that it may not freeze againe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After a thaw, though the Snow for the moſt part be vaniſhed and gone, yet under hedges and ditches, there wil lie ſome leavings of it (as we call them) a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo when it hath pleaſed God to melt a mans heart for ſinne, yet there wilbe ſome leavings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of corruption, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of his old ſinnes, in the blinde and ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his heart. So that the continuall care and daily practiſe of a Chriſtian muſt be to finde out and purge out theſe old leavings of ſinne that lie unmelted in his ſoule. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The thaw makes the wayes exceeding foule and clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie which before were faire and cleane; ſo till a mans heart be thawed, he never perceives the fouleneſſe of the wayes of ſinne, how they bemyre his ſoule, and clogge and hinder him in his paſſage to heaven; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calls the world <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="5">5. While the froſt holds the plowes are lockt out of the earth, no ſeede can be ſowne, all husbandry is intermitted, till God ſend a thaw, and then their work goes forward. So while men are frozen in ſinne, Gods Plow can make no worke, the ſeed of his word can take no roote, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as the Apoſtle calls the Miniſtrie of the word. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.) <hi>God husbandry</hi> doth no good till there come an inward thaw to prepare and make way for grace, that mens hearts may be wrought upon by the powerfull Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt, then it is no griefe for a Miniſter to take paines in

Therefore <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> was ſent before to prepare the way for Chriſt, and to thaw mens hearts by the preaching of repentance, that they might be capable of the Doctrine of Chriſt, who was to ſow the ſeede of eternall life in the world.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, after a thaw comes a floud, ſo after repentance follow teares. It was <hi>Peters</hi> caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 60. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Acceptatio fraternae correptionis,</hi> the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or well-taking of brotherly reprehenſion; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did profeſſe in the behalfe of all penitent and humble ſinners, that he would be ſo farre from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it as a diſcourteſy, or eſteeming it as a diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to be told of his faults, by ſuch a man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a manner; that (ſaith he) it ſhall be <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordia, it ſhall be a kindneſſe unto me,</hi> yea a mercy, yea more then that, it ſhall be <hi>Oleum Capitis,</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Hebrew)</hi> a principall, a ſoveraigne, <hi>an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oyle that ſhall not breake my head;</hi> of theſe in their order, firſt of the firſt part, which is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Deſiderium ſanae conſcientiae,</hi> the deſire of a good conſcience, that is, to be ſmitten, &amp; to be reproved. A ſound heart is like a ſound hand, that can abide not only rubbing &amp; chafing, but ſmiting and ſtriking too, if occaſion ſerve, and yet neyther ſuffer, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any harme; whereas if a man have a thorne in his hand, or a bille, or an vlcerous ſore, the leaſt touch at unawares provokes him to impatience, and makes him fret at him that meant him no unkindneſſe.

or other that he loveth and is loath to part with; though he be not ſmitten upon purpoſe, if he be but touched upon the by; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith in another caſe, <hi>Tange montes et fumig abunt; Touch the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and they ſhall ſmoke;</hi> ſo the leaſt touch upon his predominant, his Mountaine-ſinne, makes him fret, and fume, and ſmoke, like the vapours in the clouds, that never leave working when once they are enraged till they have vented themſelves into a clap of thunder: malice will finde a vent if it be but ſtirred with a touch. <hi>When thou with rebukes doſt chaſten man for ſinne, He is as a moth, fretting a garment,</hi> (ſaith our tranſlation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 11.) He that undertakes a carnall man, with rebukes to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten him for ſinne, ſhall finde him play the Moth preſently, he will be fretting ſecretly, though hee make no ſhew of it openly; as wee ſay of a Moth, <hi>Tinea damnum facit, non ſonitum.</hi> A moth doth miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and makes no noyſe; I ſay, Rebuke him, and you ſhall finde him a very moth; if he cannot finde a hole in that mans coate that ſhall offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove him, tis a venture but he will fret one, that is, he will either raiſe ſome imputation of ſcandall upon him, or bring ſome action at law againſt him, one way or other, he wil be revenged upon him for it. Its death to an ill-minded man to be ſmitten for his faults. But then come to a man of an honeſt heart and an humble minde, one that is truely conſcious to his owne defects, and ſuch a one will be ſo farre from taking it in ill part, or in indignation to bee touched for his tranſgreſſions; that he will rather entreate any good man, or any good Miniſter, as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21224:112"/>
the man of God entreated his neighbour. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20. 35. <hi>Smite me I pray thee, in the name of the Lord:</hi> If thou knoweſt any thing that is amiſſe in mee, or ſeeſt mee doe any thing that may be diſpleaſing to God, or prejudiciall to my calling, to my credit, or to my conſcience to God-ward; doe not favour me, doe not forbeare me, but deale truely and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually with me, and <hi>ſmite mee I pray thee, in the name of the Lord.</hi> And ſuch was <hi>Davids</hi> diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my Text, though he were a prince, and a man after Gods owne heart, yet was he ſo farre from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting to heare himſelfe flattered for his vertues, that he did rather even deſire and long to feele him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſmitten for his vices: <hi>percutiat et increpet, let him ſmite me, and reprove me.</hi>

                  <p>A man would thinke that <hi>David</hi> had ſmiting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, if that were good, he ſhould deſire no more. Almighty God had ſmitten him (as he ſaith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) with ſuch a ſore diſeaſe, that there was no reſt in his bones, noe breath in his body by reaſon of his ſinne. Beſides that his enemies had ſmitten him on every ſide, <hi>They came about me like Bees</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>animaſque in vulnere ponunt,</hi> they ſmote him and ſtung him, though it were to their own undoing, though they left their very lives and ſoules in their ſtings. Beyond all theſe, <hi>Davids</hi> owne heart had ſmitten him more then once; when hee numbred the people, <hi>His heart ſmote him</hi> (ſaith the Text. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10.) To teach us how our hearts ſhould ſmite us, when we conſider the number of our ſins. So when be had but cut <hi>Sauls</hi> coat, his heart ſmote him againe, as much perhaps as it would have done

ſome other if he had cut <hi>Sauls</hi> throat: I ſay, if ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be good, ſurely <hi>David</hi> had enough of it; and yet you ſee there was an <hi>unicum deeſt,</hi> one thing wanting to all thoſe ſmitings; He that knew the ſtate and temper of his owne ſoule, did ſenſibly finde in himſelfe that if he were but ſmitten againe in another kind, if the Righteous would but ſmite him too, it might be a meanes to doe him as much, yea, much more good, than all the reſt had done. But ſtay; and let us reaſon the caſe: why ſhould <hi>David</hi> deſire to be ſmitten once more, having been ſo much, and ſo often ſmitten before? I will tell you what I thinke his reaſon might be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Vt videat,</hi> that he might ſee his errors. We have a ſaying, that ſtanders by ſee more than Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: ſo another man may ſee more by his friend, than perhaps hee ſees or perceives by himſelfe. Hence I take it, the Prophet <hi>Gad</hi> is called <hi>Davids Seer,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 11. Wee know that <hi>David</hi> was a Prophet himſelfe, and had Revelations and Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from God as well as <hi>Gad;</hi> and yet even hee had a Seer deputed for him; and doubtleſſe <hi>Gad</hi> had a ſpeciall inſpection into <hi>Davids</hi> wayes and actions, and ſaw more by him, many a time than he ſaw by himſelfe, and brought backe many of his ſinnes to his ſight and remembrance which had formerly eſcaped him unſeene, and unrepented: for this cauſe, I ſuppoſe, doth the holy Ghoſt entitle him <hi>Davids</hi> Seer. So <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 31. when the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites were travelling in the Wilderneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the land of Promiſe, though they had the Cloud to direct them by day, and the Pillar of Fire
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21224:113"/>
to direct them by night, yet they deſired <hi>Iethro</hi> to be in <hi>ſtead of eyes unto them</hi> (as the text expreſſeth it): Why? What need had they of <hi>Iethro</hi> to be eyes unto them, ſeeing they had the infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and direction of the Cloud and Fire of God? Yes, for though theſe were guides unto them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, yet for particular places and paſſages in the deſart, <hi>Iethroes</hi> direction was inſtead of eyes unto them, becauſe he knew the dangers of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which they knew not. So though a man for the generall courſe of his life and converſation may have the heavenly guidance of Gods holy Spirit, and the bleſſed Guardianſhip of Gods holy Angels; yet in particular caſes and circumſtances of a mans demeanour and carriage, a <hi>Iethro,</hi> a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friend, that will deale truely and plainely with a man, may be in ſtead of eyes unto a man, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him of what is a right, and reforme him in what is amiſſe; to ſhew him much good, and ſave him from much evill that might befall him. They ſay, that a Mole is blinde all her life, and never ſeeth till the very point of death, for then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the paine breakes open the filme of her eyes, and then ſhe ſeeth, but then her ſight doth her no good. Whether it be ſo or no, I dare not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme; But ſo I have heard, and ſo I have read: and ſurely (me thinks) it is a lively reſemblance of the wretched eſtate of ſome kinde of men, that goe blindlings on in an evill courſe of life, like the blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Aramites,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. that thought they had beene in the way to <hi>Dothan</hi> when they were in the midſt of <hi>Samaria;</hi> ſo theſe thinke themſelves in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21224:114"/>
way to heaven, when they are in the midſt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans kingdome and dominion; till they come to die, then the extremity of their paines may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture breake open the filme of their hearts, to ſee their owne miſerable eſtate through ſinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but who can tell whether their ſight doth then doe them any good, and not rather tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them the more. Happie therefore is that man that can meet with ſuch a friend as <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Iethro</hi> was, that will be inſtead of an <hi>Oculiſt</hi> unto him; to open his eyes by ſober admonitions and ſeaſonable reprehenſions, that hee may ſee his ſinnes in time, and ſave himſelfe from this ſame <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> termes it, Acts 2. 40.) <hi>this</hi> perverſe, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward generation.</hi> We read, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 27. that when <hi>Ionathan</hi> had taſted the hony with the top of his rod, the text ſaith, <hi>his eyes were opened,</hi> and he ſaw that he had done amiſſe. This in my conceit, is a lively reſemblance of loving reprehenſion; the Rod (you will ſay) is an embleme of correction, and caſtigation; and the hony may well paſſe for an embleme of a ſweet and loving diſpoſition; put both theſe together, the Rod and the Hony, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and love, or ſweet and loving repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; if any thing in the world open a mans eies, and make him ſee hee hath done amiſſe, that will doe it.

ſay, as there is a fault in too much lenity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, ſo there is as great a fault in too much virulency and bitterneſſe. <hi>David</hi> complaineth, whether of his friends or of his enemies, that <hi>they gave him Gall to drinke:</hi> this we know was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically ſpoken, and litterally fulfilled in our bleſſed Saviour at his paſſion; but ſurely <hi>David</hi> ſpake it of himſelfe in a metaphoricall ſence, meaning, that their words and rebukes were as bitter, as vile, and as diſtaſtfull to him, as if they had put gall into his very drinke. Now obſerve it when you will, you ſhall find, that theſe harſh, theſe galling reprehenſions doe never worke kindely a good diſpoſition, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſſe of God,</hi> that is, a furious or a railing reprehenſion doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade or move a man, ſo as that thereby he is won to God or to goodneſſe: for one will take that which commeth from a haſty man, to proceede rather out of ſpightfulneſſe and ſpleene, then of love or good-meaning, and ſo it falls to the ground without working that good effect, which whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reprehenſion ſhould worke, that is, it doth not frame nor worke a mans heart to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God.

with the other. The Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>that love covereth a multitude of ſinnes;</hi> not onely <hi>Charitas Dei,</hi> the love and kindneſſe of God, and <hi>Charitas Chriſti</hi> the love and compaſſion of Chriſt; but <hi>Charitas amici</hi> too, the kindneſſe and love of a friend, if he be true and faithfull, will be the ſame that <hi>Shems</hi> and <hi>Iaphets</hi> cloake was, a meanes under God to cover and to hide the weakeneſſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of his fathers and brethren: See an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it in our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 37. when he had occaſion to ſpeake of the penitent woman that waſhed his feet with her teares, and wiped them with the haire of her head, ſee how favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, how tenderly he makes mention of her, and the worſt language hee gives her is, that ſhee was <hi>peccatrix</hi> a ſinner, <hi>There was a woman in the City which was a ſinner;</hi> Alas, what woman was not, what woman is not a ſinner? We doe eaſily gueſſe what the woman was, and what her ſinne was; but ſee the tenderneſſe and the goodneſſe of our Lord and Saviour, that names neither the woman, nor the ſinne, but ſpares her reputation, becauſe he ſaw her repentance. Thus did the Father of the Prodigall child, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi> when he was driven by neceſſity to ſeeke reliefe in his Fathers houſe, and came and ſubmitted himſelfe; ſee how his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother reviled him, how baſely, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly, how diſgracefully he makes mention of him, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>This thy ſonne</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that hath ſpent thy living upon harlots,</hi> ſhall have more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from thee, than I that never angred thee.

as if he had beene nothing a kinne to him, ſeeing he was growne into poverty, and driven by neceſſity to make bold with his friends. Such is the dogged diſpoſition of ill-minded men, if they know any thing by a man that may any way diſgrace him, he ſhall be ſure to have it laid in his diſh when he fares the worſt.

Thus favourably doth the Scripture ſpeak of <hi>Davids</hi> great offence. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was upright in all things (ſaith the text) ſave only in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 15. 5. it is not ſaid, ſave onely in the murther of <hi>Vriah,</hi> but <hi>ſave onely in the matter of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah;</hi> what that matter was is too well knowne, but the holy Ghoſt ſeekes to cover it, that there may be no diſgracive mention of it. It is meate and drinke to ſome kind of people, if they can but find any juſt accuſation againſt a man, to diſgrace him by it: Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> compares ſuch to <hi>Dives</hi> dogges that lay licking and ſucking of <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſores; they medled not with his ſound parts, but onely with his ſores; ſo let a man have never ſo many good parts, they make no mention of them, but if hee have but one ſore, (i) an infirmity, you ſhall have them licking at that continually; never chance to ſpeake of him, but that is at their tongues end. Well therefore did <hi>David</hi> abandon all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men from having to doe with him; and make
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21224:119"/>
choiſe of one that is right-wiſe, and honeſt to ſmite and to reprove him, for ſuch a one will doe it <hi>ſine contumeliâ,</hi> without diſgrace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Sine adulatione,</hi> without flattery; without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betting or juſtifying a man in his evill courſes. For there is, (as one hath well obſerved) a twofold Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; 1 A Iuſtification of a ſinner from his ſinnes. 2 A Iuſtification of a ſinner in his ſinnes; the firſt is an act of Gods mercy, the ſecond is an act of mans flattery: the former is an happy an bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing, when God is pleaſed in mercy to juſtifie and acquit, to diſcharge and free a guilty ſoule from the bond and puniſhment of all his ſinnes, by the merits, and by the bloud, and by the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt. The latter is a wofull and accurſed thing, when a man ſhall ſpeake good of evill, and labour to juſtifie another mans actions though never ſo vile and foule; it is ſuch a Iuſtification as without Gods infinite mercy will bring a man to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting condemnation; and yet ſuch ſervile ſpirits there be, that for their owne advantage, will ſooth a man up (if hee be rich or great) in all his wayes, and wickedneſſe: Let him ſinne what he will, they will not checke him; project what he will, they will not thwart him; ſay what he will, they are ready to ſecond him; and let him be what he will, they applaud and admire him. Oh, what amiable friends are theſe! theſe love a man, as the Ravens love his eyes, or as <hi>Dalilah</hi> loved <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when ſhe hugged and lulled him in her lap, and then cut off his locke, which was the onely ligament that tied and faſtned him to his God, ſo ſhe did what lay
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21224:120"/>
in her even to cut him off from God. Theſe are they whom the Prophet termes <hi>Caementarios dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli,</hi> the devils dawbers, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13. 10. the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ſtands thus; when a man dwels in an old rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous houſe, the Maſon comes and plaſters and dawbes it over, making the Indweller beleeve that all is well, that it is a ſound and a ſolid wall, and he may dwell ſafely in it, when the houſe is indeed ready to fal, drop down, and ſmother him. Such are they, that will not ſticke to perſwade a man that his caſe is good to God-ward, that he hath no cauſe to be diſcontented or ill-conceited of himſelfe, when there is an <hi>ulciſci in promptu</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) when vengeance is in a readineſſe to fall downe and ſeize upon him. Another calls them the devils Vphoſters (in relation to that <hi>Ezech.</hi> 13 18.) if they ſee a man leane towards a ſinne, they will ſow a pillow under his arme-hole, (i) ſooth him up in his inclination, that he ſleepe ſecurely in it with as little trouble and unreſt as poſſibly may be. Theſe be wofull friends, God deliver every good man from having ſuch burs hang on his ſleeve, from having his head broken with theſe precious balmes (as our Tranſlation reads my text.) For my part (ſaith <hi>David)</hi> give me a true friend that will ſmite me, as for a flatterer that will ſmooth me, I hate and abhor him; give me ſuch a friend as is like thoſe ſawces which a man commends with teares in his eyes; whoſe reprehenſion is like ſome whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome potion, though it make a man ſick for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it wil purge him &amp; do him good for the time to come; it be theſe rough hands (as one ſaid of <hi>Iacobs)</hi>

Or thus, It ſhall not breake my head, but it ſhall breake my ſinnes-head, or the head of my ſinnes; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 14. <hi>The heads of Dragons are broken in the waters:</hi> what are theſe <hi>Capita Draconum,</hi> theſe heads of Dragons? but capitall crimes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant and maſter-ſinnes, that doe <gap reason="foreign">

Now he that can be a meanes to ſave his friends head, and breake his ſinnes head; to cheriſh the one and cruſh the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Is not this a kindneſſe worth acceptation?</p>

                     <hi>and wrath, upon the ſoule of every one that doth evill</hi> (upon purpoſe to vexe his neighbour.) Now thus ſtands the caſe, Hee that revengeth his owne quarrell, and recompenſeth evill for evill, hee heapes coales of fire on his owne head, that is, makes himſelfe liable to the juſt revenge of God; but hee that by patient forbearance commits his cauſe to God, and renders good for evill, he heapes coales of fire on his enemies head, that is, he ſaves himſelfe from wrong, and transferreth the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath of God upon him that wronged him, or whom God in flaming fire will render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance when he comes to judgement. And this is the way to be revenged of an enemy.</p>
                  <p>But then if a man have a friend that hee wiſheth well unto, and faine would reclaime him from his evill life; <hi>David</hi> would have him take another courſe, and powre drops of oyle upon his head, that is, mollifie and melt him, and worke gently and kindly upon him, by mild rebukes and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; for this may touch his heart, but ſhall never breake his head; it may doe him good for his ſoule, but ſhall never doe him wrong for his life or reputation. And this I take to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my text. The ſumme of all is this, Looke what vertue, what excellency there is in the moſt ſoveraigne, moſt precious oyles or balſomes for the ſalubrity and health of the body; the very ſame are to be found in kind and gentle admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the health and welfare of the ſoule. Fitly therefore doth <hi>David</hi> reſemble it to oyle in many reſpects, I will but name them and conclude.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

And for this cauſe I ſuppoſe, that God, who if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed could eaſily withhold the righteous from ſinne, doth yet in his wiſedome, leave them to themſelves and let them fall, that by falling they may have experience of their infirmity, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie may draw them to humility, humility brings them home to God, and in God they have their <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> a free and full diſcharge from all their ſinnes.</p>

For if you marke the Scripture, you ſhall finde, that wicked and ungracious children, though they be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of righteous and religious parents, yet they are not eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor accounted as their ſeed: As you ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 12. that <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> that ungracious younſter, whoſe hands was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every man, and every mans hand againſt him, Hee is called the ſeed of <hi>Hagar,</hi> not the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though hee came out of his loynes, as well as out of her wombe, onely becauſe the promiſe of bleſſing was not made to him but to <hi>Iſaac;</hi> who is therefore called the child of promiſe: and <hi>Rom. Chapter</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 7, 8. Wee have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe place for to prove, <hi>viz. That the children of the Promiſe onely are counted for the ſeede;</hi> Others, though they come of righteous parents according to the fleſh, yet in Gods account they are not reckoned for their ſeed. And therefore <hi>Cajetan</hi> hath a good conceit upon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to <hi>Abraham, Gene. Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>The land which thou ſeeſt, I will give unto thee, and to thy ſeed for ever.</hi> It is (ſaith hee) as if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du erit ſemen tuum,</hi> &amp;c. as long as they ſhall bee thy ſeed, I will give them this land; therefore when they beganne to degenerate from <hi>Abraham,</hi> both in faith and in good life, and were not his right children (as our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21224:139"/>
Saviour told the Iewes, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.) but rather by their wicked manners, the children of the devill; God was no longer tied to his promiſe, but did diſinherit them of that good land which they might ſtill have enjoyed, had they continued to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and followed the ſtepps of his righteouſneſſe. The like place we have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. 11, 12. The Lord ſwore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>David,</hi> of the fruit of thy body will I ſet upon thy Throne (that is) one of thy children ſhall ſtill ſucceed thee in thy kingdome; but marke what kinde of children God meant; onely ſuch as ſhould keepe his Covenant, and doe as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done, <hi>If thy children will keepe my Covenant</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and my Teſtimony as thou haſt done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their children alſo ſhall ſit upon thy Throne for ever-more:</hi> ſo that the promiſes of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, though they ſeem to be made promiſeuouſly to all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the righteous, yet are they peculiarly reſtrained to ſuch onely as tread in the ſteps of their parents vertues. Therefore in the Iewiſh <hi>Talmud,</hi> an ungracious ſonne is called <hi>(Ben ve lo ben) filius &amp; non filius,</hi> a ſonne and no ſonne; as an <hi>Eunuch</hi> is ſaid to be a man and no man, and a Batt a bird and no bird, and a Pumiſe a ſtone and no ſtone; ſo a diſobedient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is ſtoried of <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar</hi> that hee had three untoward ſonnes, whom he uſed to terme <hi>tres vomicas, &amp; tria carcinomata,</hi> his three impoſtumes, or his three ulcerous cancers; they were ſuch an eye-ſore, and an heart-ſore unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo may all ungracious children be truly termed, as being no better than ulcers and cancers to thoſe that breed and bring them up, as <hi>Eſau</hi> was to <hi>Rebeccah, Gen.</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that on the one ſide, whereas it is ſaid, <hi>God will viſite the ſinnes of the fathers upon the children;</hi> it is meant onely of wicked children, ſuch as do <hi>patrizare,</hi> and follow the tracke of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents wickedneſſe, and ſo draw upon themſelves their juſt-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved puniſhments; ſo on the contrary, whereas it is ſaid in my text, that God will never forſake the righteous nor their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21224:139"/>
the compaſſe of their parents happineſſe. It is indeed a great happineſſe to be borne and bred of righteous parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a good child ſmarts for his fathers wickedneſſe, ſo many a bad one fares the better for his fathers goodneſſe, as <hi>Cham</hi> was ſaved in the Arke, not for his owne, but for his fathers ſake. And I doe verily beleeve, that the more vertuous predeceſſours a man hath, the greater mercies he ſhall receive, as the bleſſings of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> all three together were more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileable for their poſterity, than if there had beene but one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of them: therfore <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith to <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 49. 26. <hi>The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of thy Father ſhall be ſtronger than the bleſſings of my elders;</hi> for he had his fathers bleſſing, and all the reſt concurring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: as on the contrary, I feare, that the more evill Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours one hath, the greater puniſhment he ſhall receive, if his owne ſinnes be alſo added to theirs. Therefore let all children that have good parents, thanke God for them, be obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and take heede they doe not degenerate from them; for as it little benefits a river to come from a cleare ſpring, if it ſelfe be muddy; or as it little benefits a blinde man to ſay that his parents could ſee, or a feeble man, that his parents were ſtrong; ſo its little comfort, and leſſe credit to any young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that his parents were worthy and vertuous, if he himſelfe be unworthy and vicious: for this bleſſing which is here repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the ſeede of the righteous, belongs (you ſee) of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore no marvell that God in his juſt judgement doth let ſuch runnagates <hi>continue in ſcarceneſſe:</hi> for if they would ſeeke their meat at God (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith the young Lyons doe) God would take ſuch order, that they ſhould not alwayes be to ſeeke for their meate, as now they are; if they did but begge their daily bread of God (as our Saviour teacheth us in his prayer) God would ſurely provide them bread, that they ſhould need to begge it of none elſe but him: but as they reſtraine their prayers from God, ſo God reſtraines his bleſſing from them, and lets them like Runnagates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſcarceneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But now for the ſeed of the Righteous, they have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall relation to God, and God hath a ſpecial regard to them, as being the lambs of his owne flocke, the members of his own Son, and the children of his own adoption; and in that reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heaven ſhall want power, and earth want meanes, before any of Gods owne children ſhall want maintenance: let the world be never ſo hard, corne never ſo deare, and their meanes never ſo ſmall, that God that multiplied the widdowes oyle, will adde ſuch a bleſſing to that little which they have, that like a Spring it ſhall continually feede them,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21224:141"/>
and keepe off beggery from ever comming on them. Here then is a comfort to all poore pious parents that have little or nothing to leave their children but onely prayers and bleſſings; God who is Rich in mercy to all that call upon him, will be a Father to thy children, a Guardian to thy orphans, and while thou art above with God in glory, God will be beneath with them in mercy, that they ſhall never feele ſuch want nor fall to beggery. It is a bleſſing promiſed to the poore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 41. <hi>That God will make them families like a flocke of ſheepe;</hi> which implyes that they ſhall thrive with a little maintenance, even as ſheepe grow fat and gather fleſh and fleeces, though the plaines and leas they feed on, be but bare and ſhort.</p>
                  <p>I know that generally all parents have a naturall deſire that their children ſhould proſper and doe well, when they themſelves be dead and gone. <hi>Oh that Iſhmael might live in thy ſight</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham to God)</hi> Oh that thou wouldſt be pleaſed to take him into thy favour and mercy, that he may never caſt off thee, nor waſte his meanes, and ſo come to want and beggery.

reaſon why we celebrate the comming of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in ſo ſolemne, ſo ſacred, and ſo ſettled a maner, being gone and paſt 1600. yeares agoe? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hath given me an anſwere to my hand, <hi>Becauſe grace and truth came by Ieſus Chriſt, Iohn</hi> 1. 17. When Ieſus Chriſt came from the boſome of his Father, he came not empty-handed, nor unprovided: but brought <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> into the world with him: <hi>Truth</hi> to direct us to heaven, and <hi>Grace</hi> to deliver us from hell: and that's a Congiary that deſerves commemoration to the worlds end. If any man ſhall yet further inquire, what is this <hi>Grace</hi> to us? or what are wee the better for the <hi>Grace</hi> that hee brought? For that my text will reſolve you, and make it evidently appeare unto you, that Chriſt is no niggard of his <hi>Grace,</hi> neither doth he keepe it to himſelfe (as <hi>Nabal</hi> did his victuals) but doth graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly impart it, and mercifully beſtow it, ſo much upon every one, as he ſeeth in his wiſedome to be enough and ſufficient for him. <hi>My Grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee.</hi> And let that ſuffice for the occaſion and choyce of my text, that it is not <gap reason="foreign">

For thus ſtood the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Our Apoſtle at this time was puniſhed with two ſtrange and ſtrong afflictions, the one internall, the other externall; the one he termeth the <hi>Thorne</hi> in

I ſuppoſe hee did meane his owne concupiſcence, his owne corruption and luſt, which is as painefull and vexatious to a tender ſoule, as a thorne in the hand, or a ſplinter under the nayle, is irkeſome and grievous to the tender fleſh. By that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the meſſenger, or the angell of Satan, muſt needs bee underſtood the Devills temptation; for before that wicked one come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he ſends his Meſſenger or his Angell before him to make way for his entertainement, and as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> ſaid of the King of <hi>Iſraels</hi> man which was ſent to behead him, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. 32. <hi>Is not the ſound of his Maſters feet behind him?</hi> ſo beleeve it, whenſoever an evill temptation, or a temptation to evill doth come before, the devill himſelfe who is the maſter and maker of it is not farre behinde. Now marke how this evill angell uſed, or rather abuſed S. <hi>Paul;</hi> the text ſaith, He fell foule upon him, and buffeted him; now you know that buffeting is a malicious act joyned with violence, or a violent act joyned with malice, and it ſignifies unto us, what a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minde the Devill beares to Gods eſpeciall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; if he cannot by faire meanes entice, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, and inveagle them to ſinne; if God will give him leave, he will fall upon them by ſoule meanes, even <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> to buffet them, and enforce them in a manner to ſin againſt God and their owne ſoules. Thus ſorely was our poore Apoſtle haunted, thus cruelly was he handled, both with venemous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions within, and with violent temptations

without, ſo that neither inwardly, nor outwardly: hee could bee free or at liberty to enjoy himſelfe and his God: Whereupon (ſaith the text) <hi>Hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord thrice, that they might depart from him;</hi> all his deſire, all his prayer to God was, to be rid of theſe annoyances.

                  <p>Iuſt as ſome skilfull Phyſitian, when his Patient in a feavour calls for drinke, gives him a ſirrope, or ſome conſerve, and ſo quencheth his thirſt in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kinde, than drinke would doe: ſo dealt the Lord with <hi>Paul,</hi> who was now in a ſpirituall feaver, and cryes out amaine, (as it were for drinke) that is, for ſome preſent refreſhing, and releaſe of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

From which paſſage of Gods providence (before I come to particulars) give me leave to commend unto you this briefe obſervation in generall: <hi>viz.</hi> That if after all our prayers, after all our entreaties and importunities with God for private and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular favours and mercies; as for health in time of ſickneſſe, for eaſe in time of paine, for reſt and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the time of trouble and affliction: Though God ſhould ſeeme to take no notice of us, but deny or with-hold all theſe things from us; if he doe but condeſcend unto us in this one thing (as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21224:146"/>
he did to Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> if he doe but vouchſafe us his <hi>Grace, Summam votorum attigimus,</hi> wee have as much as heart can wiſh, wee have that which is in ſtead, or in liew of all the reſt. As the Iewes write of their <hi>Mannah,</hi> that it had in it <hi>Omne dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamentum,</hi> all manner of delightfull taſtes, and was in ſtead of Bread, in ſtead of meate, in ſtead of all kindes of dainty fare; ſo may it bee truely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, that it is in ſtead of health, in ſtead of wealth, in ſtead of all other earthly bleſſings whatſoever: ſo that as a man that walkes in the Sun, never lookes nor regards whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Moone or the Starres ſhine or no, becauſe he hath no need of their light: ſo he that enjoyeth the light of Gods countenance, that hath the <hi>Grace</hi> of God to befriend and beſtead him, needs care the leſſe for theſe inferiour commodities, theſe <hi>Bona ſcabelli</hi> (as the Fathers call them) theſe goods of Gods Foote-ſtoole; becauſe, if he have them not, God will ſo provide he ſhal have no need of them. In a word then, if thou wert put to thy choiſe, as <hi>Salomon</hi> once was, to aske any one thing at the hands of God, and to have promiſe of acceptance, what ſhould that one thing be? wouldſt thou aske for riches, or pleaſure, or long life, &amp;c?

                  <p>By the grace of God (in few words) I conceive to be meant nothing elſe but the favour and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of God; that which the ſchoolemen terme <hi>Complacentiam dei,</hi> the well pleaſedneſſe of God: the ſame which the ſcripture calleth <hi>Lucem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It is an uſuall expreſſion among us to ſay, ſuch a one is in great grace with the King, or in great grace at the Court, we meane, he is in great favour there. And it is a phraſe no leſſe uſuall in ſcripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Noah found grace in the ſight of God, i. e.</hi> hee found favour in his ſight; and God Almighty ſaith of <hi>Moſes Exod.</hi>

As when <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren found their money in their ſackes mouthes, it inriched them, and it raviſhed them too, with wonder and admiration, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 28. in like manner, when a poore diſconſolate wretch, ſhall without all deſert, and beyond all expectation, finde a ſenſible experiment of Gods favourable goodneſſe towards him; how can hee chuſe, but even bleſſe himſelfe and ſay, Lord, what am I that ſuch a favour ſhould be caſt upon me! In a word, as <hi>Iacob</hi> anſwered his aged father when hee queſtioned him about the matter of his veniſon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 20. <hi>How is it that thou haſt found it ſo quickly my ſonne?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Becauſe the Lord thy God brought it to my hand.</hi> In like ſort, if any ſhall ſeeme to queſtion the matter, how it comes to paſſe that ſome one man findeth favour and riſeth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment ſo eaſily and ſo quickly over that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe, which to our thinking deſerves it better, <hi>In promtu ratio,</hi> the Lord their God brings it to their hand: when God brings a bleſſing to hand, the labour is not long to finde it. But that by the way.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here take occaſion to reſolve you of two

queſtions, which doe offer themſelves to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; the firſt is this, when a man wants the grace and favour of God, how ſhall he doe to finde it? the ſecond is like unto it, when a man hath found Gods grace and favour at his need, how ſhall he doe to keepe it, that hee doe not forfeit it, nor looſe it againe? I will anſwer you for both, in a word.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou want the grace of God, and fayne wouldeſt finde it? Thou muſt doe two things for it.</p>
