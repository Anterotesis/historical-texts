            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as the libell being sclanderous against our soueraigne and her lawes, &amp; blasphemous against God &amp; his truthe, might be a reioysyng to the obstinate &amp; rebellious, and an offence to the weake and ignorant, if the cloudes of calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deceiptful reasonyng vsed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, were not driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a waie with the blaste of some confutation: so the falshod ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of beyng opened, and the crafte discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by your L. procureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, shalbe a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:21339:3"/>
of gladnes to the godly, of grief to the wicked, of strenthenyng to the weake, and of learnyng to the ignorant. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by trueth beyng mainteined, and errour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded, many men shalbe profited, &amp; God hymself shalbe glorified. And your L. for preferryng so many folde goodnes, may be assured to receiue worthie than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of men, and plentifull reward of god. But this especially, wherin your L. ought chiefly to reioice, is not to be omitted, that as god hath iustified you in the merites of his sonne through faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued in your harte, so he hath geuen you an occasion hereby, of his holie name and religion, to make ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profession in the world. VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accordyng to the testimonie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, as a true and liuely beleif of the hart is necessarie for iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so a cleare &amp; open confession of the mouth is requisite
<pb facs="tcp:21339:3"/>
to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that this your L. requeste, might seme in all poinctes most fortunat, if it had not founde so meane an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I am to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plishe it. For beside that, I am inferiour to verie many of my brethren, that are meate to take suche a matter in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, I haue been for these two yeres almost, as it were sequestered, both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> serious studie, and plentie of such bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, as for such a purpose, were most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, esteming your L. motion, as a prouocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sente of god, to occupie my idle tyme, &amp; to employe some parte of gods giftes, to the profite of his Churche, as my duetye bindeth me, I thought good to shew my self, rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willing to satisfie your godly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. Not that the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie were of suche weight, but that thei might easely bee auoyded by many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb facs="tcp:21339:4"/>
christians, whom God hath indued with meaner giftes of knowledge, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstandyng, then it hath pleased hym to bestowe vpon me: but that I am priuie to myne owne imperfection, whereby I am lesse apt, to beautifie a matter, with such copy, &amp; eloquence as many other are, &amp; I would wish that this argument might haue been handled. Neuertheles, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to my bare, and simple facultie, I haue endeuoured to set forthe the truthe, rather with substaunce of matter, then with florishyng of woordes, not caryng howe finely, but howe plainly, I might cause it to appere, seyng it is no lesse cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to teach the ignoraunt, then it is commendable to please the learned. And this labour I haue bestowed for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of others, and not for the praise of my self. For whiche cause also I thought it
<pb facs="tcp:21339:4"/>
not beste, to encomber the simple reader with many reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or authorities to proue one matter, but to enstructe hym with a few, and those pitthie, &amp; of force to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade. Sauyng that in one questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, in multitude of testimonies, I maie seme to be ouer tedious, if the cause be not considered, whiche prouoked me thereto. For seyng the aduersaries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shame crie out, that our doctrine of iustification, is suche a straunge paradox as neuer was hearde of in the worlde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our tyme, the same doctrine, beeyng the chiefe foundation of true Religion, I thought it expedient, that the vnlearned were admonished, what ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it hath of antiquitie, as it hath moste manifest aucthoritie in the holie worde of God. To conclude, there were twoo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considerations that encouraged me,
<pb facs="tcp:21339:5"/>
to take vpon me this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation. One be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Popishe apologie discouereth no greate learnyng of the aucthor, there is no greate connyng to bee required, in hym that should make answere to it: &amp; for that it hath presumed, to thrust it self into the princes court, it is not impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that it should be confuted, by one that is atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant in the same. Thus hauing doen my good will, I moste humbly desire your L. to take it in good parte: besechyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God so to continue and encrease his giftes of vertue, and godlines in your L. that you maie be blessed with true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and prosperitie in this life, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, rewarded with eternall ioye, and felicitie.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was found in the court, either cast of purpose, or lost of negligence, a certain small pamphlette, conteinyng an Apollogie, or aunswere of a Papiste, to some frendes of his, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded hym to conforme hymself, to the Religion now receiued in the realme, by publike aucthoritie: whiche when it came to my handes, supposyng it might do some hurte emong them that are ignoraunte, I thought good, briefly to confute it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the copie whiche was founde, was vnskilfully written, I had some diffultie to reade it in certaine places, and somety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes I mighte plainely perceiue, that the aucthours meanyng was chaunged by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true writyng: So that the aucthour, or his frendes, maie haue some occasion to cauill at my publishing of the copie, whiche was so muche corrupted: In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I would haue been verie glad, to haue had the principall copie of the aucthours owne hande, if I could haue knowen how
<pb facs="tcp:21339:6"/>
to come by it. But seyng I was out of hope of that, I perused, and restored the copie that I had, as faithfully as I could, desiryng the aucthour, or his frendes, that haue the originall, if I haue erred in any woorde of any momente, to lette me haue knowledge thereof, and I will thereby reforme the apologie, and alter myne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere thereto accordyngly.

               <p>The first consideration co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth two causes of your refusal, the one because the booke of Seruice, was repealed by Acte of Parliament, the other, for that Cranmer Ridley, and Latimer, were burned at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde for it. To the first I aunswere, that if you accompt the aucthoritie of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of force to condempne it, why doe you not acknowledge th'aucthoritie of the same, in establishyng it, for <hi>anno.</hi> 1551. by all the states of the realme, that boke was allowed, and appoincted to bee vsed. Also by diuerse Actes of Parliamente, in the tyme of our soueraigne Ladies reigne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed. But it is no hard matter, to gather your traiterous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, whiche is common to you, with all them of your religion. You accoumpte no actes of Parliament, passed in the tyme of kyng Edward, or Quéene Elizabeth, to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21339:7"/>
of any aucthoritie, beyng confirmed by the roiall assent of those, whom you esteme to be no lawfull Princes, seyng your father the Pope, hath pronounced sentence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation against them.</p>

               <p>The thirde consideration is, that it is prohibited by the Canons of the apostles, and by the generall caunselles also, that a christian man shoulde not communicate neither in Sacramentes nor yet in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praiers, with Heritikes and Schismatikes. As it appeareth in the tenth Canon, and in the seconde Canon of the counsell hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Antioche. It was decreed there, that it was not lawful to communicate with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate persones, nor to enter into any house, nor to praie with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor lawfull to receiue them that are excommunicate out of one churche into another churche. And in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Laodicea, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited there, that the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men should enter into the churches or churche yerdes, of the heretikes, there to praie with them, and in the 33. Canon of the same counsell the like prohibition is there expressed for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21339:9"/>
praier with Schismatikes. And in the 4. counsell holden at Carthage Canon 73. it was decreed, that christian men should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praie nor singe with Heretikes. And who so euer did praie, singe, or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, with any exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate person, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were of the Clergie or of the Laitie, shoulde be thereby excommunicated. An example we reade therefore, how the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men at Constantinople would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Arianes, neither in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, nor yet in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praiers, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng that the Arians did agree with the Christen menne in theim bothe, as in all Sacramentes, and in all poinctes of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, sauing that the Arians did sing <hi>Gloria patri in filio,</hi> and the Christian menne, <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria patri &amp; filio, &amp;c.</hi> And therfore, and for that onely poinct, Iho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chrysostome then beyng Bishop of Constantinople, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincte vnto the christian men a seperate place, and maner of praier from them, as it appeareth in the sixth of the Historie Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastike.

               <p>The fowerth consideration is, that the receiuyng of this new booke of seruice, is a condemnation of the olde, wherby is taken away 5. of the. 7. Sacramentes, the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christes body in the Sacramente
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21339:10"/>
of the alter, the sacrifice of the masse, many traditions of the Apostles, as the holiyng of the Fonte, oile and Chrisma in Baptisme and Confirmation, the making of the signe of the Crosse, praiers for the deade and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sainctes. All sacramentall, and godly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonies, frequented in the vniuersal chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Christe, and brougt into this realme with the faithe of Christe by S. Augustine, and here by hym established, as suer signes and tokens of christian faieth, like as the holy. S. Bede witnesseth in his firste boke <hi>de gestis Anglorum,</hi> in the 25.29.30. chapiters, beside that all the foresaide thinges haue been alwaie approued, vsed, and allowed throughout the vniuersal church of christ. And therfore saieth S. Augustine all these thinges whiche haue been receiued in the vniuersall Churche of Christe, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the vse, and consente therof, ought not to be ouerthrowen, nor yet to be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged by the iudgemente of one priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be his learnyng and liuyng neuer so good, nor yet by the Bishoppes of any one prouince or countrie, when thereby they shoulde breake the vnitie of Gods spirite, whiche is the chief treasure in his Churche,
<pb facs="tcp:21339:11"/>
commended by our sauiour Christe vnto his Apostles, wishynge and praiynge the same vnitie to be amongest theim, whiche was betwixt him and God (Ioan 17) the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Apostle S. Paule tought the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians aboue all thinges to obserue this vnitie, and willed the Romaines that with one minde and one mouth they shoulde glorifie God. And in the Epistle to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians, he besought theim most entirely to obserue this vnitie. Again. S. Augustine saieth, these thinges whiche the vniuersall churche doth teache, therfore are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and kepte of all menne, because the churche which is the spouse of Christ, hath the full aucthoritie of her husband Christ, and suche gouernement also of the holy ghost, that she cannot consent, but to true thinges, nor she cannot commaunde but onely suche thinges whiche are both holy, holsome and good. And farther the same S. Augustine saieth, that in the ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacramentes, and in the manner of praiyng vsed of Preestes, there must be an vniformitie obserued in Christes catholike Churche, that by their Lawe and maner of praiyng there may be established the lawe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21339:11"/>
of beleuyng. And lest that the lawe, and maner of praiyng being chaunged, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so bring foorthe a chaunge and alteration of faieth, like as it hath so proued in thys realme. Beside that S. Ambrose doth thinke that there can not bee the faieth, where Schisme is, for albeit that schismatikes may haue faieth towardes God, yet they cannot haue faieth towarde the Churche of God, whom they suffer to bee dismembred, and discerped in peeces. For wheras our sauiour Christe suffered for his Churche, and the Churche is the mysticall bodie of Christe, how therfore may thei haue faith in christ, by whom his Passion is made frustrate, and his mysticall bodie drawen in peeces. And therefore woulde not we shoulde chaunge an order set, or a custome of Christes chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. For albeit saieth he, the reason or cause of a custome may be sought for, yet must it be so sought for, that the custome thereby be not infirmed or broken, for the searche may not bee made vnto destruction, but vnto aedification, wherby thou maist bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obserue the custome when thou arte as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of the cause and reason therof. I do praise thee (saieth Tertuliane) whiche firste
<pb facs="tcp:21339:12"/>
doeth beleue the custome to be obserued, before it hath learned the cause and reason why and wherfore.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21339:13"/>
aucthorities you would seme to grounde. But to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider your groundes particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Augustine, whom you call saincte Augustine, was an vnlearned Monke, as appereth by his questions, propounded to Pope Gregorie, that came into this land, to corrupte the sinceritie of faithe, whiche the Britons had receiued, euen from the Apostles, aboute sixe hundred yeres after Christe, and liued twoo hundred yeres at the least, after the aunciente father sainct Augustine bushoppe of Hippo in Affrica, of whose pride and folie, you maie reade in <hi>Galfridus Monumeth.

And as for Beda, he liued longe after Augustine. But where you affirme, that all youre Ceremonies haue been alwaies approued, vsed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, throughout the vniuersall churche of Christe, I can no longer forbeare you, you saie more then all the Papistes in the worlde, will be able to proue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:21339:13"/>Touchyng sainct Augustine, although the place by you alledged, is not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his vndoubted writyngs, yet I confesse that he speaketh fauourably of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vsed, to be quietly suffered, and borne withall, rather then vnitie to bee broken. But what maketh this, for your Ceremonies, whiche you teache to bee necessarie for saluation, and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: whiche if thei had been in saincte Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines tyme, or that men had so taught of theim, there is no doubte, but he would haue vtterly misliked theim, as hereafter in place more conueniente, I shall plainly declare. In your next sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce out of sainct Augustine also, I must néedes tel you, you plaie the suttle Marchaunt, to sett for the counterfeict ware, in steede of true mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice, for Augustine neuer was of that opinion, that the Church hath the full au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthoritie of her husbande Christ, and such gouernemente of the holy Ghost, that she cannot consente, but vnto true thynges, neither hath he any suche wordes in al his workes. For it is well knowen, that the boke <hi>de dogmaticis ecclesiasticis,</hi> out of which this sentence séemeth to bee borrowed, is
<pb facs="tcp:21339:14"/>
not accompted among the Authenticall workes of Augustine, but forged of muche later time, and falsly fathered vpon S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, to steale credite from his name, whiche it could not obtain of it self.</p>
               <p>And yet if this saiyng were graunted to bée true, it perteineth nothyng to your church, which is the Sinagoge of Sathan, and not the Churche of Christe. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng your thirde testimonie of sainct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, I can hardely thinke that saincte Augustine, would haue an vniformitie of Ceremonies, in praier, and administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacramentes throughout all the worlde, because I am able to shewe his aucthoritie to the contrary, as in his. 118. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to <hi>Ianuarius,</hi> he discourseth at large. And whereas you saie, that the chaunge of the maner of praiyng, hath broughte in chaunge of faithe in this lande, it is cleane contrary, for the diuersitie of faithe, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to praie, otherwise then you vse, for inuocation commeth of faithe, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth sainct Paule. <hi>Roma. 10.</hi>

               <p>The testimonie of saincte Ambrose, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you declare not, where a manne should finde it, maketh little for your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21339:14"/>
For we agrée with hym, that Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes are to be abhorred, but wée will not graunt to you, that wée are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, as long as wée knowe, that wée are members of Christe. The testimonie of Tertuliane concernyng custome, if it bee faithfully rehearsed of you, I se not what it maketh for you. For although laudable customes, maie be obserued, without sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng their beginnyng, what is that, to your Ceremonies, whiche containe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeste impietie? For you your self will not bee so madde, to allowe all customes, seyng many are contrary to the worde of GOD. And although Tertuliane was to muche addicted to the maintainyng of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and customes in some places, yet otherwhiles he either expoundeth his meanyng, or correcteth his errour, as in his booke <hi>De virginibus velandis,</hi> where he writeth in these woordes. <hi>Hoc exigere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem, cui nemo praescribere potest, non spacium temporum, non patrocinia personarum, non pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilegium regionum.

This the truthe requireth, againste whiche no man can prescribe, not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of tyme, not the defence of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones, not the priuiledge of any regions. For of these, custome takyng her begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, for the moste parte, through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, and simplicitie, is confirmed into an vsage, by succession, and so is bosted of against the truthe.

nor colde, therfore I shall beginne now to vomit and cast thee out of my mouth. The premisses well waighed, it cannot be iustly saied that I sticke at a trifling or small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but a matter of greate importance, and conscience moueth me therunto, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me that I shoulde not vnaduisedly without greate cause seperate my self, from the vnity of the Churche, neither to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the vniuersal church, vnheard hauing no iust or weightie cause why I should so doe. For I haue alwaies, and doe thus waigh the matter with my selfe, that the poinctes and matters of religion, which this boke of seruice, hath condemned or taken awaie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thei were thought matters of smal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and did no harme, but being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstanded might haue doen good, or els thei were to be taken, for matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie and intollerable to be borne withal. In case thei were of the firste sorte, whiche thei haue condemned and abolished. Then in my iudgement they should haue been tolerated and borne withall, for charities sake, and for the continuance, and encrease of vnitie betwixte vs and the vniuersall Church of christendom. On the other side,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21339:17"/>
in case thei had been taken for matters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, and could in no wise haue been borne with all for their impietie, as it hath been pretended, then yet in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, we ought to haue been better aduised then by our priuate condemnation of theim, to haue shewed our selfe to condemne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, al the whole vniuersall church of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnheard, which thinges the vniuersall church hath vsed from the Apostles time, and doe to this daie.

S. Augustine writeth hereof. The Church of God beyng placed and put among muche chaffe, and many Cockles, and wedes, the same church doth suffer, and beare with many thinges, yet that notwithstandyng, touchyng the thinges whiche are against faithe, and against good life, the Churche doth neither approue theim, nor yet lette theim escape vnspoken against.</p>

Doe you not here see, that when the Romishe churche, with a fewe other that agréed with her are exempted, the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall churche of Christe still remaineth, by sainct Augustines iudgemente? and that if the Romishe Churche, departe from the whole Catholike Churche, the Romishe Churche is a Schismatike, as it is at this daie, and hath been a long time, euen since Antichriste sette vp his seate there, and made a generall departyng from the faith of Christ, which sainct Paule prophesieth should come to passe. ij.

               <p>And whereas you saie, your Churche is vnhearde, I maruaile what you meane, for what can the Pope, or any of her proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, saie in her defence, but it hath been hearde, and confuted by the scriptures? Whiche thing hath caused, the most part of the regions of Europe this daie, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake your Hereticall, Schismaticall, and Antichristian Churche of Rome, and to ioigne them selues to the true Catholike, and Apostolike churche of Christ, whiche approueth all her doctrine, out of the holie Scriptures, and by the same reproueth all your heresies, and erronious opinions: the iudgement, and triall of whiche holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall scriptures, you neuer yet durst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide.

Finally, where you affirme, that the churche of Christe, was not destitute of the holy Ghoste, I agree with you, but that your Churche, is the

               <p>The sixte, and laste consideration, that I come not to their churche, is, because I am not of their Churche. S. Augustine in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

difference of churches saieth, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them whiche haue not all one Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, there can not be one religion, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently one Churche. And the cause why I am not of their Churche, but refuse to communicate with theym in religion, besides this saiyng of S. Augustine, that we should not Communicate in sacramentes with those men whose doctrine we can not aproue and allow: I do refuse to be of their church, because I cannot learne nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, of what church they are of. For thei beyng first Baptized in the catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and in the very self faieth and religion, wherin I do at this present time, beleue and remaine: thei are departed therefro, some to the Lutheranes Church, some to the Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians, and comyng last of al to the church Geneua, they are in maner fled from that church also, and by attributing the chief &amp; supreme gouernment of this their English churche vnto the Quenes highnes, thei are in doctrine directly against their old mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Caluine, being the chief Apostle of the Church of Geneua, whiche Caluine in the eight Chapter of the boke of his instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doth directlie reason against Kynges,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21339:20"/>
and Princes, for takyng vpon theim spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gouernment in the Church of Christ, and in the same Chapiter he doeth muche commende the holy Bishop S.

And if peraduenture they cease not ro pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende, that the Primitiue Churche is that plat forme of the Churche wherunto they would reduce vs: I answere, that there be so many poinctes wherein they doe dissent from the Primitiue Churche (like as I shall make sufficient proofe thereof) that it can not be so, it is onely pretended, but it shall neuer be proued: The Anabaptistes, the Li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bertines and the Arians doe pretende gods worde, and the Primitiue Churche as well as thei: And because they are so bolde to name the primitiue church, I aske of theim but this one questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether that this daie 50. or, 60. yeres laste paste, was their Church here in this realme, or in any other parte of christendome?

               <head>The aunswere.</head>
               <p>In your laste consideration, you doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately alledge, that you are not of our Churche, but shewe no sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why you ought not to bee one of our Churche. You saie, we are departed from the churche, in whiche we were baptised, as though, if a manne were Baptised in a Churche of heretikes, he is bounde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the same Churche, and heretical faithe of that Churche, in whiche he was baptised, so that if a manne were baptised in the Churche of Arrianes, Nouatianes, Donatistes, Pelagians, he might not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb facs="tcp:21339:22"/>
the faithe, and Churche, in whiche he was baptised, to become a true Christian catholike. A childe of seuen yere old, maie see how slender a reason it is for a manne, to continue in any Churche, or Religion, because he receiued baptisme therin. For if a Papist maie not become a Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, because he was Baptised in the Popishe churche, by the same reason, a Protestant must not become a Papist, if he were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised in the Protestantes Churche, which you your self by no meanes will graunte.</p>
               <p>The seconde reason you bryng, is of the diuersitye of churches, the Lutherane, the Zwingliane, &amp; the Geneuian. As though the diuersitie of some opinions, not of the greatest importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, maketh diuers chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The churche of Salisburie, the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Yorke, and the churche of Bangor, had some diuersitie in their maner of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, and yet you will saie, thei were all one Popishe Churche. But to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, you recite more names, then there be diuersities of opinions. For Zwingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, and Caluine, in the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, whiche you shoote at, are all one, and Luther differeth from them. And yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21339:22"/>
the difference is not so great, but that thei bee all of one Catholike Churche, because thei agree in the onely foundation, Iesus Christe, and in all opinions, that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Saluation, although Luther in his opinion of the Sacramente (as a man) was deceiued. And that diuersities of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions (so longe as the principall groundes of faithe bee obserued vncorrupted) doeth not make diuersitie of churches, you maie easily see, by this example S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and all the Churches of Affrica, were in this error, that such as were baptised by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, should be baptised again, which was a very perilous errour. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Bishops of Rome, with the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Europe were, in the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And yet no man euer refused S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priane, to bee a member of the Catholike churche, nor iudged the churches of Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, that followed his errour, to bee of any other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuersall church of Christ, emong whom were many martyres, and godly men which liued &amp; died in the same error. Now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare Cypriane, &amp; Luther, the one erring in the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, the other in the Sacramente of the
<pb facs="tcp:21339:23"/>
Supper, if the errour of th'one, did not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate hym from the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church, no more ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the error of the other. Whiche thing, if it were well wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghed, would remoue that sto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blyng blocke, that troubleth many weake persones, but can hinder no learned man, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the controuersie of Luther, and Zwinglius.</p>
               <p>The third reason is, that we are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, from the Churche of Geneua, because we ascribe supreme gouernement, in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall matters, to the Quéenes high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. Firste, we must bee bolde to tell you, that as we reuerence, and honour all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare Churches, where true religion is established, so we doe not grounde our self vpon either the opinion, or custome, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, but onely vpon the worde of God, and so farre foorthe to followe euery one, as thei come neare to the same rule. But whereas you would sette that excellente, godly Churche of Geneua, at variaunce with vs, aboute the supremacie, your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishe quarrellyng, shall easily appeare to all menne. You alledge Caluine againste vs, in twoo places, one in his Institutions, an other in his Comentarie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21339:23"/>
Amos. A man in deede, from whom we would bee lothe to dissente, excepte it were for a greate cause. A manne of suche godlie learnyng, and profounde knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in diuinitie, as all the Papistes, that euer were, are not worthie to carrie his bookes after hym. But before I aunswer you, I muste admonishe you, that either your copies, whiche came to my handes, were verie muche corrupted, or els you haue recited those places by hearesaie, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by your owne obseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Your copies sendeth me to the, viij. Chapiter of his Institutions, namyng no booke, and to the fowerth. Chapiter of Amos, whereas that you speake of the one place, is in the fowerth boke, and twelue Chapiter of his Institutions: the other in the seuen Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter of Amos. So that in deede, it was more labour to seeke your places, then to make aunswere to them. Concerning the firste, I meruaile you were not ashamed, to alledge Caluine againste vs, where he saieth, that Kynges, and Princes, are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to the discipline of the Churche, as Theodosius was content to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by saincte Ambrose, for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:21339:24"/>
he had committed in Thessalonica, (which none of vs denieth) and doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how substauncially he proueth, that godlie Princes haue aucthoritie, and ought to maintain true religion, by lawes decrees, and iudgementes, whiche is all the supreme gouernemente, that wee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the Quéenes highnes.</p>
               <p>And as for the place of Caluine vpon Amos, the truthe is this: Caluine findeth fault, not with kyng He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ry, but with those that did ascribe that title vnto hym, and sheweth for what reason, he misliked the same. Not that he denied his lawfull auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, whiche was meant by that title, of all his godly, and true subiectes: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, Steuen Gardener bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, by false vnderstandyng thereof, declared that he vnderstode nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but the tyrannie, whiche the Pope v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpeth ouer the churche, to be translated vnto the kyng. And therfore at a solemne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference, at Ratisbone in Germanie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Popes aucthoritie by acte of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was abolished out of the realme, he defended all Popishe religion, whiche remained vnreformed, to bee good, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21339:24"/>
godlie, because it was established by the kings aucthoritie, who was supreme head of the churche. He disputed not by reasons, neither cared he for the testimonies of scriptures, but saied, it was in the kynges power, to abrogate all Lawes, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishe what he thought good in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, as to forbidde Priestes marriage, to forbidde laie menne the vse of the Cuppe in the Churche, and all other suche mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he saied, were in the kynges auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. This he saied of the Kynges power abroade, and howe he abused that noble Prince at home, to make the Acte of sixe Articles, and other thynges of like effect, there be many yet aliue, that can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But seeyng this title of supremacie, dooeth so muche offende you, I praie you lette me demaunde one question of you. Who did first inuent it here in England? Or who did first ascribe it to kyng Henry? Was it not the whole Popishe Cleargie of Englande? when thei were caste in the Premunire, for mainteinyng the power Legantine of Cardinall Wolsey, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittyng theim selues vnto the Kynge, they flattered hym with that title, and
<pb facs="tcp:21339:25"/>
offered hym a greate somme of money, for their pardon: as witnesseth Halle, and Grafton in their histories, and ther be yet aliue many, that can reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber it. So that if there were any faulte in it, you should blame them, and not vs for it. For so far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthe, as beyng rightly vnderstoode, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the lawfull power of the Prince, wee did, and doe yelde vnto it, but not in Steuen Gardiners sence, whiche Caluin in the place by you alledged, doeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute.</p>
               <p>After this, you require vs to shewe you a Churche, where vnto you maie resorte, whiche hath continued euen since Christ, whiche if it can not bee shewed, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in th'ende, that Christ had no chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, or els our Churche is not Christes Churche. Againe where our Church was fiftie, or sixtie yeres agon. If a manne had asked of Elias, where the churche of God was in his tyme, he could not haue made aunswere, and yet God had his Churche in Elias tyme.

And yet for fiftie or sixtie yere agone, it had been no harde matter, to haue shewed you diuers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Churche, bothe in Englande, &amp; in Bohemia, as th' historie of the church declareth at large.

For whatsoeuer we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to shewe, for our Churche, I am sure you are neuer able, to shewe your self, for your churche, that whiche you require vs to shewe: namely a churche that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from this tyme vpwarde, vnto the Apostles, that taught vniformely, and in all poinctes, the doctrine that the Popishe Churche nowe teacheth. Whiche thyng when you haue performed, I will doe the like for oure Churche. In the meane time, that whiche is a sufficiente rule, to finde out the true Churche, by the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of Saincte Augustine, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you.

Capi. 2. Inter nos autem &amp; Donatistat, quaestio est, vbi sit ecclesia. Quid ergo facturi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus? In verbis nostris eam quaesituri sumus, an in verbis capitis sui domini nostri Iesu Christi? Puto quod in illius potius verbis eam quaerere debemus, qui veritas est &amp; optimè nouit corpus suum.</hi> Betwene vs, and the Donatistes (saieth saincte Augustine) the question is, where the churche should bée. What shall we doe then? shall we seke her in our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, or in the woordes of her heade, our Lorde Iesus Christ? I thinke that rather in his wordes, we ought to seke her, which is the truthe, and beste knoweth his own bodie. And in the. xvj. chapiter of the same booke, he writeth thus of the Donatistes <hi>Vtrum ipsi ecclesiam teneant, non nisi diuinaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> scripturarum canonicis libris ostendant.</hi> That is, whether thei haue the churche on their side, let theim shewe none otherwise, but by the Canonicall bookes of holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Many other suche testimonies are in S. Augustine, by whiche it is plaine, that he geueth this infallible rule, to knowe the true churche, to examine the doctrine therof, onely by the scriptures. But wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as you saie, that Anabaptistes, Libertines
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21339:26"/>
and Arians, pretende the word of god, and the primitiue Churche, what meane you therby? that we should forsake the worde of god &amp; the Primitiue churche, by whiche all heretikes haue béen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed, what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thei pretended. For though heretikes pretende the scriptures, yet onely by the scriptures thei are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed, &amp; though thei appeale to the iudgemente of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue church, yet by the primitiue church thei are condemned for heretikes. I maie as well say, that Arianes, Libertines, and Anabaptistes, boste them selues to be the true Catholike Churche, therefore wee must not allowe the true catholike chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. It is pitie to see menne, that would be coumpted wise, and learned, to reason so fondly, and vnlearnedly. For of all other reasons, it is the vainest, and feeblest shift that the Papistes vse, to flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the aucthoritie of the Churche, in confutation of heresies. For there was ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer yet heresie did arise, but there was as greate controuersie, of the Churche, as of the opinion: for euery heretike, boasteth as well of the Churche, as of the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, but when all is dooen, his bragges of

bothe, muste bee beaten doune, onely by the scriptures. But because you make so proude vauntes, that you will so plainlie proue, that our Churche hath none agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with the primitiue churche of Christ, in discourse of that controuersie with you, I will sette for the bothe what is the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue churche, and how we agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and I doubte not, but that I shalbee able by the grace of God, bothe to iustifie our cause, againste your false accusations, and also to ouerthrowe youre falshodde, whiche you haue heaped vppe, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme the truthe.</p>

               <p>The very title of your argumentes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, of what force youre argumentes are. Your reasons are tenne in noumber, whiche if thei were all grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to be true yet foloweth not this conclusion, that our Churche hath no agreance, with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche of Christe, excepte you would affirme, that all the doctrine of the Primitiue Churche, were comprehended in these tenne poinctes. Again your owne Popishe Churche differeth, in these tenne poinctes, as muche from the Primitiue Churche, as ours, therefore by your owne Logike, I will conclude, that your Popish churche, hath no agreance with the church of Christ. 1. For neither you haue all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges common, 2. neither dooe you sell your houses, and landes, to putte the price in common. 3. Neither doe you make diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to euery manne, accordyng to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie. 4. Neither are all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of your

Churche so prouided for, that none dooe begge. 5. Neither doe you baptise onely in the name of Christe. 6. Neither dooe you giue the holy ghost, by laiyng on your han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. 7. Neither dooe you restore theim to health, whom you annoincte with oile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng sicke. 8. Neither dooe you make open confession of your synnes. 9. Neither dooe you celebrate the Sacramente, after sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. 10. Neither dooe you abstaine from bloodde, and strangled, therefore by your owne reason, you haue no agreance with the Primitiue Churche of Christe. Or if you maie haue any agreance, these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences notwithstanding, why maie not we the same differences, nothyng lettyng vs, haue sufficient agremente therewith? You see that either your argument is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng worthe, or els you haue as little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greance with the Primatiue churche, as we. Your only refuge is this, that it is not necessary for you, to haue any agreance with the primitiue Churche. And that is the opinion of all Papistes, whiche is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be noted, that you disclaime of al title of the Primitiue Churche, whiche you holde, was but an infante, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21339:28"/>
of your doctrine, and Ceremonies, is growne to bee of womannes state. As though Christ maried his Churche, when she was vnder age, and so the matrimonie was not ratified, and consumated, before the Pope had nourtured her in his schole, vntill she came to yeres of discretion. For it is as lawfull for me, so to inferre vppon your allegorie, as for you so to allegorise of her.</p>
               <p>But that you maie the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, what we meane by the primitiue Churche, I putte you out of doubte, that none of vs doeth attribute vnto her, suche long limites, as you doe in your argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, gathered out of the Doctours: where you alledge the seconde counsaill of Nice, as a determination of the primitiue chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, whiche was holden almoste eight hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres after Christe. Of whiche thing you were not ignoraunt, but you thought it was sufficiente, to fill vnlearned eares, with greate blastes, voide of all reason, or truthe. Wherefore, when wee appeale to the Primitiue Churche, wee meane the Churche of the Apostles, and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, so longe as thei continue in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb facs="tcp:21339:29"/>
of the Apostles, whereof triall is to be made, by the Canonicall writynges of the Apostles. That wheras you accuse vs for departyng fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your churche, as though we were of no Churche, wee defende our selues to be of the true churche, seyng wée retaine the faithe, and doctrine of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churche, whiche without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, was the true churche. Now as I haue shewed you, what we accompte to bee the primitiue churche, so muste I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, in what thynges wee are bounde to consente, and agree with the same. For whiche purpose, we must marke this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whiche I suppose, no Papist is so farre paste shame, to deny: namely, that in the primitiue Churche, some thynges were necessarie, and immutable, some thynges againe were temporall, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Of the firste sorte is the doctrine, and Sacramentes, of the latter sorte are Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and politike constitutions. To the doctrine no manne maie adde, no man maie diminishe, no manne maie alter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thyng thereof. The Sacramentes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, as Augustine calleth theim, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woorde, bee of the same nature with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21339:29"/>
the doctrine. On the other side, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and publike constitutions, mate bee reteined, or chaunged, as thei make beste for edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for order, and for comelines. And of this latter sorte, are all those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche you alledge, in which we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the primitiue churche. But yet, so longe as we holde still the same faithe, and the same Sacramentes, whiche are lefte to vs by the primitiue Churche, all reasonable men will iudge, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng your reasons, wee haue suche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greance with the primitiue Churche, as may proue vs to be members of the same. For it is the vnitie of faithe, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, not of Ceremonies, and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ioigneth vs vnto the bodie of Christe, as witnesseth sainct Paule to the Ephesi. iiij.

Firste the faithfull bringyng
<pb facs="tcp:21339:36"/>
forthe certeine examples of their actions, acknowledge how they were seduced by the deuill before they embraced the faith: the popes law compelleth men to reherse all their deedes, wordes, and thoughtes. These men made their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession once, the popes law requireth eche man to confesse euery yere once at least, these came forth to this confession of their owne accorde, the pope compelleth all men vppon neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of saluation. Againe the text saieth, that many came, but not all, the popes lawe excepteth none, these Ephesians made open confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before al the church, as you your selfe acknowledge, the pope commaundeth euery man to whisper his confession, into a préestes eare.

And wheras you saie, we deny the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penaunce, and all the partes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The truth is, we preache repentance, as we are commaunded, by the woorde of God, but no Sacrament of penance, dooe wee finde in the Scripture, what you meane by the partes of penance, I cannot well tell, but if it be those three, that bee

Thei are suche, as a verie limme of the Deuill, maie performe, and yet goe to the Deuill, when he hath dooen. Example in Iudas Iscarioth, who hadde contrition of harte, as the Scripture teacheth, when he was sorie for his facte.

You see, that Iudas lacked none of youre three partes of penaunce, but he lacked faithe, without the whiche, all contrition, confession, and outward satisfaction is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng auailable.

In this decree of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile, twoo thynges especially are to bee noted. Firste, that the three dippynges was not alwaies, and in all places obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as a necessarie matter: and therefore your argumente is fallen to the grounde, Secondely, that it is profitable to alter, and chaunge suche Ceremoeies, as are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of heretikes, that wee seme not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with theim in any thyng, in whiche it is lawful for vs to disagree. And for this consideration, doe we refuse to dip thrise, because we would not seme to agrée with you, whiche are heretikes, although wee acknowledge, that of it self, it is a thyng indifferente, to dippe twise, or thrise, or ones, or not at al to dip, but onely to poure on water, in signe of that spirituall ablu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiche is represented by that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente
<pb facs="tcp:21339:44"/>
of Baptisme. Wherefore, you haue a verie quicke sight, that can espie a knotte in a Rushe, and of so small a gnat, to make so great an Elephante, as though all Christianitie stoode in thrise dippyng of a child in Baptisme, whiche I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not onely, not to haue been alwaies obserued, but also by decree of a Counsaill to haue been expressely forbidden. Which Ceremonie, although it bee noumbred e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the canons, commonly called of the Apostles, yet hath he a meane iudgement in antiquitie, that can not descerne theim from Apostolike writynges. But because you bryng in the Tradition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, you muste nedes giue me leaue, to presse you, with the same aucthoritie, and to shewe that you your self, obserue not the Traditions of the Apostles. In the vj. Canon of the Apostles, it is commaunded that no Bishoppe, Prieste, nor Deacon, shall put awaie his wife, vnder colour of religion, and thei that doe so shall be exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. And in the ninthe, and tenthe Canons it is decreed, that whosoeuer is presente at the Communion, and dooeth not communicate, that he should bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.

For many of theim (if your owne aucthours dooe not lye) were instituted by diuers Popes of Rome, long after the age of the Apostles. And some it is plaine, were inuented by heretikes. For the firste that we read of, in any auncient, and authenticall writer, that hadde in reuerence the signe of the Crosse, were the Valentiniane heretikes as witnesseth <hi>Irenaeus, libri primi. Capit. 1.</hi> whiche thei called <hi>Oron crucem confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uam,</hi> the strengthenyng Crosse.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21339:48"/>
forbidde that I should reioyce, but in the Crosse of Christe. But afterwarde true Christians vsed that signe, to testifie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heathen menne, that thei were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and were not ashamed of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death of Christ, whiche the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did dispightfully caste in their teeth, and at length it grewe to a meare super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and laste of all, to moste horrible Idolatrie, when the Image of the Crosse was worshipped, sensed, and praied vnto.</p>
               <p>Praier towarde the Easte, was vsed of the Christians, in the aunciente Church, to testifie, that thei differed from the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, who praied towarde the West, least thei should seem to worshippe the Sunne risyng, as the Gentiles did. And although woordes of inuocation were vsed, at the shewyng of the bread, and the Cuppe, yet was there no inuocation, of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall breade and Cuppe, but of God.</p>
               <p>Of the other Ceremonies, of anoinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, and thrise dipping, hath been spoken before. That the Apostles vsed no suche blessyng of the water of Baptisme, as you doe, it is manifeste, when thei Baptised in euery Riuer, and Brooke that thei came

to. In dedè thei did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate the water for that time, when they vsed it to serue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy vse, but did putte no holines into it which should remain after that baptisme was ministred with it, as you doe.

Of exorcisme, there was some vse in the auncient chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, but of salte, &amp; spittle, which neuer are not mentioned in that place of Basile. As there were many possessed with Deuills, so there was some, that that had this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the holie ghost, to caste out Deuils whiche were called exoreistes, as witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth S.

Cap. 4.</hi> There was but one Aulter in all the Churche, whiche stoode not againste the furthest wall, at the East ende of the Churche, as your Aulters, but in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the Churche, and was compassed rounde aboute with Grates or Lattesses of woodde, which were called <hi>Cancells,</hi> the Chauncel, with in whiche place so incloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the Communion was ministred, and at the time of the ministration, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Deacones, stoode round aboute the Aulter, whiche is a manifest proofe,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21339:51"/>
that it was not an Aulter against a wall, like youres, but a Table standyng in the middest as ours is. Laste of all, what they vnderstode by the name of sacrifice, I will discloase by one Testimonie of Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, whiche shalbe in steade of a greate number. For this he writeth vpon the. x. chapiter to the Hebrues. <hi>Hom.</hi> 17. Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the sacrifice, whiche the Churche doth offer. <hi>Hoc autem quod facimus in come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moratione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quidem fit eius quod factum est.

For he saied, doe this in remembraunce of me, we dooe not offer an other Sacrifice, as the high Prieste, but wee offer the selfe same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, or rather we exercise the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that sacrifice. By this testimony of Chrisostome, it is euident, that the olde writers, when thei spake of Sacrifice, did not meane the Popishe sacrifice of the Masse, but onely the remembrance of the sacrifice of Christe, which is the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

The Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Beda, concernyng Augustine the Monke, that came into Englande, which you alleged, is neither aunciente, beyng aboue sixe hundred yeres after Christe, neither yet of auctoritie to bee followed, the same Augustine beyng a superstitious proude, cruell, and vnlearned Monke.

So the Churche knoweth to preache, these are the medicines of healyng. You see here that Epiphanius, woulde haue suche as

By these witnesses it is apparant, that all auncient fathers, be not of your iudgement, if wee shall beleue their owne writinges, rather then your saiynges.

For I dooe not well remember, whose Image it was. Therefore when I sawe, this thing, that the Image of a man was hanged vp, in the Churche, contrary to the aucthoritie of the Scriptures, I did rende it in péeces, and gaue counsaile to the kepers of that place, rather to wrappe it about some poore bodie that was deade, to burie hym with all.

an other vaile for it, and so chaunge it. Whiche thing when I heard, I promised, that I would giue theim one, aad sende it shortlie.

And I praie you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the Elders of that place, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that Vaile of this bearer, whiche is sente by vs. And to giue theim charge, that hereafter in the Churche of Christe, suche vailes bee not hanged vp, whiche are contrary to our Religion. This writeth Epiphanius to Ihon bishoppe of Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, by whiche it is euidente, what was thought of Images, at that tyme, when a painted vaile, might not bée hanged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Churche doore, to keepe out the winde, or for some suche purpose, and not in any respect of religion, or worshipping. The same Epiphanius, emong the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of Carpocrates rehearseth, that he made priuilie the Image of Iesu, &amp; Paule Homer, and Pithagoras, and worshipped them. Also he inueigheth sharply against

the <hi>Antidicomarians,</hi> and <hi>Collyridians,</hi> for vsyng, and worshippyng the Image of Marie the Virgine. As for your testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, out of Gregorie Nyssene, and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, serue nothyng to the purpose, for Gregorie speaketh not of the historie of Christes passion, as you vntruely report, but of the oblation of Isaac, by his father Abraham. <hi>Conc.

               <p>And Chrysostome in his saiyng, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth not, that therefore we must haue Images of GOD, and of Christe in the Churche, but he that doeth iniurie to any manne, that is made after the Image of god, or disobeieth a Magistrate, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth the persone of God. &amp;c. He doth iniurie to God. For he that maketh any Image of God, doeth God greate iniurie, transformyng the glorie of the inuisible GOD, into the shape of any corruptible creature. Rom. j. But what Chrysostome and diuers other godlie fathers, thought of the vse of Images, in the churche, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed in the counsaile of Ephesus, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21339:59"/>
condemned Images before the Counsaile of Nice, whiche restored theim. And the Counsaile <hi>Elibertinum,</hi> fower hundreth yeres before that, vnder Constantine the greate, made this decree. <hi>Capt. xxxvi. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit picturas in ecclesia esse non debere, ne quod colitur aut adoratur, in parietibus depinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> That is.

And so all thei that followed your Augustines supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were iustely blinded, and deceiued, because thei sought not Christ in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but in painted Tables, whiche is the punishemente due for Idolatrie, as sainct Paule testifieth.

But the celebration of the communion, for thus he writeth in the same Epistle against <hi>Vrbicus. Dicit cessisse pani pecus, tanquam nesciens &amp; tunc in domini mensa, panes propositionis poni solere, &amp; nunc se de agni immaculati corpore partem sumere, dicit cessisse poculo sanguinem, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cogitans etiam nunc se accipere in poculo sanguinem.</hi> He saith that the Shepe hath giuen place to the breade, as though he were ignoraunt, that then also the Shewbread, was vsed to bée sette on the Lordes boarde, and that now

When we affirme, that Christe onely is the heade of his vniuersall Churche, wee doe it not to the honour of Christ, but wée include y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> negation of a farre better thing, that is the supremacie of the Pope. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by your assertion, is a farre more bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21339:83"/>
thyng, then the supremacie of Christ. So when we affirme, that onely the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture must bee the rule of true Religion, it maketh nothyng for Religion, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe God as he hath commaunded, but it includeth a negation of vnwritten ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, whiche are farre more better thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then the scripture. When we affirme that we must put our trust in God alone, we doe no honour to God therby: but we denie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men muste put their trust in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which by your rule, is a farre more better thyng, then to putte our truste in God alone. When wee affirme, that wée must praie to God alone, it perteineth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng, to Gods seruice, but includeth the negation, of praiyng vnto sainctes, whiche is a farre more better thyng, then to pray vnto God. And when we affirme, that the onely Sacrifice of Christes passion, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiente for our saluation, we yelde no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God thereby, but denie the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse, whiche is a farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thyng, then the Sacrifice of Christes passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

As it is written of Abraham, not for hym onely (as saincte Paule testifieth) but for vs also, Abraham beleued God, and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse: so that faithe doeth not iustifie vs by the merite, or worthinesse therof, but by Goddes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteousnes therevnto. For to be iustified before GOD, is not to bee righteous by any qualitie that is in vs, but to be accoumpted righteous of GOD for Christes sake, hauing our synnes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by his passion. But whereas you take vpon you, to talke of iustification, and that so substancially, that you wil tell vs what all learnyng agreeth thereof, you declare that youre learnyng, and discretion are bothe a like. For it were enough for you, to speake of all your owne learning, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che you knowe, and not of all learnyng in

generall, whiche you knowe not. It is not by and by all lernyng, that the Maister of the Sentence, and after hym all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenciaries, and whole rable of Papistes also doe holde. There is some learnyng of the olde writers, and there is some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the newe writers. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes I trust, bee not voide of all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. It were sufficiente for you, to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge truthe, though you did not boaste of all learning. But seyng all learnyng is on your side, as you saie your self, will you giue a poore manne of small learnyng, leaue, to aske you one question, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng that diuision, whiche all learnyng dooeth agree of? Is this your diuision, of the worde of iustification? Or of the thing it self, whiche is Iustification. If it be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the woorde iustification (sauyng the correction of all learnyng) I finde in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture three other diuerse kindes of iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of whiche neuer a one, can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in any of your three kindes of iustification. The firste is, in the. Lj. Psalme. <hi>Vt iustificeris in sermonibus tuis, &amp; vincas cum iudicaris.</hi> That thou maiest bee iustified in thy saiynges, and gette the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21339:90"/>
hande, when thou art iudged. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, is in the eleuenth chapiter of sainct Matthew. <hi>Iustificata est sapientia a filijs suis.</hi> Wisedome is iustified of her own childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The thirde is. j. Timo. iij. <hi>Deus manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est in carne, iustificatus est in spiritu. &amp;c.</hi> God was shewed in the fleshe, iustified in the spirite. &amp;c. Loe heare, are three seueral iustifications more, then your learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision dooeth conteine. But if you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande your diuision, not of the diuerses acceptions of the worde, but of the thyng it self, I would demaunde by what kinde of iustification, the Publicane was iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, of whom our sauiour Christe dooeth testifie, that he departed iustified, rather then the Pharisie. Luke. xviij. The firste kinde you saie, is by Baptisme, but he was not baptised, the seconde you make by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, but he receiued no penaunce: and by the thirde kinde, he could not bee iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for he came thether a Publicane, and a synner, Therefore all learning hath left out one kinde of Iustification, whiche Christe hymself doeth teache. And that is the onely true iustification, whereof wee meane, when our synnes beyng pardoned
<pb facs="tcp:21339:91"/>
by the free mercie of God in Christe, wée are accoumpted righteous before hym, whiche is confirmed to vs, when wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue his promises therof. And this is that iustification, whereof sainct Paule dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at large, in the Epistle to the Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. By whiche it maie appeare, what a clearkly diuision you haue made, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the onely true iustification, which is the thing we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tende of, and is so moste properly called. But now to consider righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, the partes of your diuision. You saie, the firste kinde of iustification, is when of an vngodlie manne, is made a godly man. Whiche if it were rightly vnderstoode, is the same iustification, that we speake of, when we saie onely faithe dooeth iustifie. But when you restraine it to Baptisme of infauntes, you are farre wide from our vnderstandyng, and from the truthe. For what is Baptisme to vs, more then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was to Abraham? but Abraham was not iustified by Circumsition, as S. Paule proueth at large, therefore neither are we iustified by Baptisme. But Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was iustified by faithe, and receiued Circumsition, as a seale of his iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21339:91"/>
So we beyng iustified by faith, receiue Baptisme, as a seale of our righteousnes, whiche is by faithe. Thus we doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the Sacramente of Baptisme, as you moste shamefully doe slaunder vs, but we shewe the right vse, and profite thereof, out of the scriptures. For when wee haue receiued by faithe, the promises of Gods fauour, and mercie, in whiche our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dependeth, we doe not refuse the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, whiche are the Sacramentes, whiche GOD hath added for confirmation of our faithe. But whereas you restraine this iustification to infauntes, you shewe your ignoraunce in the Scriptures, for he that <hi>ex impio fit iustus,</hi> that is, of a wicked man is made righteous, muste beleue in hym that iustifieth the vngodlie manne, as it is in saincte Paule. Roma. iiij. and so his faithe is imputed, or accoumpted to hym for righteousnesse, and in suche sorte, that it is without respecte of woorkes, whiche is nothyng els, but that wee affirme, an vngodlie manne is iustified by faithe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for what woorkes canne he haue, that should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curre with faithe, to iustifie him, whiche is an vngodly manne, before he be
<pb facs="tcp:21339:92"/>
iustified, and therefore Augustine saieth verie well of good woorkes. <hi>Sequuntur iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificatum, non praecedunt iustificandum.</hi> Thei followe hym that is iustified, thei goe not before hym that is to bee iustified. Seyng therefore, that faithe is necessarie in this iustification, and infauntes (to speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) haue no faithe, this iustification can not bee restrained to Baptisme of infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which if thei dye before thei heare the worde of God preached, that thei maie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, are saued by election, if thei bee the children of God, and not by faithe. For as the doctrine of faithe, perteineth to theim onely, that liue to heare the Gospell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, to whiche thei maie giue credite, and bryng for the fruictes of good woorkes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyngly, to the praise of Goddes glorie: So the doctrine of Iustification, by faithe onely, pertaineth to theim, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes. And therefore your assertion, that infantes are iustified by Baptisme, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth nearer to the errour of the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes, for bothe you, and thei require faith necessarie, to bee in all them that shall bee Baptised, wherevpon springeth twoo he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, the one of the Anabaptistes, deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng

Whereas the saiyng of our sauiour Christe, whiche is misunderstoode of you bothe (he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth, and is baptised, shalbe saued) must with all equitie, be expounded, accordyng to the matter whereof he speaketh, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the wordes goyng before. Which are, Goe into all the worlde, and preache the Gospell to euery creature. Mat. xxviij. Mark. xvj. So that where preachyng hath gone before, their faithe is necessarie to saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and necessarie to be required, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a manne bee Baptised. For we must remember, that our sauiour Christ, doeth not in that place, institute Baptisme, but shewe how it must bee added, as a seale of the Gospell, for confirmation of the bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and for a testimonie of their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But seyng that God hath also a secret operation in Baptisme, whereby the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD are regenerate, by his holy spirite, and that the fauour of God, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by his promise, not only to our selfes, but also to the seede of vs that are faithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb facs="tcp:21339:93"/>
we minister the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, to our infantes also, because thei are comprehended within the compasse of Gods couenaunte, and therefore ought to haue the seale, and cognisaunce of Goddes couenaunte sette vpon them. And yet not bindyng the grace of GOD so straightly, to the outwarde Elemente, but that, he maie saue the children of the faithfull, without Baptisme, whom he taketh out of this life, before thei can receiue this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente in the churche, accordyng to his holie institution.</p>
               <p>And this iustification by faithe onely, we doe not make to be an inconstant qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of righteousnes, that should be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, whiche is abolished so often as wee fall into synne, but a perpetuall accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, wherby he imputeth not our synnes vnto vs, but accoumpteth vs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, for the righteousnes of Christe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng as sainct Paule difineth iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by faithe, without workes, out of the xxxj.

Roma. iiij. For whom God dooeth iustifie by faithe, he dooeth not iustifie them for a daie, or a yere, but for euer, as S. Paule testifieth, whom he hath iustified, he hath glorified. Roma. viij. Whereby it is easie to see, what a vaine iustification that is, whiche you make to be your second kinde by penaunce, whiche is loste, by euery fall into deadly synne, of whiche kinde of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, the scripture speaketh not one woorde, but it is a fantasie of youre owne braine, to sette vp a Butcherie of mennes consciences, and to make your selues Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ouer their consciences, by binding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon necessitie of saluation, to your beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly Penaunce. For although a manne that is regenerate, and iustified of God, is not onely subiecte to infinite falles, as the scripture testifieth (the righteous manne falleth seuen tymes a daie, and riseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) but also sometymes falleth into greate, and notable crimes, as Dauid into murther, and adulterie, yet can he neuer fall from the fauour of God, but that he is called to repentaunce, and his synnes are forgiuen hym. For this foundation shall neuer faile, the Lorde knoweth who are
<pb facs="tcp:21339:94"/>
his, and whom soeuer he hath knowen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all tyme, theim he will call in tyme thought conuenient to his wisedome, and theim who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath so called, he hath iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and whom soeuer he hath iustified, he will glorifie eternally. Roma. viij. And in this iustification, whereby God receiueth vs into his fauour, and pardonyng our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, imputeth rightousnes vnto vs, there is no degrees, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doeth iustifie vs, he maketh vs his children, and so his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that wee are his heires, and heires by adoption, annexed with Christe his onely begotten soonne by nature. Roma. viij. Wherefore althoughe faithe, and good woorkes, the one beyng the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to receiue, the other beyng the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to shewe our iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, maie, &amp; ought to increase daiely in vs, that are iustified: Yet our iustification before GOD, is not thereby increased, who imputeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse vnto vs, for Christes sake alone, and not for our owne worthines. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is euidente, how vnlike youre thirde kinde of iustification, is to the iustification of God, who iustifieth not the righteous, but the vngodlie manne, that beleueth in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21339:94"/>
hym. And as for the testimonie that you alledge, out of the Apocalipse, although it maie haue a true meanyng, that he which is iuste, maie bee made more iuste, and he that is holie, maie bee made more holie, whiche is of the increase of vertues, and not of iustification: yet the beste interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, accordyng to the Greke phrase, is rather of continuance, then increase, and so it is beste translated, he that is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, lette hym be righteous still, and he that is holie, let hym be holie still. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you se vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how weake a foundation, youre thirde kinde of iustification dooeth leane, namely vpon a corrupte translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But admitte it bee so, as you dooe take it, there is greate difference betwene a iuste manne, and a manne iustified. For a iuste manne, is he, that is indued with the vertue of iustice, whiche maie increase, or diminishe in hym: But a iustified manne is he, whose synnes are forgiuen hym, and he accoumpted rightous, not for his owne worthinesse, but for Christes sake, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although the vertue of iustice, which is a qualitie in hym, may increase, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Goddes sight, there is no respecte
<pb facs="tcp:21339:95"/>
of his worthines, his iustification can not increase therby. For what can he be more then the soonne of GOD, and inheritour with Christ, of the kyngdome of heauen. If you saie, he maie haue greater reward, that hath greater vertues, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende againste you, so that this bee reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that his vertues are rewarded, not as his merites; but as Gods giftes, for his promise sake. So that a iuste, or righteous man, is he that exerciseth hymself, in the kepyng of Goddes commaundementes, so neare as God shall giue hym grace, and the infirmitie of mannes corrupt nature, will admitte. But a iustified manne, is he that hauyng no iustice, or righteousnesse in hym before, is accepted of God for iust, his iniquities being pardoned, and his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes couered. And for them that be simple, an example will make the matter plaine. There are twoo menne standyng before a prince, the one that hath not transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the princes lawes, whiche maie be cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led a iuste manne: The other that hath greuously offended, and is pardoned of the prince, whiche maie well bee termed a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified manne. But this difference there
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21339:95"/>
is to be noted, in this example, that before God, none can bee iuste, or righteous, but he that is firste iustified, neither can any manne be so iuste, but that he offendeth in many thynges, and hath neede of greate mercie. Thus it is cleare, how impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly the increase of faithe, and good woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, with tertes of Scripture belongyng thereto are of you drawne to iustification before God. Wherefore by our affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that onely faithe iustifieth, we neither denie the exercise, and commoditie of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes Sacramentes, nor yet the studie, and practise of all good woorkes, commaunded of God, but rather established them: when we teache, that the Sacramentes are sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and confirmation of this faithe, and good workes, are the fruites of the same: firste to the glorie of God: secondly for the example af others: and thirdly, for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of our election to vs warde, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of our rewarde before God. And as for that, whiche you alledge out of saincte Augustine, whiche of all other writers, is moste cleare of our iudgemente, for elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, iustification, and sainctification, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothyng in the worlde againste vs.
<pb facs="tcp:21339:96"/>
For wee dooe not teache (as I haue often saied) that a bare faithe alone, whiche is voide of good woorkes, is sufficiente for our saluation, but that a true, liuely, and fruitefull faithe, onely dooeth iustifie vs before God, that GOD maie haue all the glory, of our saluation in Christ: And that sanctification, or good woorkes, of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie must followe a iustified man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God maie bee glorified, his neighbour profited, and himself rewarded, not of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite due to his woorkes, but of mercie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to Goddes promise.</p>
               <p>And that whiche sainct Iames speaketh of faieth, that it dooeth not iustifie, alone, he meaneth, as he himselfe expoundeth, of a deade faithe, whiche is voide of good woorkes, of an historicall faith, that there is one God. &amp;c. whiche the diuell beleueth, not of a liuely faithe, whiche worketh by charitie, nor of a iustifiyng faithe, whiche embraceth the mercie of God set forthe in his promises. So that this saiyng of sainct Iames, a man is not iustified by faithe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, is all one with this, a deade faith or an historicall faieth doth not iustifie, whiche we doe alwaies affirme. And whereas he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21339:96"/>
speaketh of iustification by woorkes, hee meaneth of argumentes proues, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine signes to the worlde, of iustification before God, as it is manifest by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. For Abraham was iustified before God by faith, without respect of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, as sainct Paule doth testifie, when he beleued the promise, and that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saied his faithe was imputed to hym for rightousnes, whiche was long before he offered his soonne Isaake: but this his obedience, was a triall and manifest testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, of his iustification by faithe, to all the worlde, whereuppon as saincte Iames concludeth, it was euident to al men, how this scripture was fulfilled: Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued God, and it was imputed to hym for righteousnes. Likewise the harlot <hi>Rahab,</hi> as witnesseth the Apostle to the Hebrues the. 11. was iustified by faith, when she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued the worde of God, concernyng the destruction of her Countrie, and all them that did not ioigne theimselues to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of god: but she shewed the fruict of this faith, when she enterteined and dismissed the spies, that came to her house. So that by this distinction, of faithe and iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:21339:97"/>
sainct Iames agréeth with S. Paule, whiche without it, can neuer by reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For that confusion of faithe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, which the papistes make to concurre in iustification, can neuer make theim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, for sainct Paule doth flattly exclude workes from that office. Wee determine saieth he, that a man is iustified by faithe without the workes of the lawe. Rom. 3. But this is the iudgement of both the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, that a liuely faithe alone doth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie. The one affirmeth, that nothing is required to iustifie but faithe, the other affirmeth, that faithe whiche onely is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as sufficient to iustification, is not deade, solitary or vnfruictfull, but liuely, fruictfull, &amp; accompanied with manie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, &amp; good workes. For he that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth his sinnes to be forgeuen of God for Christes sake, and that he is receiued of God as his childe (whiche is to be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) must needes loue God, and all theym that loue God, muste néedes haue a desier to obeye God, honour God, to be thancke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God, and to profette all theim, that God hath commaunded hym to loue. And this is the worste effecte of onely faithe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21339:97"/>
iustifiyng. But because you make it so straunge a matter, as though it had neuer been heard of in the worlde before nowe, that faithe alone or onely faithe doth iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, I will rehearse you the sentences of a fewe doctours, that I haue readde, whiche in plaine wordes affirmed the same, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeres before you and I were borne. Not doubtyng but they, that haue redde more then I, are able to bring forth a greate deale more then I haue brought.</p>

of Iesus Christe. For so muche as the free will of manne is the seate of grace, and the mansion house of faieth, whereby faieth is produced and brought foorth by the grace of God, as chiefe agent and worker thereof, and in the will of man, as in an apte recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackle and place to receiue the same, when no man canne beleue but he that will. And therfore for man to beleue both these two thinges are necessarilie required. First is the acte of Gods grace, stirryng and mouynge the will of man therunto, second is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente of mannes will to applie, and receiue the same, without the whiche consente of mannes will, Goddes grace knocketh all in vaine. As it appeareth by the citezeins of Hierusalem, vnto whom our sauior Christ saieth in the Gospell. Hierusalem, Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, whiche dooest slaie the Prophetes, and stonest them to death, that are sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, how often tymes would I haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thy children, like as a Henne gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her chickens, vnderneath her wynges, and thou wouldest not.

The Apostle saincte Paule, in witnesse thereof saieth, by the grace of God, I am that I am, and his grace in me was not in vaine, but I haue laboured more aboundantly then thei all, and not I saieth saincte Paule, but the grace of God with me, and not without me as workyng before in me, and without my consente, but <hi>mecum,</hi> with me.

               <p>It is a greate marueile to see you, and suche as you are, that boaste of your free will, to bee so obstinately blinde, that you will not see the truthe, but that wee dooe acknowledge the iuste iudgement of God in those that striue against him. But to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide al your cauilling of free will, where by you goe about to amase the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, of suche as bee simple, I will firste shewe, what we teache of free will, and then aunswere your peuishe Sophistrie. And because the name of free will, is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, and of diuers significations, it is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21339:117"/>
expediente, to sette foorthe the sonderie meanynges thereof. Free will is somety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes taken as it is contrary to coacted or constrained will. Sometymes as it is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to a seruile, or bonde wille. And sometymes as it is, the election of that, whiche seemeth good, and is contrary to refusyng. But in the ambiguitie, of the twoo former significations, all the doubte of this controuersie dooeth consiste, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we determine after this maner. That manne before his falle, had free will, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery respecte: he might haue chosen freely without any lette, or compulsion, that whiche was good in deede, and acceptable to God: For there was in his nature, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to prouoke hym to euill. But man after his falle, bothe in hymself, and in all his posteritie, hath vtterly loste that free will, whiche I make the seconde meaning of the woorde, and hath his will, now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together seruile, and bounde, so that he can will nothyng of hym self, that is good, and acceptable before God. And therefore the scripture saieth. Genesis the. vj. and viij. That all the immaginations of the thoughtes of mennes hartes, are onely
<pb facs="tcp:21339:118"/>
euill continually. Our sauiour Christ also Matth. xv. teacheth, that out of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte harte of manne, proceadeth all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. And saincte Paule. ij. Corin. iij. affirmeth, that we are not apte <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of our selues, as of our selues, to thinke any thyng, that perteineth to the glorie of God. With an infinite noumber of places beside, to the same effect, through out the Scripture, declaryng that before we be regenerate, and borne a newe, wée can will nothyng but that whiche is well. Neuerthelesse, wee dooe not deny, that a manne hath free will in the firste mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, for although his wille is bonde, and slaue vnto synne, before it bee made free, by the grace of God, yet is it not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor enforced by any externall coaction or Stoicall necessitie vnto euill, but volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily embraceth that, whiche is euill, and delighteth therein, and voluntarily doeth refuse goodnesse, and pleaseth it self in ille doyng. As for the thirde kinde of free will, whiche is an appetite, or election of that, whiche seemeth good, continueth in man after his fall (but yet subiecte to Gods prouidence) whereby he guideth all his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21339:118"/>
externall actions, but this is vnproperly called free wille, and therefore maie bee well omitted in this disputation. The whole matter of doubte resteth therefore in this, whether a manne hath his will so free, and vncorrupted, that he can discerne any thyng in true godlinesse, and applie hym selfe to receiue it. And here in this your discourse, a manne can hardely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, whether you defende free will sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie with the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> or partly with the Papistes. But this is the maner of you all, to shewe your self, where you dare for shame, plaine <hi>Pelagians</hi> in deede, for all your diuinitie of free wil, is out of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and not out of Gods woorde, but when you be pressed with the aucthoritie of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to flie to some sorie shift of defence. But it is all one in a maner, to confute the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and you, when it is proued out of the woorde of God, that the grace and goodnesse of God, woorketh all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whatsoeuer is good in them that are regenerate. For it is neither of hym that willeth, nor of hym that runneth, but of GOD onely, that sheweth the mercie. Therefore it is no harde mater, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
<pb facs="tcp:21339:119"/>
moste of your cauillations, with that one distinction of free will, whiche is either free from coaction, and compulsion, or free from corruption, and bondage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to synne. As when you wrangle of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of faithe, that no manne beleueth but he that will, I aunswere, no manne is compelled to beleue, but he that bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, dooeth beleue willingly, and of his owne accorde, but that he hath a wille to beleue, is not of hymself, but of God. For GOD dooeth not onely offer mercie to our wille, but also geueth vs a wille to receiue it. As saincte Paule testifieth, God woorketh in vs, bothe to will, and to performe whatsoeuer is good, and pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to our saluation. Phili. ij. And where God giueth not a will, there menne can not beleue, though grace, and mercie bee offered vnto theim. As saincte Ihon testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in the. xij. Chapiter of his Gospell, that the Iewes after so longe preachyng, and so many miracles woorkyng emong the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did not beleue in him, and thei did not beleue, because thei could not beleue in hym, for that God, accordyng to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of Esaie, had geuen theim ouer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21339:119"/>
a reprobate mynde. But if euery man had free will, as you defende it, it mighte not bee truely saied of any menne, thei could not beleue, because God had blinded their iyes, and hardened their harte. For you holde, that euery manne maie beleue that wille, and that euery manne hath this wille, in his owne power. And the firste parte of the sentence in some respect maie be graunted, that eche manne maie beleue that wille, but the seconde parte is altogether false, that eche manne hath this wille in his power. But those onely whom God hath appoincted to saluation, he maketh willyng to beleue, that thei maie bee saued.</p>
               <p>And whereas you quarell, that Christe would haue gathered, and Hierusalem would not, it maketh nothyng to proue, that the Iewes had power of their wille, to receiue Christe, whiche sainct Ihon vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denieth, saiyng, thei could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue. And concerning the will of God, and Christe, you should not bee ignoraunte of that distinction, whiche youre Sentiaries dooeth acknowledge. That there is one will of Goddes determination, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:21339:120"/>
of his precepte, or commaundement, whiche thei call <hi>voluntatem signi.</hi> As when GOD commaunded Abraham, to kill his soonne, he declared one wille by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente, and yet the ende declared that he willed not the deathe of Isaac. These diuerse willes, are not repugnant in God, neither dooeth he intende, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thynges by theim, but suche as maie well stande together. For he determined to saue Isaac, for his promise sake, and yet to trie the obedience of Abraham, by the commaundemente. So when Christe preached to Hierusalem, he determined to call those onely, that were elect of God, and yet to make the other inexcusable, when he offered mercie vnto theim, and they by no meanes would receiue it. The reste that you adde, of the consent of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes will, to bee necessarie vnto iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is so impertinent, that I muse what you meaned to speake one woorde of it. For who euer saied that God woorketh in the faithe of a manne as in a Stocke or Stone, or who euer denied the consent of a mannes will to be required in beleuing? This is no parte of the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21339:120"/>
euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is not predestinat of god to saluation, hath it in his power to consent vnto faith, that he maie bee iustified, and so be saued, which is cleane to ouerthrowe the election and predestination of God, which is the chief foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our faith, &amp; conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ouerthrow the power, wisdome, glorie and aucthoritie of God ouer his creatures. For if euery able and scilful workeman, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth of the ende and vse of his worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, before he beginneth it: with what reason can we take that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creator of all thinges, who as Salomon witnesseth, made all thinges for his owne glory, euen the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man for the daie of his wrath. Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is verie clerkely, that we haue driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all thinges to faith alone, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all is duely examined, wee haue no fathe at all. When <hi>Zeno</hi> had disputed longe that there was no mouynge, <hi>Diogenes</hi> walked vp and doune his scole, and beeyng demaunded, what he was doing, he aunswered I am confuting of <hi>Zeno</hi> his argumentes. In whiche behauour he shewed a dooble example of wisedome, first because he vouchesaued not to au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>swere the subtilties of <hi>Zeno</hi> in so vaine a matter, &amp; secondly for that his sensible action, did suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confute the Philosophers vaine spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.
<pb facs="tcp:21339:121"/>
We will therefore holde our peace in this case, and let the matter it self speake for vs. If it were not that wee had faithe to Godward, why should we troble our selues in this controuersie of religion? If we sough riches, honour, pleasures, or whatsoeuer the outwarde man can wishe for, where should we sooner finde it, then in Popery? If wee sought any thing in this life by our professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why should we not leaue it in time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? Let the life &amp; death therfore of theim that haue suffered martirdome for our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, declare whether for maintenaunce of faithe and truste in God, or for confidence in the worlde, we haue taken this contention in hande. But seing you are disposed to dally with vs in deniyng our faithe, you shal geue me leaue to disproue in good earnest, your iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. For if you haue none other but these thrée, which al learnyng (you saie) doth agree of, I suppose it not vnpossible by your owne learning, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince that iustification in papistry, is either very vaine, or els none at all. And because your distinction is so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterus of it self, it shal not be against order to begin with the last kinde firste, whiche is (you saie) when of a iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made a more iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If no man be iust, how can there be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21339:121"/>
degrees in iustification? If the scripture teache (as I wene you wil not deny) that all men are sinners, and that no sinner is iust, then no man can bee made of a iuste manne more iuste. But because I promised to deale with you rather by youre owne learnyng, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by scriptures, if I can disproue your two first kindes of iustification, the third muste needes vanishe awaie of it selfe. Iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by baptisme is your first kind, by penaunce, your second kinde. If a childe be iustified by Baptisme, &amp; die in that state of iustification, he cometh not into purgatorie. And therfore néedeth neither Dirge nor Masse to be saide for hym: but by saiyng Dirge and Masse for such one, you acknowledge him to be in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, therfore you confesse he is not iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And so your owne catholike doinges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie your learned saiynges of iustification by Baptisme. Lette vs see if iustification by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce be any thing surer. When a manne hath shryuen himself, &amp; receiued absolution, I trowe you will saie hee is iustified by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. But so soone as he is gone from the Prieste, if he fall into deadlie sinne, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>lapsus</hi> again. And it is the doctrine of al the Sententiaries, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery euil desier, with consente is deadlie sinne, as if the partie,

So that he must be shriuen ten thousand tymes in a yere, or els he must not tary, but a short while in his iustification. A miserable consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or none at al, must that man haue, that trusteth to suche a iustification. But you wil saie, he needeth not to fall by concupiscence so often. But I saie, hee is a false hypocrite, that dare so saie, of hym selfe. Sainct Paule was not inferiour to any man, in the grace of regeneration, and yet he confesseth, that there was an other Lawe in his members, whiche was resistaunte to the lawe of his minde, &amp; so far preuailed, that it brought him continually, captiue vnto the lawe of synne, in so much that it did wryng out of him, this pathetical exclamation: miserable man that I am, who shal deliuer me from this bodie of

And whereas you thinke you haue aunswered the common obiection that you haue nothing to saie, I suppose by the iudgemente of wise menne you haue rather confirmed the same, that either you haue nothyng to saie, or that which you saie is nothing to the purpose. Youre fidelitie in the allegations shoulde better haue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if you had noted the places at the firste, which either must bee imputed to fraude or to lacke of bokes that it was omitted, but by notyng of some places it shoulde seeme you wanted no bookes, and your streight keping I suppose is not suche, but you might haue had bokes if you list. You co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude your Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with an odious diffamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the whole state of our princes gouernemente, which if it haue failed in anie poincte, it was in ouer muche clemencie shewed towardes suche as you are. It cannot be denied, but menne of good profession are oftentymes wicked in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, and many of no profession be a slander to those of true religion. But howe soeuer

menne be malicious and vngodly bente, the state alloweth theym not, but punisheth theim, that by order of lawe are conuicted to be suche. Wherfore to make suche an out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crie, as though nothing but murther oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion, filthines and all kinde of vngodlines, yea nothing els but a confusion of al wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes were openly mainteined: it sauoureth neither of truthe, nor of the spirite of God, nor of the affection of a good subiect. If <hi>Nero Domitian</hi> or <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> raged in the world, with what other Rhethorike would you haue painted out their regiment then this that you haue abused againste this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent gouerment? the praise whereof if the present age enuie, the posteritie will mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile at it, when neither in memorie nor in monumentes beyng compared without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffection, the like shall euer be founde before it. God geue all true Subiectes grace to bee thankefull for it, and so to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therein, that through his mercie it maie be many ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res more, most happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie continued.</p>
