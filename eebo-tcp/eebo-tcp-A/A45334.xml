         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and our Goſpel-principles, with Goſpel-practices, that all
our teaching may riſe at the laſt day for our juſtification, &amp;
not for our confuſion. This open prophaneneſs is a great
heart-breaking to the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, and makes
them cry in the bitterneſs of their ſpirits, <hi>Who hath beleeved

            <p>The world begins to loathe Gods Mannah, they are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of preaching, and ſick of Sermons; and therefore 'tis juſt
with God to eaſe them of ſuch burdens, and to lay upon

               <p>For the <hi>Major</hi> it is clear, wee are oft commanded to

in practicals, as well as in polemicals, that one abſurdity
being granted, makes way for many more to follow. When
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32052:11"/>
men once begin to fall in this kinde, they know not where
they ſhall reſt. Our corrupt nature like tinder or gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
is ready to bee fired with every ſinful temptation, and
therefore wee ſhould carefully ſhun them, elſe wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
our prayers, when wee pray that wee bee not led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
temptation; if wee run into them, wee mock God, and
ruine our ſelves; for hee will not preſerve us from the ſin,
if wee do not carefully ſhun the occaſions of ſin.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Minor,</hi> that at theſe prophane meetings there are
many occaſions of ſin, is too apparent. Who ſees not what
drunkenneſs, ſwearing, curſing, fighting, ſtealing, lying,
mixt-dancing, Morrice-dancing, Ribaldry, Debauchery,
ſcoffing at piety, oppoſing of zealous Magiſtrates, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
and people, prophanation of Sabbaths, miſ-ſpence of
precious time, complying with Heathens and Idolaters in
their ſinful and ſuperſtitious cuſtomes, perverting of that
order which God hath ſet, turning night into day, and day
into night? God hath ordained the night for man to reſt in,
and not to ramble and go ſtealing May-poles in.</p>
               <p>So that as in one <hi>Caeſar</hi> there were many <hi>Marii,</hi> ſo in this
one ſin there is a confluence of many ſins. Phyſicians ſay,
that <hi>morbi complicati ſunt periculoſiſſimi,</hi> where there is
a complication of diſeaſes, there the cure is very difficult
and dangerous. How perilous is it then to tolerate thoſe
prophane paſtimes, which open the flood-gates to ſo much
ſin and wickedneſs, as the ſad experience of all ages doth
teſtifie? So that if I would debauch a people, and draw
them from God and his worſhip to ſuperſtition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
I would take this courſe; I would open this gap to
them, they ſhould have <hi>Floralia</hi> and <hi>Saturnalia,</hi> they ſhould
have feaſt upon feaſt (as 'tis in Popery) they ſhould have
Wakes to prophane the Lords day, they ſhould have May-Games,
and Chriſtmas-revels, with dancing, drinking,
whoring, potting, piping, gaming, till they were made diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
and fit to receive any ſuperſtition, and eaſily drawn
to bee of any, or of no Religion: And this was the practice
of the late <hi>Prelates,</hi> when they were bringing in Popery

better for the ſwallowing of thoſe ſuperſtitious innovations,
which ſhortly after followed.</p>

living ſoberly, righteouſly, and religiouſly in this preſent

works of darkneſs, nor conform themſelves like to
the wicked of the world: But they muſt think the time paſt
of their lives too much to have lived according to the luſts

live according to the will of God, making his glory the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate

                  <p>My Lord, the King came into <hi>London, May</hi> 29.
and the 30th. of <hi>May</hi> hee publiſhed a Proclamation againſt
prophaneneſs, to the great rejoycing of all the good people
of the Land. When all was running into prophaneneſs and
confuſion, the Parliament ſate ſtill, and wee poor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
had nothing left but our prayers and tears; then, even
then it pleaſed the Moſt High (in whoſe hand is the heart
of Kings) to put it into the heart of our Soveraign Lord
the King, eminently to appear in the cauſe of that God,
who hath ſo eminently appeared for him, and hath brought
him through ſo many dangers and difficulties to the
Throne, and made ſo many mountains a plain before him,
to teſtifie againſt the debauchery and groſs prophaneneſs,
which like a torrent had ſuddenly over-ſpread the Land.
The ſum and ſubſtance of the Kings Proclamation is this,
That it is the duty of all to take notice of Gods tranſcendent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32052:16"/>
goodneſs to us, and to walk with ſuch circumſpection, integrity,
and reformation in our lives, that wee may not drive away the
mercy which is coming to us, by making our ſelves unworthy
of it; and in order hereto, wee think it high time to ſhew our
diſlike of thoſe (againſt whom wee have been ever enough
offended, though wee could not in this manner declare it) who
under pretence of affection to us and our ſervice, aſſume to
themſelves the liberty of reviling, threatning, and reproaching
others, and as much as in them lyes, endeavour to ſtifle and
divert their good inclinations to our ſervice, and ſo to prevent
that Reconciliation and Union of hearts and affections, which
can onely with Gods bleſſing make us rejoyce in each other, and
keep our enemies from rejoycing.</p>
                  <p>There are likewiſe another ſort of men, of whom wee have
heard much, and are ſufficiently aſhamed, who ſpend their time
in Taverns, Tipling-houſes, and Debauches, giving no other
evidence of affection to us, but in drinking our Health, and
inveighing againſt all others, who are not of their own diſſolute
temper; and who in truth have more diſcredited our cauſe by the
licence of their manners and lives, than they could ever advance
it by their affection and courage. Wee hope that this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way of delivering us all, from all wee feared, and almoſt
bringing us to all wee can reaſonably hope, hath, and will work
upon the hearts even of thoſe men to that degree, that they will
cordially renounce all that licentiouſneſs, prophaneneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety,
with which they have been corrupted, and endeavoured
to corrupt others; and that they will hereafter become examples
of ſobriety and vertue, and make it appear, that what was paſt,
was rather the vice of the times, than of the perſons, and ſo the
fitter to bee forgotten together.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the fear of puniſhment, or apprehenſion of our
diſpleaſure, may have influence upon many, who will not bee
reſtrained by the conſcience of their duty; Wee do declare, That
wee will not exerciſe juſt ſeverity againſt any Malefactors
ſooner, than againſt men of diſſolute, debauched, and prophane
lives, with what parts ſoever they may bee otherwiſe qualified
and endowed, and wee hope that all perſons of honour, or in
place and authority, will ſo far aſſiſt us in diſcountenancing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32052:17"/>
ſuch men, that their diſcretion and ſhame will perſwade them
to reform what their conſcience would not; and that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of good men towards them, may ſupply what the Laws
have not, and it may bee cannot well provide againſt, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the licence and corruption of the times, and the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
nature of men, many enormities, ſcandals, and impieties in

&amp;c. The Devil, who is the god of this world, hath blinded
thine eyes, and as blinde men are not fit to judge of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
ſo thou art unfit to judge in ſuch caſes. The Devil
deals with thee, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did with his enemies, hee firſt
ſmit them with blindneſs, and then brings them into <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>

ſay I, Lord open the eyes, and awaken the conſciences of
theſe blinde, ſecure ſinners, that they may ſee, and if the

your ſelves in the Devils camp, on the brink of deſtruction,

               </p>
               <p>3. Whereas thou ſayeſt that none but a few preciſe fools
oppoſe this prophaneneſs, thou art much deceived. Was
<hi>David</hi> a fooliſh preciſian, who would have no familiarity
with the wicked, but bids them depart from him? and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Lord to turn away his eyes from beholding vanity;
and poured out rivers of tears, becauſe men tranſgreſſed
Gods Laws. Was <hi>Paul</hi> a fooliſh preciſian, who commands
us to walk preciſely, and circumſpectly, to ſhun the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of evil, to have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful
works of darkneſs, but reprove them rather; and to live
ſoberly, righteouſly, and religiouſly in the world? Were
the <hi>Antient Fathers</hi> fools, who do unanimouſly enveigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch prophane practices? Were <hi>Perkins, Babington,
Dod, Andrews, Elton, &amp;c.</hi> preciſe fools, who do condemn
theſe prophane practices in their Expoſitions of the ſeventh
Commandement? Sure thou art ſome ſingular conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool,
that thus cenſureſt all the grave and pious ſages of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
and latter times for fools, and all becauſe they oppoſe
thy folly, which will bee bitterneſs in the end.</p>
               <p>4. Whereas thou accuſeſt them <hi>as enemies to the King,</hi>
which oppoſe ſuch prophaneneſs, let mee tell thee, the
King hath not better friends in the Land, than ſuch as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
thoſe prophane practices; nor more deadly foes, than
ſuch as do promote them; theſe ſet open the flood-gates to
all rudeneſs, diſloyalty, debauchery, and effeminacy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
people are made unfit, either for the ſervice of God, or
the King. Thoſe that are ſuffered to rebel againſt God,
will not ſtick (when a temptation comes) to rebel againſt
the King. 'Tis the dark and ignorant places of the earth,
which are habitations of cruelty and rebellion. Should a
man debauch your children and ſervants, and take them to
ſuch prophane meetings, where they ſhould learn to ſwear
and ſwagger, to rant and roar; I know no wiſe Parents that
would count ſuch for their friends. Theſe licentious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
are the very nurſeries of villany, the bane of piety and
peace, and the overthrow of thoſe Kingdomes that tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them. The <hi>Romans,</hi> when they grew idle and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32052:22"/>
became effeminate, and loſt all. When people

Ordinances, then comes a curſe upon a Land, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.

               <p>So that this is but an old trick of the Devil and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
when they would deſtroy Gods people, to put ugly
titles on them, and call them troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> trumpets
of rebellion, enemies to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> raiſers of ſedition, the Peſts
of a Nation, &amp;c. Thus, as the Heathen Perſecutors did put
Bear-skins on the backs of the Chriſtians, and then bait
them like Bears; ſo the limbs of Satan, when croſt in their
luſts, put ugly titles upon Gods people, that ſo they may
take occaſion thereby to deſtroy them. Thus <hi>Elijah</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the troubler of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when indeed he was the chariots

'tis the Kings Court, and hee that comes there muſt bring

As <hi>Sampſons</hi> ſtrength lay in his hair, ſo the Governours of
<hi>Judah</hi> ſhall one day ſay, That <hi>in the inhabitants of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem

By a Letter from <hi>Breda (May</hi> 10. 1660.) I finde
that his Majeſty hath oft been heard to ſay, <hi>That the prayers

who do indeavour to expreſs their affection by debauchery, may
ruine themſelves, or at leaſt ſtain his reputation, his Majeſty
deſiring no ſuch attendants.</hi> An excellent ſaying, and well
becoming a Prince.</p>
               <p>Religion makes the beſt ſubjects, the beſt ſervants, and
the beſt relations. Where Religion comes in the power of
it, there men obey, not for fear (as wicked ones do) but
for conſcience ſake. There are no better Subjects in the
world than theſe, none more faithfull to their truſt, none
pray more for their Governours, none pay their dues
more freely to them, Theſe are they that will venture their
lives and eſtates for their good, when ſuch as ſerve them
for their own ends, will leave them and forſake them; and
though for the preſent the righteous may bee condemned
as Traitors, and the wicked bee exalted to honour, yet in
Gods due time hee will clear the innocency of his ſervants,
as the light, when the names of the wicked ſhall rot. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at that great day of Revelation, then ſhall we clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcern betwixt the righteous and the wicked, between
him that feareth the Lord, &amp; him that feareth him not. This
may comfort us who are faln into the laſt daies, which are
called perilous times,<note place="margin">Ille eſt publicus inimicus cui haec voluptas diſplicet. Aug. de civit. Dei, l. 2. c. 21.</note> wherein hee that refrains from evil,

               <p>1. For <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> I have preached, prayed, practiſed, and

pay to him, and command men ſo to do, and am ready to
ſacrifize my life for him in an honourable way, and when

two hundred pound, and ran the hazard of my whole live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood;
for I had no Law to recover a penny. At two pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Diſputations againſt Sectaries, I ran great hazards, at
the firſt 1650. there was a great rabble of Sectaries met
together, who gave out untoward ſpeeches againſt mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1651. About a week before the King came
into <hi>Worceſter,</hi> I was called to aſſiſt in a Diſputation againſt
ſome Sectaries, this falling out at that juncture of time, I
was look'd upon as an enemy to the Common-wealth, and
therefore the Conſtable was commanded to bring mee in
priſoner to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> to be there ſecured amongſt the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts;
and lately have I been threatned (from another coaſt)
with an Arreſt, for oppoſing the Millenarians and Fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-men.
I mention theſe things, not for any ſiniſter
ends of fear or favour, but to prevent, or at leſt to blunt the
edge of thoſe vile aſperſions, which are caſt upon the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
as if they were enemies to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> when I dare be

not better ſervants, nor the King better ſubjects, than thoſe of
this Judgement.</hi> Who were it that God made Inſtruments to
bring about the great change which is now wrought in the
Land? were it not our brethren of <hi>Scotland?</hi> Who were
they that petitioned in Print for the life of the late King?
were they not the Presbyterian Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> one of
them loſing his head not long after upon a Royal account!

Hereſies on the other, when others were dumb, and did tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
