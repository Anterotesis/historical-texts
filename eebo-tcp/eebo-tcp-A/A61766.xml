            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS ALSO, How great Stones as big as a Mans Fist, were thrown at her in the Dwelling House of Mr. <hi>Tuers,</hi> which came flying into the House in a most strange and amazing manner, the Doors being shut and Windows, so that it could not be imagined how they should be conveyed into the House, and that none of the Family was any ways hurt, but this Maid; Also how the Bellows was thrown at her. Mr. <hi>Tuers</hi> her Master, finding his House thus troubled, after some time, sent her home to her Mothers House at <hi>Asteed,</hi> about three Miles off from <hi>Yowel,</hi> where by the way She was most strangely assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Stones as before; and after She came to her Fathers House, the throwing of the Pewter-Dishes, Candlesticks, and other clattering of Houshold-Goods at her, besides the displacing of a Musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hanging up her Grand-Fathers Breeches on the top of the Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100128:3"/>
In the mean time or interim, one <hi>Ioan Butts</hi> a person that hath been for a long time suspected to be a <hi>Witch,</hi> came to the house of the aforesaid Mr. <hi>Tuers,</hi> and framing some discourse to the Maid before named, she at last askt her for a pair of old Gloves; the Maid knowing her to be a person of ill repute, and being willing to be rid of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, gave her a very short and sharp answer; tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her she had no Gloves for her, or if shee had she could not spare time to look them; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>Ioan Butts</hi> went away, but in a little time returned, asking the aforesaid Maid for a Pin to pin her Neckcloth, which she furnished her with, and so this <hi>Ioan Butts</hi> departed, leaving the Maid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dread or fear of any harm; but about fourteen days after, there happened strange and miraculous wonders, amazing and frightning all the Spectators, for stones flew about the Yard at such a strange rate, as if it had rained down showers of them, and many of them were as big as a mans fist, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards flew as thick about the house as before they did about the Yard, notwithstanding the doors were close shut, yet for all they flew so thick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, they hit no body but the Maid, to the great astonishment of her Master, Mistris, and others: but more to be admired, the next day this maid was suddenly attacqued with intolerable pain in her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100128:3"/>
back, and such unsufferable pricking of Pins, that she was not able to endure, or without lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able complaining, undergo the groans &amp; skreeches she sometimes suddenly parted with, would have moved a stony heart to pitty her destress, and Mr. <hi>Tuers</hi> her Master commiserating her condition, asked if he should put his hand down her back and feel what might be the cause of her pain or Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which she willingly agreed to, and he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did, and to the amazement of all persons present, pulled out a great piece of Clay as full of Pins as it could well be, and throwing them into the fire, she was for that present at great ease, but after that a second Torment did seize this Maid, which caused her to complain more grievously and lamentably then before, whereupon one Mr. <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> being there present, put her hand down her back and pulled out a piece of Clay as thick of Thorns as the other of Pins, so throwing them into the fire, she was again at ease for that time: The next day as she was going a Milking, she saw in <hi>Nonsuch Park</hi> this wretched old Caitiff sitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Thorns and Bushes, bedaggled up to the knees in Dew, and looking like one that had lately had converse with some Infernal Fiend, and wondring to see her there so early in that pickle, (being as it were doubtful of her wickedness) and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100128:4"/>
supposing her to be the cause of her (before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) pain and misery, returned home to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters house, telling him how she saw this <hi>Ioan Butts</hi> in the place before named, adding in what a strange Garb and posture she sat in, which added to the suspicion of the (before doubtful) Master, but the same night the Maid going into the chamber where she lay to fetch a Trunk which was intended to be sent to <hi>London,</hi> all on a sudden cryed out, Master, Master, here is the old Woman: the master run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hastily to see whether it were so or no, could see no old woman, but the Andirons thrown after the maid, and all her own Linnen thrown about at such a rate, as it is hard to believe, but that it will upon occasion be attested by unquestionable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: and likewise a Wooden Bar which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the street door, was strangely removed and conveyed up stairs, and came tumbling down after the maid in the sight of her master: about three days after they were surprized with new wonders, for there was to be seen such sights as they never saw before, <hi>viz.</hi> The Bellows flew about the house, and Candlesticks and other things thrown after the Girl as she passed to and fro in her masters house, and going to her Mothers house which was at <hi>Astead</hi> about three miles distant from <hi>Yowel,</hi> such numberless numbers of stones were thrown at her,

that she found it hazardous to Travel, but had she returned it might have been the same, and so she continued till she came to her mothers house, where on Sunday the 9th of <hi>October,</hi> they were possest with admiration as well as those of her Masters Family, for her Grandfathers Britches were strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found to be on the top of the house as near as can be imagined over his Bed, and besides such great quantities of Nuts and Acrons flew about, that the Spectators never beheld the like before: The pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danced about the house in a strange manner, and hits a Gentleman such a blow on the back, that I suppose he will have but little stomach hereafter to go to see the Devil dance: but the same day hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened another Wonder no less strange then what is before recited, for there was a Fiddle close laid up in a Chest, which was strangely and unknown to any of the house, hung up in the room, and after was removed to the top of the Beds Tester, and the third time carried quite away, and hath no more been seen since: But on Thursday the <hi>18th</hi> of this present <hi>October,</hi> there being a Fair kept at <hi>Yowel,</hi> the mother of this afflicted maid came thither, and meeting with this old suspected <hi>Witch</hi> (whom she had great reason to imagine so to be) fell foul upon her, and so evilly Treated her, that she fetcht out some of her Hellish Hellish
