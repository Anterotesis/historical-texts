         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> being earnestly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by a d√©ere friend, to put downe in
writing, some true relation of our late
performed voyage to the North parts
of <hi>Virginia;</hi> at length I resolued to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his request, who also emboldened
me to direct the same to your honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
consideration; to whom ind√©ed
of duetie it perteineth.</p>
            <p>May it please your Lordship therefore to vnderstand, that
vpon the sixe and twentieth of March 1602, being Friday,
we went from <hi>Falmouth,</hi> being in all, two &amp; thirtie persons,
in a small barke of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> called The <hi>Concord,</hi> holding
a course for the North part of <hi>Virginia:</hi> and although by
chance the winde fauoured vs not at first as we wished, but
inforced vs so farre to the Southward,<note place="margin">They fel with <hi>S. Marie,</hi> one of the <hi>A√ßores.</hi>
               </note> as we fell with <hi>S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
one of the islands of the <hi>A√ßores</hi> (which was not much
out of our way) but holding our course directly from thence,
we made our iourney shorter (than hitherto accustomed) by
the better part of a thousand leagues, yet were w√©e longer
in our passage than we expected; which happened, for that
our barke being weake, we were loth to presse her with much
saile; also, our sailers being few, and they none of the best, we
bare (except in faire weather) but low saile; besides, our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon an vnknowen coast, made vs not ouer-bolde to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23305:3"/>
stand in with the shore, but in open weather; which caused
vs to be certeine daies in sounding, before we discouered the
coast, the weather being by chance, somewhat foggie. But
on Friday the fourt√©enth of May,<note place="margin">They discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red land the 14. of May.</note> early in the morning, w√©e
made the land, being full of faire tr√©es, the land somewhat
low, certeine hummocks or hilles lying into the land, the
shore full of white sand, but very stony or rocky. And standing
faire alongst by the shore, about twelue of the clocke the same
day,<note place="margin">Eight Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord of them.</note> we came to an anker, where eight Indians, in a Baske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shallop
with mast and saile, an iron grapple, and a kettle of
Copper, came boldly aboord vs, one of them apparelled with a
wastcoat and breeches of blacke serdge, made after our sea-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
hose and shoes on his f√©et; all the rest (sauing one that
had a paire of breeches of blue cloth) were naked.<note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</note> These
people are of tall stature, broad and grim visage, of a blacke
swart complexion, their eie-browes painted white; their
weapons are bowes and arrowes. It seemed by some words
and signes they made, that some Basks or of <hi>S, Iohn de Luz,</hi>
haue fished or traded in this place, being in the latitude of 43.
degr√©es. But riding heere, in no very good harbour, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
doubting the weather, about thr√©e of the clocke the same
day in the afternoone we weighed, &amp; standing Southerly off
into sea the rest of that day and the night following, with a
fresh gale of winde, in the morning we found our selues em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baied
with a mightie headland; but comming to an anker a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
nine of the clocke the same day, within a league of the
shore, we hoised out the one halfe of our shallop, and captaine
<hi>Bartholmew Gosnold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their first landing.</note> my selfe, and thr√©e others, went ashore,
being a white sandie and very bolde shore; and marching all
that afternoone with our muskets on our necks, on the highest
hilles which we saw (the weather very hot) at length we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
this headland to be parcell of the maine, and sundrie
Islands lying almost round about it: so returning (towards
euening) to our shallop (for by that time, the other part was
brought ashore and set together) we espied an Indian,<note place="margin">Another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</note> a yoong
man, of proper stature, and of a pleasing countenance; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some familiaritie with him, we left him at the sea side, and
returned to our ship; where, in fiue or sixe houres absence, we
had pestered our ship so with Cod fish,<note place="margin">Anexcellent Codfishing.</note> that we threw num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23305:3"/>
of them ouer-boord againe: and surely, I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that in the moneths of March, April, and May, there is
vpon this coast, better fishing, and in as great plentie, as in
<hi>Newfound-land:</hi> for the sculles of Mackerell, herrings, Cod,
and other fish, that we daily saw as we went and came from
the shore, were woonderfull; and besides, the places where
we tooke these Cods (and might in a few daies haue laden our
ship) were but in seuen fadome water, and within lesse than
a league of the shore: where, in <hi>Newfound-land</hi> they fish in
fortie or fiftie fadome water, and farre off. From this place,
we sailed round about this headland,<note place="margin">A great head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> almost all the points of
the compasse, the shore very bolde: but as no coast is fr√©e from
dangers, so I am persuaded, this is as fr√©e as any. The land
somwhat lowe, full of goodly woods, but in some places plaine.
At length we were come amongst many faire Islands,<note place="margin">Many faire Islands.</note> which
we had partly discerned at our first landing; all lying within
a league or two one of another, and the outermost not aboue
sixe or seuen leagues from the maine:<note place="margin">The first I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland called <hi>Marthaes</hi> vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</note> but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ming to an anker
vnder one of them, which was about thr√©e or foure leagues
from the maine, captaine <hi>Gosnold,</hi> my selfe, and some others,
went ashore, and going round about it, we found it to be foure
English miles in compasse, without house or inhabitant, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a little old house made of boughes, couered with barke,
an olde piece of a weare of the Indians, to catch fish, and one
or two places, where they had made fires. The chiefest tr√©es
of this Island, are B√©eches<note place="margin">Beeches.</note> and Cedars;<note place="margin">Cedars.</note> the outward parts
all ouergrowen with lowe bushie tr√©es, thr√©e or foure foot in
height, which beare some kinde of fruits, as appeared by
their blossomes; Strawberries, red and white, as sweet and
much bigger than ours in <hi>England:</hi> Rasberies, Gooseberies,
Hurtleberies, and such an incredible store of Uines,<note place="margin">Uines in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</note> aswell
in the wooddie part of the Island, where they run vpon euery
tr√©e, as on the outward parts, that we could not goe for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon them: also, many springs<note place="margin">Springs.</note> of excellent sw√©et water,
and a great standing lake<note place="margin">A Lake.</note> of fresh water, n√©ere the sea side, an
English mile in compasse, which is mainteined with the
springs running exc√©eding pleasantly thorow the wooddie
grounds which are very rockie. Here are also in this Island,
great store of D√©ere,<note place="margin">Deere.</note> which we saw, and other beasts,<note place="margin">Other beasts.</note> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

fowles, in great plenty; also, great store of Pease, which
grow in certeine plots all the Island ouer. On the North
side of this Island we found many huge bones and ribbes of
Whales. This Island, as also all the rest of these Islands,
are full of all sorts of stones fit for building; the sea sides all
couered with stones, many of them glistring and shining
like minerall stones, and verie rockie: also, the rest of these
Islands are replenished with these commodities, and vpon
some of them, inhabitants; as vpon as Island to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and within two leagues of this; yet w√©e found no
townes, nor many of their houses, although we saw manie
Indians, which are tall big boned men, all naked, sauing they
couer their priuy parts with a blacke tewed skin, much like
a Black smiths apron, tied about their middle and betw√©ene
their legs behinde: they gaue vs of their fish readie boiled,
(which they carried in a basket made of twigges, not vnlike
our osier) whereof we did eat, and iudged them to be fresh
water fish: they gaue vs also of their Tabacco,<note place="margin">Tabacco.</note> which they
drinke gr√©ene, but dried into powder, very strong and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and much better than any I haue tasted in <hi>England:</hi> the
necks of their pipes are made of clay hard dried, (whereof in
that Island is great store both red and white) the other part
is a piece of hollow copper, very finely closed and semented
together. W√©e gaue vnto them certeine trifles, as kniues,
points, and such like, which they much est√©emed. From hence
we went to another Island,<note place="margin">Elizabeths Island.</note> to the Northwest of this, and
within a league or two of the maine, which we found to bee
greater than before we imagined, being 16. English miles at
the least in compasse; for it conteineth many pieces or necks
of land, which differ nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> seuerall Islands, sauing that
certeine banks of small bredth, do like bridges, ioine them to
this Island. On the outsides of this Island are many plaine
places of grasse, abundance of Strawberies &amp; other berries
before mentioned. In mid May we did sowe in this Island
(for a triall) in sundry places, Wheat, Barley, Oats, and
Pease,<note place="margin">Wheat, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and Oats sowed, came vp nine inches in fourteene daies.</note> which in fourt√©ene daies were sprung vp nine inches
and more. The soile is fat and lustie, the vpper crust of gray
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23305:4"/>
colour; but a foot or lesse in depth, of the colour of our hempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
in <hi>England;</hi> and being thus apt for these and the like
graines; the sowing or setting (after the ground is clensed)
is no greater labour, than if you should set or sow in one of
our best prepared gardens in <hi>England.</hi> This Island is full of
high timbred Oakes,<note place="margin">Oakes.</note> their leaues thrise so broad as ours; Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,<note place="margin">Cedars.</note>

in euery part of euery Island, are great store of Ground
nuts,<note place="margin">Ground nuts.</note> fortie together on a string, some of them as bigge as

sorts of shell-fish,<note place="margin">Shell fish.</note> as Scalops, Muscles, Cockles, Lobsters,

But not to cloy you with particular rehearsall of such things
as God &amp; Nature hath bestowed on these places, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof, the most fertil part of al <hi>England</hi> is (of it selfe) but
barren; we went in our light-horsman from this Island to the
maine, right against this Island some two leagues off, where
comming ashore, we stood a while like men rauished at the

beautie<note place="margin">The exceeding beautie of the maine land.</note> and delicacie of this sw√©et soile; for besides diuers
cl√©ere Lakes<note place="margin">Great Lakes.</note> of fresh water (whereof we saw no end) Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes<note place="margin">Large me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.</note>
very large and full of gr√©ene grasse; euen the most
woody places (I speake onely of such as I saw) doe grow so
distinct and apart, one tr√©e from another, vpon gr√©ene grassie
ground, somewhat higher than the Plaines, as if Nature
would shew her selfe aboue her power, artificiall. Hard by,
we espied seuen Indians,<note place="margin">Seuen In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> and cumming vp to them, at first
they expressed some feare; but being emboldned by our cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
vsage, and some trifles which we gaue them, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vs to a necke of land, which we imagined had beene se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from the maine; but finding it otherwise, we perceiued
a broad harbour or riuers<note place="margin">A broad riuer.</note> mouth, which ranne vp into the
maine: and because the day was farre spent, we were forced
to returne to the Island from whence we came, leauing the
discouery of this harbour,<note place="margin">A good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> for a time of better leasure. Of the
goodnesse of which harbour, as also of many others therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
there is small doubt, considering that all the Islands,
as also the maine (where we were) is all rockie grounds and
broken lands. Now the next day, we determined to fortifie
our selues in a little plot of ground in the midst of the Lake
aboue mentioned,<note place="margin">The English house.</note> where we built an house, and couered it
with sedge, which grew about this lake in great aboundance;
in building whereof, we spent thr√©e w√©eks and more: but the
second day after our comming from the maine, we espied 11
canowes or boats, with fiftie Indians in them,<note place="margin">Eleuen ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows with fiftie Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in them.</note> comming
toward vs from this part of the maine, where we, two daies
before landed; and being loth they should discouer our forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
we went out on the sea side to m√©ete them; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
somewhat n√©ere them, they all sat downe vpon the
stones, calling aloud to vs (as we rightly ghessed) to doe the
like, a little distance from them: hauing sat a while in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> willed me to goe vnto them, to s√©e what
countenance they would make; but as soone as I came vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, one of them, to whom I had giuen a knife two daies
before in the maine, knew me, (whom I also very wel remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred)
and smiling vpon me, spake somewhat vnto their lord
or captaine,<note place="margin">Their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> which sat in the midst of them, who presently rose
vp and tooke a large Beauer skin from one that stood about
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23305:5"/>
him, and gaue it vnto me, which I requited for that time the
best I could: but I, pointing towards captaine <hi>Gosnold,</hi>
made signes vnto him, that he was our captaine, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to be his friend, and enter league with him, which (as I
perceiued) he vnderstood, and made signes of ioy: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> with the rest of his companie, being
twenty in all, came vp vnto them; and after many signes
of gratulations (captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> presenting their Lord with
certaine trifles which they wondred at, and highly est√©emed)
we became very great friends, and sent for meat aboord our
shallop, and gaue them such meats as we had then readie
dressed, whereof they misliked nothing but our mustard,
whereat they made many a sowre face. While we were
thus mery, one of them had conueied a target of ours into
one of their canowes, which we suffered, onely to trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were in subiection to this Lord to whom we made
signes (by shewing him another of the same likenesse, and
pointing to the canow) what one of his companie had done:
who suddenly expressed some feare, and speaking angerly to
one about him (as we perceiued by his countenance) caused
it presently to be brought backe againe. So the rest of the day
we spent in trading with them for Furres,<note place="margin">Seuerall sorts of Furres.</note> which are Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
Luzernes, Marterns, Otters, Wild-cat skinnes, very
large and d√©epe Furre, blacke Foxes, Conie skinnes, of the
colour of our Hares, but somewhat lesse, D√©ere skinnes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large, Seale skinnes, and other beasts skinnes, to vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen.
They haue also great store of Copper,<note place="margin">Red Copper in abundance.</note> some very
redde; and some of a paler colour; none of them but haue
chaines, earings or collars of this mettall: they head some
of their arrows herewith much like our broad arrow heads,
very workmanly made. Their chaines<note place="margin">Chaines.</note> are many hollow
pieces semented together, ech piece of the bignesse of one of
our r√©eds, a finger in length, ten or twelue of them together
on a string, which they weare about their necks: their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars<note place="margin">Collars.</note>
they weare about their bodies like bandelieres a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
broad, all hollow pieces, like the other, but somewhat
shorter, four hundred pieces in a collar, very fine and euenly
set together. Besides these, they haue large drinking cups<note place="margin">Drinking cuppes of Copper.</note>
made like sculles, and other thinne plates of copper, made
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23305:6"/>
much like our boare-speare blades, all which they so little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st√©eme,
as they offered their fairest collars or chaines, for a
knife or such like trifle, but we s√©emed little to regard it; yet
I was desirous to vnderstand where they had such store of
this mettall, and made signes to one of them (with whom I
was very familiar) who taking a piece of Copper<note place="margin">Mines of Copper.</note> in his
hand, made a hole with his finger in the ground, and withall
pointed to the maine from whence they came. They strike
fire in this manner; euery one carrieth about him in a purse of
tewd leather, a Minerall stone<note place="margin">Minerall stones.</note> (which I take to be their
Copper) and with a flat Emerie stone<note place="margin">Emerie stones.</note> (wherewith Glasiers
cut glasse, and Cutlers glase blades) tied fast to the end of
a little sticke, gently he striketh vpon the Minerall stone,
and within a stroke or two, a sparke falleth vpon a piece of
Touchwood (much like our Spunge in <hi>England</hi>) and with
the least sparke he maketh a fire presently. We had also of
their Flaxe,<note place="margin">Flaxe.</note> wherewith they make many strings and cords,
but it is not so bright of colour as ours in <hi>England:</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
they haue great store growing vpon the maine, as
also Mines and many other rich commodities, which we,
wanting both time and meanes, could not possibly discouer.
Thus they continued with vs thr√©e daies, euery night reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them selues to the furthermost part of our Island two or
three miles from our fort: but the fourth day they returned to
the maine, pointing fiue or six times to the Sun, and once to
the maine, which we vnderstood, that within fiue or six daies
they would come from the maine to vs againe: but being in
their canowes a little from the shore, they made huge cries &amp;
shouts of ioy vnto vs; and we with our trumpet and cornet,
and casting vp our cappes into the aire, made them the best
farewell we could:<note place="margin">Indians apt for seruice.</note> yet six or seuen of them remained with
vs behinde, bearing vs company euery day into the woods,
and helpt vs to cut and carie our Sassafras,<note place="margin">Sassafras.</note> and some of them
lay aboord our ship. These people, as they are exc√©eding cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,<note place="margin">A goodly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; of good conditions.</note>
gentle of disposition, and well conditioned, excelling all
others that we haue s√©ene; so for shape of bodie and louely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
I thinke they excell all the people of <hi>America;</hi> of stature
much higher than we; of complexion or colour, much like a
darke Oliue; their eie-browes and haire blacke, which they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23305:6"/>
weare long, tied vp behinde in knots, whereon they pricke
feathers of fowles, in fashion of a crownet: some of them are
blacke thin bearded; they make beards of the haire of beasts:
and one of them offered a beard of their making to one of our
sailers, for his that grew on his face, which because it was of
a red colour, they iudged to be none of his owne. They are
quicke eied, and stedfast in their looks, fearelesse of others
harmes, as intending none themselues; some of the meaner
sort giuen to filching, which the very name of Saluages (not
weighing their ignorance in good or euill) may easily excuse:
their garments are of D√©ere skins, and some of them weare
Furres round and close about their necks.<note place="margin">Their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</note> They pronounce
our language with great facilitie; for one of them one day
sitting by mee, vpon occasion I spake smiling to him these
words: <hi>How now (sirrha) are you so saucie with my Tabacco?</hi>
which words (without any further repetition) he suddenly
spake so plaine and distinctly, as if he had b√©ene a long scholar
in the language. Many other such trials we had, which are
h√©ere n√©edlesse to repeat. Their women<note place="margin">Their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> (such as we saw)
which were but thr√©e in all, were but lowe of stature, their
eie-browes, haire, apparell, and maner of wearing, like to
the men, fat, and very well fauoured, and much delighted in
our company; the men are very dutifull towards them. And
truely, the holsomnesse and temperature of this Climat, doth
not onely argue this people to be answerable to this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but also of a perfect constitution of body, actiue, strong,
healthfull, and very wittie, as the sundry toies of theirs cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
wrought, may easily witnes. For the agr√©eing of this
Climat<note place="margin">The goodnesse or the Climat.</note> with vs (I speake of my selfe, &amp; so I may iustly do for
the rest of our company) that we found our health &amp; strength
all the while we remained there, so to renew and increase,
as notwithstanding our diet and lodging was none of the
best, yet not one of our company (God be thanked) felt the
least grudging or inclination to any disease or sicknesse, but
were much fatter and in better health than when we went
out of <hi>England.</hi> But after our barke had taken in so much
Sassafras, Cedar, Furres, Skinnes, and other commodities,
as were thought conuenient; some of our company that had
promised captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> to stay, hauing nothing but a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23305:7"/>
voyage in their minds, made our company of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
(which was small enough before) much smaller; so as
captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> s√©eing his whole strength to consist but of
twelue men, and they but meanly prouided, determined to
returne<note place="margin">Their return.</note> for <hi>England,</hi> leauing this Island (which he called <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths
Island</hi>) which as many true sorrowfull eies, as were
before desirous to s√©e it. So the 18. of Iune, being Friday,
we weighed, and with indifferent faire winde and weather
came to anker the 23 of Iuly, being also Friday (in all, bare
fiue w√©eks) before <hi>Exmouth.</hi>

To whose succour he hath sent fiue seuerall
times at his owne charges. The parties by him set foorth,
performed nothing; some of them following their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
elsewhere; others returning with friuolous allegations.
At this last time, to auoid all excuse, he bought a barke, and
hired all the company for wages by the moneth: who depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from <hi>Weimouth</hi> in March last 1062, fell fortie leagues
to the Southwestward of <hi>Hatarask,</hi> in thirtie foure degr√©es

came along the coast to s√©eke the people, they did it not, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that the extremitie of weather and losse of some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
ground-tackle, forced and feared them from searching
the port of <hi>Hatarask,</hi> to which they were sent. From that

strange and differing from ours of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fish, namely, Cods, which as we encline more vnto the

then the <hi>Newland</hi> fish. Whales and Seales in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances.

whereof we now make Soape, besides many other vses.
<hi>Item,</hi> Tunneys, Anchoues, Bonits, Salmons, Lobsters,

are more plentifull vpon those Northwest coasts of <hi>America,</hi>

            <p>So as the commodities<note place="margin">Commodities in generall.</note> there to be raised both of the sea

            <p>These commodities before rehearsed,<note place="margin">Imploiment of our people, and repairing decaied ports.</note> albeit for the most

as for the imploiment also of our people and ships; the
want whereof, doth decay our townes and ports of <hi>England,</hi>
and causeth the realme to swarme full with poore and idle
people.</p>
            <p>These commodities in like sort,<note place="margin">The trade to <hi>Newfound-land</hi> shalbe remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to vs.</note> are of great vse and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in all the South and Westerne countreys of <hi>Europe;</hi>
namely, <hi>Italie, France</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> for the which all nations
that haue b√©ene accustomed to repaire vnto the <hi>Newfound-land</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23305:10"/>
and many commodities besides, of good importance &amp; value.</p>
            <p>Then will the Spaniards and Portugals bring vnto vs

Sw√©et oiles, Fruits, Spices, Sugars, Silks, Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,

our merchants of <hi>England</hi> will bring vnto vs againe,
Cloth, Cattell, for our store and br√©ed, and euery thing els

            <p>By this intercourse,<note place="margin">Uent of our Cloth.</note> our habitations will be made a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>This intercourse also will be soone drawen together by this

is the greatest fishing of the world; whether doe

ar diligent inquisitours after gaines, they will soone
remooue their trade from <hi>Newfound-land</hi> vnto vs n√©ere at

with vs.<note place="margin">In commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Newland trade.</note> For whereas the voyage vnto the <hi>Newfound-land</hi>
is into a more cold and intemperate place, not to be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
nor frequented at all times, nor fortified for securitie of
the ships and goods; oft spoiled by pirats or men of warre; the
charges great for salt; double manning and double victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their ships, in regard that the labor is great and the time
long, before their lading can be made readie: they cary out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
no commodities for fraight; and after sixe moneths
voyage, their returne is made but of Fish and Oiles.</p>
            <p>Contrariwise,<note place="margin">Commodities by hauing trade with vs.</note> by trading with vs at our intended place,
the course shalbe in a maner as short; into a more temperate
and healthfull climat; at all times of the y√©ere to be traded;
harbors fortified to secure ships and goods; charges abridged
of salt, victualling and manning ships double: because lading
shall be prouided vnto their hands at a more easie rate than
themselues could make it. They shall carry fraight also out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23305:10"/>
to make exchange with vs; and so get profit both
waies: and then euery foure moneths they may make a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
and returne, of both fish and oiles, and many other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of good worth.</p>
            <p>These reasons aduisedly waighed,<note place="margin">Note.</note> shall make our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
appeare easie, and the most profitable of the world, for
our nation to vndertake. The reasons we chiefly relie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are these, namely.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Those lands which we intend to inhabit, shall minister
vnto our people, the subiect and matter of many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
commodities.</item>
               <item>2 <hi>England</hi> shall affoord vs people both men, women and
children aboue 10000, which may very happily be
spared from hence to worke those commodities there.</item>
               <item>3 <hi>Newfound-land</hi> shall minister shipping to carrie away
all our commodities, and to bring others vnto vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
for our supplie.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now two of these reasons are already effected vnto our
hands:<note place="margin">An easie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, and great reward.</note> that is to say: The place where we shall finde rich
commodities, and ships to vent them. It remaineth onely
for our parts, to carrie and transport people with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions
from <hi>England,</hi> where the miserie and necessitie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
crie out for such helpe and reliefe.</p>
            <p>This considered,<note place="margin">The English nation most fit for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries.</note> no nation of Christendom is so fit for this
action as <hi>England,</hi> by reason of our superfluous people (as I
may tearme them) and of our long domesticall peace. And
after that we be once 200 men strong, victualled and fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we can not be remooued by as many thousands.</p>
            <p>For besides that, we haue s√©ene both in <hi>France</hi> and the
<hi>Low-countreys,</hi> where 200 men well fortified and victualled,
haue kept out the forces both of the French &amp; Spanish kings,
euen within their owne kingdomes: it shall be also a matter
of great difficulty, to transport an army ouer the Ocean with
victuals and munition, and afterwards to abide long siege a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
against vs fortified within, where the very elements
and famine shall fight for vs, though we should lie still and
defend onely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:23305:11"/>The Saluages neither in this attempt shall hurt vs, they
being simple,<note place="margin">The Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vnable to defend or offend.</note> naked and vnarmed, destitute of edge-tooles or
weapons; whereby they are vnable either to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>selues
or to offend vs: neither is it our intent to prouoke, but to cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and win them vnto Christianitie by faire meanes; yet
not to trust them too far, but to prouide against all accidents.</p>
            <p>Then to conclude, as we of all other nations are most fit
for a discouery and planting in remote places; euen so, vnder
the heauens there is no place to be found so conuenient for
such a purpose; by reason of the temperature, commodities,
apt site for trade, &amp; repaire thither already of so many ships,
which in any other frequented countrey, can not be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in a mans age, nor with expense of halfe a million.</p>
            <p>So as the onely difficultie now,<note place="margin">This action but set on foot, will goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it selfe.</note> is in our first preparation
to transport some few people at the beginning; the charges
whereof shall be defraied by our first returne, of fish and some
commodities of Sassafras, Hides, Skinnes and Furres,
which we shall also haue by trading with the Saluages. The
proofe of which commodities shall incourage our merchants
to venter largely in the next. The supplie shall easily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
be sent by ships, which y√©erely goe from hence vnto
the <hi>Newfound-land</hi> and vs; and the intercourse &amp; exchange
we shall haue with all nations repairing thither, shall store
vs with aboundance of all things for our necessities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes.<note place="margin">Ouersight in choise of a new habitation.</note>
Which reasons if they had b√©ene fores√©ene of them
that planted in the South part of <hi>Virginia</hi> (which is a place
destitute of good harbours, and farre from all trade) no doubt
but if they had settled neerer vnto this frequented trade in the
<hi>Newfound-land,</hi> they had by this time b√©ene a flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
State, and plentifull in all things; who also might then
haue made way into the bowels of that large continent,
where assuredly we shall discouer very goodly and rich king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and cities.</p>
            <p>It may also s√©eme a matter of great consequence for the
good and securitie of <hi>England;</hi> that out of these Northerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
we shall be able to furnish this realme of all maner of
prouisions for our nauies; namely, Pitch, Rosen, Cables,<note place="margin">A matter of importance for <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>
Ropes, Masts, and such like; which shall be made within
those her Maiesties owne dominions, by her owne subiects,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23305:11"/>
and brought hither thorow the Ocean, fr√©e from restraint of
any other prince; whereby the customes and charges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
by our merchants (to the inriching of forren Estates)
shall be lessened, and turned to the benefit of her Highnesse and
her deputies in those parts: which also shall deliuer our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
from many troubles &amp; molestations which they now
vnwillingly indure in our East trades; and shall make vs the
lesse to doubt the malice of those States whom now we may
not offend, lest we should be intercepted of the same prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to the weakening of our nauie, the most roiall defence of
this noble realme.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of a conuenient passage and trade into the
South Sea, vnder temperate regions part by
riuers, and some part ouer land, in
the continent of America.</head>
               <p>Neither vpon the discoueries of <hi>Iaques Noel,</hi> who hauing
passed beyond the thr√©e Saults, where <hi>Iaques Carrier</hi> left to
discouer, finding the riuer of <hi>S. Laurence</hi> passable on the other
side or branch; and afterwards, vnderstood of the inhabitants,
that the same riuer did lead into a mighty lake, which at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23305:12"/>
the entrance was fresh, but beyond, was bitter or salt; the
end whereof was vnknowen.</p>
               <p>Omitting therefore these hopes, I will ground my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vpon reason and nature, which will not faile.</p>
               <p>For this we know alreadie, that great riuers haue b√©ene
discouered a thousand English miles into that continent of
<hi>America;</hi> namely, that of <hi>S. Laurence</hi> or <hi>Canada.</hi> But not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
miles more or lesse, most assuredly, that and other
knowen riuers there doe descend from the highest parts or
mountaines, or middle of that continent, into our North sea.
And like as those mountains doe cast from them,<note place="margin">A large course of a riuer tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a mightie continent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riuer.</note> streames in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our North seas; euen so the like they doe into the South sea,
which is on the backe of that continent.</p>
               <p>For all mountaines haue their descents toward the seas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, which are the lowest places and proper mansions
of water: and waters (which are contained in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
as it were in cisternes) descending naturally, doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
resort vnto the seas inuironing those lands: for exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple;
From the <hi>Alps</hi> confining <hi>Germanie, France,</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi>
the mighty riuer <hi>Danubie</hi> doth take his course East, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth
into the Pontique sea: the <hi>Rhine,</hi> North, and falleth
into the Germane sea: the <hi>Rhosne,</hi> West, and goeth into
the Mediterran sea: the <hi>Po,</hi> South, is emptied into the <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick</hi>
or gulfe of <hi>Venice.</hi> other instances may be produced
to like effect in <hi>Africk;</hi> yea, at home amongst the mountaines
in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing then in nature this can not be denied, and by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
elsewhere is found to be so, I will shew how a trade
may be disposed more commodiously into the South sea tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
these temperate and habitable regions, than by the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Zones in the supposed passages of Northwest or North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east:
where, if the very moment be omitted of the time to
passe, then are we like to be frozen in the seas, or forced to
Winter in extreame cold and darkenesse like vnto hell: or
in the midst of Summer, we shal be in perill to haue our ships
ouerwhelmed or crusht in pieces by hideous and fearefull
mountaines of yce floting vpon those seas.</p>
               <p>Therefore foure Staple-places must be erected, when the
most short and passable way is found: that is to say, two
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23305:12"/>
vpon the North side, at the head and fall of the riuer; and two
others on the South side, at the head and fall also of that other
riuer.</p>
               <p>Prouided, that ships may passe vp those riuers vnto the
Staples, so farre as the same be nauigable into the land; and
afterwards, that boats with flat bottomes may also passe so
high and n√©ere the heads of the riuers vnto the Staples, as
possibly they can, euen with lesse than two foot water, which
can not then be far from the heads; as in the riuer of <hi>Chagre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That necke or space of land betw√©ene the two heads of the
said riuers, if it be 100 leagues (which is not like) the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
from the North and from the South sea brought
thither, may wel be carried ouer the same vpon horses, mules
or beasts of that countrey apt to labour (as the elke or buffel)
or by the aid of many Saluages accustomed to burdens; who
shall stead vs greatly in these affaires.</p>
               <p>It is moreouer to be considered, that all these countreys do
y√©eld (so farre as is knowen) Cedars, Pines, Firre tr√©es and
Oaks, to build, mast, and yeard ships; wherefore we may
not doubt, but that ships may be builded on the South sea.</p>
               <p>Then as ships on the South side may goe and returne to
and from <hi>Cathay, China,</hi> and other most rich regions of the
East world in fiue moneths or thereabouts; euen so the goods
being carried ouer vnto the North side, ships may come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from <hi>England</hi> to fetch the same goods, and returne by a
voyage of foure or fiue moneths vsually.</p>
               <p>So as in euery foure moneths may be returned into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
the greatest riches of <hi>Cathay, China, Iapan,</hi> and the rest
which will be Spices, Drugges, Muske, Pearle, Stones,
Gold, Siluer, Silks, Clothes of gold, &amp; all maner of precious
things, which shall recompense the time and labour of their
transportation and carriage, if it were as farre and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
as the Moores trade is from <hi>Fess</hi> and <hi>Marocco</hi> (ouer
the burning and moueable sands, in which they perish many
times, and suffer commonly great distresses) vnto the riuer
called <hi>Niger</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and from thence, vp the said riuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
hundred miles; afterwards ouer-land againe, vnto the
riuer <hi>Nilus;</hi> and so vnto <hi>Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> from whence they
returne the way they came.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:23305:13"/>Or if it were a voyage so farre as our merchants haue
made into <hi>Persia,</hi> euen to <hi>Ormus,</hi> by the way of the North,
through <hi>Russia</hi> into the Caspian sea, and so foorth, with pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of many tolles. But this passage ouer and thorow the
continent of <hi>America,</hi> as the same shall be alwaies vnder
temperate and habitable climats, and a pleasant passage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it hath b√©ene a little frequented: euen so it must fall out
much shorter than it s√©emeth, by false description of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
which doth not extend so farre into the West, as by
later nauigations is found and described in more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit
charts. Besides that, the sea extends it selfe
into the land very farre in many places on
the South side; whereby our accesse
vnto the South ocean, shall
be by so much the
shorter.</p>

and consequently of her honour, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
and of her power by this enterprise.</p>
            <p>4 An ample vent in time to come of the Woollen clothes
of <hi>England,</hi> especially those of the coursest sorts, to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of our poore, that els sterue or become burdensome to
the realme: and vent also of sundry our commodities vpon the
tract of that firme land, and possibly in other regions from the
Northerne side of that maine.</p>
            <p>5 A great possibilitie of further discoueries of other regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the North part of the same land by sea, and of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
honor and benefit that may rise vpon the same, by
the trades to ensue in <hi>Iapan, China,</hi> and <hi>Cathay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6 By returne thence, this realme shall receiue (by reason
of the situation of the climate, and by reason of the excellent
soile) Oade, Oile, Wines, Hops, Salt, and most or all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
that we receiue from the best parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
we shall receiue the same better cheape, than now we receiue
them, as we may vse the matter.</p>
            <p>7 Receiuing the same thence, the nauie, the humane
strength of this realme, our merchants and their goods shal
not be subiect to arrest of ancient enemies &amp; doubtfull friends,
as of late y√©eres they haue b√©ene.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:23305:14"/>8 If our nation do not make any conquest there, but only
vse trafficke and change of commodities, yet by meane the
countrey is not very mightie, but diuided into pety kingdoms,
they shall not dare to offer vs any great annoy, but such as we
may easily reuenge with sufficient chastisement to the vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
people there.</p>
            <p>9 Whatsoeuer commodities we receiue by the St√©elyard
merchants, or by our owne merchants from <hi>Eastland,</hi> be it
Flaxe, Hempe, Pitch, Tarre, Masts, Clap-boord, Wainscot,
or such like; the like good may we receiue from the North and
Northeast part of that countrey n√©ere vnto <hi>Cape Briton,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
for our course Woollen clothes, Flanels and Rugges fit
for those colder regions.</p>
            <p>10 The passage to and fro, is thorow the maine Ocean sea,
so as we are not in danger of any enemies coast.</p>
            <p>11 In the voyage, we are not to crosse the burnt Zone, nor
to passe thorow frozen seas encombred with ice and fogs, but
in temperate climate at all times of the y√©ere: and it requireth
not, as the <hi>East Indie</hi> voiage doth, the taking in of water in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
places, by reason that it is to be sailed in fiue or six w√©eks:
and by the shortnesse, the merchant may y√©erely make two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes
(a factory once being erected there) a matter in trade of
great moment.</p>
            <p>12 In this trade by the way in our passe to and fro, we
haue in tempests and other haps, all the ports of <hi>Ireland</hi> to our
aid, and no n√©ere coast or any enemy.</p>
            <p>13 By this ordinary trade we may annoy the enemies to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and succour the Qu√©enes Maiesties friends there, and
in time we may from <hi>Virginia</hi> y√©eld them whatsoeuer commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
they now receiue from the Spaniard; and so the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
shall want the ordinary victual that heertofore they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
y√©erely from thence, and so they shall not continue trade,
nor fall so aptly in practise against this gouernment, as now by
their trade thither they may.</p>
            <p>14 We shall, as it is thought, enioy in this voyage, either
some small Islands to settle on, or some one place or other on
the firme land to fortifie for the saftie of our ships, our men,
and our goods, the like whereof we haue not in any forren
place of our trafficke, in which respect we may be in degr√©e of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23305:14"/>
more safetie, and more quiet.</p>
            <p>15 The great plentie of Buffe hides, and of many other
sundry kinds of hides there now presently to be had, the trade
of Whale and Seale fishing, and of diuers other fishings in
the great riuers, great bayes, and seas there, shall presently
defray the charge in good part or in all of the first enterprise,
and so we shall be in better case than our men were in <hi>Russia,</hi>
where many y√©eres were spent, and great summes of money
consumed, before gaine was sound.</p>
            <p>16 The great broad riuers of that maine that we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into so many leagues nauigable or portable into the maine
land, lying so long a tract with so excellent and so fertile a soile
on both sides, doe s√©eme to promise all things that the life of
man doth require, and whatsoeuer men may wish, that are to
plant vpon the same, or to trafficke in the same.</p>
            <p>17 And whatsoeuer notable commoditie the soile within or
without doth y√©eld in so long a tract that is to be carried out
from thence to <hi>England,</hi> the same riuers so great and d√©epe, do
y√©eld no small benefit for the sure, safe, easie and cheape cariage
of the same to shipboord, be it of great bulke or of great weight.</p>
            <p>18 And in like sort whatsoeuer commoditie of <hi>England</hi> the
<hi>Inland</hi> people there shall n√©ed, the same riuers doe worke the
like effect in benefit for the incariage of the same, aptly, easily,
and cheaply.</p>
            <p>19 If we finde the countrey populous, and desirous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
vs, and iniuriously to offend vs, that s√©eke but iust and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
trafficke, then by reason that we are lords of nauigation,
and they not so, we are the better able to defend our selues by
reason of those great riuers, &amp; to annoy them in many places.</p>
            <p>20 Where there be many petie kings or lords planted on
the riuers sides, and by all likelihood mainteine the frontiers of
their seuerall territories by warres, we may by the aide of this
riuer ioine with this king h√©ere, or with that king there, at our
pleasure, and may so with a few men be reuenged of any
wrong offered by any of them; or may, if we will proc√©ed with
extremitie, conquer, fortifie, and plant in soiles most sw√©et,
most pleasant, most strong, and most fertile, and in the end
bring them all in subiection and to ciuilitie.</p>
            <p>21 The knowen abundance of Fresh fish in the riuers, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23305:15"/>
the knowen plentie of Fish on the sea coast there, may assure
vs of sufficient victuall in spight of the people, if we will vse
salt and industrie.</p>
            <p>22 The knowen plentie and varietie of Flesh, of diuers
kinds of beasts at land there, may s√©eme to say to vs, that we
may cheaply victuall our nauies to <hi>England</hi> for our returnes,
which benefit euery where is not found of merchants.</p>
            <p>23 The practise of the people of the <hi>East Indies,</hi> when the
Portugals came thither first, was to cut from the Portugals
their lading of Spice: and heereby they thought to ouerthrow
their purposed trade. If these people shall practise the like, by
not suffering vs to haue any commoditie of theirs without
conquest, (which requireth some time) yet may we mainteine
our first voyage thither, till our purpose come to effect, by the
sea-fishing on the coasts there, and by dragging for pearles,
which are said to be on those parts; and by returne of those
commodities, the charges in part shall be defraied: which is a
matter of consideration in enterprises of charge.</p>
            <p>24 If this realme shall abound too too much with youth, in
the mines there of Golde, (as that of <hi>Chisca</hi> and <hi>Saguenay</hi>)
of Siluer, Copper, Yron, &amp;c. may be an imployment to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of this realme; in tilling of the rich soile there for graine,
and in planting of Uines there for Wine; or dressing of those
Uines which grow there naturally in great abundance, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues
for Oile; Orenge tr√©es, Limons, Figs and Almonds for
fruit; Oad, Saffron, and Madder for Diers; Hoppes for
Brewers; Hempe, Flaxe; and in many such other things, by
imploiment of the soile, our people void of sufficient trades,
may be honestly imploied, that els may become hurtfull at
home.</p>
            <p>25 The nauigating of the seas in the voyage, and of the
great riuers there, will br√©ed many Mariners for seruice, and
mainteine much nauigation.</p>
            <p>26 The number of raw Hides there of diuers kindes of
beasts, if we shall possesse some Island there, or settle on the
firme, may presently imploy many of our idle people in diuers
seuerall dressings of the same, and so we may returne them to
the people that can not dresse them so well; or into this realm,
where the same are good merchandize; or to <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23305:15"/>
present gaine at the first, raiseth great incouragement present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the enterprise.</p>
            <p>27 Since great waste Woods be there, of Oake, Cedar,
Pine, Wall-nuts, and sundry other sorts, many of our waste
people may be imployed in making of Ships, Hoies, Busses
and Boats; and to making of Rozen, Pitch and Tarre, the
tr√©es naturall for the same, being certeinly knowen to be n√©ere
<hi>Cape Briton</hi> and the Bay of <hi>Menan,</hi> and in many other places
there about.</p>
            <p>28 If mines of white or gray marble, Iet, or other rich stone
be found there, our idle people may be imployed in the mines
of the same, and in preparing the same to shape, and so shaped,
they may be caried into this realm as good balast for our ships,
and after serue for noble buildings.</p>
            <p>29 Sugar-canes may be planted aswell as they are now
in the South of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and besides the imploiment of our idle
people, we may receiue the commodity cheaper, and not inrich
infidels or our doubtful friends, of whom now we receiue that
commoditie.</p>
            <p>30 The daily great increase of Woolles in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the
like in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> and the great imploiment of the same
into Cloth in both places, may mooue vs to endeuour, for vent
of our Cloth, new discoueries of peopled regions, where hope
of sale may arise; otherwise in short time many inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
may possibly ensue.</p>
            <p>31 This land that we purpose to direct our course to, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in part in the 40 degree of latitude, being in like heat as
<hi>Lisbone</hi> in <hi>Portugall</hi> doth, and in the more Southerly part as
the most Southerly coast of <hi>Spaine</hi> doth, may by our diligence
yeeld vnto vs besides Wines and Oiles and Sugars, Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Limons, Figs, Resings, Almonds, Pomegranates, Rice,
Raw-silks such as come from <hi>Granada,</hi> and diuers commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for Diers, as Anile and Cochenillio, and sundry other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and materials. Moreouer, we shall not onely receiue
many precious commodities besides from thence, but also shal
in time finde ample vent of the labour of our poore people at
home, by sale of Hats, Bonets, Kniues, Fish-hooks, Copper
kettles, Beads, Looking-glasses, Bugles, &amp; a thousand kinds
of other wrought wares, that in short time may be brought in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23305:16"/>
vse among the people of that countrey, to the great reliefe of
the multitude of our poore people, and to the woonderfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
of this realme. And in time, such league &amp; entercourse
may arise betw√©ene our Stapling seats there, and other ports
of our Northern <hi>America,</hi> and of the Islands of the same, that
incredible things, and by few as yet dreamed of, may sp√©edily
follow, tending to the impeachment of our mightie enemies,
and to the common good of this noble gouernment.</p>
            <p>The ends of
this voyage
are these:
<list>
                  <item>1. To plant Christian religion.</item>
                  <item>2. To trafficke.</item>
                  <item>3. To conquer.</item>
               </list>
Or, to doe all
thr√©e.</p>
            <p>TO plant Christian religion without conquest, will b√©e
hard. Trafficke easily followeth conquest: conquest is
not easie. Trafficke without conquest s√©emeth possible, and
not vneasie. What is to be done, is the question.</p>
            <p>If the people be content to liue naked, and to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with few things of m√©ere necessity, then trafficke is not.
So then in vaine s√©emeth our voyage, vnlesse this nature may
be altered, as by conquest and other good meanes it may be,
but not on a sudden. The like whereof appeared in the <hi>East
Indies,</hi> vpon the Portugals seating there.</p>
            <p>If the people in the Inland be clothed, and desire to liue in
the abundance of all such things as <hi>Europe</hi> doth, and haue at
home all the same in plentie, yet we can not haue trafficke
with them, by meane they want not any thing that we can
y√©eld them.</p>
            <p>Admit that they haue desire to your commodities, and as
yet haue neither Golde, Siluer, Copper, Iron, nor sufficient
quantitie of other present commoditie to mainteine the y√©erely
trade: What is then to be done?</p>
            <p>The soile and climate first is to be considered,<note place="margin">Meanes to breed a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die trade.</note> and you are
with <hi>Argus</hi> eies to s√©e what commoditie by industrie of man
you are able to make it to y√©eld, that <hi>England</hi> doth want or
doth desire: as for the purpose, if you can make it to y√©eld good
Wine, or good Oile, as it is like you may by the climat, (where
wilde Uines of sundry sorts doe naturally grow already in
great abundance) then your trade may be mainteined. But
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23305:16"/>
admit the soile were in our disposition (as yet it is not) in
what time may this be brought about?</p>
            <p>For Wine this is to be affirmed, that first the soile lying in
36 or 37 degr√©es in the temperature of <hi>South Spaine,</hi> in setting
your Uine-plants this y√©ere, you may haue Wine within thr√©e
y√©eres. And it may be that the wilde Uines growing there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
by orderly pruning and dressing at your first arriuall,
may come to profit in shorter time.</p>
            <p>And planting your Oliue tr√©es this y√©ere, you may haue
Oile within thr√©e y√©eres.</p>
            <p>And if the sea shores be flat, and fit for receipt of salt water,
and for Salt making, without any annoy of n√©ere freshes,
then the trade of Salt onely may mainteine a y√©erely nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as our men now trade to the isle of <hi>Maio,</hi> and the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
to <hi>Terra Firma</hi> n√©ere the West end of the isle of <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But how the naturall people of the countrey may be made
skilfull to plant Uines, and to know the vse, or to set Oliue
tr√©es, and to know the making of Oile, and withall to vse both
the trades, that is a matter of small consideration: but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
a countrey or prouince in climate &amp; soile of <hi>Italie, Spaine,</hi>
or the Islands from whence we receiue our Wines &amp; Oiles,
and to man it, to plant it, and to k√©epe it, and to continue the
making of Wines and Oiles able to serue <hi>England,</hi> were a
matter of great importance both in respect of the sauing at
home of our great treasure now y√©erely going away, and in
respect of the annoyance thereby growing to our enemies.
The like consideration would be had, touching a place for the
making of Salt, of temperature like those of <hi>France,</hi> not too too
colde, as the Salts of the Northern regions be; nor too too firy,
as those be that be made more Southerly than <hi>France.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
whereof, many circumstances are to be considered; and
principally, by what meane the people of those parties may be
drawen by all courtesie into loue with our nation; that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
not hatefull vnto them, as the Spaniard is in <hi>Italie</hi> and
in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> and elswhere, by their maner of vsage: for
a gentle course without crueltie and tyrannie best answereth
the profession of a Christian,<note place="margin">A gentle course best to be held.</note> best planteth Christian religion;
maketh our seating most void of blood, most profitable in trade
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23305:17"/>
of merchandise, most firme and stable, and least subiect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
by practise of enemies. But that we may in seating
there, not be subiect wholly to the malice of enemies, and may
be more able to preserue our bodies, ships, and goods in more
safetie, and to be knowen to be more able to scourge the people
there, ciuill or sauage, than willing to offer any violence. And
for the more quiet exercise of our manurance of the soiles
where we shall seat, and of our manuall occupations, it is to
be wished that some ancient captaines of milde disposition and
great iudgement be sent thither with men most skilfull in the
arte of fortification; and that direction be taken that the
mouthes of great riuers, and the Islands in the same (as
things of great moment) be taken, manned, and fortified; and
that hauens be cut out for safetie of the Nauie, that we may be
lords of the gates and entries, to goe out and come in at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and to lie in safetie, and be able to command and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole
all within, and to force all forren nauigation to lie out in
open rode subiect to all weathers, to be dispersed by tempests
and flawes, if the force within be not able to giue them the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
abroad.</p>
            <p>THe Red Muscadell grape, that bishop <hi>Grindall</hi> procured
out of <hi>Germanie;</hi> the great White Muscadell; the Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

<hi>Fulham;</hi> and after one yeeres rooting to be giuen by the bishop,
and to be sold by his gardener. These presently prouided, and
placed in earth, and many of these so rooted, with store of cuts
vnrooted besides, placed in tubbes of earth shipped at the next
voyage, to be planted in <hi>Virginia,</hi> may begin Uineyards, and
bring Wines out of hand.</p>
            <p>2 Prouision great of wilde Oliue tr√©es may be made out
of this citie so then to be caried, to encrease great store of stocks
to graffe the best Oliue on: and <hi>Virginia</hi> standing in the same
degr√©e that <hi>The Shroffe</hi> the Oliue place doth in <hi>Spaine,</hi> we
may win that merchandise, grassing the wilde.</p>
            <p>3 Sugar-canes, if you can not procure them from the
Spanish Islands, yet may you by our Barberie merchants
procure them.</p>
            <p>4 There is an herbe in <hi>Persia,</hi> whereof Anile is made,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23305:17"/>
and it is also in <hi>Barbarie:</hi> to procure that by s√©ed or root, were
of importance for a trade of merchandise for our clothing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>5 Oad by the s√©eds you may haue; for you may haue
hundreds of bushels in <hi>England,</hi> as it is multiplied: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
soile and labor in <hi>Virginia</hi> cheape, and the Oad in great
value, lying in small roome, it will be a trade of great gaine to
this clothing realme: and the thing can not be destroyed by
Saluages. The roots of this you may haue in plenty and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
comming in the trade: so this may grow in trade within a
y√©ere ready for the merchant.</p>
            <p>6 Figge tr√©es of many good kinds may be had hence in
barrell, if now presently they be prouided; and they in that cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat
will y√©eld noble fruit, and feed your people presently, and
will be brought in frailes home as merchandise, or in barrell,
as Resings also may be.</p>
            <p>7 Sawed boords of Sassafras and Cedar, to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
small boxes for ladies and gentlewomen, would become a
present trade.</p>
            <p>8 To the infinite naturall increase of Hogs, to adde a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
how the same may be fed by roots, acornes, &amp;c. without
spoiling your corne, would be of great effect to f√©ed the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
continually imployed in labour: and the same cheaply
bred and salted, and barrelled there and brought home, will be
well solde for a good merchandise; and the barrels after, will
serue for our home Herring-fishing; and so you sell you woods
and the labour of your cooper.</p>
            <p>9 Receiuing the saluage women and their children of both
sexes by courtesie into your protection, and imploying the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
women and the others in making of Linnen, you shal raise
a woonderfull trade of benefit, both to carie into <hi>England</hi> and
also into the Islands, and into the maine of the <hi>West Indies,</hi>
victuall and labour being so cheape there.</p>
            <p>10 The trade of making cables and cordage there, will be
of great importance, in respect of a cheape maintenance of the
Nauie that shall passe to and fro; and in respect of such Nauie
as may in those parties be vsed for the venting of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of <hi>England</hi> to be brought thither. And Powldauies, &amp;c.
made for sailes of the poore Saluages, yeeld to the Nauie a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23305:18"/>
great helpe, and a great gaine in the trafficke.</p>
            <p>But if s√©eking reuenge on euery iniurie of the Saluages
we s√©eke blood &amp; raise war, our Uines, our Oliues, our Figge
tr√©es, our Sugar-canes, our Orenges and Limons, Corne,
Cattell, &amp;c. will be destroyed, and trade of merchandise in all
things ouerthrowen; and so the English nation there planted
and to be planted, shalbe rooted out with sword and hunger.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He bread which they eat in all the land of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida,</hi>
is of <hi>Maiz,</hi> which is like to course Millet.
And in all the Islands and <hi>West Indies</hi> from
the <hi>Antiles</hi> forward there is this <hi>Maiz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewise in <hi>Florida</hi> there be many Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts,
Plummes,<note place="margin">Their fruits.</note> Mulberies, &amp; Grapes. They
sowe their <hi>Maiz,</hi> and gather it, euery man his owne croppe.
The fruits are common to all men, because they grow abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
in the fields without planting or dressing. In the
mountaines there grow Chestnuts; they are somewhat smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
than the Chestnuts of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which are called <hi>Collar√≠nnas.</hi>
From <hi>Rio Grande</hi> toward the West, the Walnuts are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from the other; for they are softer and round like bullets.
And from <hi>Rio Grande</hi> toward <hi>Puerto del Spirito Santo</hi> East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
for the most part they are harder. And the Tr√©es and
Nuts are like in fashion vnto those of <hi>Spaine.</hi> There is in all
the countrey a fruit which groweth vpon an herbe or plant
like to the herbe called Dogs-tongue, which the Indians doe
sowe. The fruit is like vnto the <hi>Peres Rial:</hi> it is of a very good
rellish,<note place="margin">These may be the <hi>Tunas.</hi>
               </note> and of a pleasant taste. Another herbe groweth in the
fields, which beareth a fruit n√©ere the ground like to a Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie,
very pleasant in taste. The Plummes are of two sorts,
red and gray, in fashion and bignesse of Walnuts, and haue
thr√©e or foure stones in them. These are better than any in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and they make better Prunes of them. The want of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23305:20"/>
dressing is perceiued only in the Grapes: which although they
be great, yet they haue a great kernell. All the rest of the fruits
are very perfect, and lesse hurtfull than those of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are in <hi>Florida</hi> many Beares,<note place="margin">The beasts of <hi>Florida.</hi>
               </note> Lions, Stags, Roe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucks,
Wild-cats, and Conies.</p>
            <p>There be many Wild-hennes as bigge as Peacocks, small
Partridges like those of <hi>Africa,</hi> Cranes, Ducks, <hi>Rolas,</hi> Black-birds,
and Sparrowes. There be certeine Blacke birds big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than Sparrowes and lesser than Stares.</p>
            <p>There be Sore-hauks, Faulcons, Gosse-hauks, and all
fowles of pray that are in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Indians are well proportioned. Those of the plaine
countreys are taller of stature, and better proportioned than
those of the mountaines. Those of the Inland are better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with corne and wealth of the countrey, than those of the
sea coast. The countrey on the sea coast toward the gulfe of
<hi>Mexico</hi> is barren and poore, and the people more warrelike.
The coast beareth from <hi>Puerto del Spirito Santo</hi> vnto <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lache,</hi>
