            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as made the event doubtful,</hi> I taking the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>
to be my lawful King, 'tis well known that I aſſiſted him all
that I could at the <hi>Boyn.</hi>

               <p>And as to <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Praying,</hi> and all that, — 'tis
as well known that I did what became me as early as the moſt
forward of them all, and therefore, Wo is me, I am utterly
excluded, according to the Doctor, from all hopes of a

               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Don't deſpond, my Friend, however; for I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
an honeſt Man may yet be allow'd to tell the Doctor to
his face, That our King, and his Royal Conſort Q. <hi>Mary,</hi>
have a <hi>Right,</hi> a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>indiſputable Right,</hi> not only to what
they <hi>poſſeſs</hi> at preſent, but to what they <hi>claim,</hi> and is forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
detein'd from them by the Rebels.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Div.</speaker>
               <p>What need you be ſo earneſt tho? Let me beg of you,
Noble Captain, to <hi>moderate</hi> your Zeal for the King's Honor
and Service a little at preſent, that you may the better <hi>attend</hi>
to the Doctor, who ſays again, <hi>That many of thoſe who have
writ in defence of the new Oath, have ſuppoſed this, that a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Right is neceſſary to make Allegiance due, and therefore
have endeavoured to juſtifie the Legal Right of K.</hi> William and
Q. Mary. <hi>Pag.</hi> 1.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but what <hi>Effect</hi> had thoſe Endeavours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his late <hi>Converſion?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Div.</speaker>
               <p>None at all, it ſeems; for in the ſame breath he tells
us, That <hi>How well ſoever ſuch Diſputes may be intended, they
are certainly needleſs in this Cauſe, and ſerve only to confound
it, by carrying Men into ſuch dark Labyrinths of Law and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
&amp;c. as very few know how to find their way out of again,</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>He's an admirable Advocate the while, to betray
his Cauſe thus at the firſt daſh, by telling the World in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that we have neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Precedent</hi> to ſupport it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Div.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, if the Doctor does not play Booty, I don't
underſtand him; for let but the foundation-Claim of <hi>Legal
Right</hi> be once removed, and our glorious Superſtructure muſt
infallibly come to the ground; for what any one <hi>wrongfully</hi>
poſſeſſes (be it a <hi>Crown</hi> or a <hi>Cottage)</hi> moſt Men will think
ought to be reſtored to the <hi>right Owner.</hi> And what if none
of thoſe <hi>many Writers</hi> he talks of, have been ſo happy in their
<hi>Endeavours</hi> to juſtifie the <hi>Legal Right</hi> of K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi>
as a body might wiſh, does it become him to declare ſo to all
the World? And over and above, to lay an Embargo, as
it were, upon all <hi>future Attempts</hi> of that kind? We have
known how fruitleſs, for a long time, the <hi>Endeavours</hi> of <hi>ſome
Men</hi> to prove the <hi>Original Contract,</hi> were rendered by the
contrary <hi>Endeavours</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> till Time, that brings all
things to light, has made it as <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>legible</hi> as now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.
Now I my ſelf (I ſpeak it without Vanity) dare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to produce <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory</hi> enough in half an hour,
not only to <hi>juſtifie</hi> his Majeſties late doings, which ſome
Men ſeem to take ſo much pleaſure in cenſuring, but to free
all the honeſt Loyal Party from that <hi>Reproach</hi> they have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
under from the beginning of the late <hi>Troubles</hi> to this

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Explain your ſelf a little however, that I may know
<hi>what King</hi> you mean, and <hi>who</hi> thoſe are which in your eſteem
are the <hi>honeſt Loyal Party.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Div.</speaker>
               <p>That is ſuch an odd Queſtion now, when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
tell's us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 14. (how conſiſtently with him ſelf it
matters not) that <hi>we can have but one King at a time;</hi> but
to humour you for once, by <hi>King</hi> I mean a <hi>Lawful King;</hi>
or if you had rather have it in <hi>Latin, a King de jure,</hi> which
I take our King to be; and by <hi>honeſt Loyal Party,</hi> I mean
thoſe who have in all times, even in the worſt of times,
ſtrictly adhered to ſuch their <hi>Lawful King,</hi> in oppoſition to
all the injurious Claims and Pretences of <hi>Oliver,</hi> the <hi>Rump,
Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>the like.</hi>

               <p>I underſtand <hi>you</hi> now. But 'tis hard to ſay what
the <hi>Doctor</hi> would be at; for after he had led us out of the
<hi>dark Labyrinths</hi> of <hi>Law, &amp;c.</hi> and put us under the conduct
of <hi>Providence,</hi> and <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. taught us to follow Her ſtep by
ſtep, in ſuch ſort as to proportion our <hi>Duties</hi> of Allegiance
to all her <hi>Events,</hi> and to take for the <hi>Object</hi> of thoſe Duties
<hi>any Powers</hi> whatever (tho deſtitute of all <hi>Legal Right)</hi> ſo
ſettled (no matter by what means) as may agree with his
Definition of <hi>thorough ſettled Powers, Pag.</hi> 9. After all this,
I ſay, the Doctor (having probably found more <hi>Difficulties</hi> in
Providence, than that <hi>one</hi> which he mentions, <hi>Pag.</hi> 32.)
brings us back again into the <hi>dark Labyrinths <hi>of</hi> Law.—</hi> I
hope he means us no harm.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Why the Doctor ſays, <hi>Pag.</hi> 54. that <hi>what Prince
we muſt obey, and to what particular Prince we muſt pay our
Allegiance, the Law of God does not tell us, but this we muſt
learn from the Laws of the Land;</hi> And ſo he proceeds, <hi>Ibid.</hi>
to ſtate the Queſtion, <hi>whether the Subjects of England (when
ſuch a Caſe happens) muſt pay their Allegiance to a King de

who is poſſeſſed of it without a Legal Right?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>But to <hi>whoſe Determination</hi> will he ſubmit that Point?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>He tells you in effect by a pair of other Queſtions,
<hi>Ibid. Is it not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>moſt reaſonable to think that to be the
ſenſe of the Law, which learned Judges and Lawyers have agreed
is the ſenſe of it?</hi> And again, <hi>Is it not reaſonable to take that
to be the ſenſe of the Law, which has been the ſenſe of</hi> Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Hall,
<hi>and is like to be ſo again, if we think fit to try it.</hi>

               <speaker>Div.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>

               <p>Thanks good Captain — Now I ſee my way.
But as I was ſaying, the Doctor had done well to have told
us, whether by his <hi>Learned Judges</hi> he would have us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
Judges <hi>de facto</hi> or <hi>de jure?</hi> For who knows but by
his <hi>Learned Judges who have agreed,</hi> &amp;c. he may mean
<hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and his Companions, and by his <hi>Learned Lawyers</hi>
that <hi>Cook</hi> who pleaded in quality of Sollicitor before the
<hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> ſo call'd, and <hi>Prideaux</hi> and the reſt
of that Tribe of <hi>Mercenaries</hi> to the Uſurpers of thoſe times
many of whom (it cannot be denyed) were ſufficiently
<hi>Learned.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>But I think they had no Honeſty to ſpare,
<q>
                     <l>For 'tis well known that <hi>Glynn</hi> and <hi>M—d</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>To make good Subjects Traytors, ſtrain'd hard.</l>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Div.</speaker>
               <p>The Doctor you ſee has not made <hi>Honeſty</hi> a neceſſary
<hi>Qualification</hi> to Authoriſe the judgments or determinations
of his <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Lawyers:</hi> But if he had, 'tis all one to
him, for according to his Notions thoſe Sparks were very
honeſt Fellows; they acted by Commiſſions from the then
<hi>Powers</hi> who, according to his account of the matter, were
<hi>thorough ſetled Powers,</hi> and the <hi>Ordinance of God,</hi> to whom
all Allegiance was due, and which ought not to be reſiſted.
Now though the Doctor would not be thought a friend to
the Uſurpations of the <hi>Rump Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Late Protector,</hi>
or <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> &amp;c. but in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and in ſome
other parts of his Book, ſeems to caſt them all off, yet to the
<hi>Objection</hi> pag. 45, 46. <hi>that upon his Principles we might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and ſwear to a Rump Parliament, or to another Protector,
or to a Committee of Safety,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that his Principles arraign
all the Oppoſers of thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations as the Reſiſters of Gods
Ordinance,</hi> &amp;c. He gives ſuch an Anſwer you'l ſee as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
acknowledges them all to have been God's Ordinance,
which ought to have been complied with and not reſiſted,
his Anſwer is, <hi>that it is a great prejudice, but no Argument;
for if theſe Principles be true,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>and according to theſe
Principles they</hi> (the Loyal Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy)
<hi>might have complied with thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations; that they did not,
is no confutation of them.</hi> It is plain, I think, by this that
the Doctor himſelf found that he could not ſupport his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
upon any other Principles than would juſtifie thoſe
Powers, <hi>and Arraign the honeſt Loyal Nobility, Gentry, and
Clergy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as reſiſting God's Ordinance by their Oppoſition to
thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurped Powers, and their attempts to reſtore their
King to his Throne.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>Well, But he can't expect to top upon many the
Judgments and Opinions of the <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> of thoſe
times, for an Authentick Senſe of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Div.</speaker>
               <p>Where will he be then? for if he means publick
Judgments or Opinions of any who either have ſate, or do
fit as Judges in any of the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by K. <hi>W's.</hi>
Commiſſion, or any Opinions of Lawyers delivered at any
of the Bars of thoſe Courts before them, in favour of his
Doctrine in this Point, he ſhould have cited one <hi>Caſe</hi> at
leaſt; ſince moſt People, I preſume, are Strangers to any
ſuch <hi>Judgment</hi> given in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> during this Reign,
and do think that if the Doctor at any time ſince the <hi>New
Oath</hi> was appointed to be taken, could have found his way
from the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> whither he is ſo
ready now to direct others, ſome of the <hi>Learned</hi> there might
have told him another <hi>Story.</hi> And if he means by his <hi>has
been agreed,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>has been the ſenſe of Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>
ſome Judgment or Sentence given in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent

of <hi>Submiſſion</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to any Powers <hi>de facto,</hi> not
having <hi>Legal Right,</hi> 'tis probable ſuch Judgment was extant in
Print before the Tryal of the Regicides, who might then
have offer'd it in their own defence, and if that they did not
was owing to their Ignorance of the Law, it may however
be reaſonably ſuppoſed that ſome of the many Honourable
<hi>Commiſſioners of Oyer and Terminer,</hi> Learned in the Law,
before whom they were tryed, would have found it out, and
accordingly have directed the Jury to have acquitted them
from the crime of High Treaſon, of which they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted;

by whoſe Commiſſion the Regicides acted, being ſuch <hi>ſetled

and <hi>Legal,</hi> though their Maſters were <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> for want

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
               <p>No more, I think, than what in effect he ſaid before
pag. 46. <hi>That this is a great Prejudice, but no Argument, for
if his Principles be true and according to his Principles, thoſe
who ſate as Judges in the High Court of Juſtice, and their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants
at the Tryal of King</hi> Charles I. <hi>did no more than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them to do, and ſo ought to have been acquitted; that
they were not is no confutation of his Principles: For if Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Judges, and Lawyers have agreed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if it has been
the Senſe of</hi> Weſtminſter-Hall, <hi>&amp;c. And if that be the Senſe
of the Law, and is like to be ſo again if we think fit to try
it; that it was not ſufficiently urged or inſiſted upon in their
favour, and that they were not acquitted does not prove that it
might not have been ſo urged and inſiſted upon in their favour,
or that they ought not to have been acquitted.</hi> Now though,
I am certain the Law condemns all Uſurpations whatever up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Regal Office, yet I will not deny but it has been the
conſtant Senſe of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> under every Uſurpation,
that all the duties of Allegiance ought to be paid to the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but not <hi>eo nomine,</hi> not as Uſurper I hope, no thoſe
who at any time, by Commiſſions from Uſurpers, have ſate
as Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> knew well enough that to
admit in the leaſt the Legal Right of their Maſters to be
diſputed, would be to admit their own Authority to fit and
determine Cauſes there to be queſtioned, and therefore even
that ſame <hi>High Court of Juſtice</hi> would have told the Doctor
if he had demurr'd to their Authority, or (which would
have been the ſame thing) to the Legal Right of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers,
as they told the Bleſſed Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> I. Sir, <hi>I
