            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE To the CITY, Newly after the Removal of the Duke's Company from Lincoln's-Inn-fields to their new Theatre, near Salisbury-Court.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>OUR Author (like us) finding 'twould scarce do,</l>
               <l>At t'other end o'th' Town, is come to you:</l>
               <l>And since 'tis his last Tryal, has that Wit</l>
               <l>To throw himself on a substantial Pit.</l>
               <l>Where needy Wit, or Critick dare not come,</l>
               <l>Lest Neighbour i'the Cloak, with looks so grum,</l>
               <l>Shou'd prove a <hi>Dunne;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Where <hi>Punk</hi> in vizor dare not rant and tear</l>
               <l>To put us out, since <hi>Bridewel</hi> is so near;</l>
               <l>In short, we shall be heard, be understood,</l>
               <l>If not, shall be admir'd and that's as good;</l>
               <l>For you to sensless Plays have still been kind,</l>
               <l>Nay, where no sense was, you a Jest wou'd find:</l>
               <l>And never was it heard of, that the City</l>
               <l>Did ever take occasion to be witty</l>
               <l>Upon dull Poet, or stiff Players Action,</l>
               <l>But still with claps oppos'd the hissing Faction.</l>
               <l>But if you hiss'd, 'twas at the Pit, not Stage,</l>
               <l>So, with the Poet, damn'd the damning Age,</l>
               <l>And still we know are ready to ingage</l>
               <l>Against the flouting, ticking Gentry who</l>
               <l>Citizen, Player, Poet, wou'd undo,</l>
               <l>The Poet, no; unless by commendation;</l>
               <l>For on the Change, Wits have no reputation;</l>
               <l>And rather than be branded for a Wit,</l>
               <l>He with you, able men, wou'd credit get.</l>

                     <p>Hold, hold—your resentment is as much greater than mine, as your experience has been greater; but all this while, what do we make of my Cousin, my Husband elect (as my Aunt says) we have had his Company these three days. Is he no man?</p>

                     <p>Or if I provide not my self with another in the mean time! For Fathers seldom chuse well, and I will no more take my Father's choice in a Husband, than I would in a Gown or a Suit of Knots: so that if that Cousin of mine were not an ill contriv'd ugly Freekish-fool, in being my Father's choice, I shou'd hate him; besides he has almost made me out of love with mirth and good humour, for he debases it as much as a Jack-pudding; and Civility and good Breeding more than a City Dancing-Master.—</p>

This is one of your confident Tricks too, as I have been told, you'll be acquainted with a Woman in the time you can help her over a Bench in the Play-house, or to her Coach: but I need not wonder at your confidence, since you cou'd come in at the great Gallery-window just now.

                     <p>Well, Child, I am satisfi'd then; but I hope he does not use the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-masters tricks of squeezing your hands, setting your Legs and Feet, by handling your Thighs, and seeing your Legs.</p>

                     <p>Poor Innocent! Well I am contented you shou'd learn to dance; since, for ought I know, you shall be marry'd to morrow, or the next day at farthest, by that time you may recover a Corant, a Sarabrand I wou'd say; and since your Cousin too will have a dancing Wife, it shall be so, and I'll see you dance my self, you shall be my Charge these two days, and then I dare venture you in the hand of any Dancing-master, even a sawcy <hi>French</hi> Dancing-master, look you.</p>

                     <p>No, no, if I went, I would go for good and all; but now my Father will soon come in again, and may quickly overtake us; besides, now I think on't, you are a Stranger to me.

                     <p>Nay, I know 'tis the trick of all you that spirit Women away to speak 'em mighty fair at first; but when you have got 'em in your Clutches, you carry 'em into <hi>Yorkshire, Wales,</hi> or <hi>Cornwall,</hi> which is as bad as to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be served so, I would be a Pris'ner in <hi>London</hi> still as I am.</p>

                     <p>I see the Air of this Town without the pleasures of it, is enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Women with an aversion for the Country. Well, Miss, since it seems you have some diffidence in me, give me leave to visit you as your Dancing-master, now you have honour'd me with the Character, and under that, I may have your Fathers permission to see you, till you may better know me and my heart, and have a better opportunity to reward it.</p>

                     <p>I thank you for that, Sir, how you have made bold with me indeed; but if I am such a confident Piece, I am sure you made me so; if you had not had the confidence to come in at the Window, I had not had the confidence to look upon a Man: I am sure I cou'd not look upon a Man before.</p>

                     <p>But that I humbly conceive, sweet Miss, was your Fathers fault, because you had not a Man to look upon. But, dearest Miss, I do not think you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, you are only innocent; for that which would be called confidence, nay impudence in a Woman of years, is called innocency in one of your age; and the more impudent you appear, the more innocent you are thought.</p>

                     <speaker>Hipp.</speaker>
                     <p>Say you so! has Youth such Priviledges? I do not wonder then most Women seem impudent, since it is to be thought younger than they are it seems; but indeed, Master you are as great an Encourager of impudence I see, as if you were a Dancing master in good earnest.</p>

                     <p>Come, dear Miss, let me tell you how I have design'd matters; for in talking of anything else we lose time and opportunity: people abroad indeed say the <hi>English</hi> Women are the worst in the World in using an opportunity, they love tittle tattle and Ceremony.</p>

                     <speaker>Hipp.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis because I warrant opportunities are not so scarce here as abroad, they have more here than they can use; but let people abroad say what they will of <hi>English</hi> Women, because they do not know 'em, but what say people at home?</p>

                     <p>Yes, but it goes against my Conscience to be accessary to so ill a thing; you say you do it for my sake?</p>

                     <p>Come, Dearest, this is not a time for scruples nor modesty; modesty between Lovers is as impertinent as Ceremony between Friends, and modesty is now as unseasonable as on the Wedding night: come away, my Dearest.</p>

when I declare to the contrary? I take it unkindly, that the longer I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with you, you shou'd have the less confidence in me.</p>

                     <p>Nay, he shall thank me for that too; but how came you two to quarrel? I thought, Cousin, you had had more wit than to quarrel, or more kindness for me than to quarrel here: what if my Father hearing the Bustle shou'd have come in, he wou'd soon have discover'd our false Dancing-master (for passion un-masks every man) and then the result of your quarrel had been my ruine.</p>

                     <p>None but those who wou'd delight in a Husbands jealousie, as the proof of his love and her honour.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hipp.</speaker>
                     <p>Hold, Sir, let us have a good understanding betwixt one another at first, that we may be long Friends; I differ from you in the point, for a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands jealousie, which cunning men wou'd pass upon their Wives for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, is the worst can be made 'em, for indeed it is a Complement to their Beauty, but an affront to their Honour.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Ger.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Hipp.</speaker>
                     <p>So that upon the whole matter I conclude, jealousie in a Gallant is humble true Love, and the height of respect, and only an undervaluing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to overvalue her; but in a Husband 'tis arrant sawciness, cowardise, and ill breeding, and not to be suffer'd.</p>

                     <speaker>Hipp.</speaker>
                     <p>I intended 'em for our guard and defence against my Fathers Spanish and Guiney force, when we were to make our retreat from hence, and to help us to take the Keys from my Aunt, who has been the watchful Porter of this House this twelve-month; and this design (if your heart do not fail you) we will put in execution, as soon as you have given your friends below instructions.</p>

                     <p>The time last night was not so proper for us as now, for reasons I will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you; but besides that, I confess, I had a mind to try whether your interest did not sway you more than your love; whether the twelve hundred pounds a year I told you of, had not made a greater impression in your heart than Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita; but finding it otherwise—yet hold, perhaps upon consideration you are grown wiser; can you yet, as I said, be so desperate, so out of fashion, as to steal a Woman with nothing?</p>

                     <p>Alas, alas, all the sputter I made was but to make this Young man, my Cousin, believe, when the thing shou'd be effected, that it was not with my connivence or consent; but since he is so well satisfi'd, I own it. For do you think I wou'd ever have suffer'd her to marry a <hi>Monsieur,</hi> a <hi>Monsieur Guarda.</hi> Besides, it had been but a beastly incestuous kind of a Match, voto—</p>

                     <p>I was resolv'd too, my Daughter shou'd not marry a Coward, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made the more ado to try you, Sir, but I find you are a brisk Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, firm, stiff, Spanish Honour; and that you may see I deceiv'd you all a long, and you not me; ay, and am able to deceive you still; for, I know, now you think that I will give you little or nothing with my Daughter (like other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) since you have marry'd her without my consent; but, I say, I'll deceive you now, for you shall have the most part of my Estate in present, and the rest at my death; there's for you, I think I have deceiv'd you now, look you.</p>

                  <l>THE Ladies first I am to Compliment,</l>
                  <l>Whom (if he cou'd) the Poet wou'd content,</l>
                  <l>But to their pleasure then they must consent.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Most spoil their sport still by their modesty,</l>
                  <l>And when they shou'd be pleas'd, cry out, O fie,</l>
                  <l>And the least smooty jest will ne'er pass by.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But City damsel ne'er had confidence,</l>
                  <l>At smooty Play to take the least offence,</l>
                  <l>But Mercy shews, to shew her innocence.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet lest the Merchants Daughters shou'd to day</l>
                  <l>Be scandaliz'd, not at our harmless Play;</l>
                  <l>But our <hi>Hippolita,</hi> since she's like one</l>
                  <l>Of us bold Flirts, of t'other end o' th' Town;</l>
                  <l>Our Poet sending to you (though unknown)</l>
                  <l>His best respects by me, do's frankly own</l>
                  <l>The character to be unnatural;</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Hippolita</hi> is not like you at all;</l>
                  <l>You, while your Lovers court you, still look grum,</l>
                  <l>And far from wooing, when they woo, cry mum;</l>
                  <l>And if some of you e'er were stoll'n away,</l>
                  <l>Your Portion's fault 'twas only I dare say:</l>
                  <l>Thus much for him the Poet bid me speak,</l>
                  <l>Now to the men, I my own mind will break;</l>

                  <l>We must depend, when Sparks to Sea are gone;</l>
                  <l>Into the Pit already you are come,</l>
                  <l>'Tis but a step more to our Tyring room;</l>

                  <l>Upon an able Love of <hi>Lumber</hi>-street:</l>

                  <l>Than spend-thrift Fops with better Cloaths and meens;</l>
                  <l>Instead of Lac'd-coats, Belts, and Pantalloons,</l>
                  <l>Your Velvet Jumps, Gold Chains, and grave Fur Gowns,</l>
                  <l>Instead of Perriwigs, and broad cock'd Hats,</l>
                  <l>Your Sattin Caps, smalls Cuffs, and vast Crevats;</l>
                  <l>For you are fair and square in all your dealings,</l>
                  <l>You never cheat your Doxies with gilt Shillings;</l>
                  <l>You ne'er will break our Windows, then you are</l>
                  <l>Fit to make love, while our Houzaas make War;</l>
                  <l>And since all Gentlemen must pack to Sea,</l>
                  <l>Our Gallants, and our Judges you must be;</l>
                  <l>We therefore, and our Poet, do submit</l>
