            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is somewhat, but yet not enough; because they are the most excellent Creatures for Prudence, and profit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept man; and indeed the divine wisdome hath thus ordered it, that wee might understand that Prudence consists not in the greatnesse of the body, but in the minde, which hath no need of magnitude, but as it is lesse, is so much the more excellent. Here is <hi>magnum in parvo,</hi> a little in quantity, but much in worth and quality.</p>
                     <p>The Bee is a little creature, but Gods smallest springs prove at length main Oceans, his least beginnings grow into great works, great wonders.</p>
                     <p>Who can imagine that so many pleights and joints, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99780:17"/>
and concatenations, should bee orderly disposed in so small a fabrick? That in a body so little, the joints should move so actively, the wings stirre so nimbly, the sting pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate so deeply, the senses utter forth themselves so sharply, Nay, the lungs, (though scarcely visible) to breath so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,<note place="margin">Chrysost. Comment in Epist. Paull ad Philip. c. 2. c. 4.</note> doth any then glory, or is proud for his skill in various arts! What in this respect is wiser, or better instructed than the Bee? What Artificer is so various, what Painter, what Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician can imitate her works?</p>
                     <p>Why do wee then marvail at the Tower-bearing shoulders of Elephants, and not rather where Nature hath planted so many senses, and such industry in such little bodies? where is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and feeling, yea where are the<note place="margin">Pliny saith, no creature can live or move without them.</note> Veines and Arteries in these so little bodies, which a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from us can scarcely bee seen with our eyes: And what shall wee say of the parts of the same? and yet in this little Bee is such sagacity and industry, as the like is not seen in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of greater quantity.</p>
                     <p>The great Artifex of Nature hath enlarged the smaller crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with wisdome, and invention, so teaching that greatnesse<note place="margin">Tertul. adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Marcion. lib. 1.</note> is to bee found in meannesse (as the Apostle saith) strength in infirmities. Imitate if thou canst the Bees buildings, the Ants hills, or lodgings, the Spiders nets, the Silk-worms webbs.</p>
                     <p>Such therefore are not a little mistaken, who affirm that there is neither much strength, nor yet such beauty in small crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Ant. of Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vara famil.

                     <p>And though the greatest thing the Vulgar praise her for, is her laborious industry, yet indeed the least thing that may bee praised in her, is her industry.</p>

The Drones eyes are farre larger, being almost two thirds of their head, with two moveable wreathed horns, growing out together between the eyes, but extending like a fork.</p>
                     <p>For gathering her provision, shee hath two instruments, her fangs, and her tongue; her fangs in fashion of a pair of pincers, hang not as the jaws of other things, one over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but side-waies, one against the other: Her tongue is of that length, that her mouth cannot hold it, but being doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led between her fangs under her throat, it reacheth to her breast; it is divided into three parts, whereof the two outmost serve as a case to cover the third, which being the chief, the Bee in her work, putteth forth beyond the other, and draweth in again as shee pleaseth, and this third is likewise parted into three; so that there are five in all.</p>
                     <p>In their fangs or chaps, wherein are their teeth, their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal strength consisteth; for in their conflicts, where they slay one with their sting, they kill twenty with their teeth, quickly biting off the wings, or breaking the leggs of their adversaries: And therefore <hi>Mr. Butler</hi> was somewhat deceived, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth this pinching of other Insects (for against them only do they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> use them) to bee rather a chiding, than a fighting, a warning, than a punishment; being indeed a deadly and mortal instrument of revenge; so that after a battel you shall see them lye sprauling, hopping away, and crauling in great multitudes, either drawing on the ground one, or more of their leggs, or doubling the nether part towards the ground, or turning the same awry to the one side, or other, but as many as are bitten, within a short space will certainly dye.</p>

It is a report not confirmed by any, but supposing it true, the Bees (not Flies) were small, like unto the <hi>American</hi> Bees, and the Ants great, such as are in some parts of the <hi>Indies</hi> greater than our Flies.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, there is some difference in the bigness of Bees, but it is accidental, for they that are loaded (especially with water or honey) seem greater and longer than those that are empty. The Nymphs also when they come first abroad are not grown to the full bigness, which afterwards they have; and the old ones do wither and become little again.</p>
                     <p>Likewise in these three Ages their colours also do vary; for in their middle age they are brown, whereas before they are more pale, and at the last they grow grey, of whitish again, but these are differences of Bees in the same hive, and not of one hive from another, since these divers sorts are in every Hive.<note place="margin">Natal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Com.

                     <p>BEES are neither absolutely wilde, nor altogether tame crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but of a middle nature between both. Some Bees are not (as some conceit) ignorant or negligent in gathering honey, and framing their combs, but yet serviceable in meaner imployments (as fetching water, watching, and warding) but all are naturally skilfull in all their proper labours, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably perform them. Their sting is more often the cause of their ruine, than instrumental for their relief; for loosing it (which they alwayes do when they sting) they unavoydably lose their lives; but with the fear of it they often chase away timorous persons from their Hives.</p>
                     <p>Some fancy that the cause of their humming noyse while they flye, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, least they should bee deprehended for theeves; whereas the robbing Bee, or theef, boldly discovers his purpose, as soon as hee comes near the hive which hee intends to assault, with a loud threatning noyse, proclaiming their destruction, if they shall resist, and not willingly permit their goods to bee plundered, endeavouring by fear to betray the courage that self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preservation should arm them with.</p>
                     <p>That some Bees stay at home to receive the labours of those<note place="margin">Arist. in histot. Anim. l. 9. c. 40.</note> that go to work (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> delivers) is but a fable; hee saith the Bees returning from their labour, shake themselves, and three or four attend and follow, and ease them of their burden.</p>
                     <p>That they carry in a windy season little stones to poise themselves, is a false relation; yet in a storm they will help themselves by flying under the Lee-side of an hedge, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassing a high and hilly place (if there bee any) and so as it were by making a board (as Sea-men speak) take the advantage of the wind. But if it bee a plain Champaign Country, where evasions avail nothing; then if the wind blow strong against them, they flye low, and almost close to the ground, and rest often.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, The smaller Bees are more industrious than
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99780:22"/>
the greater; his reason is, their wings are worn and jagged, their colour black, and their backs bowing, when saith hee, the greater are smooth and beautiful (like idle women) when indeed they are originally of one magnitude, but growing old, their bodies, are small thin, and grey, and their wings torn and tattered, a certain symptome of an approaching death, whereas the others beauty, and lustiness is a Crysis of their youth, not their idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>In the morning they are husht and still, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till one (surely the Master of the watch) with two or three loud buzzings calls them all up as it were to work: But no such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing sound could I ever hear; nay I am confident there is none at all. But some such like thing is practised by the Apes which some have transferred to the Bees.</p>

                     <p>When the Bees likewise return from work, they are (as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and others) a while in a tumul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Bees live in a Martial discipline like Souldiers in a Garrison, some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies watching and warding, understand it of the Summer season, when the chilling cold, or nipping frost doth not force them into their Hives: yet in the day time they continue it longer.</p>

Upon dissection I have found that onely the head being cut off, the horns, the chaps, and the tongue also will stir, and that a great while after the separation from the body. Now the reason hereof may bee this, Bees have the spirks diffused, amost all over, and therefore they move in their several peeces, whereas men and beasts move very little time after their heads are off: And therefore it is certain, that the immediate cause of death, is the resolution or extinguishment of the spirits, and that the destruction or corruption of the Organs, is but the mediate cause; but some Organs are so peremptorily neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that the extinguishment of the spirits doth speedily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but yet so, as there is an interim of a small time; but for Worms and Bees the spirits are diffused almost all over, and therefore they move in their several peeces.</p>

But this by experience is found to bee otherwise, and birds that have long tailes, yet have a jumping motion in their flight, as the Wagtaile.</p>
                     <p>When the Hives are full of Bees, and well supplied with meat, neither moths, nor any other hurtful creature can much endanger them; but when they are few and weak, they easily miscarry by every adversary; so that it is not a signe of a better sort of Bee, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> delivers, but onely of want of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or strength, when they neglect their own preservation, which sometimes they having formerly endeavoured, and finding their labours frustrate, they grow desperate and careless; but though in number they bee but few, and therefore their dangers many; their provision little, and therefore their fare poor and pinching, yet will they not forsake their own Commonwealth to communicate of the wealth or strength of others, but without repining rest contented, yet by diligence endeavouring to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove

                     <p>Bees delight to play abroad before the Hive, flying in and out as thick as if they were fighting or swarming, in breeding time, once a day usually, if it bee fair weather, and ordinarily at a set time, each Hive observing the same hour of the day if it bee fair; and then they will expatiate and dance the Hay in circling motions, and surrounding Vagaries; and at other times when they have been long shut up with cold, or closer weather, the first fair day they will thus abroad both to recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and also to ease their bodies, for they evacuate for the most part flying.</p>

                     <p>Their Ethicks and Economicks appear in many particulars, They make frugality the basis of their subsistance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they laboriously gather store of honey they shut up the Cells still as they fill them, and untill Winter come, will not open them, but live in the mean time of Bee-bread, and such provision, as they get abroad, lest if they should prodigally waste while they may work, they might after starve when they cannot work. And in the pleasures of this life they are so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, that perfect temperance seems to rest onely in them.</p>
                     <p>They are neat and cleanly creatures, never suffering any filth or excrements long in the Hive, emptying themselves alwayes abroad. And if in the Winter while they are weak, and not able to indure the colder aire, filth bee contracted, yet as soon as the Spring comes, and they grow numerous, and strong, they diligently cleanse their Hives, and carry out all.</p>
                     <p>Their cleanliness also thus appears, That they will not suffer their dead to continue long in the Hive, but carry them forth to burial.</p>
                     <p>Their chastity is admirable, for whereas many other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures couple together openly; Waspes also and Humble bees, and many sorts of wilde Bees scarce specifically differing from them, yet whatsoever the Bees do in <hi>Venus</hi> service they act in secret, and far remote from the eyes and knowledge of all men.</p>

                     <p>In their own Commonwealth they are most just, not the least wrong or injury is offered among them: but I cannot commend their justice towards strangers, for all that they can catch is their own, unless they may bee excused in this respect, that the Bees of divers Hives are at deadly feud, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Kingdomes that are at difference one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>If Bees, creatures without reason, have such Prudence, Providence, Fortitude, Chastity, Loyalty, Natural affection, such Government, Order, Discipline; How much rather ought men to express the same in their carriages and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                     <p>Bees have all the five senses, though there do not appear all those outward Organs of senting, which some other Animals have: And so likewise Fishes have no visible Organ of hearing and smelling; and yet hear and smell, there is not seen perfectly in their heads a brain, yet is it the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fountain and feat of all these senses, phantasie, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                     <p>Of all the five senses their sight seems weakest, yet is it clear, especially afar off, which guides them abroad, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them home, though sometimes they are three or four miles from their Hives.</p>
                     <p>But their sight is not so quick near hand; for sometimes they will flye against you, if you come suddenly cross them when they are laden; and also near the mouth of the Hive, if<note place="margin">Mr. Butler Feminine Monarch.</note> they light besides the door, they will run up and down seeking for it, as if they were in the dark (hereby verifying this truth, That things nearest the eye are furthest from sight) but then up they rise, and flying back a little way, turn again with a better view.</p>
                     <p>As many as fall besides the stool when it waxeth dark, ten to one but they lye abroad allnight; yea if at such times being troubled by any thing, they come forth out of the Hive, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they bee fresh and lusty, they will leap up and down, run, and flye to and fro, untill they bee weary, but by no means can they finde the way in again.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is, that when they flye abroad they take much pains at the door in rubbing, and wiping their horney eyes, that they may better discern their way forth, and back again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99780:27"/>It is said by some of the Ancients, that Insects have onely the sense of feeling, which is manifestly untrue, for if they go forth right to a place they must needs see.</p>
                     <p>Their smelling is quick and excellent, for they will sent honey a mile from their Hives, and make haste to it, and when they flye aloft in the aire by it, sent any flowry Mead or Heath near them.</p>
                     <p>As soon as the hony-dew is fallen, they presently sent it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Oaks that receive it bee afar off; which the Poet (speaking of the excellency of this creature in this sense) thus expresseth,</p>

                     <p>Their feeling is as active as their other senses, nay more, for it is most individuate, it inheres in the subsistence of the creature,<note place="margin">Mr. Brathwayt Third Essay of Touching.</note> and cannot bee separated, or taken away without the detriment, or utter decay rather of the subject wherein it is. It may therefore bee called the living sense, although in divers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases and occurrences also oft-time befalling the subject wherein it is, it may be deprived of it.

                     <p>Their feeling is so quick, that if you do touch a Hive very softly, or knock upon the ground near the stool, they presently resent it, making a general murmure, and many of them coming out of the Hive door, as it were to examine the cause.</p>
                     <p>And for their taste, this is evidently as active as their other senses; thereby they make choice of waters, and all other gatherings for their use and purpose.</p>

                     <p>But in a word, further to manifest that they hear: If a swarm rise, and the Queen Bee miscarry, and fall by the way (as it oft happens) her company notwithstanding will light, expecting her coming. But being hived, they presently miss her; and with a mournful murmure bewail their condition. Some run up and down distractedly within the Hive, others without; and by and by making a sudden stop, fall into a passion of mourning, and then run up and down again, and then mourn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but in the mean time they send many to seek for her. I have often found her where shee hath been fallen, and taking her up, carried her to the Hive, where I have observed (not without admiration) how that at her first coming they have in a moment changed their former note and carriage, and with clapping of their wings, and a rejoycing murmure congratulated her presence; and those that were seeking about for her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some rods distant from the Hive, in an instant, as it were, returned all home, and with a rejoycing gratulation welcomed<note place="margin">L.

And therefore they have hearing, which shews likewise, that though their spirits bee diffused, yet is there a seat of their senses in their head.</p>

                     <p>And herein Brutes differ from men, That a reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not onely remember that hee hath seen, or heard, but also differenceth the spaces of the present time, from the time past; but Brutes onely know thus much, that they have fallen (into a pit, or other dangerous place) at this present, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times formerly.</p>
                     <p>Again, a man observes that hee remembers, which irrational creatures do not. And among all living creatures they have the best memory, which have the most clear, pure, and perfect ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, of which sort are Bees and Pidgeons.</p>
                     <p>As some creatures besides sense, have memory, and natural prudence, so some go further, for they are disciplinable; but none have experience, or very little.</p>
                     <p>Now by sense wee are to understand that sensitive knowledge which is onely in the presence of the object, whether it bee by the internal senses, or by the outward common sense or phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie: For under the name of sense, the Philosopher compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends whatsoever is necessary to perceive or understand in the presence of the object, but there is necessary in all, somewhat of the phantasie or imagination, to understand even that which is without. And therefore it is common to all brutes, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, so also to have imagination; but memory addes an inward strength, and power of conserving the species and using them in the absence of the objects, that by this means any thing may remember those things which it takes in the sense, even then when they are not present, in regard of the externall senses.</p>
                     <p>This faculty, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> some creatures have, but not all, but yet hee declares not what creatures have, or what want it. They are commonly thought to have memory, which

may properly and perfectly bee moved from one place to a more remote, either by a progressive motion on the land, or flying through the aire, or swiming in the waters, for memory seems for this purpose to bee given to creatures, that they may bee removed to a distant place, either to avoid that which is nocive and prejudicial, or to finde that which is useful, which they have any wayes made trial of.</p>
                     <p>Further, some creatures, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with memory, have prudence, which (as wee said before) is not to bee understood properly, but metaphorically, for they use not discourse, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a habit, whereby they may judge of what they are to do; but oftentimes so act by a natural instinct, and so provide for the future, as if they had reason indeed, and therefore by a figure are called prudent.</p>
                     <p>And this prudence of Brutes is a special sagacity in some, which by the instinct of nature, are so ordered as that they seem to imitate the reason and prudence of men; but all brutes have not this prudence, but those creatures that have it, are so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that they have all of them memory.</p>
                     <p>And wee may adde further, that this natural sagacity, then chiefly merits the name of prudence when it is trained up, and perfected by the memory of former things.</p>
                     <p>Some creatures have not onely memory, but are also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinable, but others are not: Of this last ranke are those, which though they have memory, want the sense of hearing, for hearing is the sense of discipline; for wee see many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, dogs, and horses, act by external signes, but never without a co-operation of hearing, whereby they are called and stirred up to understand the signes.<note place="margin">Arist.

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Queen-Bee.</head>
                     <p>THe Queen-Bee is a faire and stately creature, longer by the half, and much bigger than a common Honey-Bee, yet not so big as a Drone, but somewhat longer. She differs from the Common-Bee both in shape and colour; her back is all over of a bright brown, her belly even from the top of her fangs, to the tip of her train, is clear, beautifull, and of a sad yellow, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what deeper than the richest gold: Her head is more round than the little Bees, by reason her fangs bee shorter, her tongue is not half so long as theirs; and thereby nature hath disabled her for working, for it is impossible for her short tongue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract much out of any flower, were shee never so industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                     <p>Her wings are of the same size with an ordinary Bees, and therefore in respect of her long body, they seem very short, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling rather a cloak than a gown, for they reach but to the middle of her train, or nether part. Shee hath streighter, and stronger legs and thighs than a Honey-Bee, which are of the colour of their belly, but her two hind-legs more yellow. Shee hath a lofty pace and countenance expressing Majesty: That shee hath a white spot in her fore-head glistering like a Diadem, I never saw, though it bee frequently reported: Nay I am sure of the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Her nether part is much longer than her upper part, and more sharp than any ordinary Bees, having in it four ringles or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99780:30"/>
partitions, and in each ringle a golden bar instead of those three whitish rings, which other Bees have at their three partitions. The spear or sting shee hath is but little, and not half so long as the other Bees, which like a Kings sword, is rather born for shew and authority, than any other use. I beleeve they cannot use their sting, for I have provoked and forced them to sting by hard holding of them, and putting their taile to my bare hand, but could never perceive them willing to put it forth. Nay when I have forced it out yet shee would not enter it in my hand.</p>
                     <p>In a word, the Queen Bee in her whole shape and colour, is a goodly and beautiful creature.</p>

                     <p>It is a Chymerical fable that some have asserted, that the Bees first build their Commanders houses in the most eminent part of the combes, more large and beautiful than their own, and of the purest wax, and then inclose it with a waxen wall from the rest.

                     <p>Ridiculous is the conceit of <hi>Didimus</hi> to pull off the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Queen Bees wings, that they may not flye away, for sometimes for recreation, and also for evacuation of their bodies, they use to go forth; and if their wings were cut would bee disabled to return.</p>
                     <p>I once had a good swarm likely to miscarry, the Queen Bees wings being accidentally torn, so that going out of the Hive, shee fell besides the stool, and could not get up again. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though once and again finding her before the Hive, I put her into it, yet afterwards shee went forth, and was lost. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Bees (in her loss) neglected their work, and began to pine away, untill I furnished them with a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</p>
                     <p>The Queen Bee never voluntarily deserts her subjects, as <hi>Aelian</hi> and others intimate, affirming that the Bees diligently<note place="margin">Aelian. lib. 5. cap. 12.</note> seek her out, and return her when shee hath fled away.</p>

                     <p>Many are confident that the Queen Bee never goeth off the hive, but with a swarm. <hi>Cantipratanus</hi> asserts this, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting himself in the twentieth Chapter, hee saith, If her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bee weary with working, and cannot, or wander, and know not the way home again; the Queen Bee goes forth and findes them by their smell, and relieves them, and conducts them to the hive; but this is more fabulous than the former.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99780:31"/>It is more than probable, that the old Queen Bees, go forth sometimes with the latter swarm (whether out of curiosity, or wantonness, or indulgency, or dislike of her proper house, or love to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er ancient subjects, I determine not) and this is the cause of the not thriving of many old stocks, after they have cast a second swarm; for although the Bees that are left, bee in a well replenished Hive, and therefore live out the Summer well, and work too, though not with that order and diligence as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, yet will they rarely breed, but by degrees consume away, and come to nothing. I have exactly viewed divers such stocks that I have taken, and could never finde a Queen Bee among them.</p>
                     <p>If therefore you perceive a hive, after it hath cast twice, to have some quantity of Bees, and yet to work negligently, or not to increase in the Spring, suspect them to want a Queen, and supply them with one as soon as you can, if no other way, by driving a poor swarm into them, for which purpose alwayes reserve some.</p>
                     <p>It hath been a constant tradition, that the Queen Bee hath a special guard alwayes waiting on her, and that when shee goeth forth, she is alwayes attended with them. I have often seen her to go forth, but alwayes without attendance. It may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly fall out that some Bees may go abroad with her, and some others return when she comes back to the hive, but never as her special guard.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> saith, If the Queen Bee by her voyce bids them go, they swarm; this is warily to bee understood, namely of the latter swarm only; for the first is for ought I could ever finde out, at the will of the Commons; but there may bee a tacite consent of the Queen, but not solemnly by voyce, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their departure as in after swarms.</p>
                     <p>And again this is not alwayes true in second swarms, for after the Queen hath approved of their going forth, yet they will sometimes refuse, and manifest their dislike by massacring all the Infants of the Royal family.</p>
                     <p>I have observed some few Bees in the Spring in every good Hive, with crests, tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:99780:32"/>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> supposeth them subordinate governours and leaders, as Captains and Colonels: They are seldome seen but in May, and a little after; that they have any authority, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the rest, or special place about the Queen Bee, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not. This I am sure, I never saw any one of them attend her in her short progresses. Their working, I conceive wears oft this ornament.</p>
                     <p>The Queen Bee goes first out with the swarm, say some:<note place="margin">T. Cantiprat. bonum univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale de apibus, lib. 1. cap. 14.</note> but it is not so, for she goeth almost last, sometimes indeed shee comes forth half an hour before the swarm riseth, with a great company which environ, and attend her on the stool; but her company moves not untill the greater part are passed out of the hive, and then those that environed her begin to arise, and shee with them.</p>
                     <p>And as in the emission of a Colony, the Queen Bees go not<note place="margin">Aelian lib 5. c. 11.</note> before, neither are they carried at any time as some report.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes as I said, shee comes forth before, and stayes without; at other times shee comes first to the bottome of the stool, and perhaps out of the door, as it were chiding their slackness; but then when the swarm begins to arise, shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in untill the greater part bee come forth, when shee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and where they usually light, joynes her self to them.</p>
                     <p>Bees are governed by a Queen, which many hold not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to come to the supremacy by succession, but by a judil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and prudent election, whereas it is most apparent, that the elder of the Blood-royal goes forth with the first swarm, and so the next in order with a second, although sometimes especially in castlings, or second swarms; some others venture forth. I have known eight go forth in one swarm, for they can but dye, going forth, and death is certain and inevitable if they stay. And a younger by dividing the swarm, or first getting the highest place of the Hive, may bee peaceably obeyed, with the destruction of all the rest.</p>
                     <p>Nay being necessitated, their own leader miscarrying in swarming, or by some accident afterwards. I have preserved the stock by putting to them a Queen Bee taken from another. And once, because I would bee sure, I pared off a little of one wing, and some months after, for experience sake, took the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99780:32"/>
Hive, where I found that Commander put in by mee, and no other Leader. So that though ordinarily the Queen Bee comes to her government by birth-right and seniority, yet sometimes by election, as in the miscarriages of their old Queen, and in second swarms when two are united together.</p>
                     <p>When several Leaders go forth, one whose party prevails gets the Throne, and all the other competitors are slain. When their proper leader by some mis-hap hath been lost, I have given them another (as I said before) with whom they have well agreed, and prospered, so also in the union of swarms.</p>
                     <p>And although they are willingly subject to a leader, yet do they not altogether lose their liberty; for the first swarm goes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes forth at the will of the commons; and although the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and also the third, must have the Regal assent which usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (being indulgent to their issue) upon petition they grant; yet if the Commons see it not convenient to diminish their numbers, upon the Queens grant, they kill the Probationer, and all of the Blood-royal; so that Prerogative avails little in the Commonwealth of Bees.</p>
                     <p>The Queen Bee (for it is an Amazonian Commonwealth) transcends in greatness and beauty of body; but which is most praise-worthy in a Commander, in mildness and gentleness, therefore though they have stings they never use them, which the breeding or mother Wasp doth, stinging more venomously than the smaller.</p>
                     <p>The Laws whereby this Commonwealth is ordered, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, not written in letters but engraven in their manners; and so studious are they of peace, that neither willingly, nor unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly do they offer injury to any of their subjects.</p>

                     <p>THe Drone is a great Bee without a sting, the Vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that hee is made of a Honey Bee that hath lost her sting; but no man ever saw that a Bee became a Drone.</p>
                     <p>Others seeing the fondness of this opinion, have thought<note place="margin">J. Stobaeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, That they onely are bred of the Bees, but the truth is, they are of the same species with the Honey Bee, but of a different sex.</p>
                     <p>Many reasons are laid down by Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> to prove the<note place="margin">Mr. Butler Feminine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. c. 4.</note> Drone to bee the male.</p>
                     <p>First, because though they bee great Masters of the Honey, yet untill the Bees begin to leave breeding, and have conceived for the next year (which some do in <hi>Iuly,</hi> most before <hi>August</hi> is expired) they suffer them, afterwards they begin to beat them away, which if some stalls do not, they dye naturally before <hi>October;</hi> and from thenceforth all the Winter untill the Bees breed again, there is not a Drone to bee found in <hi>rerum natura:</hi> When they are quite gone, then do the Bees lay no more seeds that year, but onely hatch and breed up those that are in the cells.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because as the rather, and the more the Drones are, the greater and the earlier are the swarms: So where the Drones are few and late, there is small increase. And therefore if you kill the Drones of a Hive before they have done swarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and breeding (as some sondly have done before Midsum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to save their honey) neither will the swarms come forth that were formerly bred, nor the stock thenceforth breed any more. After which time bringing in Bee-bread as much as before, and having no young ones to spend part, they lay it up care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly in their cells, where it corrupteth and tuineth to stinking,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99780:34"/>
stopping, which will cause them so much to mistike their Hive, that in Autumn they will yeeld to the robbers. And if by your care and watchfulness they bee then preserved, in <hi>February</hi> following, when the breeding time begins, finding their wombs barren, and therefore loathing themselves, they yeeld their goods to them that will take it, and after a while by conversing with the strange Bees, like of their company, and go away with them to their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>one<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. But every fair day they will with them return to fetch that they left behinde.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, because every living thing doth breed male and female of his kinde, and experience doth teach us, that the Bees do yearly breed as well Drones as honey Bees; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the honey Bees are females, it followeth necessarily, that the Drones are the males of the same kinde: And therefore the Drone in the learned languages hath his masculine appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the honey Bee her feminine.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, wee see the like in the likest Insects, the Wasps, Hornets, and Humble-Bees, of which in their proper places.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, I adde the Drones are males, and the honey Bees females, because of the smalness of their voyce, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes<note place="margin">Arist. de hist. Anim. lib. 4. cap. 11.</note> smaller, and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iller in females than males, except Cows which bellow lowder than Bulls.</p>
                     <p>When the old Bees have ended their first brood of females, then last of all after the same manner, first in the Drone combe, which is one, and but one in every Hive, and almost the backwardest, made with deeper and wider cells for the nonce,<note place="margin">Plin. Nat hist. l. 11. cap. 11.</note> they breed the male Bees, or Drones, as was long since ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
                     <p>In the latter part of the year they breed some promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with the Nymphs, but then they elevate their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                     <p>That not many are bred before Mid-May, not any before Mid-April (except a few by chance which are not suffered to live) as Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> asserts, is not so; for there are some in all swarms, and some stocks (with us) swarm by Mid-April, therefore must the breeding of many of the Drones bee then finished.</p>
                     <p>And after a Hive hath swarmed, though before you saw not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99780:34"/>
one stir, yet then shall you take notice of their flying abroad every day about noon. But when the Hives are full, and yet swarm not so early as their fellows, they will then (but not often untill Mid-May) flye forth, and play a while, and then return into the Hive to fill their bellies.</p>
                     <p>But to put all out of doubt, that the Drones are males, I adde that the Drone in diffection hath two large testicles, greater, proportionably to his body than any other creature.</p>
                     <p>They are joyned together upward, but hang down towards the tail in two visible parts, of a whitish watry colour towards the ends, their ends or points are of the bigness of a small pins head, milk-white; the testicles are half as long as the nether part of the Drones body.</p>
                     <p>In the belly is a white entral longer when it is extended then the whole body. They have lungs (if my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The outward part of the back and breast is of a grisly substance, under which is a kinde of flesh, all of a reddish colour, where is the heart, and other necessary parts, although (without a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying glass, by an expert Anatomist) not exactly to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</p>

as in Horses and Mares; but some differ in magnitude, and that diversly, for in most the male is the greater; the chief cause is, for that the males have more strength of heat than the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; now heat causeth greatness of growth generally, where there is moisture enough to work upon: But if there bee found in any creature (which is rarely seen) an over great heat in proportion to the moisture in them, the female is the greater, as in Hawk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> delivers that the Drones are bred by themselves if the Commander lives, but if shee dyes, they are produced in the Bees cells by the Bees, and these so bred, are more hardy and couragious than the other; but the truth is (as I hinted before) all Drones are bred by the Bees, when they are wearied, and almost spent with breeding of females, that by them they may have a new prolifical power whereby they may breed females afresh; but the Drones are first bred in the Drone combe, which is afterwards at least a great part of it fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with honey; and then in the latter part of the Summer, they breed some Cephens among the Nymphs.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Aristotle</hi> could not determine about the breeding of the<note place="margin">Arist. de hist.

Nay they begin the Drone comb and half finish it, before they make the Nurseries (for so I rather call them, than with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> houses or pallaces) for their Queen, of which there bee alwayes some in every hive. And therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> was deceived, who saith, They made the Queens Pallaces or Nurseries onely, <hi>Cum faetus la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aelian</hi> tells a long story, how that the Drones lye hid among the combs in the day, but in the night when the Bees are asleep, rob and purloyn the honey, which when the Bees understand (for most of them sleep being weary with working, and a few onely watch) they first correct them gently, and drag them out of the Hives by the wings.

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Generation of Bees.</head>
                     <p>IT hath been an ancient tradition, that Bees have a twofold production, as many other creatures, by generation and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresaction. About this latter way, <hi>Virgil, Cardan. Aldrovandus,</hi> and many others have been copious; but whether there bee any solidity in this particular, I am somewhat dubious, because it was never authentically proved to bee performed by any. But they tell us that the best sort is procreated of a corrupted Lion; And therefore say it is no wonder, that being so small crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they fear not any, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A second sort is bred of a Bull, and therefore they are called the daughters of Bulls, because they are bred of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses.<note place="margin">Suidae Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r ca.</note>

                     <p>A fourth sort of a Calf, but tell us not wherein these kindes differ, for they forgot waking what they dreamed of sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Would I spend words to no purpose, I might easily for the general, evince the invalidity of this opinion, for in <hi>Brasile, Peru,</hi> and most of the new world where are many sorts of Bees, and some in colour and magnitude not differing from ours, there were no such creatures, whereof (if they were lost) they might bee again recovered, before they were transported by the Spaniards.</p>
                     <p>But more absurd is that opinion of others, that of the ashes of Bees bedewed with sweet wine, and exposed to the Sun in<note place="margin">Muffer Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Insector</note> a warm place, there will bee a present resurrection of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer burnt Bees.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Scaliger</hi> questioning whether Bees did copulate or not, saith that of the dew in leaves of plants, worms are produced, and therefore dew opportunely gathered, and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Scaliger,</hi> though hee propounded the former opinion, yet held not to it; for whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi> delivers it as an opinion of some that the Bees bred by copulation, and that the Drones were males, and the honey Bees females; this saith hee is false<note place="margin">Scalig Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Arist. de hist.

                     <p>Another saith, the matter in which they blow or breed, is<note place="margin">Mr Remnant hist. of Bees.</note> something that they gather of the flowers or plants, and bring home, and put into the holes, or cells of the combes, which they mix finely with a little water, and then blow in it a thing less then, or as little as a flye-blote. But this cannot bee, for wee finde nothing in the cells wherein the seed is injected, but the seed it self. And again, the Bees seed is much bigger than a flye-blote.</p>
                     <p>And as to others, so to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the generation of Bees<note place="margin">Arist de gene. lib. 3 cap 10.</note> seemed very ambiguous and doubtful; for whereas among fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>es some generate without copulation, he sometimes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the same of Bees, and argues thus: They must either fetch their young else-where, as some in his age opinionated, which young must be either bred of themselves, or be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by some other living creature, or they must generate them, or partly fetch them, and partly generate them: For so some supposed that they fetched onely the Drones, or else they must generate them by copulation, or without copulation. Thus Bees by copulation among themselves to breed Bees, Drones to breed Drones, and the Queens to breed Queens. Of all the rest from one kinde, either from the Queens, the Drones, or the Bees; for some, he confesseth in his time, held that the Drones were males, and the Bees females: Others held a contrary opinion, that the Bees were males, and the Drones were females.</p>
                     <p>But against all these tenets, <hi>Aristotles</hi> reasons as impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. If, saith he, they breed not, but fetch their young else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, of necessity it must bee, that there be Bees without any labour of Bees, namely in that place from whence they fetch their seed; for why do they come to perfection, being carried away, and not in their own proper places.</p>
                     <p>And again he saith, It agrees not with reason that the Bees are females, and the Drones males, because nature never gives females weapons to defend themselves withall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:99780:38"/>Now the Drones are weaponless being without stings. And on the contrary, it is not reasonable to imagine that the Bees are males, and the Drones females; for no males are diligent and laborious in educating of their young Cock-pidgeons, and most males among birds, sits part of the day, as well as the female, and as diligently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And that some Bees should be males, some females, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether likewise improbable, for in all creatures the male differs from the female, externally many fowls differ not, as Crows, Rooks, and many small birds.</p>
                     <p>And that by generation they should procreate, is as unlikely, because no man ever saw it.</p>
                     <p>At last he determines that the Bees are females, but as plants have both sexes, because the sex is not to be distinguished. But if the Drones are bred without copulation, then also keeping the same order, the Bees, and their Commanders, are bred without copulation.</p>
                     <p>He concludes after a long uncertain discussion of this doubt, That the Kings or Queens Bees breed themselves, and the Bees. It is necessary also that the Commanders be procreated by some, but neither of the Bees, nor of the Drones, therefore of themselves.</p>
                     <p>Now the Commanders cels being last made, and but few in number, they breed therefore their own kinde (few according to the cels) and also the <hi>Bees.</hi> And the Bees breed the Drones, and they breed nothing; and so the Generation determines in the third number, <hi>Non tam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But the Philosopher enumerated too fast: Of Caterpillars it is true, and of all others that have proper, or natural cases, but such as have adventitious, as Bees, and Waspes, never harden.</p>

that is an egg out of the whole whereof, a living creature is<note place="margin">Aqua pend.</note> bred, as the eggs of Spiders, Ants, Flies.</p>
                     <p>Insects first breed a worm (although it be not yet a worm<note place="margin">Arist. de gen. lib. 2. c 1.</note> untill it be hatched, but indeed rather an egg) and this after a space of time is a kind of egg, for the Aurelia hath the faculty of an egg, and a living creature is bred of it, receiving in the third nutrition, the end of generation.</p>

                     <p>And after it is hatched, it lyes a while cross, or side-wayes, with the mouth somewhat erected, and grows so long as the matter of augmentation continues, which is not long, and then it falls to the bottome, and raiseth it self up that it may be fed. It will raise it self up, and sink as it were within it self by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction when it pleaseth; for though it have not feet, yet the skin is somewhat scabrous whereby it rouls, or moves it self higher, or lower within the cell.</p>
                     <p>The Bees in their breeding discend by degrees towards the nether part of the combs, filling one cell after another: But when their chief breeding is past, they do not precisely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this order, but lay up their food promiscuously among the young Bees, where they find the cells empty.</p>

How therefore they should receive it, was the great mystery. He supposeth the worms to stick fast on one side of the cell, and the hony on the other, that with bowing of their bodies, they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The worm, saith he, sticks so fast to the side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if she were glewed or rivited there, but by no means at the bottome, lest she should be drowned with the hony. And this supposition of the worm and the hony being together in the same cell, made him conceive the worm smaller than the Bee; for saith he of the seed is generated a worm, which worm is alwayes less than the Bee; but this is not so, for the grown worm is every way as great, and as large as the Bee.</p>
                     <p>But neither of the former opinions are true ordinarily, for the Bees are bred usually in the combs before, or in the lower part of the other combs, the hony (if there be any) being repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited in the backward combs, and the upper parts of the other. It is true indeed, that the Bee-bread is oft laid up in the void cells, among the breeding cells; not that the young may feed themselves, but that therewith being ready, and near at hand they may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As for the Grashoppers, they will flye nimbly with eighty, nay one hundred eggs in them as big as the eggs of Pismires, and the claw-tailed Humble-Bee (of which afterwards) works as diligently, and flyes as deliverily when she is great with young, as when she is barren.</p>

The male continued at his work next day, and at noon giving over, dyes; from that hour untill evening the female laid many eggs which were hatched in twenty hours, and presently went their way; so that some Insects speedily hatch, and perfect their eggs.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he concludes Bees may copulate in a few hours, and presently lay their eggs.</p>
                     <p>Likewise he relates, that when he was a stripling, that he took of the greater sort of flies, one marked with white strakes, and holding it some while in the hollow of his hand, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the shape, it brought forth many white worms notable for their motion.

without all controversie flye about with their eggs in them. Now <hi>Scaliger</hi> at last discovered his little experience in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bees, when thinking to answer more fully; hee mars all: For whereas <hi>Cardan</hi> saith truly, they are in continual labour, hee denies it, and affirms, that the Bees having gotten honey by labour, they take the benefit of it without any more working: Whereas it is certain, that they never give over working (the season being fitting)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as long as there is any thing to gather, and they give over breeding, before they give over working.</p>
                     <p>The seed being hatched lives, and excerns excrements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All Insects first make a worm, except a certain sort of Butter-flye, which produceth a certain hard thing, like wilde-saffron seed, but fluid within.</p>
                     <p>Now the generation of Insects in these worms, is not caused in some part onely, as that some part of the egg, turns to the formation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the rest to the nourishment, but the whole alters untill it attain the just and due proportion.</p>
                     <p>Creatures which produce a worm first; bring forth a small<note place="margin">Arist. de gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. l. 3. c. 4.</note> one, which is increased by it self, without any addition, as meal by leaven is made of a little mass a greater.</p>
                     <p>And again, some creatures have this property in themselves, that<note place="margin">Idem de gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. l. 3. c 9.</note> they have an increase for themselves, as the worms of Bees, others gather it abroad, as the worms of Butterflies, called Caterpillars.</p>
                     <p>This is, if at all, but partly true; for after they are hatched, there is a small augmentation from the seminal vertue; but as soon as they are capable of food, they must have it, or else after three or four dayes they will dye, as I have often experimented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas when they have done feeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are shut up with their waxen covers, they will (though out of the Hive) live, and come to perfection, but will bee perhaps longer in their Metamorphosis, than if they were continued in it.

                     <p>Creatures shaped without the females womb have in the egge, as well matter of nourishment as matter of generation of the body, because after the egg is laid, and severed from the body (of the Hen, or other creature) it hath no more nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Hen, but onely a quickfling hear when shee sits, but as soon as the chicken i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> acknowledgeth that they void excrements, and can there bee excrements without a supply of food, or a mutipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a little seed above a hundred fold by the feminal vertue, or ambient aire, especially where the excrement are four times so much as the seed, or egge was at the beginning; yet <hi>Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandus</hi> concurs with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> saying, That the worms of Bees and Wasps have within them that which is the matter of their augmentation; the contrary whereof is evident, for if the Hives be not provided before hand, or supplied daily with food in stormy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unseasonable weather, the young brood will dye in the cells, and you may see the old ones carry them out in abundance upon the first change of the weather, and then breed again.</p>

But thus the worms in the combs cannot bee sed, the meat being remote from them.</p>
                     <p>The Bees vomit forth the honey which they have gathered<note place="margin">Idem exer. 6.</note>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:99780:42"/>
and digested in their bellies, and lay it up in their Hives, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same sort the Hornets, and the Wasps nourish their young. The assertion is not true, or very ambiguous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. If hee understands that the Hornets and Wasps empty into their cells what they collect, and gather, then is it not true, for they lay up nothing that ever I could finde. If it bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that they feed their young with what they gather, as also the Bees, with what they gather, and also with that which they have formerly injected into their combs, when the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not permit them to gather abroad, than it is a truth, but darkly, and imperfectly delivered.</p>
                     <p>So then wee see after that they are disclosed, they must have meat; out of their cells they cannot come, nor creep, they are not <hi>locomotive,</hi> like Caterpillers.</p>
                     <p>Now the main Query is, how they should have it? And the ignorance of this caused <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and others to deny, that they received any, so that from the history of their being a worm, to their metamorphosis into a Bee, wee hear of nothing.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this, I was long without satisfaction, and finding that it was impossible to observe the particulars among the Bees, because of their numbers and closeness, I sought to finde it out by observation in other Insects of somewhat differing, yet of a like nature, in many particulars. I considered that yearly in my empty Hives there Hornets, I took notice therefore daily of the progress and order of their work, and generation, which I found to bee thus:</p>
                     <p>The Hornets neast is begun by one mother, or breeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornet at the first, which in the top of an empty hive wrought a very short little drossie pendant peg or pin, about the bigness of the tag of a point of the outer dry parings of pales, or other old timber with a mixture of a gummy liquor that flows from oaks principally (of which matter are all her combs fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) this short peg shee made the foundation and center of a Canopy, or Tent like to a half globe, in the center of which with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ting out on each side downward, and having wrought them half their depth to an angle of every cell somewhat above the hono<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e, shee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth into each a several seed, and then on the out-side of those

cells begins six, or seven more, but all co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>entring in the same point with the former; and when they are wrought half their depth, shee injecteth into each a particular seed; but before this is done and finished, shee quickens and hatcheth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, encompassing with her body, or lying round like a ring about the pin that is the center of the globous depending Tent, or Canopy, but in the inside of it, that her heat may equally transmit it self to each cell, and enliven every seed.</p>
                     <p>Within a few dayes thus receive they life, and begin to stir, at first sticking at the taile end, and then falling to the bottome, do they raise themselves upward. Now the mother sometimes sits upon, or rather about them, and the latter brood also to hatch and comfort them, and sometimes goes abroad and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth food for them, and giveth it them as a bird her young, with her mouth going from one to another: And as they grow shee worketh the cells deeper, until they attain their perfect growth, which will bee above three weeks; and then the first brood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bee torpid and dull, and receive no more food, which when they refuse, shee worketh a cover over them, whiter than the combs, and they so continue shut up about three weeks, and being transchanged from a worm to a Horner, eat of the cover, and come forth, and work, and breed their kinde, but then being many, in broad combs.</p>
                     <p>And as they are fed, so also I am confident are the Bees, although they come to their perfection in a shorter space: For they also after they have fed about eighteen dayes, and attained their growth, are shut up by the Bees, with awaxen cover, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so about the like space wherein they are metamorphosed, and eating the cover before them, lift up the rest with their head, and come forth winged creatures.</p>
                     <p>Of this metamorphosis of Insects, <hi>Aristotle</hi> thus; Every<note place="margin">Arist. de gen.

same matter, afterwards are together nourished, augmented, and formed.</p>
                     <p>The frame of those begins from some one part as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and by the help thereof, the other members are added and joyned together; and these wee say are done by a Epige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis, or after addition of parts, namely, by degrees, part after part, and in respect of the other, properly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>After the first sort is the generation of Insects, where the worm by a metamorphosis is bred of an egge, of the beginnings are procreated of a corrupting matter (the moist drying, or the dry moistening) of which as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a Caterpillar grown to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect magnitude, by a metamorphosis a Butterflye appears in the just magnitude. Give mee leave to vary from so learned an Author, and diligent observer.</p>
                     <p>It is a truth that there is no metamorphised creature, and addition of a new matter or magnitude, yet in many there is a diminution for those that have not adventitious cases, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as Bees, Hornets, and Wasps, but natural hardened shells or covers, as Caterpillars, &amp;c. have so much (as the shells or covers) subtracted from the being and substance of the future Butterflyes.</p>
                     <p>And this also holds not that all the parts begin to appear, and are distinguished together for the change and metamorphosis of Insects is not altogether, but by degrees, part after part is changed, and altered, as wee will further make appear in the particulars.</p>
                     <p>The alteration of Insects in some is made of the whole, as Bees, they having no membranous skins or shells about them, but the cells of the combs, and not of any parts of it: But every such kinde of worm, when it hath accomplished his magnitude and greatness, is made as it were an egg, for the skin hardens, and all that time it is immovable from its place, yet moves in its skin, cell, or shell, as is visibly evident, for touch the out-side and they will contract, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>Now the cause hereof is, because nature hastens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and before it bee a perfect egg; brings forth so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the worm by degrees, grows to the bigness of a soft egg, and after in season<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eats through the cover or shell (for they are not reposited in cells

as Bees) and comes forth as a chicken out of an egg being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected<note place="margin">Arist de gen. lib. 3. cap 9.</note> in the third generation.

The first alteration in shape is the division in the middle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then the other division between the head and shoulders, Thus Mr. <hi>Butler.</hi> But it is otherwise, for the transmutation as in a Wasp, begins to be first visible in the superiour part, and the eyes are first discerned, and then the incision between the head and the shoulders, which yet as it grows more perfect, becomes smaller, the middle incision or division is scarcely visible, when the eyes may bee seen, then the legs, and the horns begin to bee framed, and the wings are last finished.</p>
                     <p>When they are perfect they thrust up the covers over their heads, which hang at their backs till they come forth, their fangs and tongue hang down on their breast, but when they are come forth, they then contract them (untill they have occasion of their use) and draw them up close bending under their throats, that they are scarcely visible, but when they eat or work; their colour is at the first ash colour, and so are their wings, but in a little space they convert to a dark brown untill they grow old, when they become gray.</p>
                     <p>And thus it is in many other creatures. Fishes procreated of<note place="margin">Arist. de hist. l. 6. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But hee was deceived, for in the metamorphosis of flying Insects, the alteration begins at the head, and is first visible in the eyes.</p>
                     <p>As in dry weather Bees gather most honey, suppose it with moderation, for immoderate drought (as in the year 1652.) withers away the flowers; so moist weather produceth store of Bees, suppose it still with moderation, for otherwise (as in the year 1648.) the perpetual raines washed away all the substance of the flowers, that not onely the swarms, but old stocks gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dyed.

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99780:44"/>Now the reason why moist weather produceth store of Bees, is because the Bees do spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Too much fair weather is destructive to the increase of Bees, for going forth every day to gather, they are there with wearied, and neglect breeding, and so though they leave fat stalls, yet in a short time few Hives, and therefore <hi>Columella</hi> adviseth to<note place="margin">Colum. lib. 9.</note> stop them in, every third day, that they may attend to breeding.</p>
                     <p>The Bees breed best, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when they gather<note place="margin">Aristor. de hist.

                     <p>Each Country almost hath his several fashion, as well for the matter whereof they are made, as also for the manner and form of their making. In our Country, the Hives principally in use, are either made of wickers, or of straw.</p>
                     <p>The wicker Hives, if they bee not often repaired, will bee at a fault, and lye open unto Wasps, Robbers, Mise; any of these if shee findes but a crack, or crany, will dig her way in. And the Mouse, unless the twigs bee close wrought, although shee finde none.</p>
                     <p>The straw Hives when they are old and loaded, do usually sinke on the one side (especially if they take wet) and so break the combs, and let out the hony. Yet I have divers which have been continually used above twenty years together, and never lost spoonful of honey out of them. Hives made of the fashion of a Bell, which they use in <hi>Northfolke,</hi> are not so subject to sinking, but being generally large, they are not fit for single castlings; and besides they are colder than the globous Hives.</p>
                     <p>All things considered, the straw Hives are the best; and the Bees do best defend themselves from cold when they hang round together in manner of a Sphear or Globe, and therefore the nearer the Hives come to the fashion thereof, the warmer and safer they bee; but of necessity the bottome must bee broad, for the upright and sure standing of the Hive, and for the better taking out of the combs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the top must rise three or four inches higher than the just form of a globe, whether they bee covered with hackles or not, because they delight to hang in a cone, and work from a point; but chiefly to prevent sinking when they are full of honey, or young Bees, to which the broad crowned Hives are generally subject.</p>
                     <p>So then that Hive hath the best shape that is likest to an egg, with one end cut off, as wee usually order it when wee eat it. It may consist of twelve strawn wreaths or rowls,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99780:45"/>
or more, according to the bigness of the Hive.</p>
                     <p>Let the three first rowls bee of one magnitude, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and about a foot or somewhat more in the Diameter, the four next above them more large, bellying out a little each be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his fellow that the combes may bee more firmly fastened: Let the other five by little and little bee narrowed to the center at the top that it may bee pyramidal.</p>
                     <p>And after this proportion, if the Hive consists of more wreaths or rowls, for this is the shape of a small Hive. I have some consisting of seventeen or eighteen wreaths.</p>
                     <p>Hives are to bee made of any size between a bushel and half a bushel, saith Mr. <hi>Butler.</hi> I have many Hives containing five pecks which swarm yearly, and last (by succession) longer than those that are hived in small Hives: And although a half bushel Hive will contain a competent stock, yet the swarms for the most part are small, and the castlings of themselves worth nothing; and the Bees that are ordinarily left when they have cast twice are so few, that they quickly miscarry.</p>
                     <p>However let your Hives bee rather too little, than too great, for such are hurtful to the increase and prosperity of Bees. If the Hives bee too great, the Bees will bee more lazy, working un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably, because they despair ever to finish and furnish their house; but yet if there bee a competent number of Bees, they will work industriously (though the vacuity bee large) and compleat as much with combes as shall bee sufficient for them. But an over large Hive is prejudicial to their swarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>When you have provided your Hive, clip off, and cut away all the staring straws in the inside, and make it as smooth as you can. The best and readiest way to perform it, is this: First wet the skirts of you Hive, then hold it a turn or two over a blaze of straw, and then take it off, do it a second time, and if need bee a third; and after rub it with a peece of a rubbing stone, such as Mowers use to whet their sithes withall. And so shall you much ease the Bees, they will do it themselves in time, but not without much pains and labour, which might bee more profitably imployed. Howsoever when you have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>And if it bee an old Hive, though it were musty, yet hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over a fire several times, will sweeten it. And the Bees will better like in such a Hive so ordered, than in a new one, not purged with the fire.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Southern,</hi> and others after him advise, that if Bees finde<note place="margin">Mr. Southern.</note> fault with a Hive, and will not continue in it, to pull out the spleats, and put into it a little quantity of Barly, Pease, or Moult, and let a Hog, eat it out of the Hive, turning the Hive with your hand as hee eats, that the slaver or froth hee makes may remain in the Hive, and then wipe it lightly with a cloath, and having put in your spleats again, hive your Bees in it, and they will undoubtedly tarry. I never had occasion to experiment it, because that I never had swarm that I could not make to ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty in one Hive, or other.</p>
                     <p>Many rub their Hives before they use them with fennel, or other sweet herbs, and sprinkle them also with Honey and Beer mingled together, Sweet-wort, Milk, or some other sweet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, but I seldome use it, but onely as I said before, purifie and sweeten them with fire; and perhaps set them, before they bee used, open in the aire a few dayes out of the danger of rain.</p>
                     <p>I have scarce (in forty swarms, and more that I have had in a year) hived one twice, or had any return after that they have been hived, except when the Queen Bee hath been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Having prepared and dressed your Hives, the next thing that you are to do is to stick them. And various are the fashions that are observed, some doing it one way, some another, Mr.<note place="margin">Mr. Levit or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Bees.</note> 
                        <hi>Levit</hi> prescribes this course. Take a stick of Sallow, or Hasel, about the bigness of a mans thumb, let it bee a foot long, or somewhat more, then cleave it cross-wise from one end till you come within a handfull of the other end, and no further, then bend each quarter a several way, cutting off the sharp edges in the midst of every one of them, then may you put the end that is not cleft into the crown of the Hive, and bending every of them a several way, stick them into the side of the Hive, that they may force the upper uncleft end hard to the crown of the Hive; but if the Hive have a little hole in the crown (as many
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99780:46"/>
straw Hives have) then cut the upper end of your said crown tree where it is not cleft small enough to go through a little way, leaving a shoulder on the inside to stay it: And this is to keep the crown of the Hive from sagging down-wards as they wil do (except your Hives bee exceeding good) when they are heavy laden with hony.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Take a small stick and cleave it clean through in the midst, cutting both the parts flat and smooth, and put them cross-wise into the Hive within four fingers of the board they shall stand upon.</p>
                     <p>But this inconvenience I finde in this manner of sticking, that they cannot bee taken out, but altogether, and therefore the combes will bee much broken, and the honey run out when you take a Hive.</p>
                     <p>This course I observe; I take a willow stick, about nine, or ten inches long, and (according to the greatness) cleave it into several thin peeces, each spleat I shave till it will bow, then sharpning both the ends; I stick three such spleats in the center of the crown of the Hive, and bow the three other ends to the sides of the Hive (that they stand like so many bows) and there enter them in a triangle. And then after put a strong spleat quite through the middle of the Hive within four inches of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. If it bee a large Hive, I put another cross that (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise not) about an inch lower.</p>
                     <p>That the Hives should have holes quite through them to prevent Spiders webs, or by the wind passing through to blow away any offensive matter, is an idle fancy, yet prescribed by<note place="margin">Florentinus.</note>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99780:47"/>
hurts them nothing, and the greatest frost in Winter (supposing them covered above, and also well stopt below) damnifies them nothing. Nay, I have found experimentally that in a row of Hives standing on the North side of a long Barn, whose height hath intercepted the Suns beams all the Winter, less provision (almost by half) hath served those Hives than would have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved others standing alwayes open to the Sun, for coming seldome forth they did eat little, and yet in the Spring were as forward to work, and to swarm, as those that had twice as much hony (otherwise alike) in the Autumn before.</p>
                     <p>Some Bees will bee late at their work after Sun-set, and if when they return they finde it dark about the hive, they must lye abroad, if not altogether perish. Let the door therefore bee somewhat to the West.</p>
                     <p>Let your Bee-garden bee well fenced from Cattel, and as well as may bee defended from winds, especially let them be secured from the West and South-west winds, which are with us most constant in the Summer. The time of Bees labouring, <hi>Virgil</hi> thus prescribes,</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> would have them defended from the rising Sun, because it invites them to work when the aire is chilly and cold. Suppose there were such an inconvenience, which yet I never found, yet where there were many hives, a fense on the East side could not defend many if any at all. And if they stand on benches with backs or walls behinde them, and a Penthouse over them, they will bee at work in a fair day two or three hours before the Sun can shine upon them.</p>
                     <p>And for swarms, it is best to uncover them on the first shining of the Sun upon them the day after they are set up (till they know their station) that they may bee allured forth by the heat thereof, yet when the Sun shines hot at noon, let them bee sleightly covered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Columella</hi> prescribes that the hives stand with their mouths somewhat to the East, that the Sun may shine on them in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99780:47"/>
morning, and make them more early to follow their work; but upon experience, I commend the setting of them somewhat to the West, that (being late often at their work) they may have more light (their eyes being weak) to enter their Hives, and also that they be not prejudiced with the Easterly winds, which are cold and hurtful.</p>
                     <p>Let their entrance be low (because of the Mouse) but lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Summer, and shorter in Winter, but in Autumn shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of all, not having passage for above a Bee or two at once, to prevent the danger of robbing both by Bees and Waspes.</p>
                     <p>Some prefer single stooles as not subject to diverse inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, which Bees standing on benches (as they imagine) are liable to, they are kept saith Mr. <hi>Levit</hi> by Penthouses from the raine, but neither from the heat of Summer, nor cold of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they stand naked, the heat or cold easily takes hold of them, especially any great and long frost.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the Wind many times makes a great noyse in the hollowness of those kind of houses, which sore annoyeth the Bees; Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> saith, that many stalles upon a bench in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may cause the Bees to fight, as having easie access on foot to each other.</p>
                     <p>And againe, standing so near, they some time mistake the next Hive for their owne; and againe, in Winter the benches will bee alwayes wet, which looseth the cloome, rotteth the bottom of the Hive, and offendeth the Bees; and lastly, the Mouse at all times hath free passage from one to another without fear.</p>
                     <p>I have tried both wayes, and found none of these evils that are objected, in setting Bees under a penthouse, and whereas in the first place it is urged, That they are always subject to Heats, and Colds; I answer, that if any are much offended with either of these extreams, they are the Hives that stand on single stools where the Sun penetrates, sometimes through the hackle and the cold winds every way pierce them; and in the Spring, when they begin to work, will blow many of the Bees from their Hives when they would enter in.</p>
                     <p>And for the noyse that is occasioned by the Winds to Hives under a penthouse, it is less loud and violent than where it hath an open passage on all quarters; but they are more apt to fight on benches than on single stooles. In many years observation,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99780:48"/>
having more Hives upon benches than ever I knew any to have on single stooles, I never had any robbed by his next neighbour, but most commonly (if at all) by some of another Bee-fold; and whereas it is objected, that in Winter the benches will bee always wet, I answer, that this objection is altogether frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, nay false, for the same cause shall wet the single stooles that will wet the benches under covers; nay, they are much more subject to it, for only a driving raine from the South can wet a little at most before the entrance, which the Sun or Wind wil quickly dry, when as they are liable to wet on every side; and for the Mouse, she will more securely visit them where she may unseen (getting under the hackle) eate her way into the Hive,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> new Orchard.</note> Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi> therefore commends a penthouse.</p>
                     <p>But if any delight in single stooles, let them be of wood ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of stone, for they are too hot in Summer, and which is worse, too cold in Winter; be careful that they be well cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with hackles, which you must often take off, both to dry the Hives in a Sunny day, and also for fear of Mise and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                     <p>And whereas it is objected, that Bees standing on benches are apt to mistake their Hives, especially the young ones; and if a Swarme return home they will settle upon the next Hives, to their owne and others ruine, and thereby occasion a great loss of Bees; to prevent this, let them stand half a foot at the least between Hive and Hive (it were best a foot) and these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages would be avoyded, and to secure you from Mise, keep a Trap constantly on every Bee board.</p>
                     <p>Take notice of some advantages that this way you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, which you cannot so well when they stand on single stools; oftentimes a poor Hive standing by a full neighbour, if they lye ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But besides (which is more considerable) you may have much pure Honey without any trouble, or loss; about midde
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99780:48"/>
                        <hi>April</hi> in a warme Spring, observe what Hives are full, and begin to lye out, and set a Hive with the Combes that the Bees dyed out of the Winter immediatly before, next to such a full Hive, and you shall have them work into it presently, and carry in abundance of Honey; of necessity many of them must have been idle in their owne Hive, there being no roome for half to work; they take this as a retiring house which they will work in, and stay in too, night and day, only keeping an intercourse with their owne, which will swarme never the later, and as soon as by the emission of a Colony there is roome made in their own Hive, they will goe againe to their Leader and leave their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision; if some few stay when you take it, knock them out, and they will returne to their old habitation; I had this last year, one thousand six hundred fifty six, in four such By-hives thus gathered, in eight dayes before the end of <hi>April</hi> neere four gallons of Honey, and the Hives also swarmed in <hi>April<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> this Honey was pure Virgin Honey, as white almost as milk.</p>
                     <p>But if they stand a week in <hi>May</hi> and swarme not, then take the retiring Hive and carry it some distance from the stoole, and knock it on the crown and sides, and they will all goe out to their owne Hive. But if you dare not venter on this course<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then drive them into an empty Hive, and the day following knock them out neer their owne Stock, and they will quickly return into it. By this, conjecture how much honey Bees gather in the Spring, but of this more afterwards, so that it is neither for want of roome, or stooles, or wit (as some imagine) to set Hives on benches under a penthouse.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> designes to set sixty three Hives of Bees in a plot of ground of fifty foot square (if any, saith he, be so happy to attaine this number, which I have much exceeded) but I would rather advise to set your Hives if you have many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at a larger di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if you have roome, whether upon single stooles, or upon benches, namely, not above sixteen, or at most twenty in a row (still take notice to set them from East to West) and three or four rodds to the Southward, another row, and so according to your numbers, or at double that distance if you have roome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for it cannot otherwise but often fall out, that you shall have many swarmes rise together, or before you shall have Hived the first, especially in a plentiful year, to your no little disturbance,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99780:49"/>
and prejudice: Whereas standing at that distance, you shall more frequently prevent it; and the more, if you have a row of trees planted thick to the Southwards of every row of hives, some two or three rods distant, where they will readily light and seek no further.</p>
                     <p>Another inconvenience of many hives standing upon single stools one before another is, that sometimes the swarms will settle on the hackles of the hives before them, and if you bee not present, and speedily hive them, hazzard the loss of the swarm, and perhaps the stock too, as I have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                     <p>Let the ground before your stools or benches, for a rod or two at least, bee kept short with often mowing, for long grass and weeds, much more Beans and Pease are prejudicial: for the young weak Nymphs falling on those shady places (except the weather bee warm and dry) are in danger to bee chilled, before they can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Let it not bee a bare ground, for in Winter it will bee wet, and chill the Bees when they light on it, and in the Summer dusty, and falling on it if they rise not presently, but go a little, their feet being dew-clawed, and scabrous, will quickly sur, and they will bee so clogged, that they will not bee able to rise at all.</p>
                     <p>Let them not stand above a foot, or a foot and a half from the ground at the most, for if they stand higher (as most set them) they are more subject to the violence of the winds, for though they do well enough abroad in windy weather, yet when they return home, especially in the Spring, they will bee beaten down besides the hive (and the more if they stand upon stools than on benches) and if there bee a present shoure (the weather then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That they infect one another with their smell if they stand too hear together (as Mr. <hi>Levit</hi> surmifeth) I never found, nor do I beleeve. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

sides, or if there bee none, fixe towards the crown of the hive in several places, little fragments of waxe, and hold the hive a little over a blaze of straw that the waxe may melt and diffuse about the sides of the hive, and such a hive will they more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly work in than any other, presently to that foundation of wax, fastening wax new gathered from the flowers (for in some Islands plentiful of Bees, there are no trees for some miles, as Fowlness, &amp;c.)</p>
                     <p>They fasten the first wax near to the center of the hive, if they bee many, but if there bee few Bees then near the side, they make their combs perpendicular, beginning at the top, and so working down to the bottome; the heat of the Bee (that I say not of their breath) maketh the wax warm and pliable, that at the first gathering they can work, and turn it to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                     <p>They will not onely work artificially the wax they gather into thin hexangles, but blow and soften, and work a solid peece of wax into a comb, as I have often experimented, putting a peece of wax under a hive almost combed to the board.</p>
                     <p>The order of their work is thus: They fasten their first wax to the hive, and adding more still, make first the middle between the cells, and having wrought a little of the thin bottome, than on either side begin to raise the hexangle cells, and so still des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to the bottome, as some are fully finished, others are but half way, others new begun.</p>
                     <p>Their combes are placed otherwise than the Wasps, for the Wasps hang theirs one under another, and the Bees theirs one besides another, beginning still at the top, and at that distance that a Bee may reach from one to another. And usually sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them to stand with the entrance into the hive South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they fasten and order them so, that in the breadth they are from East to West, thereby better securing themselves from cold.</p>

                     <p>Now to say something of their gathering of Hony, which they fetch in little or much nine moneths in the year; this is of two sorts, the one pure and liquid, called therefore by some <hi>Nectar,</hi> as the other which is gross and more solid <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> and both of them are the Bees food, but in several seasons.</p>
                     <p>The gross hony <hi>Sandaracha,</hi> or Bee-bread, is gathered by their tongues, with the assistance of their fangs, from whence it is conveyed by their fore-leggs to the thighs of their hind-leggs, and that so nimbly, that unless you have a quick eye you cannot perceive it. In the Spring, when the air is colder, and the Bees duller at their work, it is more visible: namely when they gather off the Aglets, or Catkins, of the Hazel, or the Willow a little after.</p>
                     <p>Many out of curiosity have supposed, that they might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to observe the Bees work if they had a transparent Hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Let the board or plank whereon the Bee-hive stands have a small hole, or cleft thorow the middle of it (bigge enough for a Bee to goe through) or let the Hive stand a little over the board or stoole, and when the Hive is full you shall ordinarily have them work Combes to the bottome of the board under the Hive; I have had under one hive six or seven Combes about a

foot long a peice, wherein they bred their young, laid up their hony and Bee-bread as in the hive; and although they were in the open air, yet was I thereby little the wiser, only sometimes in a colder season I have observed them blowing, and working of the lower part of their Combe, but was not any thing at all enabled to understand the generation of their young, or other curiosities which were performed in the inmost combs; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves (except the Bees and their work too, had been transparent) they still some of them encompassing their work; and therefore except you can with your eye penetrate a solid body, you will conceive thereby little of their work (only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the edges of their Combs) and much less in a Glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hive.</p>
                     <p>They unload into the empty cells the Bee-bread which they have gathered for food for themselves, when they cannot goe forth to work, and also to feed their young, but if it continue any long time uneaten, it wil grow dry, insipid, and sower, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as tastless, so useless, and oft cause the Bees to forsake their Hives (as some suppose) but this is never the chief cause of their departure, but rather paucity and fewness of Bees, having over-swarmed, or else the loss of their commander. For, hive a swarm into old combs where is much stopping, yet shal you finde that they will thrive wel, for they wil draw it out of the cels with their fangs, and carry it forth. And let the combs be never so old, except they have taken wet, and so be rotten and crispie, they wil like well of them, only if they be very old, they will doe as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons doe with old stone buildings, take down the out-part and work it again with new materials, whereby it shall be as good as new, and they continue as long, and as well in them, as if they had been put into new combs.</p>
                     <p>Into old combs (after nine or ten years standing the Bees by casualty dying) I have hived little or late swarms, which have continued in some of them ten years more.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes my owne, sometimes my Neighbours Bees have trimmed up such Hives as they have found standing (the Bees being dead) and have gone of themselves into them, and thrived better than others hived into new hives, or new combs; so that blackness (as it is commonly thought) is not an infallible signe of a faulty hive, for the combs have successively sundry colours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:99780:53"/>The first colour is white, which in a good Hive before the end of Summer will turn to a light yellow, and by the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next Spring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this light is changed into a sad colour, and so by degrees it becomes brown, and then black, but not in all parts of the Hive alike, for the combs will bee black before, and brown in the middle when they are yellow, if not white in the backward combs. And this alteration of colour, is caused by the heat of the Bees, who lying for the most part before, do soonest discolour them; but the blackest combs (tried or melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) will turn again to yellow.</p>
                     <p>It is not amiss (especially if the Hives bee poor) to cleanse away in the Spring the dross and filth that the Bees have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all Winter when they could not go abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of them, as some require, I never saw any cause, nor found any profit in many years that I have been conversant among them.</p>

                     <p>The Vulgar when they see the Bees go home laden with Bee-bread, suppose they carry way, and so they call it, but if you taste it, you will easily resolve your self.</p>
                     <p>Besides, if you would coagulate it together, with the heat of your fingers (as you may wax) you cannot, but shall finde it crumble, and not stick together like wax Put it into the fire, it will not melt like wax; besides, it is of divers colours according to the quality of the flowers, or plants whereof it is gathered, so that by the colour with a little observation, you may say of most of the Bees, when they return with it, where they have been gathering.</p>
                     <p>Taste it when it is new gathered, it is sweet, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant, but not so sweet as honey.</p>
                     <p>And that it is not wax, take notice of an old stock into which they carry plentifully of it, and yet at the end of the year there is no more wax (if so much) then there was in the beginning. Whereas a swarm will sometimes work down half their hive in a week, and yet you shall see them carry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> little of it if any at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:99780:53"/>And the reason that the old stocks carry inso much, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have many young ones to feed, whereas a swarm for the first ten dayes, ordinarily have not hatched much spat, or young brood, and they feed for the most part abroad, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need little of it in the Hive.</p>
                     <p>The liquid honey the Bees suck or gather with their tongue, whence they let it down into their bottles, which are within them like bladders, each of them will hold a drop at once; you may see their bellies strut withall. Many think because they see nothing on their thighs, that they come home empty, but they are better, and more heavy laden than the other.</p>
                     <p>This sedulous diligence and indefatigable industry of the Bees is most evident and eminent in the Spring, after they have been long confined to their hives with the Winters frost and cold, but being set at liberty by the Suns warmer beams, they speedily scoure over hills and dales gathering of every blossome, and flower as greedily as the griping Usurer graspeth gold, which diligence of theirs, is notably expressed by a Modern Poet.</p>

                     <p>BEes breed in <hi>May,</hi> when there is plenty of honey dews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <note place="margin">Dr. Harvey de partu.</note> Wasps in Summer, when the fruits begin to ripon. It is true Bees breed in <hi>May,</hi> but their chief breeding is in <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>April.</hi> And although the Wasps appear not in great numbers untill the latter end of Summer, yet they begin to breed in the Spring.</p>
                     <p>The old stocks having bred in the Spring, and with a new supply replenished their hives, they presently prepare to send forth a Colony or two (if the weather prove seasonable) out of every good stall.</p>
                     <p>In extraordinary dry and windy times, many, though they bee full, yet they will not swarm at all. For having wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Sometimes it falls out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they have no Commander

ready. I once had a very good hive full, and multitudinous with Bees, and yet never swarmed in many years, I was resolved to let them alone, to try whether they would ever swarm; in the eighth year they swarmed twice, and also other years after, what might bee the cause of their long delay, I cannot certainly assign.</p>
                     <p>The swarm consists not of younger Bees, then the stock, for there go forth both old and young, and therefore <hi>Aristotle</hi> was deceived, who said that the swarm consisted of young Bees,<note place="margin">Arist. de hist. Animal. l. 9. c. 64.</note> and was not contradicted by <hi>Scaliger</hi> commenting upon him.</p>
                     <p>The swarm parts not into several companies, but when there are more Queens than one. Some Drones go along in every swarm, but not many, seldome a dozen: And therefore whereas some lay it down as an insallible rule, That those swarms that have not many Drones will not thrive, is not alwayes true.</p>
                     <p>Many times the weather proving stormy, and cold, the Drones will all bee starved, when as the Bees will supply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by going sometimes (though seldome) abroad. Nay the Bees often in such seasons jealous of their own safety (and knowing them to bee great devoure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s) will kill them; and yet the weather proving seasonable, afterwards have thriven and prospered well that year, but perhaps they had a concept<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve power by a masculine vertue from the Drones before they swarmed.</p>
                     <p>It is impossible to determine the precise time of the year when Bees will swarm, but by the forwardness of the Spring, and warmness of the weather you may probably guess.</p>
                     <p>A warm, calm, and a showing Spring causeth many and early swarms; but it is to be supposed if stormy, cold, and close weather follow, not a great while together, immediately after. I once had many Hives (the beginning of the Spring being milde and warm) very forward, so that by the end of <hi>March</hi> they began to lye forth.</p>
                     <p>And although the weather within a week of <hi>April,</hi> did somewhat alter, yet (being full of brood withi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

mouthes and no meat, and not being able (because of the cold) to goe forth to gather any, in <hi>Ianuary</hi> before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am confident the worst of them had not less than three quarts of hoay.</p>
                     <p>Now those that were poor and weak began not to breed so early, and though they were not so well supplied, yet had they few mouthes as they had a little meat, and endured the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and swarmed that year, but somewhat later than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; the first sort lying forth without the Hive I could not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely feed them, which otherwise I would have done, when I perceived them to perish.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes also in regard of the uncertainty of the weather, early swarms are not the best; in the year one thousand six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty two, I had twenty swarms before mid <hi>May,</hi> and many more after, and of all, but one survived until the next year, for the year was so dry that by Midsummer there was scarse any flowers, and they yeelded little hony, except in the Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, where the Bees among the moyst and shady pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s found better provision.</p>
                     <p>Many times <hi>May</hi> swarms prove not so well as those that are cast in the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> the Wind oft times continuing high and cold, and the season close, so that without a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing many swarms are like to perish.</p>
                     <p>If a swarme by bad weather be checked, and hindred in their work the first week, they will seldome work couragiously all the summer following.</p>
                     <p>Dry weather makes plenty of hoay, and moyst of swarms, so that when a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

penury of Hony; the one makes them able, the other willing, and then neither Winds, nor Clouds, nor Rain can stay them, whereas in times of plenty it is otherwise.</p>

                     <p>But this voyce is not at all, or but some few hours before they goe forth with their first Colony, it is true indeed always of the after swarms, but by the way, if they hear not at all, (which <hi>Aristotle</hi> elsewhere denies) to what purpose were this call, or proclamation to make ready to be gone?</p>

                     <p>When Bees lye continually forth of the Hive, they usually swarme late, sometimes not at all that year, the reason thereof is, because the Hives being ful of Bees, and therefore very hot, the Bees to refresh and coole themselves lye abroad under the Hive, or upon the sides thereof, whereby the Hive never seemes over full; and they having used a while to lye forth, finde no inconvenience from their multitudes, and are loath to forsake that plenty which they have painfully gathered.</p>
                     <p>If they begin a Combe under the board, it is a sure signe of not swarming; sweep them down that hang under, and imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the place, and gently drive them into the Hive with a brush of wet stinking weeds, or smoke them in, as you shall be more fully informed afterwards. But doe what you can, some Hives wil not swarme at all, or not a great while, perhaps they want a Leader.</p>
                     <p>Always choose a Hive answerable to the swarme, a forward swarme if great, may be put into a Hive that containes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than three pecks, but if it be a prime swarme, in the beginning of <hi>Iune,</hi> into a Hive containing three pocks; if at Midsummer, into a Hive somewhat less, but I like no Hive that holds not somewhat above half a bushel.</p>
                     <p>By this time the swarme is setled, goe presently therefore to hive it (having Hives of all sorts alwayes prepared) for fear of rising again, or of others coming to it.</p>
                     <p>If it be in the heat of the day, and the Sun shine upon it, it will not stay long, if it be provided of a place (hive or tree) as some are before hand; presently after they are setled, and all their company gathered together, they wil uncluster, rise againe, and be gone, and fly forth right thither (not as at other times uncertainly) and wil not be staid by any course you can take. If they be not provided before-hand, as soon as they are gathered together, they designe, or empower some of their company to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99780:57"/>
espy out one, and if they return with the news of it before swarming time bee past, for that day (and they yet unhived) they will presently uncluster, and away, otherwise they will hang untill the next day. They therefore deal indiscreetly, that let their swarms hang untill night, losing thereby many, and hindring them in their work; for as soon as they are hived, if it bee not late in the afternoon, they will presently ply their work, and sometimes make a comb a handfull long before night, and fill much of it with honey, as I have often found, when I have united them to another.</p>
                     <p>And besides by long hanging, they will bee wonted to the place, that for some dayes after, they will hanker thereabouts, and neglect their labours.</p>
                     <p>And where there are many Hives, there is great likelihood of others rising, and then if they bee within hearing, they will flye all together; bestir you therefore to hive them presently; and if you espy any other to arise before you have done, stop them up with a cloath (and when you have dispatched, let them out) but if you have finished before they come forth, or come towards you, cover the first with a sheet untill the last bee settled elsewhere. But if they flye about the covered Hive, seeking to enter there, set down a prepared empty Hive by it, and they will often go in of themselves.</p>
                     <p>But if two prime swarms rise together, then there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but for the most part they will settle together: Hive half of them into one Hive as near as you can guess, and the remainder into another. And if the Queen Bees be divided, they will continue severally, otherwise, will go out of that Hive where is no Queen, into the other. When they are all entred into one, knock them down into a fan, or upon a very broad board, and set two Hives over them, having first laid sticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the fan to bear up the Hives a little from the bottome, that the Bees may on every side easily enter in, and with a wing or brush of weeds, sweep some to one, and some to another, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually as you can. But if notwithstanding all your endeavours, they will go to one Hive, then fetch a weak castling, and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down near half upon the fan, carry the other away the distance of a rod, or more, and set the castling over those in the fan, and so shall you have two good Hives howsoever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:99780:57"/>If your swarm light upon a bough, shake them in gently, and set them upon a board o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if any rise as (usually some will) shake them down, and lay a handfull of May-weed, Wormwood, or other wet herbs in the place where they setled, and they will quickly remove, and goe to their fellows; but if they light very high, then carry up a cloath with you, and cover them that you have in the Hive, and bring it down with the mouth upwards, and set them below (on a fan as before) and fetch the remainder in another empty Hive covered, and when you are down, knock them out by the side of the former, sometime you must do it, a third, nay a fourth time before you have all.</p>
                     <p>If they light upon the body of a tree (they will bee trouble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> some to hive) you cannot take half of them in at once, but sweep with a wing or brush of weeds, as many as you can, and set them underneath the place, and fetch the remainder, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it will not bee amiss to saw down gently the bough (when you cannot otherwise well come at them) where they hang, fastening first a little line to it, and so softly let it down, or else bring it down in your hand. I have brought down many, and hived them with ease below. At other times when they have been very high in the middle or out-side of a tree, I have carried up a fan, and fastened it by the ears under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the swarm, and so hived them as easily as if they had been near the ground, setting them in the fan, laying sticks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>st in it, as I prescribed before. And in the evening without any trouble, fetched them down, and set them in their place.</p>
                     <p>The manner of hiving is very various and manifold, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the many and different circumstances of the lighting, or pitching, that it can hardly be taught by rules, but is rather to be learned by use, and experience, guided with reason and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
                     <p>If they settle on a dead hedge, or on the ground, set the Hive over them, under-propping it if there bee cause, and with a handfull of wet weeds stir them softly underneath, and they will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99780:58"/>
go up, and to allure them the sooner, anoint the edges of the Hive with a little honey, and sprinkle a little within it.</p>
                     <p>It will not be amiss to shred, and order here and there some boughs of the trees in, or near your Bee-garden, that they may hang out, as it were from the rest more opportunely to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Bees when they swarm. Yet in places where are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trees, nor dead hedges, they will settle upon pales, nettles, mallows, they will refuse nothing they readily meet with; sometimes on the very grass: Thus in the Island of <hi>Fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>

To keep them cool by watering and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of them, and inlarging<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the door, to give them aire (alwayes provided that there be no back-door in the Hive) I have with a contrary course occasioned their swarming, first rubbing the bottome of the stool against the door well with wormwood, or the juyce of Elder, and all the sides about the door, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aying wormwood, or May-weed also, close to the mouth, and also before, above the door; which being done, I have in the heat of the day taken off their cover, so that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well able to continue in the Hive, nor yet to rest under it, nor on the sides of the Hive, they have presently swarmed.</p>
                     <p>A second way prescribed by Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> is, when they have lain out (although they have had fit weather two or three dayes) then the next calm and warm day a little before noon (when the Sun shineth, and you see no clouds coming to hide it) put in as many as you can with your brush (it is better to smoak them in) and sweep down the rest, not suffering any to cluster again: These rising in the calm heat of the Sun, will make such a noise, as if they were swarming, which their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows hearing, will perhaps come out unto them, and begin to swarm. It is but a perhaps, for I have seldome seen this course successful.</p>
                     <p>When all hope of their swarming is past, in some evening while it is yet light (saith Mr. <hi>Butler</hi>) holding a Hive under those that lye out, cut them off with a tight thred held streight between two hands, and carry them to an over-swarmer that you would mend, knock them down on a table close before his Hive, into which, because they come without a Prince, they are
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99780:58"/>
quietly admitted, and quickly united under one Commander: Stay there, I have often tried this course, but without success al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; for though they bee without any great contest admitted and continue there that night, yet the day following, they will return to their old Hive.</p>
                     <p>See here the difference between a voluntary emission, and a compulsive; when they go forth with a Leader, you may put them any where, for they have by a voluntary departure, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded themselves from their former society, and to return thither again, except it bee in a short space, is capital: They are reputed as enemies, forsaking their own Commander, and going away with another Leader; but if their Princess in a short space return with them, there is no question about their admission; but if by a wile they are taken from their own company without a Leader, they will return back again do what you can, except you carry them so far that they know not the way.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> for such Hives as have not swarmed before Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer, directs this course, to double the stall, by turning the skirt of the Hive upward, putting the crown into the rim of an old Pale (or the like) well staked about, that it may stand fast, and setting an empty prepared Hive fast upon it, then dawb them (in the middle where they are joyned) round, onely lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a passage even with that of the old stock, and they will ascend into this, and breed, and work as well as in the old. And in the end of <hi>August,</hi> you may drive them all into the new, and take the old for your labour.</p>
                     <p>This course seems plausible upon the first proposal, but upon frequent trial, I have found it to little purpose: For the Bees ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many young ones in the old Hive, and much meat, will not ascend, but as they are necessitated for room, and then work their combs to the old, upwards, and not downwards from the top of the Hive, newly set over them; so that by parting of the combs which will not bee without trouble, you may take some little profit of the combs new wrought, but must continue the old Hive to stand still, except you mean to take all, I never found any to have wrought above half way upwards, so that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no foundation, but the old combs, it is impossible to set down the new Hive.</p>

                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:99780:59"/>Bees will swarm any time of the day, between eight in the morning, and four in the afternoon, but the chief time of swarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is between eleven and one. Many stocks when they are disposed to swarm, will rise in a cloudy season often before the Sun shine upon them, I have had some by eight of the clock; but chiefly in a hot gleam, after that a showr, or a dark cloud hath sent them home, but in hot and dry weather it is not so. The swarming month<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>To judge by the time of their swarming, which will thrive, is very uncertain, because of the variable weather that often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after, for being checked a little, and discouraged at the first, for a week together, they will scarce work kindly all the year after, so that many (though less, and coming a month after) not hindred at all by ill weather, will bee better than those at the end of the year. And another cause why forward swarmes thrive not after soul weather, is, because they are very ventrous abroad, and by the stormy winds, and unseasonable weather many are diminished, and thereby their increase exceedingly retarded.</p>
                     <p>Signes of after swarms are more manifest and certain, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten dayes after the first swarm is cast, sometimes a little sooner, sometimes a day or two later, the next Princess will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to tune in her treble voyce a mournful and begging note, as if shee did pray her Queen mother to give her leave to bee gone, unto which voyce if the Queen vouchsafe to reply, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The first day after the grant, how fair soever the weather be, they will not go, and not ordinarily on the next day, except it bee very fair; but on the third day, though it bee somewhat close, and cloudy weather, yet sometimes the weather proving very cold and windy, I have known them stay five or six dayes after li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty granted.</p>
                     <p>The evening before they swarm, the young Princess goes calling from one part of the Hive to another, sometimes shee is before, sometimes behinde, sometimes above, but still calls, and resting a while between, shee still renewes her calling. In the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99780:59"/>
morning before, shee often descends to the bottome of the Hive, with shriller and thicker, longer, and more continued notes than at first, that none may plead ignorance, but all know, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is a new Princess, and bee ready to attend her when shee takes possession of her Royalty, dealing herein (but that shee is her own officer, and it is no disparagement, for the Queen mother is her continual assistant) as Princes on earth that come newly to succeed in their Dominions, they make it known by sound of Trumpets, and Proclamations, in the most eminent parts of the Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>But take notice by the way, that sometimes the Commonalty (knowing best their numbers within, and the state of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abroad) not thinking it good to make a division, will after leave obtained, kill the young Princess, and all the infants of the blood Royal, but this is not ordinary.</p>

to their paucity, do by a continued flying about, allure as many as they can to come forth to augment their numbers.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes swarms will settle in two or more clusters, a little distance one from the other (seldome prime swarms.) Now usually the cause is, because there bee divers Commanders, and each gets a company.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99780:61"/>
whist and silent, and by and by again renewing their sad lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tumultuously likewise running before the Hive, and about the sides thereof, as if they were not onely discontented, but distracted: Others are flying (but pittifully complaining, as they flye) about the Garden with a busie Quest searching for her; and if they do not in a short space meet with her, will all comfortless return to the stock again, whence they came forth.</p>
                     <p>But if they finde her, or shee be brought unto them, they presently congratulate her return with continued shaking of their wings, and oral rejoycings, witnessing their present contentedness, complacency, and satisfaction, making even their joyfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in her, something more joyfull than before, as if the felt pleasure at her first return, were more delicious, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing, by reason of the sudden change from that discontent, and distraction in their late loss to an excellency, if not extasie of delight and joy.</p>
                     <p>But if (not finding her) they return home, the next time they come forth, though in numbers a first swarm, yet not in the manner of their swarming; for the next Princess comes not forth at the will of the Commons (losing their Commander, they lose in this respect their liberty) but by petition must obtain leave of the Queen mother, as in second swarms.</p>
                     <p>Now when you perceive the Bees discontented carriage, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently seek about (beginning at the stock, whence they rose, and going that way, the swarm took) and you shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly finde her, for shee is not alone, but encompassed with a guard which will never stir from her, though they starve in the place: Take her up therefore, removing the Bees that environed her (you may do it securely with a little stick) and carry her to the swarm. And you cannot but with wonder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the sudden alteration, with what a rejoycing plaudite (their mourning being ceased) do they welcome, and entertaine her; and those that were seeking for her abroad (although some rods distant) are instantly sensible of their felicity (by their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows rejoycing) and hastily return to express their content, and bear a part in the general gladness.</p>
                     <p>If a swarm light near the place where another was hived a day or two before, when you have hived it, set it ten foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the place where the other stood, for some Bees of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99780:61"/>
the first hived swarm, will for two or three dayes together hanker about the place, and if they finde a hive standing there, will boldly enter, supposing it their own company, and so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry by the others, who take and deal with them as enemies coming to endamage them.</p>
                     <p>Swarms will the day after they are hived busily follow their labour, but the removing of them from the place where they were hived, doth not a little discourage them; if therefore the weather bee not fair, they will not stir the first day, and except it bee more than indifferent, they will not stir the second day, and so as the foul weather lasteth, droop, and grow faint, and sometimes totally miscarry.</p>
                     <p>To prevent this, the day after they are set up, when the Sun shines upon them, or howsoever about noon (except it rain) put a little honey under the hive near the mouth of it, and some at the mouth, and before the entrance (less than a spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full will serve) which they will quickly smell, and come down to feed on, and flye forth, and thereby bee acquainted with their new standing, and fall to work upon the first fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>If the weather continue cold and cloudy a week together, without a little supply they will dye, therefore every day refesh them with a little honey. After they are acquainted with their standing, you may put it into the Hive upon a peece of an old comb in the evening. They can indure four or five dayes without meat, but if the foul weather continue longer, they will hanging by one anothers legs, fall down to the bottome of the Hive, and perish; but try them not too far, but quicken them daily with a little honey, and you shall keep them strong and lusty (such close and windy weather falls out often in <hi>May</hi>) you shall gain by this loss, for the weather altering, they will not onely subsist of themselves, but by their painful labours, recompence your cost and care.</p>
                     <p>If your stocks cast a second swarm after Midsummer, the best way is to return it home again. Hive it as you do other swarms, and about six of the clock knock them out on a table before their stock, and they will go in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if they come forth again (as perhaps they will) do so the second time, and if there bee occasion, the third also, but look heedfully when you first
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99780:62"/>
knock them out for the Queen Bee, and take her away, and then shall you bee sure to prevent further and future trouble. And thus shall you keep your stocks full and lusty, which otherwise were in danger of miscarrying, and the swarms (most years) would bee worth nothing.</p>
                     <p>Set the poorest swarms upon a plank, and when they have done working, dawb them round, allowing air, only through two or three quills, and set them in a dry cold place of your house, or barn, and so being little sensible of the alteration of the air, they will sleep much, and eat little.</p>

                     <p>Be very careful about the doore, or entrance into your Hives, for negligence herein occasions the loss of more Bees than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglect, from the Dor-mouse, and Tit-mouse in Winter, and the Wasp, and robbing Bees in Autumn.</p>
                     <p>Let the doors be somewhat long, but very low, not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the height of a Bee, and let them be more or less open, according to the seasons; but rather offend in leaving too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row an entrance than too large; a thin board in Winter cut in notches like a grate, wel fastned to the Hive, with Cow-dung and Ashes tempered together; two notches open in Winter, is enough for a good Hive, one for a poorer; for thereby they are kept more warme in Winter, and more secure from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>When they have wrought a week in the Spring, the better Hives may have three or four notches open, and by degrees more, until they be full, and then you may take away the grates altogether until Autumne; but be sure to set them early to the old Stocks that have over-swarmed, as also to the poore swarms, and in a dry year, sooner than in a moyst, for the Waspes wil be more numerous and early, and the robbing Bees finding little abroad to busie themselves about, will be seeking to plunder poor and weak Stocks betimes.</p>
                     <p>When you see the Waspes begin to be busie, and forsake eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of dead Bees, before the stooles, venter into the Hives, set up your doors to the poorer Stocks, and narrow the passage of the better with a little Cow-dung (tempered as before) that it may not be above an inch long.</p>
                     <p>If you will bee at cost, it will be very beneficial to have a hurdle made of Oziers set before your Hives, even with your stools, or else boards shelving outwards at the bottome, for the Bees to rest on when they come home weary and laden.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Levit</hi> mislikes the keeping of Hives four or five years at the most, but his reasons are weak, because (saith hee) the combs will be black and unsavoury, and the old Bees are not so good for increase and breed, as the young, nor so strong and lusty for labour; but these reasons are without reason, for blackness of the combs is no fault, as wee shewed before, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99780:65"/>
of the age of Bees, wee shall treat by and by, onely in a word, note that they are an annual creature, and live not beyond a year with the vantage; on the same ground, therefore all the old stocks must be taken every year.</p>
                     <p>Many things are necessary for the preservation of Bees, first, A competency of food which they will labour for, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass with their own industry, except the unseasonableness of the weather, the smalness of their numbers, the treachery of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the power of robbers, or the covetousness, or simplicity of their owners by driving them too late, or after that by reiterated swarming, they have diminished their numbers, for the recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, they were well enough furnished with brood (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though then unfledge Nymphs, yet the hopes of continuance) of which being untimely bereaved by driving, as desperate, they either forsake their Hives; or if they continue and work, yet can they not sufficiently breed, and provide themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Winter, and therefore must starve.</p>
                     <p>It hath been inquired by some, what quantity of hony wil serve a Hive of Bees all Winter: To which question no certain answer can be returned, because of the numbers which in some Hives are more, and therefore must have more meat; and also because the Spring in some years, is more forward than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that quantity that will serve in one year, will not serve in another. But I would not willingly let any stock continue, that had not five pintes at the least of hony.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it will bee convenient to hoist up such swarms that you fear will cast, especially if Midsummer bee past, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may live, yet ordinarily they will bee weak and poor, and the stock whence they came so impoverished, that if it continues, it will scarce swarm the year following.</p>
                     <p>Raise them up by putting four Brickbats at an equal distance under the skirts of the Hive, let them go no further inwards than the verges, then dawb them up well, leaving a fitting pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for them to go out of the Hive.</p>
                     <p>I like Mr. <hi>Southerns</hi> judgement to set them down again afterwards, the best time is in <hi>Ianuary.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Levit</hi> laughs at as an impossibility, supposing that they having wrought down to the board, the combs would bee crushed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and many Bees killed; but laying the Hive on the side,

                     <p>The course in our Country which most take to get some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by their Bees, is driving, out of a foolish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y they will not burn them, but care not much to starve them, and that without any great profit to themselves, for they usually do it after they have cast a second swarm about Midsummer, or a week after. The Bees then (besides those in the brood, which would have been a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient supply to them) being then very few, and many of them old Bees, which in a month, or a little more, will all dye, and then they will bee by much fewer; as soon as they are driven therefore, despairing by their own industry to subsist, they will leave the Hive and flye into another, so skipping for the most part, out of the Frying-pan into the fire. If they work, as some will endeavour their own preservation, yet not one of three in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary years out-live the Winter, and they being weak, are often made a prey to robbers in the Spring, or having spent their little store, then flye away; but if they out-wrastle all these difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet they will scarce swarm that year.</p>
                     <p>Moreover little hony at that time of the year is ordinarily to bee had; a quart, perhaps a pottle, and this is a liberal portion. Whereas if they will drive them, let them do it early before their hony is consumed by successive broods, and let them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the condition of the Spring, for thereby they may have some likelihoods whether they will do well.</p>
                     <p>I have driven ten Hives in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> (not swarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the year before) all which after swarmed the same Summer, and the prime swarms did very well: Or if you will drive, take this course, when your stock hath cast a second swarm, the night following drive the old stock into the swarm, and they may do well, except it be late in the year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:99780:66"/>Old stocks before they have swarmed, and early swarmes driven, seldome miscarry; I have known them driven twice in three weeks, and full of hony the second time. Nay a foolish neighbour of mine drove a swarm the third time, and had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a gallon of hony at either of the two first drivings, and above three quarts the third time, but it was so late that the Bees dyed that Winter.</p>
                     <p>If you have a stock that lay out the year before, and swarmed not, and doth so the year following, and Midsummer be past, drive it, and ten to one (if the year bee indifferent it will do well.)</p>
                     <p>Now to preserve your stocks, and yet to make some advantage of your Bees, take this course (except you know a better, but thus I do) About <hi>Bartholomew-tide,</hi> I survey my swarms, and all those that I finde not by the weight competently supplied, namely with five pintes of hony at the least, I take, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine my old stocks, especially such as have swarmed twice, or oftner, and where I finde few Bees, which you shall know, if giving the Hive a little knock with your finger on the out-side of the Hive, if the murmur bee sudden and short, then it is a signe there bee but few Bees, but if it bee smart and long, descending from the top downwards, then it is a signe of plenty.</p>
                     <p>They that have but few Bees, though they bee never so well stored with hony, yet will not continue over the next Spring, but will bee a prey to robbers; therefore it is better to take them then to lose them, and their honey also; but yet if you desire to save any that are well supplied, then drive a swarm that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to take into them, and so shall you have a good stock; and thus with Gods blessing shall you increase your Bees, and have a sufficiency of hony and wax. If you have not, you may take as many of the best as you shall think convenient.</p>
                     <p>Some prescribe to take those that are too full of hony, as (thereby) disabled to breed, and prosper the year following, but this is but a groundless supposition for ought ever I could finde, having had as good as any other, the combes being generally filled with hony to the board, which I have let stand on purpose to try whether they would breed, and never found, but such were as full of Bees the year following, as any other; for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99780:66"/>
after working time there is a long time of eating, and if they be numerous with Bees, they wil make roome enough by bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding time.</p>
                     <p>The manner in a word to take Hives in the latter part of the year is by burning, which briefly you may thus doe; take an old linnen cloath and cut it into long narrow peeces, about two handfuls long, and halfe an inch broad, and then having melted beaten Brimstone, dip them therein, and having digged a hole near the Hive that you intend to take, let it be somewhat more than a foot over, and half as deep; set in the bottome of it two or three crotched sticks, into which put three or four of your raggs smeared with Brimstone, and having kindled them set the Hive over, stopping the verges somewhat close, and your Bees with the smoak wil in a short space fall down st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the manner of driving, it is needless that I should speak much, being wel known almost to every one.</p>
                     <p>Have a prepared Hive as near as you can, of the breadth, in the skirt, of that Hive you will drive setting it on the ground, put sheet over it, and wel fasten it with a strong pack-threadround about the Hive within an inch of the skirts, then having a Trivet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, Payl, or Firkin ready, set the empty Hive therein with the mouth upwards, and then lift the Hive you wil drive, nimbly from the stall, and set it upon them empty, and gather up quickly the sheet that hangs down to the crown, and fasten it wel likewise with a little line, about an inch from the skirt, and turn them thus tied together, that the empty Hive may stand upwards, and knock gently with the palmes of your hands on the sides, and on the crown, sometimes in one place, and then in another, and often pause, and make a little stop, that the Bees may ascend, and reiterate your clapping againe; in half an hour they will be all, or the most of them gone up, and then carry it to the place where the other stood; if you doe it in the evening, let it stand unmeddled with all night; if in the morning, let it be before Sun; and if there be any Bees behind, when you take out the combs, sweep them off with a wing, and they wil finde their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                     <p>Many in the Bees necessity commend and applaud feeding, when by driving unseasonably, or not seasonably uniting (as the

                     <p>For feeding of weak Bees, many things by many are prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, I shal be brief in the particulars, because I altogether dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like feeding, except in the beginning of the year, through the backwardness of the Spring, some Hives (otherwise sufficiently furnished) stand in need, or some early swarmes, the weather proving tempestuous, cold, or close, sometimes for above a week together: it wil be very convenient then to relieve them, until the weather alter, and they begin to work, when they wil need no longer your supply, and without a little supply would bee so poor and feeble, that they would untimely miscarry, and dye.</p>
                     <p>The ancients commend feeding of them with Raisins, bruised Figgs; <hi>Pliny</hi> bids set Hens flesh before them, although he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that they eate no kinde of flesh, and therefore in that respect preferres them before the Hornet, and the Waspe.</p>

                     <p>The knowledge of Bees was never truly communicated to the World by any but by <hi>English</hi> men; Mr. <hi>Southerne</hi> brake the ice, then followed Master <hi>Levit,</hi> who wrote more than fifty years since: though he was published long after Mr, <hi>Butler:</hi> Mr. <hi>Levit,</hi> I say, not the Father of the publisher, but the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father (perhaps his Grand-child knew not so much) and I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not but Mr <hi>Butler</hi> was acquainted with his Book, for it was in divers mens hands though not printed.</p>
                     <p>After him Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> wrote singularly wel (although in some things defective, and no question but after Ages may adde more, but I wil not be too bitter, not doubting of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans good meaning, but advise him, and all others in this, or any other subject, not to urge Eutopian conceits, but such things

as out of experience they have some probable grounds for, <hi>Ne sutor ultra crepidam,</hi> all Countries produce not an equal store of every commodity; that other Countries abound more with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is not because they abound in skil, <hi>Scandia</hi> is more plentiful, because after the great snowes that lye all Winter on the ground, and keep it warme, which once dissolved, the earth is presently embroidered with a garment of Flowers in greater plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, variety, and continuance than most Countries afford; and the long dayes are another advantage, especially the weather not being so variable as with us, and a principal cause of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease is the extreame cold in Winter, which holds them in a perpetual sleep, so that they eate little after they leave working, and the earth with the Winters Snow and Raine is thorowly moystned, that drought seldome proves injurious to them, as it is often with us.</p>

                     <p>I have shewed a cheaper and safer way, by uniting, and for casual wants, in regard of the continuance of cold and bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hony is more natural.</p>

                     <p>When you have occasion to feed, if you have not reserved Combs on purpose when you took your Bees, spread Hony upon a dry combe, and put it under the Hive in the evening, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to take it away in the morning, if any be left, or shut them up until they have eaten all, least the robbing Bees finde it, and not contented therewith, carry away also that little they have in the combes, I would have feeding begun (where it is necessary) before an absolute want, least they bee so poor and weak that they cannot come down; if any happen so to be, then turne up the mouth of the Hive in the heat of the Sun, or near a Fire, and drop a little liquid hony among them.</p>

                     <p>But peeces of Wood, or Boards, entred into the water, and set shelving, or leaning towards the North are much better, the stones being too cold in the spring; but if you can bare the banks of the North-side of your Pond of all bushes, and grasse shelving towards the water, where they may drink under the Wind, and in the heat of the Sun, and suck it out of the earth above the water, which they rather desire, than to suck the pure water it self.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> enumerating the several actions of Bees in warme dayes in Winter, among others saith, they drink, but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for although sometimes in <hi>Ianuary</hi> they gather a little Bee-bread, yet until they plentifully feed of it, they drink not, for while they feed on Nectar which is hot and moyster than Bee-bread, they need it not, but the other being more hot and dry, makes them exceeding thirsty.</p>
                     <p>Bees will be very much about sinkes, and where greasie water is thrown, nay they rather delight to drink out of Sawpits and holes where the water is thick and troubled, than out of Ponds, though nearer them; and when they water out of Ponds, they delight (as I said) to extract the water from the moystned earth near the Ponds, or Rivers brinkes, than to suck or drink of the purer water it self, which yet some will.</p>

Let it bee carried between two to the place whither you intend it, when you come there, set it down, but open it not presently, for the Bees will bee somewhat disturbed with the motion, and ready to flye forth; it is best to set it up in the heat of the day, that if any suddenly flye forth, they may not bee chilled with the cold, but after a little flying about, they may return to it again; but if the weather bee close and still, then set it up in the evening, and stop it up close (leaving breathing holes) untill a faire day, and then open the door.</p>

                     <p>I will speak one word to this (although out of my sphere) and but a word, lest I conjure up learned <hi>Scalagers</hi> ghost to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose mee, That Fishes breath is evident to sense, I have seen them often come up to the top of the water, and a little eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their heads above, draw it in with the water, and with

And if it be some dayes delayed, they will turn up their bellies in the holes as quite spent, yet by the benefit of the aire, many of them recover, but if it bee altogether neglected, in a great Frost most Pond-fish will dye.</p>

                        <hi>Cardan</hi> affirms, That all living creatures breath either openly<note place="margin">Cardan. de subtil. l. 12.</note> or secretly, manifestly such as have lungs, more hiddenly which have gills; and that is must obscure by palpitation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi> denies such creatures that have no lungs to breathe, hee understands thereby a perfect breathing, and therefore saith, The sound of Bees is caused by the aire, which they receive and draw in; why not the same instrument that draws it in return it? But this opinion, although <hi>Aristotle's Scaliger</hi> labours to undermine, but to little purpose. Hee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it to bee caused by the shaking of their wings.

                        </gap> full of Pees, where they lye crowded up thick together in the Winter between the combs, without room to dilate their wings, not at all to shake them, you shall have a sudden smart sound in an instant from the place touched, descending to the bottome from all the Bees, as it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by the incouragement of the Queen Bee, when two swarms are united, and so mingled together, that either of

them being encompassed with their whole troop, and having no room to stir, and shake their wings (being each of them in the center of their regiment) but as they are in the conflict moved with the whole body; yet may they bee heard audibly some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a rod from the Hive a great while together, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, each encouraging her army to stand to her, and for her.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If their sound were caused by the agitation of their wings only, it could not bee various and changed, but onely smaller, or greater, but both <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Scaliger</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they change their voyce; and if they did not, yet<note place="margin">Arist de hist. l. 9. c. 40.</note> is it so evident to sense, that but coming among them, by their different voyces, it may bee known whether they mourn or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, work or sight.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, If their sound were caused by the agitation of their wings, then according to the largeness of their wings should bee the greatness of their sound, but this is not so; the Queen Bees wings are no bigger than a common Bees, but her sound is more than ten times lowder and greater.</p>
                     <p>I might adde that Crickets sing, and their voyces are heard very far, and yet have no wings to shake; nay they move not their bodies when they sing, as I have often observed, and as soon as they stir, they give over singing.</p>
                     <p>In a word, as to a Musitian that playes on a Flute, or such like Wind-instrument, there is required skilfulness in the outward touch of his instrument, and also wind to bee inspired, without which hee cannot possibly strike the ear, or please the sense with any melodious noise, so do I conceive in some respects the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming noise of the Bees, is caused both by the outward motion of their wings, and also by an inward motion, that I say, not inspiration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> was very wavering what to determine concerning their sound, sometimes hee saith, they make a noise; sometimes, hee grants they have a voice, and hee hath no sooner granted it, but would fain bite it in again if hee could, as overthrowing this<note place="margin">Arist. de hist. l. 9, c. 40.</note> position, that they breathe not; Hear what hee saith, they change their voyce, when they swarm they have a proper and peculiar voyce, but whether they have a voyce or not, is not yet through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood in regard of the difficulty.</p>

                     <p>And again, Insects have no voyce, but make a sound onely by the admission of the aire, not emission, and Bees, and all other Insects lift themselves up with their wings, and presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract themselves when there is made a sound by the attrition of the aire taken in, but not constant to himself, hee saith in another place, There is an innate implanted aire in the transverse inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,<note place="margin">Arist. de Spirat.</note> which being lifted up, and contracted, causeth thereby a smiting on the little membrane, and hence saith hee is their sound.</p>

It is certain, saith hee, howsoever it cross the received opinion, that sounds bee created without aire, though aire bee the most favourable deferent of sounds.

                     <p>Hot creatures as Bees, desire a greater refrigeration: Bees<note place="margin">Arist. de Spirat.</note>

like to those creatures that breathe, do make a sound (<hi>spiritu</hi>) with the aire or spirit, for when the native, which is (as before) implanted in the transverse enclosure, is lifted up and contracted, then is caused an attrition of the membrane; For they do not otherwise move this part, then other Animals draw aire with their lungs from without, and Fishes by the agitation of their Gills.</p>

                     <p>To this I answer, That it is granted that oyl kills Bees, and almost all other Insects being naturally mortal to them, and wash them after with what you will they will, neither revive, not recover, but almost as suddenly dye (though but a part of their body bee smeared with oyl) as if they were cast on hot embers. And that it is not, because of the stopping of the passages of the aire, appears thus: Let Bees bee drowned in honey, which is more viscous and clammy than oyl, yet if they bee timely taken out, they will dry themselves, or bee suckt dry by their fellows, and recover.</p>

And if they have a heart (<hi>Aldrovand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>In some that are very small, they are not distinctly visible; but it follows not therefore that they are without them, no more than because they want the visible organs of hearing and smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that therefore they neither hear, nor smell; both which senses almost all natures secretaries acknowledge to bee in them.

                     <p>Others deny that Insects breathe, and their reason is, because there is no breathing knot, or turning in the inward intrall, that is to say a membrane like to the lungs, whereby the aire is drawn in, and therefore some hold that they live as plants; but there is a great difference whether any thing breathes or lives.

                     <p>And that they receive water into their bodies, appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when they dye suffocated in the water, they are greater than when they are alive, whereas if they dye otherwise, they shrink up, and are less.</p>

                     <p>Breathing, saith <hi>Scaliger</hi> is seen by motion, or perceived by<note place="margin">Scalig. de sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. exercitat. 173.</note> touch, by the pulse, or understood by the voyce, and all there wayes more or less, may it appear that Bees breathe.</p>

                     <p>I answer, They breathe by their mouth, <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, the<note place="margin">Arist. de par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus Animal. l. 3. c. 1. Arist de Spir.</note> mouth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> for many uses, for divers creatures do breathe with it. For breathing is not a proper work of the nostrils, but creatures breathe, partly by the nostrils, partly by the mouth.</p>
                     <p>But it is further objected, wee see no lungs: I answer, in fowls the lungs are small, and but like a membrane; surely then in such small flying creatures as Bees, they are not visible.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude they have no lungs, because wee see none,<note place="margin">Arist de parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In some creatures denied to breathe, we see them, and perhaps with a good multiplying glass, might see in these; by the same reason wee might deny they hear or smell, because wee see no organs (as before) whereby they perform it, and yet nothing is more certain.</p>
                     <p>That Bees breathe, Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> affirms, but it was a question<note place="margin">Butler Fem. Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h cold) although, saith hee, they be quite dead, without sense, motion, and breath, you may, if you bee disposed, revive them with the warmth of your hand (but look to your selves, for many when they begin to revive, will ingratefully sting.) And this their reviving cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

seem a miracle unto you, for presently their spirits return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you shall see them begin to pant and breathe, and anon they will flye away as lusty as the best.</p>
                     <p>But to come to arguments, That Bees breathe is evident by their panting and palpitation; I mean not when they are in the condition of prisoners, and violently held or detained, for with <hi>Scaliger</hi> I acknowledge, that Bees or flyts captivated, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation is not breathing, but a striving to escape.</p>
                     <p>Bees when they return from their work are often so weary (as men out of breath) that they are necessitated to rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves near the Hive, untill they have recollected their spirits, and gotten, by a little rest, new strength, at first panting more quick and short, but by and by fetching as it were a longer breath, untill at last they pant little, if at all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It appears by their swearing at the Hive-door, a moist vapour is visible at the door of a good Hive in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sometimes in drops of water. As Bears in <hi>Russia,</hi> while they sleep in Winter, yet are found by the Hunters, by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved snow turned into isycles on the boughs of the trees under which they lye, caused by their continued breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, because if a full Hive bee close shut up that no aire enters, they will quickly bee suffocated and dye; whereas indeed is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> there be but few Bees, they will continue the longer enclosed, a circum-ambient aire in the mean time refrigerating, and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if you stop their throats, <hi>Aristotle</hi> acknowledgeth<note place="margin">Arist de Spirat.</note> they will bee strangled.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, when they are chilled with cold, lay them in the warm Sun, or near a fire, or if you dare venture, hold them in your hand, and you shall see them begin first a little to stir, then to pant, and the longer more strongly, untill they remit it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as they recover life.</p>
                     <p>But I trifle out the time to prove by arguments to the ear, a thing to visible to the eye. Hold your hand near to the mouth of a full Hive, and that in the night when they are supposed to sleep, and not to stir, and you shall feel a cool aire come from them. Nay hold a feather, and you shall see it fly to and fro, as if it would be blown away.</p>

                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:99780:78"/>Another time of robbing is in the spring, and then those poor old stocks that escaped in Autumn must bee carefully watched, poor swarms also shall now bee tried, until the year grows up, and the flowers bee plentiful.</p>
                     <p>Let all such have (as I ordered before) very narrow doors; swarms are more difficultly prevailed against then old stocks; for though perhaps they have not wrought down to the board, and so the entrance be more easy, yet being usually more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinous, they will hold out longer: whereas old stocks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have more provision, yet have fewer souldiers, and therefore are quickly overcome and plundered, and more easily in the spring then before.</p>

At first when they are new come, they content themselves with dead Bees; but after a while they grow bolder, and venture into the Hives, and most of all in the cool mornings when the Bees stir not. And after they have found the way they will never give over, but invite their fellows, nay, they are often the robbing Bees harbingers, who make an end usually where they beginne. And although there bee an antypathy between them and Bees, yet will they readily joyn together to plunder the poor Hives. They are naturally hardier and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Bees, one waspe will often violently break away from two or three Bees, yet many of them come short home, being slain in the Hives by them.</p>

After when they have bred let their nests bee sought ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Set glasses with strong worte, sweetned water, or sweet fruit: or rather pots covered with a paper, with a hole in the middle, and that is the best way, for in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bees will be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Of the cause of smutty corn, I will speak briefly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>Some conceive shrinking of corn by the Hony-dew to bee thus occasioned. In fields less previous to clear and strong winds (as in lower grounds, and narrow places between woods and hills) there falls often sultry and foggy mists, and those co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering too close the fruits of the ground under them, as under thick mantles do cast that corn or kinde of grain which is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this malady, as it were into an unkindly sweat, at such times as the ears thereof are not yet sufficiently filled from the root, by which faint sweat is vented that sweetness that should feed the ear. Now this sweetness once exhausted or drawn out at the stalk, or straw, sticks close unto it being burnt, or made adust by the extraordinary heat of the Sun, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth especially in the Canicular dayes, which (as it may seem) made the <hi>Romans</hi> sacrifice a Whelp or Puppy to Mildew.<note place="margin">Ovid de fast. l. 4.

But yet it brings not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the corn this way, but rather thus, The corn in close places when the Hony-dew descends, not being ventilated and shaken with winds, the Hony-dew as it dries, becomes viscuous and clammy, and sticks close to the straw, and by the heat is hardened and congealed, and thereby stops the radical moistures from ascending, and so the ears being no longer sed, shrink and wither.

                     <p>For cure Mr. <hi>Remnant</hi> prescribes, when you perceive by your Bees that a Hony-dew is fallen, to draw a cord over your Wheat as fast as may bee, before it bee dried on by the wind or Sun. One in one furrow, and another in another, two or three furrows distant as they can well reach. One at one end, and the other at the other end of the cord, for the least mot on will shake it off, it is so exceeding thin when it newfalls. I dare not say (as some) that this can bee done with good profit, for <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriam superat opus,</hi> the charge will exceed the benefit. Such as sow sixty or eighty Acres of Wheat must of necessity imploy many men, and perhaps many dayes together, for Hony-dews in a dry season fall frequently, and sometimes twice a day, and therefore it must be oft reiterated.</p>
                     <p>And the loss by it, is seldome great, it is rare to have one Acre in an hundred prejudiced by it, and yet we consist of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures, and much wood-land.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmed the Hony-dew to bee either the sweat of the<note place="margin">Plin. Nat. hist. l. 11. c. 12.</note> heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the slaver or spittle of the stars, or the moisture of the aire purging it self.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Butler</hi> judgeth the Hony-dew to bee the quintessence of all the sweetness of the earth, meaning as hee explains himself, the quintessence of flowers, because when the year is backward in his fruits, the Hony-dews are alwayes backward, coming only at such times, as the flowers have the most solid and best juice.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, because the Countries that have store of the best and sweetest flowers, have ever the best Hony. It is true, that Hony is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> before the rising of the <hi>Vergilia,</hi> denies that Bees gather any hony, but this is an apparent errour, They ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much hony, when there are Hony-dews, but yet more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any fall, if you respect the shortness of time they gather it in. Bees gather hony more or less all Summer, but least in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne, because the great dews and frequent showers, corrupt the native hony which is bred in the flowers; and yet <hi>Aristotle</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth where there is plenty of Ivy which flowreth in the end of Autumn, the Bees gather much hony, but wee finde it not.</p>
                     <p>That great plenty of Hony comes from above, is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and that the Oak among trees is principally instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to retain and keep the same on his smooth and solid leaves: yet I affirm, that there is a greater proportion collected from flowers, than from the Oak, and all other sorts of trees, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand from the leaves.</p>
                     <p>This indeed is altogether gain-said by <hi>Aristotle:</hi> He delivers, that<note place="margin">Arist. de hist. l. 5. c. 19.</note> Bees gather not hony of flowers, but chiefly of the Hony-dew; and his argument is, because in a day or two, when the Hony-dews fall, some combs will be full, and in the end of Autumn there be flowers, but no hony, if any Hive bee taken, driven, or gelded, hee saith they would gather hony, if any were to bee found.</p>
                     <p>Wee are to know, That as great store of hony falls from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, so there is a native sweetness, or hony, in flowers, the Spring and Summer chiefly, which is not to bee found so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully towards the end of Autumn, because the flowers at that time of the year are weak and spent, and afford little, and that little, is usually exhaled with immoderate heat, or spoyled with frequent raines, or great dews; so that there is little, or no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage at all from them, in respect of hony. Some <hi>Sandara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> indeed the Bees gather then, but that will not last long, therefore of necessity when Bees are late taken, for want of food, they cannot live long.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:99780:84"/>If Bees gathered hony chiefly of the Oak, which almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is retentive of the hony-dew (from flowers he denied they gathered any hony) how comes it to pass that hony-dews falling late in the year, as in the years one thousand six hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and one thousand six hundred forty eight, almost two months after the usual time, namely, in the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> when there fell divers hony-dews, but the Bees were little the better for them, except only in the Heath Country, when the Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower was in his prime, and there those late hony-dews made their fat stalls, but in other places the Bees generally mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried.</p>
                     <p>If they did principally gather of the Oak, the leaves thereof were then as retentive of it, as at Midsummer, but rather hereby it appears, that the hony-dew is received into the hollow sockets of Flowers, and there long contained, until by the Bees it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted.</p>
                     <p>Hony-dews therefore falling late when most Flowers have done blowing, not having any proper place to contain them, are, either quickly washed away with the raine, or exhaled with the Sun.</p>
                     <p>Further, that Bees gather hony of flowers is manifest, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Islands where grow no Oakes, nor yet other Trees, nor yet are near them by some miles (as the Island of <hi>Fowlness</hi>) yet Bees thrive very well, and yeeld ordinarily a greater increase of hony than in other places.</p>

                        <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, the Bees gather the hony-dew from the Elme, Teile-tree, and Sallow; but our Elmes are not retentive of the hony-dew, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>First, the Bees hony, saith <hi>Cordus</hi> is found at all times of the Spring, and Summer, but the Hony-dew (and also Manna) but sometimes and seldome.</p>
                     <p>I answer, that there is a native sweetness in some flowers at most times of the year, and plentifully in a mild and forward Spring, but yet notwithstanding the Bees gather much hony, when the hony-dews fall.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Bees hony is found both night and day in the Flowers, but the hony-dew only in the morning.</p>
                     <p>I answer, It is true, that the Bees gather hony out of the flowers a great part of the day, but there is (besides the native hony) an addition of hony from the hony-dew in the cells of the flowers, where it is preserved longer than on the Oaken leaves, being there obvious to every drying blast, and exhaling raine.</p>
                     <p>And so saith the <hi>L. Verulam,</hi> Flowers that have deep sockets,<note place="margin">L. Veru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, the Bees hony most abounds in flowers about noon, but the hony-dew as soon as the Sun waxeth hot, perisheth; I answer, it perisheth where it is open, and exposed to the Sun and Wind, but where it is well defended from either (as in the small sockets of flowers) it endures much longer.</p>
                     <p>And I affirme further, that Bees gather most hony in the fore-noon, except the hony-dew falls in the after-noon, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raine washeth it a way, nor the Suns hot rayes exhale it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Bees hony while it is contained in the flowers,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99780:86"/>
is liquid, but the hony-dew, namely Manna is compacted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and congealed; Answer, Although the hony be liquid in the combes when it is newly gathered, yet thereupon it follows not that it was so liquid in the flower, being by a transcendent Chimical skill extracted forth of a more grossie substance, and after rare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And againe, it is true in some parts of the World there falls, or rather is gathered this concrete, or coagulated hony (the<note place="margin">Sands relat. l. 4</note> right manna) Manna in <hi>Calabria</hi> is gathered from the leaves of the Mulberry-trees that grow higher in the mountaines, it falls like a dew in the night time, like a dew, and therefore liquid; it is gathered from the leaf of the Mulberry-trees, but not of such as grow in the Vallies, and it falleth upon the leaves by night.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99780:87"/>
comes it to pass that it falls onely on flowers, and not on the plants and leaves of trees? Answer, It falls not only on flowers, but on leaves of trees and plants also, though some plants and leaves, are not so tenacious, and retentive of it, as the great Maple, and the Oaken leaf, but being more porous and spungy, suck it up, and consume it.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, When the Hony-dew falls, the Bees gather it, and flock to it, but onely for their present repast and food. Answer, There is no rustick conversant among Bees, but knows the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and by experience can say, that they then gather more hony in two or three dayes, than in two or three weeks after they cease.</p>

And when it began to leave dropping, poured it on a floor, and strewed upon it as it was turned over, near a shovel full of slaked lime, not that lime addes any thing to the vegetation (perhaps it accelerates the growth) nor yet secures it from vermine (as some conceive) but onely dryes it (being done over-night) that it is more nimble and better to sow the next day.

But as in the old Law, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hony might be received for gifts, and first fruits, yet it was forbidden in Sacrifice: so in the Church (only the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) the hony of Marriage is honourable in Lay-men, yet are married persons prohibited the Altar, for it is not lawful for a Priest to be married.</p>
                     <p>There are many sorts or kinds of hony; Aerial, Manna, Reed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hony, Sugar, and that which is gathered by Bees; the best hony is that which is so pure that it glisters yellow (<hi>Aristotle</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the white) having a good smell, not too hard, nor too thin, sweet to the taste, and hanging together, once being boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led yeelds little scum.</p>

                     <p>Whereas in <hi>Africa,</hi> the fruits and the flowers by the violent heat are quickly withered, and the waters are scarce, so that of necessity those things being wanting wherein Bees delight, there must needs bee few, or in some places none at all.

The Eliconde-tree is very tall, and exceeding great, some as big as twelve men can fathome; spreading like an Oak, some of them are hollow, and from the liberal skies, receive such plenty of water, that they are hospitable entertainers of thousands in that thirsty Region. Once have I known three or four thousand remain at one of those trees, and thence receiving all their warry provision. The Negroes climb up with pegs of hard wood (which that softer easily receiveth, the smoothness, not admitting other climbing) and I think that some one tree holds forty run of water.

                        <hi>Pliny</hi> most of all commends that hony which the Bees gather in the Dogg-dayes, almost thirty dayes after the Solstice, for saith he, after the rising of every Starre, especially the greater ones, or the Raine-bow, if showers follow not, and there be a warme dew with the rayes of the Sun, Medicines, not hony are produced, heavenly gifts for the eyes, ulcers, and bowels, which if it be preserved, the Dogge-star being risen, and if by chance it fall out in the same day there be a rising of <hi>Venus,</hi> or <hi>Iupiter,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> there is no such sweetness nor vertue in the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed heavenly Nectar, to keep Mortals from Diseases, though otherwise deadly; but we have little of this in our Country, where the Hony-gathering is then almost finished, but that which is found in the lower parts of the combes, and some little that is not shut up with waxen covers.</p>
                     <p>Hony is hot and dry in the second degree, wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> forbids it such as were Hectical, have a Feaver, or the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and young men; but commends it very much in cold ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and prescribes it to such as had moyst stomacks, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately eating of it, it wonderfully nourisheth, and causeth both a good colour and constitution.</p>
                     <p>Hony with age or long boyling becomes bitter; it gives life to Wine when it is flat, Flowers, Fruites, and all simple and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Medicines by mixture of it are preserved from putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>Hony corrupts by crumbes of Bread, and therefore they that sell hony, are careful lest children passing by dip their bread in it, and so it is transmuted into Ants, or little Creatures like them, if we beleeve <hi>Paracelsus.</hi>

                     <p>For the making of Mead, if the Must, when it is altogether, bee not strong enough to bear an egg, the breadth of two pence above it, then put so much of your course hony into it, as will give it that strength, which is sufficient for ordinary Mead. And afterwards untill night, ever now and then stir it well about the tub: According to the quantity that you will make, so must you add a proportionable measure of hony and water, namely six of water for one. The learned Physitian <hi>Lobel,</hi> requireth this<note place="margin">Mathi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The second morning put to the Must the scum of the hony, stir all together, and stop the tub a little back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When it hath setled an hour or two, draw it out to bee boyled. And when you see the grounds begin to come, stay and let the rest (save the very thick grounds, which cast to your Bees) run into some vessell by it self, which when it is settled, pour out into the boyling vessel through the clean sieve, and east out these grounds also into you garden.</p>
                     <p>This Must being set over a gentle fire, when you see the scum gathered thick all over, and the bubbles at the side, begin to break it, having slacked the fire, to cease the boyling, skim it clean. Then presently make a fresh fire to it: And when you see the second scum ready, having slacked the fire again, take it quickly away; then make to it the third fire, and let it boyl to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99780:104"/>
the wasting of a fourth part, if it bee made of the washing of combs; and to the wasting of one fifth or sixth part, if it be made of clean hony; not ceasing in the mean space to take off the scum as clean as you can. One hours boyling may suffice; but if the Mead bee of clean hony, it may as well bee done in half the time. Instead of twice slacking the fire, you may twice cool the boyling Must with cold Must reserved; or else bee sure that it do boyl all the while onely at one side, and not all over. After all this put in the Spices, <hi>viz.</hi> to a dozen gallons of the skimmed Must, Ginger one ounce, Cynamon half an ounce, Cloves, and Mace <hi>ana</hi> two drams, Pepper, and Grains, <hi>ana</hi> one dram, all gross beaten, the one half of each being sowed in a bag, the other loose, and so let it boyl a quarter of an hour more.</p>
                     <p>The end of boyling is throughly to incorporate the boorn and the hony, and to purge out the dross, which being once done, any longer boyling is unprofitable, as diminishing more the quantity than increasing the strength and goodness of the Hydromel.</p>
                     <p>As soon as it is boyled enough, take it from the fire, and set it a cooling; the next day when it is setled, pour it through a hair sieve, or linnen bag into the tub (reserving still the Lees for the Bees) and there let it stand covered three or four dayes till it work, and let it work two daies. Then draw it through the tapwaze, and run it into a barrel scalded with Bay-leaves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Spice-bag fast at the tap. If there remain much grounds, you may purifie them by boyling and skimming, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but this will never bee so good as the first, and therefore you may put it by it self, or with some remainder of the best, into a small vessel to spend first before it be soure. If the Mead bee not much, you may run it the next day, and let it work in the barrel. Being tunned it will in time bee covered with a mother; which if by jogging the vessel, or by other means it bee broken, the Mead will turn sowre. But so will it make excellent vinegar, and the sooner, if it bee set in the Sun, which the longer you keep, the better it will bee.</p>

Then take the liquor and boyl it a new; and when it doth see the, skim it as long as there remaineth any dross. When it is clear, put it into the fat, as before, and there let it bee cooled. You must then have in readiness a tub of new Ale, or Beer, which as soon as you have emptied, suddenly whel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THere is one kind not half so bigge, as a Hony-Bee, with a bright shining green head and fore-part; she hath longer horns than a Hive-bee, she hath four wings, her neather part is of a light shining Carnation on the out-side, the belly of a greenish shining glistring colour, almost as bright as the shining of a Glo-worm, with a very large long sting (not forked) or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like to a sting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could not force it to enter it into my hand, whether it wil sting I know not; that which is equivalent to the skin is as it were continued without ringles; this Bee is very strong, gathers as the Hive-Bee sandaracha; and breeds in holes of old posts, divers near one another, we may call her the gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Bee.</p>
                     <p>There is another sort of Wild-Bee which is very laborious, she is not so great as a Hive-Bee by a third part, but in shape and making altogether like her, the mouth opens side-ways, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she holds very fast, like pinchers, her hinder leggs are of a tawny colour, the ringles of her hinder part gray, the rest of a blewish black, her fore-part is partly black, and partly gray, she useth to abide (if my memory deceive me not) in Brick-walls, in holes in the morter between the Bricks, many neat one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we may call her the Mortar-Bee.</p>
                     <p>There is another sort not half so great as the former, but grayer, she diggs or mines perpendicularly into stiffe clay ground in High-ways, or Foot-path sides, the earth that she works out, lyes round about her hole like the casting of a Worme, but much siner; after she hath entred three inches right down, she makes traverse holes one under another, sometimes two, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three in breadth, as several cels, or chambers where she breeds her young, which are not Worms at first, but have a perfect shape of a Bee, herein concurring with the Queen-bee, and though she be laborious, and gathers much Bee-bread, yet could I never finde any thing provided before-hand, or laid up in any cell, but all is consumed by the young, of which I have found neer forty belonging to one down-right hole (not come to

This sort of Bee is very Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, living by hundreds, nay thousands near one another, but each in a distinct mansion, we call them the Earth-Bee.</p>

                     <p>There is also a smaller sort of this kind, in nothing differing but in the magnitude, these breed in clay-walls of houses and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>A Waspe is a flying oblong Insect with four wings, of a bright Ash-colour, the two inmost neither half so long, nor so large as the out-most, six yellow dew-clawed feet mixed with Chesnut-colour towards the extremities, two black move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able horns on the head, growing on either side as high as the top of the eyes, the head is black and hairy, the fore-head divided into three yellow spots, with a black stroke down the middle, the jaws yellow without, black at the mouth, the jaws hath not the solidity of a bone, but is like a strong gristle, indented like a Saw, the back is for the most part of a shining black, and the belly also, the neather part is a bright yellow in the scales, but black bars, in the opening of the upper scale, the black in largeth it self towards the middle of the scale; and lastly, she hath a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous spear where with she wil prick often (contrary to the Bee) for it is not barbed.</p>
                     <p>The Waspes Nest is begun of one, not many mother Waspes or breeders as some imagine; the mother Waspes goe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad after they have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

their wings, and therefore after a while stirre not abroad, but order all at home.</p>
                     <p>The Waspes Nest is made for the most part in the ground, (sometimes in the thatch of a house) in a hole begun by a Mouse, or Mole, not very deep, about a foot and a half, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two foot from the entrance, for the manner of their work, making of their combes, breeding and feeding, they doe almost wholly agree with the Hornet and the Bee, for Bees, Hornets,<note place="margin">Scalig. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in Arist, de hist, lib. 5. c. 19.</note> and Waspes are alike in all, as an Asse, Horse, and Oxe, and how Hornets breed. See <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 89.</p>
                     <p>The Waspes Nest is made Oval, some consist of eight combes or stories one beneath another, fastned strongly by many peggs, or pins one to another, about three quarters of an inch distance between combe and combe, the middle combes are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine inches in the Diameter, all round, and the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved with a five or six doubled folding, or watered cover, yet all wrought into one intire peece, consisting of the same matter with their combes, being greenish, russet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The middle of each combe is somewhat Piramidall, bending upwards, and hollower in the inside than the outward part of the combe, and the center hath a very strong pin to fasten it to the next combe, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Waspes combes are plaine on the upper part, but filled and furnished with hexangle cells downwards, the cells are not so deep, nor yet so long as the Bees, and they are not made

straight but asloop, that the young may not so readily fall out as they would if they were directly downwards.</p>
                     <p>The seed is at first almost as small as a Mustard-seed, of a<note place="margin">Arist. de hist.

                     <p>This seed being hatched (for the manner how, see the tenth Chapter) grows a little while by vertue of the seminal power, it sticks at one end, bending towards the middle of the cell, but somewhat erected (or rather dejected, for the head is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) that it may receive food, and when it fills the breadth of the cell, it grows loose, and falls (or to speak properly ascend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>At first, after the seed is hatched, it is oval towards the head, near to the tail there is a blackish spot; It will contract it self almost round, sometimes as a Caterpiller, when it moves, as if it would go, for indeed the worm makes no progressive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>If you break the worm, in the body is a thick watteish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with a harder substance, like a black list in the middle of it, and that from end to end.</p>
                     <p>The transmutation begins to bee first visible in the superior part, and the eyes are first discerned, and the incision between
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99780:108"/>
the head and the shoulders, which yet as it grows more perfect, becomes smaller, the middle incision is scarcely visible, when the eyes may bee seen, then the legs, and the horns begin to bee framed, and the wings are last finished. When they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, they thrust up the covers over their heads which hang at their backs until they come forth.</p>
                     <p>They excern an excrement while they feed, which is contained under them in the bottome of the cells, but assoon as the young cut their way forth, the older Waspes carry it out of the neast.</p>
                     <p>The young Waspes (though the combes bee taken out of their nensts) that are shut up (not the other, for they must bee fed, or they will dye in three or four dayes) will come to life, and perfection, although slowly, because of the small heat; but for above three weeks I have had them in a chamber successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to perfection.</p>
                     <p>They gather no hony, that is, make it, rob they do, but then<note place="margin">Scaliger com. in Arist. de hist. l. 5 c. 19. Arist. in loc. pred.</note> they spend it as fast as they get it, yet <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith mellificant, they begin to breed in the latter end of the Spring, contrary to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who saith, they breed not in the Spring, but Autumn, whereas they miscarry by the end of Autumn.</p>
                     <p>They breed first their own kinde, and by the end of <hi>August,</hi> ordinarily have fledge Drones, which are about the greatness of an old working Wasp, but somewhat longer, whose covers they heighten above the combs when they shut them up, but in cells no greater than the Waspes.</p>
                     <p>The Drones have no sting, they have two testicles, which on crushing are easily discovered, and they are coated with a hard black tunicle, joyned together like a pair of breeches, sharper towards the point, but broader upwards, and at the upper end not coated, but full of a whitish liquor; the testicles are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like, but that they are united together to the young coated Grashoppers whilst they are in the dams belly.</p>
                     <p>The Drones are not of so bright a yellow as the Waspes, and their moveable horns are a great deal longer, yea longer than the mother Wasps horns, which they spread very wide like a fork, but not right forth, widening them by degrees, and towards the tops, bending them side-wayes.</p>
                     <p>Presently after they begin to breed Drones, they breed also mother Waspes, which are twice, nay almost thrice as great as
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99780:108"/>
the Drones, these begin to forsake the neast about a week in <hi>September,</hi> and so daily as they come to perfection, being first made prolifical by the Drones with whom they couple. The Drones continue in the neast, as long as the working Wasps, namely untill the wet, and cold in <hi>October</hi> puts a period to their lives. Whereas the mother Wasps, as soon as they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered, with the Drones flye forth, and shrowd themselves in hollow trees, thatch, or such like places, where they lye in a dead sleep without feeding till <hi>March,</hi> when the first warm weather revivies them, and causeth them to flye abroad, and then they feed, but if after they have been a while abroad, the Spring bee very cold and wet, they then for the most part, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, and dy.</p>
                     <p>For the mother Wasps, they make larger hexangle cells in the lowest combs than for ordinary Wasps, and also inlarge the covers above the combs near a quarter of an inch higher than the comb, the covers and highings are very white like fine white paper.</p>
                     <p>The young Wasps are somewhat gray at first, and after turn to a bright yellow, and the Bees are more white at first, and after turn to a bright brown.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> doubted whether the Wasps lost their stings in<note place="margin">Arist. de hist. Animal. l. 9. c. 65.</note> Winter; while they are in a deep, or dead sleep, they exercise them not, but revive them by a fire, or in your warm hand, and you may experimentally affirm the contrary. That they did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate, <hi>Aristotle;</hi> acknowledgeth, but whether the male and female, both had stings, hee professeth that hee was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
                     <p>Waspes are a kinde of Canibals, for they rob from all, and eat not the Bees provision only, but the Bees themselves, nay they will eat the young Wasps of another neast.</p>
                     <p>Once, Waspes are very strong, and daring creatures, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally near their neast, not fearing to anger, nay to injury the most mighty.

For shape shee is like a Wasp, but differs in colour: All the back wings, and belly, legs, and horns are of a bright Chesnut colour, and some part also below the division in the middle, and then yellow scales, and Chesnut-coloured openings, or bars with spots on either side of every yellow scale, on the upper-side but more Chesnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured on the under-side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Her fore-head is of an iron colour, in the middle of her for-head is a yellow spot like a heart, on either side whereof grows her moveable horns, on the out-side are her eyes oblong, and a little prominent, her face is a yellow square like a plate, her cheeks or jaws are yellow without, and black in the mouth; her jaws are a very bone indented like a saw, more thick toothed, and siner than a Grashoppers, contrary to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> also, who affirm of all Insects, that they have<note place="margin">Arist de hist. animal. l. 4. c. 1.</note> no boniness in any part, whereas a Hornets jaw, and also a great Grashopper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, are a sold bone without, and within of an equal hardness.</p>
                     <p>Hornets have no fangs, their tongue is divided into small fibers: Their breathing is visible, cut off one of their heads, and you shall see (a while) on expulsion out of the neck of a whitish moisture, and then drawn in again, at first very strongly,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99780:109"/>
and then with more weakness, and at last ceasing, yet life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in either part of the divided body above an hour.</p>
                     <p>A Hornets intrals is contracted in the body, but extended, is as long as the body, they have a very large cavitie in the end of the tail, out of the middle of it, the sting is extended and drawn in also as they please, it is not hollow (as some think) that I could discern; near to the tail I found in dissecting a Hornet (and never but once) a white egg as great as a lentill, and just such a one as I have seen in the combs, but never dissecting divers Bees, and Wasps could I finde any, nor yet in Hornets (excepting one) perhaps they are very small (if at all) and quickly grown, and suddenly ejected.</p>
                     <p>Some suppose them to bee bred of a horse: <hi>Cardan</hi> of dead<note place="margin">Cornel. Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal. de occult. Philos. Arist. de hist.

                     <p>They sting dangerously, some creatures deadly, Dr. <hi>Penny</hi> reports, that being at <hi>Peterborough</hi> in a publick street of the<note place="margin">Penni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It is reported by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as a strange and almost incredible thing, of certain Mice in <hi>Persia,</hi> which being dissected, great

                     <p>THe Humble-Bee is of various magnitudes and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, some greater, but shorter than a Hornet; others as little, but rounder and shorter than a Bee. All of them are very hairy, they have two horns, very strong indented jawes, wherewith they hold or bite very hard. Some have their heads cole-black, the upper part of the back yellow, the lower part black, they have four wings, the belly all black. In the nether part first a division or ringle of shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning black without hair, then a ringle of pale yellow hairy, then a ringle of black, and so black to the taile, but thick and full of light gray hairs, that it seemeth gray, shee hath six legs with scabrous feet. They carry their Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread on their legs, as the Hony-Bee, but no wax, as <hi>Scaliger,</hi>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99780:110"/>
combs on their thighs, I am not certain, but beleeve it, for they gather onely on flowers, but the Hornet and Waspe carry it in their mouth.</p>
                     <p>They breed saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> on the ground among stones,<note place="margin">Arist. de hist. Animal. l. 9. c. 67.</note> and have two or three entrances to their neast, but it is not so; but they breed either upon the ground, in the long grass, most commonly in Meadows, and spared layes, or else in a hole in the ground, much deeper than the Wasps: all their neast is covered; nay environed with moss.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> are very brief in the history of them, and therefore very obscure; some imagine the reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was because their nature was well known, but I rather conclude, because they knew little, or nothing of them.<note place="margin">Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The nethermost ringles of the black Humble-Bee, are as black as jeat, clear and shining; nay more transparent, for it will reflect an image, but the many long hairs, except it bee near at hand, nay in your hand, do somewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure it.</p>

                     <p>Their combs are oblong cells as big as Acorns, but not altogether so long, clustering together (one somewhat higher than another, somewhat like a bunch of grapes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, sixteen or eighteen joyning together (and then another like comb lying close, but not fastened to it, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99780:111"/>
so another) of a dark yellow, which (if after they have bred their young) they fill with Bee-bread, and some with hony; their hony is of a bright yellow, very sweet, but not so pleasant as the Bees, having a rank taste (occasionally) from the ground, their combes are not wax (as before) though gathered of the flowers, they are as tough brown paper, but not of so dark a colour, broken, they shew like <hi>Iapan</hi> paper made of Cotton, woolley.</p>

These as other Insects before described, after they have done breeding of Females, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of <hi>August,</hi> breed Drones for the propagation of their kind.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable, that though the cels or pipes wherein they breed are of a like magnitude, yet the Humble-Bees in the same Nest are of various magnitudes, some more than twice as great as others, herein differing from Bees and Waspes, which continued in the same dimensions that they were first Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosed into, only when they are strong and lusty, seeme some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what fuller and plumper, but when they grow old, then they grow lank and wither; whereas the Humble-bees, many of them double their first magnitude.</p>
                     <p>They are very laborious and hardy Creatures, working in such weather when the Bees dare not, and continuing it many weeks, after Hornets and Waspes are laid up, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried.</p>
                     <p>There is another kind of great Humble-Bee, in the fore-part exactly agreeing with the former description, but the neather part is altogether of a shining black, and not so hairy as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it is sharp pointed at the tayl, and hath but one cavity, out of the which cometh a sting, which groweth out of the under part of the tayl, and is forked like a Snakes tongue, having two points forth-right, not barbed like a Bees, so that it stinges more than once; there are two covers on either side of the sting to keep it close and safe, and these are as long as the sting, but bigger, rougher, and spreading on the top, I conceive to hold
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99780:111"/>
the sting in, in the act of generation; there are six partitions or ringles on the neither part, and on the outsides, especially of the fourth and fifth golden coloured hairs.</p>
                     <p>The Humble-Bee first described, astords some special rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not observed by any, and therefore I must return to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

                     <p>In the breast I perceived a little thing to pant, and beat a great while after I severed it from the lower part at the incision, when I after, opened the breast, I found four several parts like several members, but I was not able (my sight being weak) to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish one member from another, but concluded there was a heart, liver, and lungs, all were reddish, but some parts were more red than others.</p>
                     <p>Under the horny tunicle of the eye is a white moysture, and something white likewise, like brains in the middle of the head; her tongue is drawn so close, partly under her neck, and partly into her mouth, that it is scarcely visible, but when she works; being dead, I found it much longer than a Bees, as long as a Barley corn; she hath two fangs, on either side one, the tongue at the root is as great as a small pin, underneath of a black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to the middle, where it is divided into three parts, two shorter on either side, and a longer in the middle, so that it hath a triple tongue; this sort that breed their young within them, are without a sting; on their bellies near the roots of their leggs, are little round reddish creatures, with very long horns, with six leggs, which run very quick and swift, which (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve)
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99780:112"/>
are a kinde of Lice proper to them; their taile stretched out, is very like their mouth, being as it were a complement of clawes meeting in a round, and this is proper to this kinde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a sting, which I therefore call the Claw-tailed Humble-Bee.</p>
                     <p>Those which breed a living creature within them, after a sort produce it egg-fashion, for it is covered with a thin membrane<note place="margin">Arist. de ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat.

                     <p>This grey Humble-Bee in the taile is somewhat broad, and hath two circular horny claws, or pincers not visible, till they bee drawn out, and within them two other shorter but not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>

So one writes of young <hi>Marius,</hi> that by reason of the stoutnesse of his talke and gesture, he obtained to be called the sonne of <hi>Mars,</hi> but when he came to proofe, he gained a new name, and was called the sonne of <hi>Venus.</hi> Thus many in their words appeare gracious, but by their actions are basely effeminate and sickle, wanton and idle.</p>

The Lord will fire this proud heart of yours, and clip off those knotty lusts, but if you belong to him, he will leave a little remainder of hope, that you shall be formed and fashioned anew, not consumed.</p>

But the Humble Bees combes are but rude lumpes, a little hollowed for their owne end and use. To these three sorts may we compare the obedience of most men professing Religion; there is the obedience of the common Protestant,

perhaps somewhat more then a Pagane performes, yet a rude and indigested devotion, heaped up together by law and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. Then there is the obedience of the hypocrite, in many things resembling true devotion, super-fine carriages, but yet on one side only, to man-ward somewhat exact and formall, but to God-ward rudely, carelesse, and negligent. Whatsoever is done is not done with respect to God and conscience of his commandments. Lastly, there is the obedience of the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, arising from a grounded knowledge of the will of God and faith, and from a holy feare and love of God, conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and respectively to approve himselfe to God in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his duties, and it is exactly modelized and squared according to the rule of Gods word.</p>

So that I doe not improperly speake, if I say, they live as much by heate as by meate. And therefore if there be many in a hive, though there be but a tollerable supply of food, they will doe well, but if they have never so much meate, and be not many and numerous, they will miscarry and come to nothing. The communion of Saints puts life into those that have it not, and increaseth it in those in whom it is. The health of the body doth not communicate it selfe to others; it is otherwise in the life of the soule, the life of it makes others to live more, as iron sharpens iron, so one holy man doth another: when two lie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether they keepe one another warme, there is action and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daction, this is a powerfull meanes to get and increase this life.</p>

And what makes the Summer and Winter in the soule, but the absence or presence of Christ? what makes some so vigorous beyond others, but the presence of the Spirit?

Secondly, some say for feare of punishment, those that are idle being enforced, but a feare of starving (the worst of punishments) prompts them forth; for if they be not timely furnished, with a competent provision, they must inevitably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. Thirdly, because it is incompatible to their nature to be idle. They have a naturall propensitie and inclination to their honey-gathering labours. <hi>Tantus amor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hope hales before him, and feare blowes behind him, and both on each side rowe him, but love within like the very soule of obedience, teacheth him a naturall motion.</p>

                        <p>Bees are the most harmlesse and laborious, the most orderly and profitable creatures that the world affords; and yet have more adversaries and enemies then (almost) any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in the enumeration of them in the former booke hath been discovered: and herein are they Emblemes of beleevers, who though they hurt none, profit all; yet are opposed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted by many. Satan (first) like a roaring Lion seeking whom he may devoure, and his Emissaries are still compassing sea and land, endeavouring their destruction. If <hi>Israel</hi> will needs goe out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to serve his God, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will be presently up in armes and pursue after him.
