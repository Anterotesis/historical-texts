            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Generall scope of this Drammaticall Poem, is to set forth (in Tropicall and shadowed collours) the Greatnes, Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, Constancy, Clemency, and other the incomparable Heroical vertues of our late Queene And (on the contrary part) the inueterate malice, Treasons, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations Vnderminings, &amp; continual blody stratagems, of that Purple whore of Roome, to the taking away of our Princes liues, and vtter extirpation of their Kingdomes. Wherein if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the dignity of the Subiect, I haue not giuen it Lustre, and (to vse the Painters rhethorick) doe so faile in my Depthes &amp; Heightnings, that it is not to the life, let this excuse me; that the <hi>Pyramides</hi> vpon whose top the glorious Raigne of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Soueraigne was mounted, stands yet so high, and so sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed into the clouds, that the Art of no pen is able to reach it. The streame of her Vertues is so imme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>surable, that the farther they are waded into, the farther is it to the bottom.</p>
            <p>In sayling vpon which two contrary Seas, you may obserue, on how direct a line I haue steered my course: for of such a scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling are my words set downe, that neither the one party speakes too much, nor the other (in opposition) too little in their owne defence.</p>
            <p>And whereas I may, (by some more curions in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nsure, then sound in iudgement) be Critically taxed, that I falsifie the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of time, and set not down Occurrents, according to their true succession, let such (that are so nice of stomach) know, that I write as a Poet, not as an Historian, and that these two doe not

liue vnder one law. How true Fortunes dyall hath gone whose Players (like so many clocks, haue struck my lines, and told the world how I haue spent my houres) I am not certaine, because mine eare stood not within reach of their Larums. But of this my knowledge cannot faile, that in such Consorts, many of the Instruments are for the most partout of tune, And no maruaile; for let the Poet set the note of his Nombers, euen to <hi>Apolloes</hi> owne Lyre, the Player will haue his owne Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chets, and sing false notes, in dispite of all the rules of Musick. It fares with these two, as it does with good stuffe and a badde Tayler: It is not mard in the wearing, but in the cutting out. The labours therfore of Writers are as vnhappie as the children of a bewtifull woman, being spoyld by ill nurses, within a month after they come into the world. What a number of throwes doe we endure eare we be deliuered? and yet euen then (tho that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly issue of our braine be neuer so faire and so well lymd,) is it made lame by the bad handling of them to whome it is put to learne to goe: if this of mine bee made a cripple by such meanes, yet dispise him not for that deformity which stuck not vpon him at his birth; but fell vpon him by mis-fortune, and in recompence of such favour, you shall (if your Patience can suffer so long) heare now how himselfe can speake.</p>

               <l>You know that all the springs in Fairie land</l>
               <l>Ran once to one head: from that head, to vs:</l>
               <l>The mountaine and the valley paid vs fruit;</l>
               <l>The field her corne, the countrey felt no heat</l>
               <l>But from our fires: Plenty still spread our boards,</l>
               <l>And Charitie tooke away. We stept not forth</l>
               <l>But with a god-like adoration</l>
               <l>All knees bowed low vnto vs: why was this?</l>
               <l>Why were our gardens <hi>Eden?</hi> why our bowers</l>
               <l>Built like to those in <hi>Paradise?</hi> I shall tell you,</l>
               <l>It was because the Law most mysticall,</l>
               <l>Was not made common: therefore was not vile;</l>
               <l>It was because in the great Prophets <hi>Phanes</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And hallowed Temples, we were <hi>Choristers:</hi>

               <l>Mens soules at yonder hauen: or (beeing shipwrackt)</l>
               <l>Strong lines forth cast we, suffering none to sinke</l>
               <l>To that <hi>Abisse,</hi> which some hold bottomlesse.</l>
               <l>But now our very graues</l>

               <l>Slept on the cold hard pillowes of the earth,</l>
               <l>Are emptied now, and chang'd to drinking roomes,</l>

            <sp>
               <speaker>1. Card.</speaker>
               <l>This must be done:</l>
               <l>This shall be done: They hunted vs like wolues,</l>
               <l>Out of their Fairie forrests, whipt vs away</l>
               <l>(As vagabonds) mockt vs, and said our fall</l>
               <l>Could not be dangerous, because we bore</l>
               <l>Our gods vpon our backes: now must we whip them,</l>
