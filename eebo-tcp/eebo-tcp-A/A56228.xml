            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> (which is repeated 1 Chron. 16.22.) <hi>Touch not mine Anoynted, and do my Prophets no harm</hi>; hath not had the least violence offered it, both in <hi>Presse</hi> and <hi>Pulpit,</hi> to cry up the <hi>absolute irresistable Prerogative of Kings</hi> in all their exorbitant proceedings; and beat down the <hi>just liberties of the Subject,</hi> without the least defensive opposition; when as this text, in real verity, is rather a direct precept given to Kings themselves, not to oppresse or injure their faithful subjects, then an injunction given to subjects, not to defend themselves against the oppressive destructive wars, and projects of their Princes. In which regard it wil be no <hi>unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> nor <hi>ungratefull</hi> worke, to cleare this text from all false Glosses, and restore it to its proper construction.</p>
            <p>In former ages when popery domineered, the <hi>popish Clergy</hi> grounded their <hi>pretended exemption from all temporall jurisdiction on this Scripture</hi>; suggesting, <hi>that they onely, at least principally were Gods Anointed here intended; and therefore ought not be touched nor apprehended by Kings or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Iudges for any crimes.</hi> But this false Glosse being long since exploded, many <hi>Court Divines,</hi> not so much to <hi>secure</hi> as <hi>flatter</hi> Kings, have applyed it primarily unto <hi>Kings,</hi> and secundarily to <hi>Priests,</hi> as meant of them alone, excluding their faithfull Subjects out of its protection and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits; when as the text is meant of none else but they in general and of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> with <hi>their families</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To put this out of question: you must first observe, that this Psalm from the 5 verse to the end, is meerely historicall. The 7 first verses of it are but a gratulatory preamble (interlaced with some exhortations) to the subsequent historicall narration; as he that reads them advisedly will at first acknowledge: In the 8, 9, 10, &amp; 11. verses, the Psalmist begins his history, with the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God made to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the oath which he sware to</hi> Isaac; <hi>and confirmed the same unto</hi> Jacob <hi>for a law, and to</hi> Israel <hi>for an everlasting testament: saying, unto thee will I give the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the lot of your inheritance.</hi> In the 12, 13, 14, &amp; 15. verses, he expresseth the special care and protection of God over <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and their several families after his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant thus made unto them, in these words: <hi>When they</hi> (to wit, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with their families) <hi>were but a few men in number, yea very few, and strangers in it: When they went from one Nation to another, from one Kingdom to another people</hi> (which cannot possibly be expounded of Kings and Priests, but onely of those Patriarcks) <hi>He suffered no man to doe them wrong, but reproved even Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not mine Anoynted, and doe my Prophets no harme.</hi> Then in the very next verse to the end of the Psalm, he proceeds with the story of the <hi>famine in Egypt,</hi> and of <hi>Iosephs sending thither beforehand by God, &amp;c.</hi> So that by the expresse words and series of the story in this Psalm, these persons of whom God said, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no harme,</hi> were <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and their families, (as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> with sundry other Expositers of this Psalm conclude;) who in truth were neither Kings nor Priests by office, but onely Gods peculiar people and servants: of whom he took special care. Whence I thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in the first place.</p>
            <p>These words, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, &amp;c.</hi> were originally spoken and intended only of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, and their families,</hi> who were neither actual Kings nor Priests; &amp; they were meant of them, not as they were Kings or Priests, but only as they were the servants
<pb facs="tcp:36436:2"/>
and chosen people of God; as is evident by the 6 verse of this Psalm, <hi>O ye seed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>his SERVANT, ye children of</hi> Jacob <hi>his CHOSEN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore they are to be so interpreted; and to be applyed not to Kings and Priests, as they are such; but only to the faithful servants and chosen people of God, though, and as subjects.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Consider to whom these words were spoken; not to <hi>Subjects,</hi> but to <hi>Kings</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
