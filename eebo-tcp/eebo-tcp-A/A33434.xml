         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Newton</hi> the Knight imployed to fetch him, delivered his message on horseback, which is now remembred, and taken for an high neglect; besides, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the carriage and words of the Knight were not very pleasing.

for an intolerable affront, but the King fearfull of his servant, cooles and asswages the heat; he commands the Knight to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, and offer up his Dagger to the Idol, which (though unwillingly) was done.</p>
            <p>This would not take off his edge: The Prince who yeilds once to a Rebell, shall finde heaps of requests, and must deny no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The <hi>King</hi> had given away his <hi>Knights</hi> Dagger: now nothing will content <hi>Tyler</hi> but the <hi>Kings</hi> Sword, with which the <hi>Militia</hi> or power of Armes impliedly was sought.

They roare out, our <hi>Captaine Generall</hi> is slaine treacherously, let us stand to it, and revenge his precious bloud, or die with him: I cannot passe this place without some little wonder; had these Ruffians (with whom Kings hedged about by holy Scripture, and Lawes hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, are neither divine nor sacred) beene asked whether <hi>Tyler</hi> the Idol, of their own clay and hands, might have been tryed, touched or struck, according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting this blow here: let his tyrannies, his exorbitances have beene what they would, they would have answer'd no doubt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62665:39"/>
in the negative: Though <hi>Richard</hi> might have been struck thorough and thorough, <hi>Tyler</hi> who had usurped his power, must have been sacred, it must have been treason to touch him: <hi>Phocas</hi> must not be hurt: in <hi>Tylers</hi> case <hi>Straw</hi> would allow the old texts againe: The powers were to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

            <p>He tells them if <hi>Liberty</hi> be their onely aim, as hitherto they have pretended, they may assure themselves of it, and that it is an extreme folly to seek to make that our owne with the breach of Faith, of Lawes, with impieties, violating God and Man, which we may come by fairely. But they trod not the path to <hi>Liberty,</hi> That where every man commands, no man can be free; the <hi>Liberty</hi> too they fancy cannot be had, the world cannot subsist without Order and Subjection, men cannot be freed from Lawes: If they were, there could be no society, no civility any where, Men must be shunned as much as Wolves or Beares, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and bloud-shed would over-run the world, the spoyler must feare the next

            <p>He addes, if there can be any just cause of Sedition, yet is the Sedition unjust which outlasts it, which continues, when the cause is yeilded to, and taken away; that if his Prerogative has beene sometimes grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, his tax's heavy, and any of those they call evill Counsellours faulty, they ought to remember, in their first risings, and all along in all their <hi>Oathes,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants</hi> they swore continually not to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Monarchy,</hi> nor <hi>touch the Rights of his free Crowne.</hi> You ought to remember your own Remonstrances; you once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that you acknowledged the Maxime of the Law, <hi>The King can dos no wrong; If any ill be committed in matters of State, the Councellors; if in matters of Law, the Iudges must answer for it</hi>—My person was not to be violated.

and draines his ground, repaires the bankes, but does not usurp upon the streame, does not inhance within the Channell. And farther that quarrels to his Government and Lawes are unreasonable from those, who out of ambition arme to overthrow both, that reformation is not the worke of Sedition, which ever disorders what is well setled.

This Charter was granted about the time the <hi>Clownes</hi> of <hi>Essex</hi> disbanded, and received theirs, it was brought into <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire</hi> to Saint <hi>Albanes</hi> by <hi>Wallingford</hi> one of the Towne; * Friday sayes <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi> the day of tribulation, <note place="margin">Illucescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te die Venerls.</note>

            <p>The <hi>Clownes</hi> throw down their Armes at the <hi>Kings</hi> feet, sue for mercy, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up their chiefs; the principall of which Priest <hi>Straw</hi> was after drawne from his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding holes, and laid hold of by the Kings Officers.

            <p>The Commons of <hi>Kent</hi> now scatter and dissolve, the heads of the Archbishop, Lord <hi>Prior,</hi> and the rest, are taken down from the bridge, and the Idols advanced there; That <hi>Baal</hi> should now be taken in an old house is an errour of the Knights; <hi>Baal</hi>

            <p>The <hi>King</hi> now rides to <hi>Westminster</hi> where he gives God thankes for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and presents his offering to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in her Chappell of the Piew, next he visits the Princesse mother in the Tower Royall, called the Queenes War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe, and bids her rejoyce, for (sayes he) this day I have recovered mine heritage, the Realme of <hi>England</hi> near lost, the Lords <note place="margin">Froiss.</note> returne to their owne houses.

            <p>One, who would be wiser than the rest, perswades them not to attempt things rashly, and giddily, without authority, he tells them that <hi>Wat Tyler, Protectour and Captaine Generall</hi> of the <hi>Clownes</hi> was near, that the <hi>Protectour,</hi> was a righter of wrongs raised, and inspired by providence to redeeme the faithfull <hi>Commons</hi> from <note place="margin">Wals.

He concludes, let us returne home, and in the puissance of <hi>Wat,</hi> and our selves, force the <hi>Abbot</hi> to reason; If he deny our requests, we will awe hm with burning and demolishing the Monastery, with killing the Monkes, we will threaten not to leave one stone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another; Others conceive it more safe to petition the <hi>King</hi> (who might be spoken with by every man, and durst refuse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) for his Letters under the Privy Seale, commanding the <hi>Abbot,</hi> to restore to the Towns-men the rights, and Liberties which their ancestours injoyed in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, as if the English Church had beene lately indowed, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries founded, their Royalties, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Priviledges granted by the <hi>Norman</hi> Princes, than which nothing could be more false.

            <p>The gracious <hi>Captaine Generall</hi> was yet more kind; he vowes, if it be convenient, to assist them in his owne person.
