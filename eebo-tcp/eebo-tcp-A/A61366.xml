            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Humble Address to Your Lordship, whose Eminent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, though they may be more Illustrious in that High Sphere wherein You are worthily placed, yet were they ever highly conspicuous, and You have been long since in the eye of the World what You are now in the Court of Honour.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAving for some years past wholly employed my self in the diligent searching into the Histories of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I found by experience, that the words of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Roman</hi> Decades were most true, where he writeth, That the Beginnings of Nations, and the times next succeeding those Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, as yielding least pleasure both to Writer and Reader, were generally neglected, and Men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally hastned to those Ages, which being not so far removed, yielded a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santer prospect, and seemed more closely to concern their knowledge. For how few are there who have taken the pains faithfully to collect, and in a distinct Method to order rightly the scattered Records of Ancient <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> which are only here and there to be pickt out of divers Authors, and not to be found, much less well disposed with an ordinary diligence or superficial enquiry? Most of our Modern Chronicles content themselves with beginning from the Conquest, few go beyond it, as if with the general sort of Readers they were impatient until they came to the Battels of <hi>Cressy</hi> and <hi>Agencourt,</hi> the differences of the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the Insurrections in <hi>Kent,</hi> or something of that nature, which being of a later Date, hath yet left an uncertain sound in our ears, and is expected to be sett off with no small flourishes or vulgar elocution. And indeed the design of such Writers is not to be discommended, who following the general stream of Mankind consult their own advantages; For in subjects of
<pb facs="tcp:58825:4"/>
this nature, as the Antiquity and Original of Kingdoms, the question of the Poet may perhaps be easily asked, and as soon resolved in the same verse, <hi>Quis legit haec? nemo hercule nemo, Vel duo, vel nemo.</hi> Few there are who will trouble their heads to enquire by what means their first An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors possest themselves of those pleasant Lands, in the fruitfulness whereof they at present rejoyce, but content themselves to derive their knowledg as high as their own Families only, and discourse the Chronicles to the Beginning of their Pedigrees, as if there Nature and the World was at a stop, and all knowledg beyond that was mere <hi>Chaos</hi> and Confusion; But notwithstanding whatever might be objected of this like nature against this present undertaking, I have not been discouraged in going through with it; For if the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who had the best Historians in the World, were nevertheless called Children by their own Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, because they knew not, or neglected their own Original; will it not be a shame for us also to be ignorant in the Antiquites of our own Nation, a Nation great in its Infancy, and like <hi>Hercules</hi> (one of its first Discoverers) deserving an History even in its Cradle?</p>
            <p>But because there have been some who have already handled this Subject, and that not without great Commendation, I shall not insist farther upon the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the design in general, but only inform the Reader in short what he is to expect in this present work, which hath not been already fully discussed by others, lest perhaps it may be thought, that I have only trod in the steps of other men, and like those idle Imitators, whom <hi>Horace</hi> calls a servile sort of Cattel, have only jog'd on in the long beaten road of former Antiquities.</p>
            <p>I confess, I might with greater security, and much more ease in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of the Antiquities of the <hi>British</hi> Nation have followed Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> out of whom merely to collect hath been counted praise-worthy, and whom to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate is esteemed not only safe, but honourable. As his Learning was great, so is his Authority, and his very Name carrieth a certain veneration along with it, so that it may be questioned, whether his Antiquities add more lustre to him, or he to his Antiquities. His opinions have been long received, and therefore sit deep in the mind, and by some it is thought a piece of weakness only to dissent from him; however it be, I have chose rather to follow that which seems to the best of my judgment to be Truth, though never so naked and destitute of all advantages, then by taking in with the Common opinion, to run on further in a plausible Mistake, and to help to guild deeper what to me appeareth at best but a glorious Errour. Neither can the followers of Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> be displeased with me, if they will but inmate his Candour and Ingenuity, whose performances they so worthily admire; who, when he had treated of this Subject, concludes in these words, which may serve for an Apology for me also:</p>
            <p>Thus you have (<hi>saith he</hi>) as touching the Original and Name of <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> 
               <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> mine Error or Conjecture, whether you will, which if it
<pb facs="tcp:58825:4"/>
swerve from the truth, I wish it were by the truth it self reformed. In this intricate and obscure study of Antiquity, it is thought praise-worthy somewhat to erre; and remember we should withal, that such things as at the first sight being slightly thought upon are deemed false, after a better review, and further consideration, oftentimes seem true. Now, if any man should summon me to appear before the Tribunal of <hi>Verity,</hi> I have no other answer at all to make; And as for our Country-men the <hi>Britains,</hi> such as be of the Learneder sort, I do most earnestly beseech and desire them to employ all their labour, industry, wit, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the searching out hereof, so long, until at last the Truth with her own clear bright beams may scatter and dissolve all mists of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But I do not arrogate to my self the first discovery of these Antiquities, neither would I, that the credit of so fair an hypothesis should depend upon so weak an Authority. <hi>Bochartus,</hi> a learned <hi>Frenchman</hi> in this last Age, having treated of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Voyages through the whole World, and out of their Language plainly and easily derived the Names of most Countries and Places especially remarkable, at last bringeth them even to <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers their Trade throughout all these Western Coasts. But as he is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in his own Native Country, which he would chiefly seem to illustrate; so have I been in mine, making use of the same method in laying open the Original and Commerce of the Primitive Inhabitants of this Island, as he hath done largely of <hi>Gaul;</hi> For when I considered what <hi>Leland</hi> writeth of the <hi>British</hi> or <hi>Welch</hi> Language, namely, that the main body of it consisteth of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> words, I began to collect with my self, how it should come to pass that the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> could have any Commerce with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who where never known to send out Colonies, and of all People in the World weremost fond of their own Country; Certainly I concluded, this could proceed from no other root but the Commerce of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> with this Nation, who using the same Language with the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> even in those Primitive times were great Traders and skilful Mariners, and sent out their Colonies through the World; and this Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> himself toucheth on, where he gives the derivation of the <hi>British Caer Eske,</hi> now <hi>Exeter. For</hi> Caer, <hi>to tell you</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> 
               <hi>once for all</hi> (saith he) <hi>with our</hi> Britains <hi>is as much to say, as a</hi> City, <hi>whereupon they use to name</hi> Jerusalem, Caer Salem, Lutetia <hi>or</hi> Paris, Caer Paris, Rome, Caer Russaine. <hi>Thus</hi> Carthage <hi>in the</hi> Punick <hi>tongue was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as</hi> Solinus <hi>witnesseth,</hi> Cartheia, <hi>that is, the</hi> New City. <hi>I have heard likewise that</hi> Caer <hi>in the</hi> Syriack <hi>tongue signified a</hi> City. <hi>Now seeing that the</hi> Syrians, <hi>as all men confess, peopled the whole World with their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, it may seem probable that they left their Tongue also to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, as the Mother of all future Languages.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58825:5"/>
            <p>What can be more plain than this? and yet this is but one example of ten thousand; but I hope that in the following discourse I have plainly made out, that not only the Name of <hi>Britain</hi> it self, but of most places therein of Ancient denomination are purely derived from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, and that the Language it self for the most part, as well as the Customes, Religions, Idols, Offices, Dignities, of the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> are all clearly <hi>Phoenician,</hi> as likewise their Instruments of War, as Slings, and other Weapons, their Sithed Chariots, and their different Names, and several Distinctions; Out of the same Tongue I have illustrated several Monuments of Antiquity sound out and still remaining in <hi>Britain,</hi> which can no other waies be interpreted, than in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, where they have a plain, easie, and undeniable signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And as to that Concordance which was between the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> in point of Language and some other Customes, I have shewn that it proceeded not from hence, that they were the same People, but from their joynt Commerce with the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and that in most probability <hi>Britain</hi> was first planted by a <hi>German</hi> Nation, and not by the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> in his Learned Commentary upon <hi>Antonine's Itinerary,</hi> treating of <hi>Rutupis</hi> now <hi>Richborough,</hi> asks the question how it came to pass, if the Modern derivation of that place be true, namely, from the <hi>Welch Rhyd Tufith,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> conjectures, that on the Coast of <hi>Barbary</hi> there should be a Town and Harbour of the very same name mentioned by <hi>Pliny. Pudet,</hi> saith he, à Britannis Africae <hi>nomen mutuari,</hi> It is a shame to derive the name of a place in <hi>Africa</hi> from <hi>Britain;</hi> But they who shall seriously read and consider, that not only <hi>Rhutupis,</hi> but many other places in <hi>Britain</hi> have the same Names with others in <hi>Africa,</hi> and that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> from <hi>Africa</hi> traded into <hi>Britain,</hi> they will unquestionably conclude, that to derive, on the other hand, Names in <hi>Britain</hi> from those in <hi>Africa,</hi> is not only rational but necessary, and that it is impossible that such vast and constant similitude could happen by chance or blind fortune; For it ever was, and will be a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in the World, and is constantly used in all our Colonies at this day, that places receive their Names according to the resemblance they have with other places of those Countries from which the Planters proceeded.</p>
            <p>It is not to be expected, that I should have comprehended every thing that might have been produced to the perfection of these Antiquities; It is sufficient if there be enough to evidence the truth of them, and if any thing be omitted through want of Intelligence, or through over-hastiness neglected, as who is able at once to make a total discovery, It will be a spur for others, to make a further progress with greater felicity.</p>
            <p>As for the other Antiquities, namely of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> though at first sight they may not seem proper for a Treatise of <hi>Britain,</hi> and I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to some to have neglected the Counsel of <hi>Pliny,</hi> who adviseth to have
<pb facs="tcp:58825:5"/>
often recourse to the Title of ones Book, yet they that shall consider that few things are therein touched, which concern not either, Monuments, Altars, Gods and Customes, used by those Nations in <hi>Britain,</hi> and many other things which serve for the explication of divers Usages in this Island, though there for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity sake omitted, will charitably conclude that they also were not written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some consideration. This I think may be sufficient to advise the Reader before-hand concerning the Method and design of these Antiquities. It will be needless to add, that the Map of the Ancient World was designed only at one view to set before the eye the Progress of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and the Names of Countries as by them called, and not to shew the exactness of Longitude or Latitude, much less to represent Cities or Nations as they are known by their Names at this day.</p>
            <p>As for the Historical part, I have only this to say, that it is faithfully col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the most approved Authors, and digested into the plainest and easiest Method; Neither have I been so Nice as to refuse all before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> time, for seeing that the Names of our <hi>Celtick</hi> Kings, <hi>Samothes, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> &amp;c. are mentioned, not by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> only, but other learned Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I thought that the story of them was not to be neglected, if it were only to inform the World of the cheat and forgery of <hi>Annius</hi> in his pretended <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosus;</hi> As for <hi>Brute</hi> and his Successours, seeing their Names are made use of in Laws and Statutes of this Realm, in Titles relating to the Crown since the Conquest, and seeing upon the <hi>Trojan</hi> pretence in general descents of Ancestry, and other Exploits, are yet continued, and will not easily be quitted, I have taken the pains to rehearse them also. Some perhaps will censure me for needless curiosity in observing Chronology through the fabulous part of this Work, scarce allowing the recital, much less the nice timeing of their Actions to be tolerable; But seeing it is necessary we should know the story of <hi>Brute</hi> and other Kings, for the reasons above-mentioned, so likewise it is very convenient, that the Ages in which they are supposed to have lived should be marked out with certain stops and periods; For in continued discourses, not distinguished by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive and distinct Calculations, the head is apt after reading to confound the whole, and by strange Parachronisms to run one story into another, and misplace the actions of Ages very absurdly; For what though the History of the <hi>British</hi> Kings were allowed a fable, yet how ridiculous does it appear to hear the Tale of <hi>Brute</hi> told in the daies of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> or to see K. <hi>Arthur</hi> placed above <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar?</hi> It is fitting in Fables, as well as true Relations, to understand their times, which make to the detecting of deceit, as well as the declaring of truth.</p>
            <p>In the manner of Composing I have not used any jingling of words and Phrases in ostentation of writing, but have fitted my words to the matter, and not the matter to them, having an eye more to the benefit of the Reader, than his extravagant delight. It is the miserable fate of an History to be turned
<pb facs="tcp:58825:6"/>
into Romance, for it never reacheth to the delight of the one, and loses the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the other. It is an easie matter to frame the Idea's of Princes as it best pleaseth ones self, or best suiteth the present Humour, and then to descant politickly on their Actions, and praise or censure their proceedings; I have all along followed the footsteps of my Authors, and though I have not burthened the Margent with every quotation of them, yet they who shall examine into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of the whole shall find, that throughout I have carefully observed their very words and sense, and kept my self close to their meaning; And though in some places the History may seem short and abrupt, it is the fault of Time, which hath eaten in and left unsightly gaps in the body of it; for I have not Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized any thing worth the relating, but endeavoured to draw the lines of Ages so far distant after the largest proportions I could possible. In writing the Lives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours that possest this Island, I have purposely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the relating of their forraign Actions, as not desiring to write an History of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Britain,</hi> and where there is little to be found of the particular proceedings, I have studiously sought for some Monument or Inscription whereon his Name hath been preserved among us, and such found, have faithfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted. I will not omit that I have taken notice all along of the foundations of Cities, Castels, &amp;c. and the reasons of their Names, and times of their build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and such other things remarkable, so that along with the History you will meet with the most memorable Antiquities of the whole Nation. What pains and study it hath cost me in the compiling I will not stand to commemorate; I shall count my Labours sufficiently recompenced, if it be received with as much Candour, as it was written with sincere endeavour for the use and benefit of my Country. And I doubt not but my mistakes will be pardoned, and the smaller faults passed over both in writing and printing, especially when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that I fall into the hands of the most Ingenuous part of the Nation, the Nobility and Gentry, for whose use it was principally intended.</p>

                  <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> the most Renowned Island of the whole World, was called by the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi>

It was alwaies esteemed a very considerable part of the World, even in the height of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and much celebrated in the Writings and Monuments of the <hi>Graecians;</hi> and, as if the Genius of this Nation did prompt the Inhabitants, and insensibly lead them to Trade and Traffick, we find that besides that, the Island received its name from it,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58825:7"/>
insomuch, that, in the first Ages, it was frequented by the Ablest Merchants, and Skilfullest Marriners, the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> who carefully, and studiously concealed this Treasure from the World, being exceeding jealous, least the source and head of their Trade being discovered, the busie <hi>Graecians</hi> might put in for sharers; And least the fruitfulness of the Soyl, the pleasant and delightful scituation of the Country, might tempt those of their own Nation to neglect their Barren Soyl, and betake themselves to this more temperate and blessed Clymate; we read, that, by a publick Edict of those States, care was taken to prevent it, yea, all possible means used too, to stop the current which was visibly turning that way.</p>
               <p>In this condition <hi>BRITAIN</hi> continued during the time the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, sending forth its Commodities to the Straights, and to all the Mediterranean Seas, as likewise thorough <hi>Gaul,</hi> by Land, to <hi>Narbo,</hi> where the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> held a publick Mart.</p>
               <p>About the declining of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> State, the <hi>Graecians</hi> began to Trade into these parts, and they, who before had only heard of the <hi>Bratanacks,</hi> which in the same sence they called <hi>Cassiterides,</hi> or the <hi>Tynn Islands;</hi> now learnt the way to them, and conformed themselves to the Name the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had given them, calling them first the <hi>Bretanick</hi> Islands, afterwards <hi>Britanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the encrease of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and the fall of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Trading began to decrease, and the <hi>Graecians,</hi> for fear of that powerful State, discontinued their Voyages into the Western Seas. And it may be supposed, that <hi>Britain</hi> lay idle during the space of a hundred and seventy years, till <hi>Julius Caesar's</hi> arrival.</p>
               <p>From this Time begins Mr. <hi>Cambden's</hi> Antiquity of this <hi>Nation,</hi> and the first Discovery of it, not admitting its Name to be known much earlier in the World; Nevertheless I question not, but they that shall read the ensuing Chapters, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Voyages into these parts, will be better satisfied touching the great trade of <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> exported from them. If the love of my Country has not blinded me, it seems far more evident that it received its Name from its Trade (for which in all Ages it has been renowned) than from any barbarous Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of painting, or dying their Bodies, wherewith the Adherents to that opinion have too severely, and with too many Circumstances, branded the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>In evidencing this Opinion, I have not made use of any of the <hi>British</hi> Histories, because their credit in the World is but small, but have grounded it upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, some of which, as <hi>Timagenes, Polybius,</hi> and <hi>Festus Avienus,</hi> had made great Enquiries into <hi>Phoenician</hi> Records, and for that <note place="margin">Timagenes. Polybius. Festus Avic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> reason were more able than others, to give a true account of the Trade of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion relating to <hi>Britain.</hi> So that for the present, granting the <hi>Bretannick</hi> Islands to be so well known to the Ancient World, it will not seem fabulous, that <hi>Orpheus,</hi> but more truly <hi>Onomacritus</hi> called them of old, The Seat of <hi>Queen CERES;</hi> as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Onomacritus.</note> they were stiled, <hi>The Granary of the Western World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither will it seem Ridiculous what Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> mentions, namely, <hi>That they</hi>

                  <hi>were supposed to be the fortunate Islands so much celebrated by the Ancient Poets, where the</hi> ELYSIAN FIELDS, <hi>and</hi> HELL <hi>it self might be placed.</hi> Let us consider, that upon the first discovery of them by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> they were to the then known World, just as the <hi>West Indies</hi> were at first to Europe, and that by the small progress the World had made, so early, in the art of Navigation, the Voyage to them was as long, and as difficult. Add to this, the many Stories the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> might relate to them, especially to the credulous <hi>Greeks,</hi> and in a fabulous Age, when the digging in Mines might be interpreted, <hi>A discent into Hell;</hi> and <hi>Chule,</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, signifying <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Obscurity,</hi> might be called, <hi>The Kingdom of Darkness.</hi> No doubt on the other side; The pleasant scituation of <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> the Remoteness of it from the busie and careful World, the flowry Vallies curiously deck'd by Nature, watered by Rivers, and defended by Woods, Hills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To pass over many other advantages wherewith this Island is blessed above other Nations, when they came to be related, by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> to that Nation, it created in them the <hi>Idaea's</hi> of another World, and might be the ground-work of those <hi>Elysian Fields,</hi> and <hi>Places of Rest,</hi> to which Vertuous Souls were carried after their departure out of a temporal Being.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:58825:7"/>
               <p>This was the Opinion of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> concerning <hi>BRITAIN</hi> in those daies, when they had the knowledge of it by Hear-say only, from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> which doth evidently appear, if we consider, that upon the Real discovery of it by them, and their better Acquaintance in these parts, they left not off to hunt after those Imaginary places, still believing (according to the Ancient Tradition) that they were here only to be found. And this gave occasion to the Story of <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Tzetzes,</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> of no small Repute and Credit with M. <hi>Cambden;</hi> namely, <note place="margin">Isacius Tzet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</note> 
                  <hi>That</hi> JULIUS CAESAR <hi>was carryed from</hi> Gallia <hi>into I know not what</hi> Western Islands, <hi>where the pleasantness of the place invited him to tarry, had he not been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to depart by the Inhabitants, and so forceibly carried back by the same Spirits that conveighed him thither.</hi> And, although this be but a Fable, yet it shews the Opinion of those Times, and the strong belief they had, that here were the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Islands,</hi> and the <hi>Elysian Fields.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Famous Island is in Length, from <hi>Dunsby-Heate,</hi> the farthest Promontory in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> DC and odd miles, and in Breadth, from <hi>Dover</hi> to the Point of <hi>Belirium,</hi> or the Lands-end, CCLXXX, or as some reckon it, from the <hi>Lyzazd</hi> Point in <hi>Cornwal</hi> (which lyeth on the Latitude of 50 degrees, and 6 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes) to the <hi>Straythy-head</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> (in the Latitude of 60 degrees, and 30 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes) it extends in Length DCXXIV Miles, and from the Lands-end in <hi>Cornwal</hi> (scituated in 14 degrees, and 37 minutes of Longitude) unto the Island <hi>Tennet</hi> in the East of <hi>Kent</hi> (lying in 22 degrees, and 30 minutes) it is in Breadth CCCXL Miles.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> who measures it according to its Compass, makes, from the Point <note place="margin">Camb. <hi>Brit.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Tarvisium</hi> to the Cape <hi>Belirium</hi> DCCCXII miles, from <hi>Belirium</hi> to the Fore-land of <hi>Kent</hi> CCCXX miles, from the Fore-land to <hi>Tarvisium</hi> DCCIV miles. But in his Account, he allows for the turnings and windings of the Shoars, so that in Compass it is MDCCC XXXVI miles, almost two hundred less than what <hi>Caesar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in his daies.</p>
               <p>For its Greatness it was esteemed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> at the first discovery of it, to be a <hi>NEW WORLD,</hi> and if we curiously look upon the Form of it, as all <hi>Europe</hi> represents a great Dragon, so this Island hath some resemblance of a huge Snake, whose Head, with a wide and gaping Mouth, looks towards <hi>Norway,</hi> and part of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and his Tail to the West.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ptolemy</hi> describes it under five Parallels, whereof the first is the sixteenth from <note place="margin">Ptolemy <hi>Geog.</hi>
                  </note> the AEquator, in the middle of which Parallel the most Southerly part of it is placed, being 52 degrees from the AEquator, and the most Northerly part of it is in the 62 degrees of Latitude. But <hi>Ptolomy</hi> herein has too much streightned it, and bending the North part of it far more to the East, towards <hi>Germany,</hi> than it should be, he has taken away from its Latitude. Some, to cure this, have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it higher Northward, but gave it no more Latitude than it had before, to remedy which, others have thrust it two degrees more Southwardly.</p>
               <p>The truest Calculation is, That the most Southwardly parts lie in the Latitude of <note place="margin">The truest Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</note> 50 degrees and 6 minutes, in the beginning of the sixteenth Parallel, and eighth Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and the most Northwardly, in 60 degrees 30 minutes, in the six and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Parallel, or thirteenth Clime. So that the longest Day in the South parts will be 16 hours, in the Northern, 18 and a half. Upon the North and South, it pointeth to the Ocean, on the West, it hath <hi>Ireland,</hi> on the East, we may measure its extent by the Continent, for it lieth in the same Latitude with part of <hi>France, Flanders, Zealand, Holland, Lower Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> so that there can be no certain Rule given (as in lesser Kingdoms) of the temperature of the Air, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Soyl, the strength, growth, or proportion of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
               <p>It is now, as it was when the <hi>Romans</hi> first discovered it, that there seems to be many Nations in it differing in the make and proportions of their Bodies. The more Northward we go, the People seem to be sturdier, bigger made, and in their Limbs more resembling the <hi>Germans,</hi> hardy and stout, and enured to Labour and Cold, and to be of the same nature with the <hi>Daues</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> in the latitude of which Kingdoms they lie.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58825:8"/>
               <p>The Southwardly parts contain Men of neater strength, and more compact Limbs, and what they want of the proportion of the others, they make out in their quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and agility, being hardy, and not unweildy, having not less strength, but a better management of it. In a word, they seem to joyn the quick and brisk temper of the <hi>French,</hi> with the staid and more fixed Humour of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and as the People differ in the temperaments of their Bodies, so in this vast Kingdom are many Countries, Cities, Towns, Villages, Colleges and Free-Schools for the promoting of Learning, Hospitals and Alms-houses for the Relief of the Poor and Maimed, not inferiourto any in any other part of the World beside. Divers Languages, Customes, and Usages, which are not contrary one to the other, but by the mixture of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the happy union of this Nation under one Monarch, do meet together in the making up of the best compacted Kingdom in the World.</p>

                     <item>5.

                     <note place="margin">Caesar. Com.</note> 
                     <hi>nipping colds of the Continent.</hi> The Reason is given by <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi> namely, <hi>That it is refreshed by the warmth of the Sea, flowing round about</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Minutius Foe. lix.</note> 
                     <hi>it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Experience teacheth us, that the extremity of cold in this Country is blown off from the Continent, and proceeds not from the North, but Northeast-winds; and as it hath not those Colds in Winter, it is not burnt up with immoderate Heats in Summer. Here are none of those violent Thunders and Lightnings which are so frequent on the Continent, nor do we ever hear of Serenes wherewith those hotter Climates are infested. The heat of the Weather is allayed by gentle Winds, and continual Breezes, and the Earth cooled and nourished with mild and moderate showers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaketh very much of the temperate, and happy scituation of it, for <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> he saies, <hi>There is nothing deficient in it but the</hi> Olive <hi>and the</hi> Vine, <hi>which only grow in hotter Countries.</hi> But they that shall consider it more truly, namely, that there are many places at this day called <hi>Vineyards,</hi> in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> where in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility has been made Wine, will have small cause to complain of the Country in this particular, but will rather attribute it to the cheap and easie importation of that Commodity, and better improvement of the Ground.</p>
                  <p>But it is a great wonder to hear, what one <hi>Brietius</hi> of late hath written concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Brietius.</note> the Temperature of the <hi>Air</hi> in <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> which, because it is the production of his own Brain, and never heard of before in the World, it will not be amiss to mention it.</p>
                  <p>[<hi>Every One and twenty year</hi> (saith he) <hi>the</hi> Plague <hi>rageth in</hi> BRITAIN, <hi>which proceedeth from the extream Heat of every Seventh year, which Heat is far greater the Third seventh, for then the Waters lying in holes, putrifie and corrupt, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cause a Pestilence.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Cycle</hi> of One and twenty years, and the Plague ensuing upon it, as it smells <note place="margin">Brietius <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi>
                     </note> too much of the <hi>Cabbalistical</hi> number, SEVEN, to be true, and to be believed, concerning any Nations; so is there not the least appearance of any likelyhood in it relating to <hi>Britain.</hi> The <hi>Plague</hi> hath alwaies been observed more to be brought into this Island, than bred in it, and the Contagion hath been kept up by the Crowds of People, rather, than the malignity of the Air.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tacitus,</hi> amongst the rest of his Observations upon the <hi>BRITAINS,</hi> saies, <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> [<hi>That they generally lived to a great Age, which he attributes, especially to the</hi> Air, <hi>and</hi> Climate <hi>of the Country.</hi>] And perhaps the same Remarks might be made of the present Inhabitants; But certainly, if they are not so Healthy as formerly, it is not the fault of the Country, but the difference of Times, the Luxury of the People, the Trade of other Nations, crowding their Persons and Interest toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bringing oftentimes the Infections, as well as Commodities, of other Countries.</p>
                  <p>Generally, the <hi>Soyl</hi> of this Country is very Fertile, abundantly watered throughout with Springs and small Rivulets, adorned with pleasant and fruitful Valleys, easie and gentle Hills; nay, the Ground which lies waste in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and neglected (by the Judgment of some) far exceeds the Soyl of many Provinces on the Continent.</p>
                  <p>What Opinion the <hi>Romans</hi> had of it, may be gathered out of the words of an Oratour to <hi>Constantius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Constantine. [It was no small damage</hi> (saies he) <hi>to the Commonwealth, to loose the very bare Name of</hi> BRITAIN, <hi>to forego a Land so plentiful in Corn, so rich in Pasture, so full of Mines, and veins of Mettals, so accommodated with Havens, and for Circuit so large and spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>And as these things relate more particularly to the Southern part of this Island, viz. <hi>Britannia Major,</hi> in which the <hi>Romans</hi> were most conversant: so we may reckon the great price and value they put upon it by their care and diligence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it, fencing it in (like a precious Garden-plot) with a Wall of Eighty miles in length, from <hi>Tinmouth</hi> on the <hi>German</hi> Sea, to <hi>Solway-Frith</hi> on the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, least the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Boars (as one calls them) might root it up.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58825:9"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Saxons,</hi> who followed them, did not think this sufficient, till they had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it from the <hi>Cambro-Britain</hi> Foxes, and that with a Ditch of Ninety miles in length.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Normans,</hi> who had forsaken <hi>France</hi> to take possession of it, had not less thoughts of it, as may appear in their <hi>Doomsday-Book, viz.</hi> the black Book of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> wherein it is called, a <hi>Paradice of PLEASURE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, if we add to this the Judgment of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Graecians,</hi> we may see that in all Ages the Possession of it did highly esteem and commend it.</p>
                  <p>It would be endless to speak of all things particularly, which the whole ISLAND plentifully produceth, insomuch that as it is separated from the rest of the World, so it bringeth forth all things sufficient for the life of Man; And if I should here reckon up all the sorts of <hi>Grain</hi> it beareth, the abundance of <hi>Cattle,</hi> their several kinds and uses, the plenty and variety of <hi>Fish, Fowl, Fruit, Roots, &amp;c.</hi> I should seem to Strangers, rather to number the works of Nature, than set forth the Plenty of an Island.</p>
                  <p>As it affordeth all <hi>Food</hi> necessary, so it yieldeth to the Inhabitants <hi>Rayment</hi> also, as likewise all Materials for <hi>Architectures, Firing,</hi> the necessaries of <hi>War,</hi> and all Conveniencies that serve for <hi>Profit,</hi> or <hi>Recreation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It produceth a great quantity of <hi>Tynn, Lead,</hi> and <hi>Iron,</hi> it wants not <hi>Silver</hi> Mines, likewise <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Copper,</hi> it hath <hi>Quick-silver, Antimony, Sulphur, Black-Lead, Orpiment</hi> Red and Yellow, <hi>Allom,</hi> the natural <hi>Cinnabarum,</hi> or <hi>Vermillion, Bitumen, Chrysocolla, Coperas,</hi> the <hi>Mineral stone</hi> whereof <hi>Petreolum</hi> is made, <hi>Cole, Salt-Peter, Salt-Soda.</hi> And, as (if this was not sufficient) like a kind Mother, it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Physick</hi> to the Inhabitants, it hath many Medicinal <hi>Springs</hi> in it of great use and benefit, Hot <hi>Baths</hi> for the ease of Maims, Bruises, Inward Aches, and Pains.</p>
                  <p>Add to this the number and conveniencies of its <hi>Ports</hi> and <hi>Havens,</hi> and the most ecellent Ad vantages it hath from all parts of the World to take in <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,</hi> and we may safely conclude, there is not any One Kingdom in the World that can be compared with it.</p>
                  <p>No wonder therefore that it hath been possest by several <hi>Nations,</hi> and coveted by many more, being a Country (as One saith of it) like the TREE in <hi>Paradice, good for Food, pleasant to the Eye, and to be Desired.</hi> And whereas some <hi>Countries</hi> are still held by their <hi>Aborigines,</hi> none thinking it worth the while to dispossess them, it is harder to find out the first <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of this ISLAND, than to number up the General Vicissitudes and Changes it hath underwent.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>The first Inhabitants of BRITAIN.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is in Great Kingdoms as in Mighty Rivers, the higher we trace their Original, the more we are to seek from whence their principal Head and Scource doth proceed; And as Objects, by distance, are contracted till they scarce become visible to the eye, and those things by far removal off, seem to be in one lump, which, in themselves are really separated: So it happens that, amongst many pretenders to the first Plantation of a Country, it is hard to discern, to which the Priority is to be given, and the Map of the Ancient World, by time, is reduced to so small a compass, that the many Colonies, like little Rivulets, seem to meet in one point, and have so dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and obscured the lines and traces of Antiquity, that of necessity recourse must be made to Probable opinions, and conjectures, those Artificial Glasses, by which the foot-steps of time are laid more wide and open.</p>
               <p>In the enquiring out <hi>the first Inhabitants of this Island,</hi> I do not intend to build any thing upon the <hi>British</hi> Histories, but will altogether wave them in this place, neither relying on their Authority, nor questioning their Truth, in which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, I hope, I shall not incur the displeasure of any, seeing I shall put them in a Treatise particularly by themselves. Neither will any one, I hope, be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if contrary to the Judgment of some, I cannot suppose this Island to be Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled so soon as it is usually imagined. And, I think, to the true stating of this matter, some Remarks and Observations will not be amiss, touching the encrease of Man-kind in the Primitive Ages of the World, nor do I take it to be beside my purpose, to make some reflections on the slow motion and progress of Colonies, occasioned by their ignorance of Passages, and the little knowledge they had of the conveniencies of the Countries they arrived at, all which they could never learn, until they had tarried and made some experiment of them; To which may be added many other circumstances, as the want of necessaries of Travel, and the small improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Navigation, as to long voyages by Sea.</p>
               <p>Touching the great and extraordinary encrease of Mankind, supposed after the Flood, the Scriptures make no mention of it. <hi>Noah</hi> had but three sons, <hi>Japhet</hi> seven, <hi>Shem</hi> five, <hi>Ham</hi> four. The greatest number was <hi>Jocktans,</hi> who had thirteen, a thing not unusual even in our daies. Neither was the advantage of Polygamy so considerable, as to swell the numbers of them to so great a height as is supposed. <hi>Jacob</hi> with his Wives and Concubines had but twelve sons, and <hi>Solomon</hi> but one.</p>
               <p>But we shall see the Product of Mankind better, if we take a measure and survey of them some hundreds of years after the Flood.</p>
               <p>From the Flood to <hi>Abrahams</hi> daies are reckoned CCXCII years, and yet the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> so fruitful, and so nigh to <hi>Armenia</hi> was not fully Peopled, as by his words to <hi>Lot</hi> may be gathered, [<hi>Is not the whole Land before us?</hi>] CC years after, <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> without any other assistance, destroyed a whole City.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, when <hi>Jacob</hi> went into <hi>AEgypt,</hi> the pleasant Land of <hi>Gosben</hi> lay empty, and we may judge of the Inhabitants of all <hi>AEgypt,</hi> by the single Progeny of <hi>Jacob</hi> exceeding them, which Progeny, by a particular blessing of God, encreased; yet in CCC years to the number only of Six hundred three thousand five hundred and fifty, besides Levites and Children, which being added in proportion will not make at farthest, two parts of three of the Inhabitants, of either <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> and are a very small quantity to the Peopling of a Nation.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:58825:10"/>
               <p>The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> afterwards driven out of their Seats, by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> possessed many parts lying upon the Mediterranean, in <hi>Spain, Africa, Italy,</hi> and other places of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> which could not be supposed to be very well Peopled. How then can we imagine that <hi>Britain</hi> (lying so far West, having such a vast Continent between it and <hi>Armenia,</hi> and being secluded by the narrow Streights, from being easily accessible by Sea) should be Peopled in so short a time when far nearer places lay empty, and desert?</p>
               <p>If any one object and say, <hi>That the Islands of the</hi> Gentiles (among which <hi>Britain</hi> is one) <hi>were given to</hi> Japhet <hi>and his Sons, and therefore</hi> Britain <hi>was not so long before it was Peopled;</hi> Let them consider, that by <hi>Japhet</hi> and his Sons, is meant his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, and that in order to the enjoying of his Patrimony, and taking their Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session thereof, the delivery of a Turf to him or his Sons was not necessary, but sufficient that his Seed inherited the Blessing.</p>
               <p>Some there are, who to shew the great encrease of People in the East, after the Flood, have instanced in <hi>Ninus</hi> his Army, whom <hi>Eusebius</hi> saies, lived CCL years <note place="margin">Eusebius. Herodotus.</note> after the Deluge: His Army (by <hi>Herodotus</hi>) is reported to consist of One Million seven hundred thousand Foot, Two hundred thousand Horse, and of Sythed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots above Ten thousand, an incredible number in any Age, and which might startle us if the Author was not sufficiently known. But how came it to pass, that the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Empire, in One hundred years time, afterwards should be grown so low, as with its Confederates, not to be able to resist <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Three hundred men? What is become of all this Horse and Foot, that they did not at least, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in prosecuting his Victory? Certainly, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> hath out-stretched himself in the number of the Army, so has <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Justin</hi> makes <hi>Ninus</hi> to be later than <hi>Tanaus</hi> King of the <hi>Getes,</hi> which <hi>Tanaus</hi> lived <note place="margin">Justin. <hi>Bishop</hi> Usher.</note> about the time of the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> hath placed his Reign in the year of the World MMDCCXXXVII, and after the Flood MLXXXI, or thereabouts, so that we see almost a Thousand years difference in the circumstances of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of <hi>Assyria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much being said in short concerning the encrease of Mankind after the Flood, namely, that their Colonies were not so great and numerous, as sufficiently, to possess <hi>Asia,</hi> and all those pleasant and delightful Countries about <hi>Armenia,</hi> in the space of four or five hundred years. Let us consider whether it be reasonable to suppose our Fore-fathers, of so uneasie and restless a disposition, as to be continually wandering from place to place, and hunting after new Countries, having no Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to move them thereunto. Can we think that they could be drawn into the North, into the cold and barren Countries of <hi>Sythea,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to pass thorow the neck of <hi>Scandia,</hi> and overcome the ascents and difficulties of the Mountain <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> if they had not been reduced to it by those exigencies of affairs, by which, naturally, every Nation is obliged, upon the too great encrease of its Inhabitants, to cast out the worst of its People, and disburthen it self of the superfluity of them. Nor can we easily suppose, that one and the same Leader could induce his followers to accompany him into Countries, wherein they were to undergo the speedy and sudden changes of Weather. It is more reasonable to think, that Colonies crept on by degrees, and every succeeding Generation added one step to the progress of their Fathers, and so Mankind insensibly, in different parts, was accustomed to different Climates, which became easie and familiar to them, by reason that by long time, and short journies, they rather stole into them, than suddenly jumpt upon them.</p>
               <p>But granting, that in the first Ages after the Flood, Mankind encreased faster than now it does, and that the Progeny of <hi>Noab</hi> did desire to disperse it self over the whole Earth, yet could they not do it because they wanted sundry Materials and Necessaries for it, the forging of Iron, the curious working of it is said to be found long after the Flood, an Art without which there could be no stirring, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that every Colony did know the way of managing of it, it required time to find out Mines in order to the making of Instruments, which must be supplied in every Country, though not producing that Mettal, and sufficient quantities be-provided before they could go on any further; In like manner they must tarry for the growth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58825:10"/>
of Provisions in the places where they came, which would take up a year or two, before they could be produced. Neither could Countries in a moment be cleared from Wood, or cleansed from Fenns, with both which the Earth did then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> reports, <hi>That, the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>in some parts of</hi> America, <hi>scarcely proceeded into the Continent ten miles in ten years,</hi> which if they (with all necessary <note place="margin">Learned Sir <hi>W. Rawleigh.</hi>
                  </note> Instruments) could not do, how can we expect that in the first Ages after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, Colonies could go on so fast, when they were to encounter with no less dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and had not the same means to overcome them; And if by this measure we should calculate the progress of the first Planters we might not be far out of the way, but certainly as <hi>Europe</hi> extends in length IOCCCC <hi>German</hi> miles, so we might modestly assign so many years to the filling of it, which is four times the speed that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note, A</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>mile is four</hi> English.</note> 
                  <hi>Spaniards</hi> made in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But because it is reasonable to suppose that the first Colonies took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Navigable Rivers, which were more commodious for Scituation, Carriage, and many other respects: so it is to be imagined, that following those conveniencies they ran out in length far into a Country before they filled the main body of it, and so in <hi>Germany</hi> might proceed down the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and so come into these Western parts long before that vast tract of ground was thoroughly Peopled.</p>
               <p>This is the only Reason that induceth me to believe, that this Island had Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants at the first coming of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> things being in this condition as to Land Affairs some hundreds of years after the Flood. But let us see what success the World had in Shipping in those Primitive Ages.</p>
               <p>In the daies of <hi>Solomon,</hi> about the year after the Flood MCCLXX, the <hi>Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were arrived to a great perfection in the art of Navigation, they made long Voyages, and imported many rich Commodities into those Parts; and without doubt the greatest improvement of Shipping proceeded from those quarters, which the <hi>Gracians</hi> themselves cannot dissemble, although they give the Honour sometimes to <hi>Danaus,</hi> sometimes to <hi>Phoenix</hi> and <hi>Cadmus,</hi> whom they will have the Sons of <hi>Agenor,</hi> so making <hi>Phoenix</hi> the name of a Man, which (indeed) is the name of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Nation, which in all likelyhood had Shipping far before either <hi>Cadmus,</hi> or <hi>Danaus,</hi> as is gathered by their experience therein in King <hi>Solomons</hi> daies, who lived much about their time.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Gracians</hi> (who by the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> were alwaies called <hi>Children</hi>) made it their business to fasten all the great Actions, and Inventions of the Ancients, upon something of their own Nation, and being better able to write than perform great Matters, they brought down the original of Arts and Sciences to their own low and pitiful <hi>Epocha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this I shall have more occasion to speak in treating of the Name of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> wherein their fraud and vanity will be made more evidently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>Some say, that Shipping was first invented in the Red-Sea, by King <hi>Erithras,</hi> who is supposed to be <hi>Edom,</hi> others in the Mediterranean at <hi>Tyre,</hi> but however it be, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> inhabited upon both those Seas, and it is most reasonable (according to <hi>Tibullus</hi>)
<q>
                     <hi>Prima Ratem ventis credere docta Tyrus.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Tibullus.</note>
                  </q>
To give them the Honour of Invention, who made the greatest progress in it.</p>
               <p>If this conjecture be right concerning King <hi>Erithras,</hi> that he was the first maker of a Ship, and was the same with <hi>Edom</hi> (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> supposes) then was Navigation <note place="margin">Scaliger.</note> begun in the year after the Flood CCCC, or thereabouts, and being brought into the Mediterranean by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> there began an easie way of transporting of Colonies to all those Seas, upon which account, we may suppose they were Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled long before the Inland Countries, and all the Islands of the <hi>Ionians,</hi> and all the borders of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Epirus,</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> on one side, and the Shoars of <hi>Africa</hi> on the other to the Streights, received their Inhabitants, before the Continent of <hi>Europe</hi> was half filled with its Inland Colonies.</p>

               <p>Now adding Four hundred years more to the improvement of Navigation, to its first beginning, and it will be much about the time the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> entered the Streights; about Four hundred years more the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had built great Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and were accustomed to long and tedious Voyages, being hired by King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi> Now it is that we hear of <hi>Danaus,</hi> and his great Ship <hi>Penteconteros,</hi> or fifty <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Since the Ship . . . . came from</hi> AEgypt <hi>into</hi> Greece, <hi>and was called</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Learned Selden.</note> Penteconteros, <hi>and the Daughters of</hi> Danaus . . . . . <hi>and</hi> Helice, <hi>and</hi> Archedice <hi>chosen from the rest . . . . . and sacrificed upon the shoar in</hi> Para . . . . de <hi>in</hi> Lindus, <hi>a City of</hi> Rhodes, MCCXLVII.</p>
               <p>Having premised thus much concerning the general increase of Man-kind, the slow progression of Nations, and the advantage those People had that lay upon the Midland-Sea, above those that travelled by Land. I will leave the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in the Mediterranean and return to those Nations whom I left on their journey in the Continent of <hi>Europe,</hi> and we shall find them no sooner arrived in these Western parts, and well setled, but the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> from the Streights followed them.</p>
               <p>The Reasons which induce me to believe that this Island was Peopled from the Continent rather than from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> or <hi>Graecians,</hi> as some have thought, and from the <hi>Germans</hi> rather than the <hi>Gauls,</hi> are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Language, although it hath many <hi>Phoenician</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> words in it, and <note place="margin">R. 1.</note> especially <hi>Greek,</hi> yet the Idiom of it, as to the main, appears to be <hi>Teutonick,</hi> and those Words they received either with Trading with the former Nations, or by the Invasion of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> seem to be much modelled to that Dialect. This could not happen by the mixture with the <hi>Saxons</hi> in after Ages, because the <hi>Armorican Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> who fled over in the daies of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> retain the same way of Writing and Pronouncing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it could not be People from <hi>Gaule, Caesar</hi> methinks makes it <note place="margin">R. 2.</note> evident (where he saies) <hi>That the Inlanders of</hi> Britain <hi>reported themselves to be Aborigines, that is,</hi> Home-born, <hi>which they could not have done had they agreed in Language with those</hi> Gaules <hi>that had seated themselves on the Sea-coast of this Island.</hi> It would be vanity for any Country to pretend a different original, and to want some distinction in Dialect, the chief Criterion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Judgment of <hi>Tacitus</hi> in this point is, <hi>That the</hi> Germans <hi>planted the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">R. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>most Northern parts of it,</hi> which he collects from the make of their Limbs, and <note place="margin">Tacitus:</note> several other Circumstances. Add to this, what I shall speak of more fully in <hi>the Customes of the</hi> Britains, that what <hi>Caesar</hi> writes of the manners of the <hi>Germans,</hi> agrees exactly with the description of the Inland <hi>Britains.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:58825:11"/>
               <p>The greatest Argument produced to make this Island peopled from <hi>Gaul,</hi> is the confinity of Language between the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls.</hi> The Confinity of Language between the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> proceeds not from their being one Nation, but from the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> who Traded to both, and the words produced by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> for that purpose, I shall shew to be most of them <hi>Phoenician,</hi> some <hi>Greek,</hi> and as for the rest they have little Analogy one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that which is, may proceed from the Invasion of <hi>Britain</hi> by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and the intercourse of Druids in both Nations.</p>
               <p>Now, in my Judgment, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> stand only in Competition with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> as for the <hi>Greek,</hi> it is plain, as I shall shew, they were not in these Seas till some hundreds of years after the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Arrival. But because the coming of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> may (by many) not thought to be so soon, I shall wave them also in this place, and proceed to shew who where the first that peopled this Isle from the Continent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> call themselves <hi>Kumero, Cymro,</hi> and <hi>Kumeri,</hi> and this name is so Ancient among them, that <hi>Cymro,</hi> Pluraliter <hi>Cymri,</hi> is become to signifie as much as <hi>Aborigines.</hi> From this Appellation of themselves Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> does think that the first light of their Original does appear. The truth is, the similitude of Name between these <hi>Cymri</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Ancient people, the <hi>Cimbri</hi> of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, in things of so far distance, doth give sufficient ground for a Reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; But especially, if we consider what hath been said before of the slow progression of the first Planters, it will seem more Reasonable the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> were the Fore-fathers of these <hi>Cymri,</hi> because in Eight hundred years after the Flood the Name of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> might be in much use on the Continent, and frequent in these parts, which could not be much before that time, as will appear if we consider the true Original and progress of that Nation.</p>
               <p>This I will examine more paticularly, because Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> seems to derive them from this very same People, but in making them the Sons of <hi>Gomer,</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Gaul,</hi> he hath committed two great Mistakes, which I mention not in derogation to so Worthy and Learned a Person, but out of sincere meaning, and desire of Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He Cites <hi>Josephus</hi> (who saith) that the <hi>Gauls</hi> were called, of <hi>Gomer, Gowari, Gomaraei,</hi> and <hi>Gomeritae.</hi> Indeed <hi>Josephus</hi> doth say, that <hi>Gomer</hi> was the <note place="margin">1.</note> Father of the <hi>Galatae,</hi> but it must be understood of those <hi>Galatae</hi> who invaded the <hi>Phrygians,</hi> and possest themselves of their Seats, for by <hi>Gomer</hi> is meant <hi>Phrygia</hi> (as <hi>Bochartus</hi> proves) and, by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is placed North of <hi>Judaea,</hi> nigh to <hi>Togar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah;</hi> From these <hi>Gauls, Gallograecia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> is derived, all which <note place="margin">Bocaitus. Ezckiel.</note> is far enough from being any part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> properly so called.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the next place the <hi>Cimbri</hi> are not the Off-spring of <hi>Gomer,</hi> as will appear by the first Seat and progress of that Nation, besides there is no Authority <note place="margin">2.</note> to believe them descended of him, but rather to the contrary, and all such as have thought so, have had no other Reason but some little likeness in the Name, all which will manifestly appear in the History of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> which in short is this.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cimbri</hi> are supposed to be, the Relicks of the Ancient <hi>Cimmerii,</hi> who by contraction were called <hi>Cimbri.</hi> The Original of the name <hi>Cimmerii</hi> did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>Gomer,</hi> but from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who called them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The first, because they lived in the North in a perpetual kind of Winter, and the latter, because they dwelt in a Cloudy and misty Air, for they lived under the extreamest part of the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> in that neck of Ground called from thence, <hi>Taurica Chersonesus.</hi> They were a <hi>Scythian</hi> Nation, and were the Off-spring of <hi>Magog;</hi> for the <hi>Scythians</hi> (as <hi>Josephus</hi> reports) were first called <hi>Magogaei,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Scythae</hi> by the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But of this we shall have occasion, to declare the Judgments <note place="margin">Josephus.</note> of other Authors, in the Antiquity of the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are supposed first of all to have chosen their Seats in <hi>Coelosyria,</hi> beyond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxis,</hi> where <hi>Magog</hi> built a City, called by the <hi>Scyrians</hi> after his Name, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Herodotus, lib. 4.</note> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Pliny, Hierapolis,</hi> being driven out of their Seats by the <hi>Massagaetes</hi> that lived upon <hi>Araxis.</hi> Passing the River, they possest those vast and wide Regions which lay empty, and which afterwards by the <hi>Greeks</hi> were called <hi>Scythiae.</hi> Part of them which lived upon the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea and the <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> from the feirceness of their Manners and Hellish dispositions were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58825:12"/>
called <hi>Cerberii</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the same sence as they are now called <hi>Tartarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards these <hi>Cerberii</hi> being more civilized, as from <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cimmerii</hi> in time, by contraction, were called <hi>Cimbri,</hi> according to <hi>Diod. Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and being a War-like Nation, they proceeded from <hi>Scythia</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Diod. Sicul. Plutarch.</note> into the Countries called afterwards, <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and in process of time through several circumstances of Places they possest, they were called by several Names, and the general name of <hi>Cimbri</hi> was branched out into many particular ones, sometimes they were called <hi>Germani,</hi> sometimes <hi>Celtae,</hi> sometimes <hi>Galatae</hi> and <hi>Galli,</hi> from their Conquest of a great part of that Country, and their many Victories over it, as <hi>Caesar</hi> himself witnesseth. And <hi>Suidas</hi> calls the <hi>Cimbri</hi> that fought under <hi>Brennus, Germans,</hi> but the name of <hi>Cimbri</hi> is Ancienter than either <hi>Germany,</hi> or <note place="margin">Caesar. Suidas.</note> 
                  <hi>Gaule;</hi> so it happened that those <hi>Cimbri</hi> that lived beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in after-times were called <hi>Germans,</hi> and they that Inhabited on this side, on their Conquests, were called <hi>Galli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it proceeds that <hi>Florus</hi> saies, <hi>The</hi> Cimbri <hi>came out of</hi> Gaule, and they that sackt <hi>Rome,</hi> and went into <hi>Greece</hi> and robbed the Temple of <hi>Apollo, Justin</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Florus. Justin.</note> calls <hi>Gauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pausanias AElianus,</hi> and <hi>Athenaus,</hi> names them <hi>Galatae,</hi> and others <hi>Celtae,</hi> but as <note place="margin">Paus. AElian. Athenaeus. Suidas. Livy.</note> I said before, as to their Original, they are more truly (by <hi>Suidas</hi>) called <hi>Germans,</hi> as also by <hi>Livy;</hi> so that we see there is great confusion made in the naming of this People, and many Learned Persons not heeding these distinctions, have taken the <hi>Aborigines</hi> of <hi>Gaul</hi> to be the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> when indeed, the <hi>Cimbri</hi> only possest part of that Country, and by inhabiting the same Seats received the same Name.</p>
               <p>In this Errour Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> proceeds, not contenting himself to make them the <hi>Aborigines</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> but deriving them from <hi>Gomeri,</hi> whom, he saies, Anciently possest that Country, when the truth is, the <hi>Gauls</hi> only of Phrygia received that name of <hi>Gomari,</hi> which was never heard of in any part of the Continent now called <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, we are to take notice, that before the Names of <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> were found out, both Nations were called both by the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greeks, Celtae,</hi> but afterwards, all the Tract of Ground beyond <hi>Massilia,</hi> they called <hi>Gallia Celtica,</hi> and all on this side, to the <hi>Hercinian</hi> Mountains, and the further parts of <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Sarmatia</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi> sometimes they named <hi>Germania,</hi> sometimes simply, <hi>Gallia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it proceeds, that what <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, <hi>Festus</hi> calls the <hi>Gaulish,</hi> not that the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Gaulish</hi> Tongue was all one, but because the name <note place="margin">Plutarch. Festus.</note> of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Gaul</hi> was often promiscuously used; And because the <hi>Cimbri</hi> were sometimes called <hi>Celtae</hi> as they possest part of <hi>Celtica,</hi> hence it proceeds that the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> Tongue is made the same with the <hi>Celtic,</hi> the <hi>Celtae</hi> being a promiscuous Name of the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Gauls;</hi> The <hi>Celtic</hi> Language is as much the <hi>German</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as the <hi>Gaulish.</hi> The want of this distinction also was another cause of Mr. <hi>Cambden's</hi> mistake.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58825:12"/>
               <p>The <hi>Cimbri</hi> therefore, though they were called <hi>Galli, Celtae,</hi> and <hi>Galatae,</hi> from their Conquest of those People, yet were they a <hi>German</hi> Nation, as <hi>Caesar</hi> himself <note place="margin">Caesar.</note> testifies, and proceeding from <hi>Scythia,</hi> they passed through all the upper parts of that vast Continent of <hi>Europe;</hi> from their mixture with the <hi>Celtae</hi> (as I have said) they were called <hi>Celtae,</hi> and from their Original <hi>Celtecythae</hi> by the <hi>Graecians,</hi> a Name which could not be proper to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> because they were far from being of <hi>Scythian</hi> Original.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cimbri</hi> were an Ancient and valiant Nation. <hi>Tully</hi> writes of them, <hi>That it was their joy and delight to die in Battle, and that nothing so much tormented them as to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tully.</note> 
                  <hi>be taken away idly in their Beds.</hi> No wonder therefore if they conquered many Nations, distressed the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, and were a continual Thorn in the sides of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They possest all the Islands of the Sea called <hi>Sinus Codanus,</hi> all <hi>Jutia,</hi> which from them anciently was called <hi>Cimbrica Chersonesus,</hi> and all the rest of the Provinces of <hi>Germany</hi> upon the Sea, they had <hi>Frisia</hi> and <hi>Batavia</hi> in their Jurisdiction, and all the Sea from the <hi>Cimbrick Chersonesus,</hi> or <hi>Jutia,</hi> to both the mouths of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that is to the borders of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was called <hi>Cimbricum Mare.</hi> They possessed also many parts in the Inland Country, and many Nations proceeded from them, although in after times they had lost their Name, and those were only called <hi>Cimbri</hi> peculiarly who lived beyond the River <hi>Albis,</hi> within the <hi>Chersonesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> makes frequent mention of them, how they infested <hi>Gaul,</hi> and passed the <hi>Rhine</hi> with their Armies; Nay, that they had overrun all that Country with the <note place="margin">Caesar. lib. 1.</note> assistance of the <hi>Teutoni,</hi> another <hi>German</hi> Nation, whom he constantly joyns with them. Moreover, he saies, that most of the <hi>Belgae</hi> were of <hi>German</hi> Original, which <hi>Belgae</hi> in another place he makes part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> and in another place he makes part of the <hi>Nervii,</hi> a People of <hi>Gallia,</hi> to be descended of these <hi>Cimbri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see these <hi>Cimbri</hi> by their Conquest established in many parts of that Kingdom, but especially those that lay upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but even in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies they were not so mixt, but that they preserved their own Language. For the three Chief People of that Nation, the <hi>Celtae, Aquitani,</hi> and <hi>Belgae, Caesar</hi> writes differed in Language, which they would not have done had they been all of one Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>From these <hi>Cimbri</hi> I have alwaies thought that our <hi>Cymri</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> have been derived, because, for the Reason before mentioned, it is probable <hi>Britains</hi> were of <hi>German</hi> Original, and there is no <hi>German</hi> Nation stands so fair as these <hi>Cimbri</hi> for it. Besides what Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> takes notice of, much conduceth to this purpose, namely, That Grammarian whom <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Catalects termeth the <hi>Britain, Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides Quintilian</hi> saies was a <hi>Cimbrian,</hi> but that these <hi>Cimbrians</hi> should be the <note place="margin">Virgil. Quintilian.</note> 
                  <hi>Aborigines</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> or proceed from I know not what <hi>Gomarii</hi> or <hi>Gomaraei,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Gomer,</hi> is impossible.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> saies, <hi>Somer</hi> signifies, <hi>The utmost Border,</hi> and therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that he or his seed seated themselves in these Parts; But seeing that <hi>Moses</hi> in <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> numbring the Progeny of <hi>Noah,</hi> seems to give the names of Nations, rather than of particular Men (as many Learned do think) how can we imagine that <hi>Moses</hi> should have the knowledge of the extreamest parts in <hi>Gallia,</hi> seeing that God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him many particulars in Geography, that more immediately related to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Somer</hi> signifies the same as the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and in all likelyhood was <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> of which the <hi>Jews</hi> had heard of in their daies, for <hi>Phrygia</hi> signifies the same as <hi>Gomer,</hi> viz. <hi>A Land burnt up,</hi> as indeed <hi>Phrygia</hi> is. And the <hi>Greeks</hi> (as shall be shewn in another Chapter) did frequently translate the Names of Places from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> or <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, into their own; And this is very visibly shewn in the following Map of the Ancient World, wherein the names of Countries and Cities in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> especially are put down as they were called by the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58825:13"/>
but the word <hi>Cimber,</hi> as to its Original signifies no more a <hi>Robber</hi> or <hi>Thief,</hi> than <hi>AEgyptius,</hi> one that is <hi>Superstitious,</hi> or <hi>Chaldaeus,</hi> an <hi>Astrologer,</hi> or <hi>Sybarita,</hi> a <hi>dainty Mouth.</hi>

               <p>For these <hi>Cimbri</hi> living in an Age wherein Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his <hi>Status belli</hi> was very much in practice, and in a Nation too which disallowed, as <hi>Caesar</hi> writes, even in his Age, <note place="margin">Caesar.

               <p>Some there are who upon the words of <hi>Fesius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> give another Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the name <hi>Cimber, viz.</hi> out of the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, wherein <hi>Kemtter,</hi>

                  </gap>, a <hi>Robber,</hi> are often taken to signifie a <hi>Souldier,</hi> in a good sence, and that <hi>Festus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> did not intend to say, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> called a <hi>Robber,</hi> but a <hi>Souldier, Cimber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Answer, that <hi>Latro,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in the daies of <hi>Festus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> were alwaies taken in an ill sence, and that those Authors, if they had had any respect to <hi>Kampher,</hi> or <hi>Kimpher,</hi> as the Original of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> they would not both have agreed in an absolute word to express the meaning of their Name, especially if we consider, that as <hi>Latro</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> wre grown out of use, to express <hi>Souldiers</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, so neither can <hi>Kampher,</hi> without a figure and some straining, be brought to signifie a <hi>Warryor</hi> in the <hi>German;</hi> Besides it appears more manifest that <hi>Kamper</hi> or <hi>Kimper,</hi> a <hi>Warryor,</hi> hath nothing to do in the derivation of the Ancient Nation, the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> if it be considered that <hi>Kamper</hi> proceeding from <hi>Camp,</hi> in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue signifying a <hi>Field</hi> where Souldiers pitch their Tents, seems to be derived from the Latin, <hi>Campus,</hi> a <hi>Field.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the name of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> was long before ever the <hi>Latins</hi> can be supposed to have carried any thing of their Language into <hi>Germany;</hi> But <hi>Lazius,</hi> the Author <note place="margin">Lazius.</note> of this Etymology of the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> did not much relie upon the truth of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, seeing in another place (forgetting what he had written before) he names the <hi>Cimbri</hi> from I know not what King, called <hi>Cambrivius,</hi> the Grand-son of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the name of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> from <hi>their continual molesting their Neighbours,</hi> was used by the <hi>Gauls</hi> in their Tongue, to express <hi>Robbers;</hi> so from the exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their Limbs, being generally men of great and extraordinary Stature, in After - times <hi>Cimber</hi> came also to be taken for a <hi>Gyant.</hi> In the <hi>Danish</hi> Tongue, <hi>Pontanus</hi> saies, <hi>Kimber, Kemp,</hi> and <hi>Kemper,</hi> signifie properly a <note place="margin">Pontanus.</note> 
                  <hi>Gyant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>Cimbri</hi> were in truth very remarkable in this point, as likewise the <hi>Cymri</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> according to <hi>Strabo,</hi> who saies, <hi>He saw very Youths taller by half a foot than the tallest Men; Caesar</hi> largely expresseth by the general Consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Strabo. Caesar.</note> of his Army, in his march against <hi>Ariovestus</hi> their Leader.</p>
               <p>They were described to the <hi>Romans,</hi> just as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and we may judge of the dreadful apprehension the <hi>Gauls</hi> had of them by the like expression they used to <hi>Caesar,</hi> namely, <hi>That they were so exceeding Tall, that other Nations seemed as nothing in their eyes;</hi> And that <hi>Cimbrian</hi> whom <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> encountred, is described by the <hi>Romans</hi> like a <hi>Goliah,</hi> of a vast and unweildy <note place="margin">Manlius.</note> Body, but whilst he stood in the rank of his own Army, there was no great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion visible in him from the rest, but when he had stalked out some paces, and came higher the <hi>Romans,</hi> they began to be amazed and astonished at the sight.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Kimber,</hi> from the great proportion of these <hi>Cimbri,</hi> came to signifie a <hi>Gyant</hi> in the <hi>Danish</hi> Tongue, so from a part of them called <hi>Getes,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> also came to signifie a <hi>Gyant,</hi> but as the Nation of the <hi>Getes</hi> is far Ancienter than <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Gyant,</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58825:13"/>
this word being derived from them, so the <hi>Cumerii,</hi> or <hi>Cimbri,</hi> were a People long before either <hi>Kampher, Kimper,</hi> or <hi>Kimber,</hi> had any of the aforementioned sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, for this cause the <hi>Cimbri</hi> could not receive their Names from those words, the signification of which they themselves had occasioned.</p>
               <p>Many other remarkable Qualities these <hi>Cimbri</hi> had, which were also taken notice of in the <hi>Cumri</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> namely, their exceeding <hi>swiftness,</hi> by which they could lay their hands on the Mayns of their Horses and equal them in their Race, as is witnessed by <hi>Caesar.</hi> This might give occasion to other significations of the word <hi>Kimber</hi> in after Ages, among the <hi>Germans, viz.</hi> to express <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sherringham</hi> takes notice, that in <hi>Norfolk</hi> they say a <hi>Kemper</hi> Old Man, that <note place="margin">Sherringham <hi>de</hi> Anglorum <hi>Origins.</hi>
                  </note> is, <hi>Brisk</hi> and <hi>Lively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Cimbri</hi> therefore who are supposed by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> to be the Fathers of our <hi>Cumri</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> I think that none will doubt, but that they were a <hi>German</hi> Nation, seeing their Name also continued long after in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in regard their settlement in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and upon the Sea parts of it especially came by Conquest and not Primitive possession.</p>
               <p>But as all Nations, upon some secret and unknown causes, have often many ebbs and flows, as to matters of Manhood and Courage: so it happened that before <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, as he himself writes, the <hi>Gauls</hi> exceeded the <hi>Germans</hi> in Valour, and possibly then it might be that the <hi>Gauls</hi> encreasing in Number, and Power, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their Ancient Seats, might proceed into <hi>Britain</hi> also, and here invade part of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> who had long before placed themselves in this Island; And although these <hi>Gauls</hi> had obtained the Sea-Coasts, and entred far into the Inland parts, so by long possession came to be called <hi>Britains,</hi> yet they were looked upon by the more Ancient Inhabitants, as Encroachers only, they esteeming themselves only as the <hi>Aborigines</hi> of the Island.</p>
               <p>I have been more particular in treating of these <hi>Cimbri,</hi> because from a branch of this very same Nation, in after Ages, our <hi>English</hi> Ancestors proceeded, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence so ordering it, that although the Ancient <hi>Cumri</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> were grievously molested by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and afterwards afflicted and kept under by the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet may they be said to have recovered these Seats again, although not by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, being but a small Relick, yet by the succession of a People descended of the same Original.</p>
               <p>But whether these <hi>Cimbri</hi> entred the Northern and Eastern parts of this Island, before the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> arrived in the West, is a thing altogether unsearchable, but I have shewed, in all likelyhood, that it was Seven or Eight hundred years after the Flood before any part of it was Inhabited.</p>
               <p>In the following Mapp, I shew the progress of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> on the Continent, on one part, and the Voyages of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> from the Streights, on the other.</p>
               <p>The Procession of the <hi>Cimbri</hi> is more Obscure upon the account, that all the knowledge we have of them proceeds from the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> there being nothing of their Language remaining which we can say was particularly theirs, nor any Records of that, as well as other <hi>German</hi> Nations, whereon to build any solid foundation of Antiquity; But on the other side, all these Proofs are not wanting in the Voyages of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> their Language is sufficiently known, and by it they may, and are traced, not only through all the parts of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> but on this side of the Streights also, even in <hi>Britain</hi> it self (as shall be shewn hereafter) a Nation of the greatest Antiquity, being it self One, and Conversant with the most Knowing, and Experienced People of the World.</p>
               <p>As Learning and Science is especially got by Commerce, and they were the Wisest People that lived on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and followed Trading in the Primitive Ages of the World; so that <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> in this point, exceeded all other People, their Colonies were more numerous, and their Voyages greater, than any Nation besides.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58825:14"/>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> did but Copy-out their Actions, and the Names that were given by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> to all places they Traded unto, were translated by the <hi>Greeks</hi> into their own Language, which will appear in the following Mapp of the Ancient WORLD, wherein the <hi>Phoentcian</hi> names of the Countries are exactly put down, with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in all or most of those places, to which both those Nations, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, Traded.</p>
               <p>From these <hi>Phoenicians</hi> therefore, the first Antiquity of this Nation is to be deduced, which will more evidently appear in the following Chapters, wherein it will be manifest, that <hi>Britain,</hi> as well as the rest of those Nations mentioned in this following Mapp of the Ancient WORLD, received its name of Old from this People, So that to the full understanding of the design of the Mapp, the Reader is referred to the following Chapter, which explains it.</p>
               <p>But granting that the <hi>Cimbri</hi> from the Continent might be sooner in this Island than the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and the Islanders called themselves <hi>Cymri,</hi> before they were <hi>Britains,</hi> yet do I not think, that their sooner Arrival hither proceeded from any advantage by a neck and Isthmus of Land, whereby <hi>Gallia,</hi> and this Island, have been supposed formerly to have been joyned; But because <hi>Verstegan</hi> is very stiff and resolute in the maintaining of this Opinion, insomuch as he fancies to himself, he has put it beyond all dispute or question; I desire the Readers Patience while I examine all his Arguments, some of which he calls Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein, if I shall seem more tedious than is necessary, let him consider, that if this <hi>Isthmus</hi> were admitted, then it would seem beyond dispute, but that the <hi>Gauls</hi> peopled this Nation, which, for the Reasons before mentioned can not be imagined.</p>
               <p>It seems more glorious for this excellent part of the Earth to have been alwaies a distinct Nation by it self, than to be a dependent Member of that Territory to which it hath often given Laws.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Explication of the Ancient Names of <hi>Kingdoms, Islands, Havens, Cities,</hi> &amp;c. as well those expressed in the foregoing Mapp, as others, which in that narrow Compass could not be set down, gathered out of the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi> Tongue.</head>
               <p>BY which may be understood, how, and upon what account most Nations in the World, especially those lying upon the Sea, received their particular denominations in the first Age, namely, from some notorious <hi>Customes, Habits, &amp;c.</hi> of the People, <hi>Scituation</hi> of the Place, or such like remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, or otherwise (which was most usual) from the different Merchandize they afforded to the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> who were the first and most Eminent Traders of the World, and gave Appellations to Places, according to their respective Commodities and Manufactures, wherein if we do but seriously consider, for what particular thing each Country, in former time, was most especially taken notice of, and then apply the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Name of that thing, let it be <hi>Custome, Scituation, Trade,</hi> or any thing else, and we shall find the <hi>Phoenician</hi> word so exactly agreeing with the nature of the Country so expressed, that we must conclude it impossible so constant and general an Harmony between them should happen by chance, but rather, that the Names were imposed for some peculiar Reason and design.</p>
               <p>And hereby we may plainly see the vanity and fraud of the <hi>Greek</hi> Nation, who having received the names of Places, as well as most other things of greater concern, from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> either new modelled them according to their own Idiom, or quite changed them in sound though not signification, and then imposed upon the World new Fables of their own, instead of the Ancient Original.</p>
               <p>To begin therefore with <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> the general Divisions of the then known World.

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Whether the First Planters of this Island came by Sea, or Land? and, Whether <hi>BRITAIN</hi> was ever part of the <hi>Continent?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THAT this ISLAND hath been joyned to the Opposite Continent, by a narrow Isthmus between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Bullen,</hi> or thereabouts, hath been the Opinion of many: As of <hi>Antonius Volsius, Dom. Marius Niger, Servius Honoratus,</hi> our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <note place="margin">Antonius Volscus, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Niger, Servius Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratus, John Twyne, Du Bartas, &amp;c. Pliny's <hi>Nat. Hist.</hi>
                  </note> man <hi>John Twine,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Poet <hi>Du Bartas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this has been the fortune of most Islands in the World, we may read in <hi>Pliny,</hi> who makes <hi>Cyprus</hi> to be rent from <hi>Syria, Eubaea</hi> from <hi>Baotia, Besbicus</hi> from <hi>Bithinia,</hi> with divers others; nay, the Confinity of the two Promontories of <hi>Calpe</hi> and <hi>Abyla,</hi> in the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> has been the cause why some have imagined, that <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> were, in Ancient times, conjoyned, and hath given occasion to some Geographers themselves, to make <hi>Africk</hi> part of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As these Opinions carry some pleasure with them, by reason of the Novelty and strangeness of them: so do we find, they were most made use of by men of Fancy, rather than Judgment, to imbellish and adorn their Histories with, that they might render thereby more delightful to the Reader; Among which, not to name many, <hi>Pliny</hi> may be reckoned for one, whom we alwaies find, catching at any thing that was strange and uncoutch'd, and although his History, by some, might be thought the more delightful, yet assuredly, to such as understand it, it proves more sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and so, less useful. But that this should be used by the Poets, is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whose business is not to follow Truth exactly, but content themselves with the Possibility of things, studying alwaies what Opinion is most pleasant. Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was he, who turned the Verses of <hi>Sicily</hi> unto <hi>Britany.</hi>

                     <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> was once, one piece of Land,</l>
                  <l>Till furious Billows did divide the Strand;</l>
                  <l>Now <hi>Nereus,</hi> 'twixt two Cliffs, victorious rides,</l>
                  <l>And washes both the Shoars, with swelling Tides.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>We shall find this such a Trade amongst the Poets, that <hi>Lucan</hi> was hard at work about the Isthmus in <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> for after that the Sea had play'd upon it for the space of two or three pretty Ingenious Verses, at last down fell that little Damm, which Five thousand years separated the two Seas; And with no small noise and impetuosity,
<q>Ionium AEgeo, <hi>frangit Mare</hi> —</q>
I must confess, Judicious <hi>Virgil</hi> (treating of the Narrow Seas between <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>) speaks of the breach the Sea made;
<q>Hesperium Siculo <hi>latus abscidit</hi>—</q>
but puts in the word <hi>Siculum</hi> to corroborate his Authority, without which he judged the Opinion too light and trivial. The very Name of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which before was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58825:21"/>
called <hi>Trinacria,</hi> and the Promontory <hi>Regium,</hi> upon the very Streight of <hi>Sicily,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokening by its signification, a BREACH, because at that very place the Sea breaking through the Earth, might be some inducement for any to think it once part of <hi>Italy.</hi> The constant Tradition in all Ages has been so, and to this day it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted part of <hi>Naples,</hi> or <hi>Naples</hi> part of it, as mens thoughts shall please to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, so that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is stiled, <hi>REX UTRIUSQUE</hi> SICILIAE, But for this Island of <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> there was never any such Tradition, neither doth there remain any signs or tokens of any name of a place that signifies any thing relating to it, nay, on the contrary, <hi>Dover,</hi> where this Breach is supposed, as it is derived in great probability, by Mr. <hi>Lambard,</hi> it comes from the <note place="margin">Lambard.</note> word <hi>Dufyrrha,</hi> which in the <hi>British</hi> Language betokeneth, a place <hi>steep</hi> and <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> an evident sign of the Antiquity of those Cliffs, and Breaches, so that what may be gathered out of the Name, is not indifferent, but makes absolutely to the contrary; Indeed, for the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> being part of <hi>England,</hi> there is some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability from the Name, as it signifies in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, SEPARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION.</p>
               <p>When Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> had sought on both Shoars, to find some Place, or Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, whose Name might have any thing in it that signified a BREACH, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none, yet will needs set down <hi>Vitland,</hi> which we call <hi>Vitsan,</hi> near unto <hi>Backness,</hi> in all likelyhood, was that <hi>Itium Caesar</hi> writes of, from whence, into <hi>Britain,</hi> he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, was the best and convenientest passage, and so continued until <hi>Vitsan.</hi> Haven was quite stopped up. It is to be observed, that in such Breaches, the Name and Memory of the Separation ought to be sought for, on that side of the Shoar which containeth the Minor part of the Division; As for Example, The word <hi>SICILY,</hi> was given to <hi>Trinacria,</hi> and not to <hi>Italy.</hi> And <hi>WIGHT,</hi> to that little Island, and not to <hi>England;</hi> For to speak properly, <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Wight</hi> were separated from <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and not <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>England</hi> from them, so that if we enquire for the Memory of this Breach, made between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> we must examine our own Shoar, where we can find nothing that makes for it, but absolutely against it.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Vitsan</hi> (I lately spake of) must be derived from <hi>Gwith,</hi> or it maketh nothing for their Opinion, and I leave it to any to judge, whether <hi>Vitland,</hi> or <hi>Vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,</hi> formerly called <hi>Itium</hi> by <hi>Caesar,</hi> can claim its derivation from thence, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon that account, it is any thing more reasonable to ground a Separation once made from the Continent, than by the word <hi>Dehofden,</hi> by which name the <hi>Dutch</hi> call their Streights, and which signifies <hi>two Promontories,</hi> who do conclude, that those Promontories and Cliffs were alwaies so, and that they were never joyned by any neck, or bridge of Land whatsoever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richardus Vitus,</hi> in his History, <hi>Lib. 1.</hi> saith, <hi>That the</hi> Morini <hi>who lived on the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hist. Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Viti, lib. 1.</note> French <hi>side of these</hi> Streights, <hi>were called so in the Ancient</hi> Celtick <hi>Language, for Mor, signifies the</hi> SEA; Now the great Antiquity of the <hi>Celtick</hi> Tongue, shall be shewn hereafter in a more proper place, however thus much appears, That from any Name there can be nothing gathered of this Isthmus, for these <hi>Morini</hi> lived on the Sea-coast, and not upon the end of the Isthmus.</p>
               <p>Thus much as to the Name of these Streights, that they have nothing in them, or contiguous to them, that can preserve the Memory of any such conjunction of Shoars, or violent Separation made by the Sea, or dug by the labour of Man, a thing easily to be expected, considering, that less mutations in the World have left some Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion behind them. Certainly, such a Breach as this, between two such considerable Countries, must make more noise in the World when ever it happened, than either <hi>Sicily,</hi> or the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> which to this day do retain some Memory, of being cut off from their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Let us now consider, whether in the Reason of the thing, the nature of the Streights themselves, the position and similitude of the opposite Soyls themselves, and such Arguments are sufficient Inducements to engage any Rational man to believe that <hi>Britain</hi> was once joyned to <hi>Gallia.</hi> And it is not to be doubted, but there has been several mutations and changes in the World, before, and since <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood, Countries in some parts being swallowed up by Earth-quakes, which in these Colder parts of the World are never so violent, as to be able to subvert twenty miles
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58825:21"/>
of dry Land together, and to cast it into the Sea by that force. In the <hi>Northern</hi> Countries we have only experience of some general Tremblings of the Earth, and where they extend to any length of Ground, bring only fear, not distraction, on the minds of the Inhabitants. For when any Earthquake is united and contracted, the most that we experience is the removal of some Church, or the walking of some little Hill, as it hath been seen often in <hi>England,</hi> when as in Hotter Countries, , whole Cities have been overturned, nay swallowed up, and for many miles together, Houses shattered and demolished.</p>
               <p>This is very easie to be imagined, if we consider the nature of Earth-quakes, and from what Cause they proceed, being very obvious to any that know and consider the <hi>AEolopylae,</hi> how, by heat, the Wind and Vapours rarified, are forced out in great violence, for the force is augmented by the strength of the Heat in its several Sallys: So likewise must it be with the Earth, which in the Bowels of it having many Concavities that contain Vapours, the greater the external Heats are that rarifie those Vapours, the stronger force will they have, if they can find no vent and passage, for as the heat is greater, so must the passages likewise be more suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, stopt, and choaked up in dry Countries, when as in cold Climates, the moisture of the Earth keeps open its pores, and admits passages for the Vapours, agreeable to its proper nature, and natural Constitution.</p>
               <p>From hence it may be concluded, that such a Neck of Ground that is presumed to have been between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> of that length and breadth, could not (by any Earthquake) be thrown into the Sea. What is alleadged out of <hi>Ovid,</hi> will make nothing material to our purpose; He brings <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whose Soul for many years, by Transinigration, had passed from one to another, and therefore must be wondrous well fraught with the Ocular experience of things, we only hear of, to speak these words,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Vidi Ego quod quondam fuerat solidissima tellus,</l>
                  <l>Esse fretum vidi factas ex aequore terras.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I saw what once was solid Earth, made Sea,</l>
                  <l>And dry Land there, where Waters us'd to be.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This I suppose must have been in those daies of <hi>Yore,</hi> in which he saies of himself,
<q>Panthoides, Euphorbus <hi>eram</hi>— <note place="margin">Verslegan;</note>
                  </q>
May not a very material Objection be offered, and say, That he did not really distinguish the times of his Transmigrating to <hi>Fish</hi> and <hi>Flesh,</hi> and so mistook <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> as he was longer or shorter in the Element.</p>
               <p>But to come to the purpose, <hi>Verstegan,</hi> to make way for this Opinion, quotes <hi>Genesis,</hi> cap. 14. <hi>Omnes hi convenerunt in Vallem sylvestrem, quae nunc est</hi> Mare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis <note place="margin">Speaking of the Kings of <hi>Palestine.</hi>
                  </note>. <hi>All these met together in the Wood Valley, which is now the</hi> Salt Sea; <hi>So that,</hi> saies he, <hi>many places are now Sea, which have been formerly dry Land.</hi> This may be easily granted, where there are Reasons to induce one to believe it: As the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowness of the Sea, the position of the Ground, as we find to be in the <hi>Red</hi> Sea, part of which to this day, and a considerable part too, at Low Water, lieth like a great Vally, and Plain of Sand, so that it is made a publick Road for Passengers, the Waters lying on both sides of them, and this I have heard from one who passed through it himself, when he Travelled in those parts. And this part might be that <hi>Wood Vally Moses</hi> speaks of, which lying so low, might easily by degrees be turned into Sea, but that all the <hi>Red</hi> Sea should once be a <hi>Wood Vally,</hi> the depth of it in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, and the steepness of the Shoars, do manifestly contradict it. Not to say any thing, that this very Text may be understood otherwise, viz. <hi>Quae nunc est Mare salis,</hi> may in the Hebrew bear, <hi>Quae nunc est ad Mare salis.</hi> It is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied there has been several Changes in the World, as Sea turned into Land, and Land into Sea, although I am perswaded this latter to have happened more rarely, as will be shewn hereafter.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58825:22"/>
               <p>As briefly as I can, I shall Answer, now, <hi>Verstegan's</hi> Reasons, and take them in order as they lie. The first Reason he gives for the liklyhood of it, <hi>Is the nearness of the Land between</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>not exceeding Twenty four miles, and how one Shoar is exactly answered with a Shoar of like nature;</hi> as for Example: Dover <hi>Clyffs are of Flints and Chalk, the opposite shoar between</hi> Bullen <hi>and</hi> Calais <hi>is of the same substance,</hi> I suppose he means <hi>Vitsan,</hi> Dover <hi>Clyffs are broken, and so are they. Again,</hi> Calais <hi>lies upon a Flat and an Eaven shoar, so does</hi> Sandwich, <hi>which exactly answers it from</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>therefore it seems very probable,</hi> saies he, <hi>that they were once joyned.</hi> To Answer this, I will not question, how, and by what Rule he makes his <hi>Opposites,</hi> nor enquire so strictly, how the <hi>Clyffs</hi> correspond one with another, for it will happen as the <hi>line</hi> is laid, and places at a distance may be thought to be one against another as <hi>fancy</hi> leads the string. I say, that neither the nearness of position of the <hi>two Promontories,</hi> nor the similitude of <hi>Soyl,</hi> are sufficient Arguments to make us believe a <hi>Conjunction</hi> here, more than in any other part of the World. And here I must desire it to be granted, <hi>that the Earth continues for many miles together, in most parts of the World, the very same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water, as it is on the next Neighbouring dry Land, and that in no place, or very rarely, and by accident, there is a mutation of the Soyl just upon the Sea-shoar,</hi> I mean, <hi>that upon the Sea, the uttermost bounds of the Earth shall be fat and sertile, stony or minerally, and immediately where the Sea begins, it shall be of a different nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The want of this Consideration seems to have been the Reason, why men in several parts of the World have thought, by the likeness of <hi>soyls,</hi> there hath been a <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Earth, when, the truth is, it was nothing more but the very fame Vein of ground which ran under Water, from one Country to another.</p>
               <p>To Explain this matter, I will set down <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> concerning the <hi>forming of the Earth,</hi> which whether it be true or false, as to the Mechanical way he proceeds in, yet by it this <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> in Nature may be solved, and serves as well as if it were true. And here I will not treat of every particular <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this <hi>Globe of Earth,</hi> which requires a continued series of progression, and depends on a link or chain of Reasons, whereby he establishes and grounds his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But let it suffice for the present that we know, <hi>That this Ball of Earth contains in its Centre, Fire, next to that Mineral Earth, made by that constant Furnace which is in it, next to that Water, then Air, above all the Earth on which we live.</hi> Which will seem strange to any that have not read his whole discourse; but supposing it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the Figure of the <hi>Earth</hi> in its first formation is thus:
<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>V</hi> and <hi>F</hi> are the <hi>Air,</hi> part whereof is above, part under the upper Crust of the Earth. <hi>E, D,</hi> is the <hi>Water. M</hi> and <hi>G,</hi> the <hi>Mineral Earth,</hi> upon which the upper Crust <hi>E</hi> is supposed to fall. <hi>I,</hi> the <hi>Fire.</hi> Now supposing the upper Crust of Earth, <hi>E,</hi> be dried by the heat of the Sun, it follows in time that it would shrink, and so
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58825:22"/>
wanting the continuation of its parts which is necessary to support the Arch, some of it would fall upon the Mineral Earth, <hi>C,</hi> whereby the Water <hi>D,</hi> and Air <hi>F,</hi> would arise and be uppermost, and other parts of <hi>E</hi> remain above, yet so hollow within as to keep Water in its Concavity, which drayned through the Earth would produce Springs, and being rarified into Vapours would cause Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</p>
               <p>Now, that which makes to our business is this: Suppose all the distance between 1, 2, 3, 4. to be of a <hi>Sandy</hi> and <hi>Rocky</hi> nature, if the breach be in the middle point, betwixt 1 and 4, the shoar 1, and shoar 4, will be of the same Nature, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Earth is the same all along between them, which now is supposed to be under Water between those two Points.</p>
               <p>Again, Suppose the Earth between 1 and 4 be of a different Soyl, so that from 3 to 4 is of a <hi>sandy</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> nature, and from 1 to 3 of a different Soyl, if the breach be in the point 3, then the shoar 2, and the shoar 4, will be of a different quality.

               <p>
                  <hi>E, E, E,</hi> the upper Crust of the Earth, 1, 2, 3, 9. <hi>V</hi> 6, the several Breaches, the Breach at 9 and <hi>V</hi> makes the Mountain, whose top is at 4, the Concavity at <hi>F.</hi> From 2 to 8, as likewise from 7 to X, the Water is above the Earth, and maketh two Seas, the shoars whereof are at 8 and X; from 8 to 9, and so to X, is dry Land.</p>
               <p>And because, in the Nature of the thing, it is more reasonable to imagine the Breaches to be made where the Soyls differ, therefore it happens that different and opposite Shoars are most commonly of a different Nature, yet it follows not, that Shoars of the same Nature and Soyl ought to be imagined of later date in their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than those which are of a different Nature; neither is it material, whether the Shoars be steep and Cliffy, or whether plain and eaven, or whether they answer one another, or no. For we find, in sounding of the depths of the Seas, Hills and Valleys, as well as on the dry Land, neither does it follow more, that the Cliffs of <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Bullen</hi> were a continued Ridge of Hills, than that <hi>Highgate,</hi> and <hi>Penman</hi> in <hi>Flint-shire,</hi> are.</p>
               <p>All that I think worthy to be observed is this, that where a Shoar is high and steep, there, as to the main matter, the further you go from Shoar for some distance, the fewer fathom of Water you find. And on the contrary, where a Shoar is plain, by degrees you go deeper and deeper, and in this also you must allow for height of ground, which often casually happens in the bottom of the Sea, as well as on the dry Land.</p>
               <p>The Reason of it is this, because that Arch of Earth which we called <hi>Mineral Earth,</hi> and was formed under Water, being a less Circle of vast proportion, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by two Outward ones, could not have Superficies enough for the upper Earth to lie upon it, for where the fall is greater and steeper, of necessity not far off must
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58825:23"/>
there be some Ascent proportionable, as we find <hi>Dover</hi> and the opposite Clyffs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the mid-way, an Ascent of ground called the <hi>Riff,</hi> or <hi>Trowen Shoal,</hi> not sandy, but of a Rocky substance, scarce four Fathom deep at low Water, the farther you go from it East or West being deeper and deeper, still, as afore, allowing for casual and accidental Hillocks in the bottom.</p>
               <p>From all which, I think, that the similitude of <hi>Soyls,</hi> and equality of <hi>Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,</hi> are no Argument to make us believe (that after the general ordering the Earth) <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Bullen</hi> were more joyned than any other parts whatever, but were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively disjoyned, as other Nations were. And this Argument will hold good, whether, according to <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> we suppose <hi>the Earth above the Water,</hi> as a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulatum</hi> only and no further, or whether, with <hi>Moses,</hi> we certainly believe <hi>that the Waters were above the Earth,</hi> for according to both the <hi>Earth</hi> must shrink, and by ascent and descent, gather it self together to make room for the Waters, which in its hollow or concave places were to be gathered together.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Verstegans</hi> Argument, <hi>That there is nothing broken but what was whole;</hi> I think he might have joyned the two <hi>Promontories,</hi> as easily, with any other Principle, as two entire parts joyned make a <hi>whole,</hi> or that the <hi>Parts</hi> are less than the whole; Of the same force is his Observation, <hi>That steep places near the Sea are called</hi> Cliffs, <hi>when as in the In-lands they are rather called</hi> Hills, <hi>or</hi> Mountains, and this he would have to intimate as much, as if they had been cleaved from some other Promontory. According to his Principle, <hi>Nothing is broken in Nature, that hath not been whole,</hi> a Principle undeniable, yet makes no more for the Cliffs of <hi>Dover</hi> than any other in the World, which are not answered by other Cliffs as perhaps <hi>Dovers</hi> are.</p>
               <p>These are his Reasons that shew the probability of such a Breach. Let us now examine his Arguments by which, he thinks, he has put it out of all doubt, Such as he calls <hi>evident Reasons,</hi> and <hi>remarkable Demonstrations,</hi> which, he saith, ought to be admitted as sufficient as <hi>Authors,</hi> nay beyond some who deliver it by <hi>Hear-say;</hi> but to give my Judgment in this case, I should think the least Tradition in <hi>Antiquity, that there was such athing,</hi> to be of more force than all his <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> to perswade and convince a man of so great a change in the World.</p>
               <p>Although to him it might seem never so easie and common, yet we read, that some who had rashly undertook to cut the Isthmus of ground on which <hi>Corinth</hi> stood, <hi>they were daily and hourly terrified and affrighted with Noises, and hideous Out-cries, and their works,</hi> notwithstanding all their diligence, <hi>went backwards.</hi> Nature will not easily permit such <hi>Changes,</hi> whether it proceeds from <hi>guilt of mind,</hi> being a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption that naturally would startle <hi>humane nature;</hi> to set surer bounds to Kingdoms than first ordained, or whether it proceeds from the <hi>hardness</hi> or <hi>impossibility</hi> of such an Attempt, sure it is, the Work was discontinued to this day, notwithstanding all the <hi>Conveniencies</hi> may be alleadged for it; for such a <hi>Cutt</hi> would needs make the Trade to the <hi>Archipelago</hi> much shorter and safer, when all the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> those little Islands, or great Rocks, might thereby be avoided: yet if we compare that Isthmus to this Neck of Land which is supposed to joyn <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> what a <hi>petty business</hi> it was, either for the <hi>Sea</hi> sooner to break it down, or for <hi>Man</hi> to remove it?</p>
               <p>The first Demonstration he gives us, is, <hi>That the Neatherlands,</hi> not only those parts of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> which at any time, by Cutting the Banks, may be turned into Sea, but great part of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> which lie so high that they can never be made <hi>Sea</hi> any more, <hi>have in former times been Sea,</hi> and he quoats <hi>Hubert Thomas,</hi> sometimes Secretary unto <hi>Frederick</hi> Count Palatine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who, in his description of the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> saith, <hi>that the Sea hath come up even to the Walls of</hi> Tongres, <hi>and that there remains to this day, great</hi> Iron Rings, <hi>to which the Ships, that there sometime Arrived, were fastened.</hi> Now <hi>Tongres</hi> lies almost an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>English</hi> miles from the Sea, having many pleasant and fertile Countries between that and the Sea.</p>
               <p>That these Provinces have formerly been Sea, the Eaveness of them are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, besides the nature of the Soyl, which in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> is Sandy, besides, in digging (in many places) two Fathom deep, are found innumerable shells of Sea-fish, and in many places great Bones of Fishes, which argues those places
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58825:23"/>
formerly to have been the Sea-shoar, because Shell-fish is naturally bred and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the Flats, and Shoar, and not in the Deep; So that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> must be supposed to have been deep Sea, because in none of those Provinces are any <note place="margin">Utrecht <hi>the Utmost bound of Land.</hi>
                  </note> Shells found under ground; moreover in <hi>Brabant,</hi> there hath been dug up Anchors, and when that famous Cut was digged from <hi>Brussels,</hi> unto the River of <hi>Rupel</hi> at <hi>Willebrook,</hi> begun <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1550, and ended <hi>Anno</hi> 1561, through Corn-lands, Wood-lands and Meadows, for fifteen <hi>English</hi> miles; an Undertaking that shews the Richness of that City; In those daies, there was found among other things the Bones, or Anatomy of a Sea-<hi>Elephant,</hi> the Head of which being reserved, <hi>Verstegan</hi> himself saw.</p>
               <p>Now the cause why those places were Sea, and afterwards became Land, <hi>Verstegan</hi> thinks can be no other than this, <hi>That the Isthmus of Ground between</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>kept up the Northern Seas, so that wanting passage they over-flowed those Countries, and when they had workt themselves through this Neck of Land, they left these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries dry, so that never since they could be over-flown by the Sea;</hi> I mean, those higher places of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant:</hi> And that this could not be the Reason, I hope to demonstrate by several Arguments.</p>
               <p>He himself does acknowledge, that in some Vineyards of <hi>Campagne</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> a high and Hilly Country, many shells of Fishes has been dug up, which he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood; and why, by the same Reason, may not those in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> have the same Originals, seeing they lie so deep under ground as two fathoms, which argues a great Land-flood that could cover them with so much Earth.</p>
               <p>Neither does the multitude of them in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or the paucity of those dug in the <hi>Vineyards,</hi> any thing alter the case, for without doubt, the Waters in the Flood could not so easily carry them to the tops of Mountains, but that the greater number would stick in the Low Countries, as is plain in those <hi>Firr</hi> Trees which were found in the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi> and in some low Grounds of <hi>Lancashire,</hi> and other parts in <hi>England,</hi> with their Roots to the south, and their Heads to the north, which Firr-trees never grew on those Grounds naturally, as it is a Tree of the Mountains, and thrives not but on craggy and barren Hills, as the abundance of them in Upper-Germany do witness.</p>
               <p>But supposing those Parts to have been Sea, those <hi>Iron Rings</hi> which, they say, are yet at <hi>Tongres,</hi> do shew, that they have been Sea a great while since this Isthmus was broken down; For in the daies of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> seventeen Hundred years ago, there was no such thing, nor any memory of it, but the passage from <hi>Itium</hi> and <hi>Ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soriacum,</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> was by Sea.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Iron Rings</hi> exposed to the Weather, and Rust, should continue for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen hundred years, nay this supposed Isthmus, in all Reason, must have been some Hundreds of years before <hi>Caesars</hi> time, otherwise he would have Recorded so memorable an Action, I leave to any Rational man to judge whether it be possible so to be; the like may be said of those <hi>Anchors</hi> found under ground, and not unlike of the Sea-fish <hi>bones</hi> and <hi>shells,</hi> though it is more probable that they being genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Sea, and preserved in a Ground that retained the natural Saltness of the Waters that flung it up, might be preserved longer than Iron, which, by Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, quickly rusts and moulders away into its first Natural constitution, Earth.</p>
               <p>Besides, if this passage of Water through the Isthmus sunk the Sea northward, then that Sea which was south of this Isthmus must rise but upon the very Coasts of <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Dorcet-shire,</hi> which lie south of it; the Inhabitants do shew several Marks, to which, they say, the Tide once did rise, which upon the Level is very much higher than now it flows, and this doth not happen among them only, but the whole World over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> is full of those <hi>Marks,</hi> and so are other Countries; and, I think, it ariseth from a general decay of <hi>Moisture</hi> in the Universe, and that the Earth continually grows dryer and dryer. And, although the Sea may be said to gain in some places (that is) where the Earth fell lower than the Waters, and had nothing to preserve it from being Sea but some continued Ridge, which, by accident, kept the Sea out, and which as soon gone, the Sea broke in; yet as to the whole, the Land hath gained on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58825:24"/>
the Sea, as all parts of the World do evidence: <hi>Delos</hi> was not alwaies visible, great part of <hi>Egypt</hi> was Sea in <hi>Homers</hi> daies, and <hi>Venice</hi> to this day keeps Marks of the falling of their Waters, of which latter Ages have been very sensible; nay, they have a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition among them, <hi>That the Sea, in future times, will forsake their City, and that then the</hi> Government <hi>thereof, and the</hi> City <hi>it self must be destroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>England,</hi> I my self have examined many Coasts both on the East and West parts of it, so that in most places I find there are plain grounds, sometimes half a mile, sometimes a mile broad, which lie between the Sea and some Hills, which Hills, by their steepness and being broken off, seem once to have been washed by the Sea. The soyl of those Meadows now lying higher than the Sea, do argue much that they were once part of it: Neither could I find any other Reason, excepting the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral decay of the Sea in all Parts, why those Coasts once lying under Water, ever became dry Lands. That this has happened in other parts of the World is plain, viz. <hi>That the Water hath left many places it once possessed; Hybanda,</hi> an Island once of <hi>Ionia,</hi> in <hi>Pliny's</hi> daies, was Two hundred <hi>stadia</hi> from the Sea, likewise <hi>Ortygia</hi> is now become a <hi>Peninsula,</hi> by a neck of Ground the Sea hath either left, or flung up.</p>
               <p>I am very certain there are many more Examples in the World of <hi>Peninsula's</hi> made, than destroyed.</p>
               <p>But I leave this to others to judge, whether this be the true Reason or no, <hi>Why the</hi> Neatherlands, <hi>and some parts of</hi> England, <hi>formerly Sea, are now become dry Land,</hi> and so will proceed to shew, <hi>That such an</hi> Isthmus <hi>of ground between</hi> Britain <hi>and</hi> Gaul, <hi>could not be the cause why they were drowned.</hi> Here the cause is not the same (as <hi>Verstegan</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) between these Seas and the <hi>Mare Rubrum,</hi> that is, the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> For although it might be dangerous to cut the Isthmus, and so let the <hi>Red Sea</hi> into the <hi>Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> by reason that the <hi>Red Sea</hi> was the higher, and so inconveniently might be drayned on one side, and several Countries on the other side lying on the Inland-Sea might be drowned, yet the cause could not be so as to this Isthmus between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as is represented in this following Figure:
<figure/>
               </p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:58825:24"/>
               <p>Here I am not to be understood, as though I speak of the <hi>Lunary</hi> Tide, but of the general and constant Flux of Waters. Let <hi>A</hi> be this Isthmus that disjoyns <hi>C France,</hi> and <hi>B Britain, D D D</hi> the North Sea, about the thirteenth Parallel, and uttermost parts of <hi>Scotland;</hi> now this North Sea equally slows upon the Isthmus <hi>A,</hi> and the same opposite Parallel <hi>E,</hi> so that when the Flood is at <hi>A,</hi> or between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Bullen,</hi> it will likewise be the same time at <hi>E,</hi> about South <hi>Wales,</hi> and so going round about the Point <hi>F,</hi> it comes to the other side of the Isthmus <hi>A,</hi> and there raises the Waters at <hi>G;</hi> so that the passage of the North Sea lying so open by <hi>E</hi> and <hi>F,</hi> there can be no difference of the height of Waters at <hi>A</hi> and <hi>G,</hi> which cannot be in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> there being no passage for the <hi>Red Sea</hi> into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> nor is it possible that the Waters of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> can be raised on the other side of that Isthmus, by the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> there being no way for the Waters of the <hi>Red Sea</hi> to come into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> but round about <hi>Africk,</hi> and so thorow the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like may be said of that Isthmus of ground in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> between <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama</hi> and <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> for now there is no passage from the <hi>Pacifick Sea (Core Mar del Zur)</hi> into the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean; so that one Sea may be higher than another, but it cannot be so with this <hi>English</hi> Isthmus, as hath been already shewn.</p>
               <p>But granting that the North Sea, about <hi>Britain D D D,</hi> be higher than the Southern Sea coming in at <hi>F,</hi> yet will not the Shoar <hi>H,</hi> which we suppose to be <hi>Holland</hi> and the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi> be any thing the more under Water, by reason of the Isthmus <hi>A</hi> stopping the passage of the Water, because, as was said before, of the free course of the Northern Sea, by <hi>E, F</hi> and <hi>G,</hi> to the same Isthmus on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</p>
               <p>So, that if we could make an Isthmus from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> yet would it not endanger the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> as we see in the Isthmus in <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> the Sea is equally high on both sides because of the short passage the Waters have round that <hi>Peninsula;</hi> so although the nature of one side of the Sea and its scituation should be higher, yet it comes to a Level, because in so short a turn it would raise the Waters on the other side.</p>
               <p>But how comes it to pass, that the Sea on the North side of the Isthmus is higher than the South, when as the <hi>Inland Sea,</hi> lying on the north and west of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> is lower? But this (amongst <hi>Verstegans</hi> other Opinions and Demonstrations, saies) is plain, as from the Current of Water which runs from the North Sea; so that Old <hi>Shippers</hi> of the <hi>Neatherlands</hi> say, <hi>The Voyage from</hi> Holland <hi>to</hi> Spain <hi>is shorter by a day and a halfs sayling, than from</hi> Spain <hi>to</hi> Holland: This may proceed from several Reasons, as the insensible quickness of some Winds from some Corners over others, and the conveniency of Sea-Marks, which are not the same in going, and returning, although in the same Voyage.</p>
               <p>The Arguments to prove, <hi>that the Sea was higher on the North side, than the South side of this supposed Isthmus,</hi> are taken from the sundry <hi>flats</hi> on the North side, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the bottom of the Sea is supposed to be <hi>higher</hi> than the bottom of that Sea on the South side, and consequently, <hi>the SEA also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To consute this, let us first consider, If there had been such an Isthmus of <hi>Land,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> working forceably upon it from the North side, would have carried the <hi>Earth</hi> of that Isthmus southward, so that for some space of Sea, the bottom would be shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower <hi>Southerly</hi> than <hi>Northerly;</hi> but we find it to the contrary, for on the <hi>North</hi> side the Ryff, which is supposed a Relick of that Isthmus, we find twenty five Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom, on the <hi>South</hi> twenty seven, besides farther you go <hi>Northerly</hi> the <hi>deeper</hi> the Sea is, excepting some Shelves, as off of <hi>Harlem,</hi> eight or nine miles within the Sea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, <hi>De breed Verthien,</hi> reaching along the Coast of <hi>Holland</hi> to the Plain of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where it endeth.</p>
               <p>To manifest this, I will set down the <hi>sounding</hi> of the <hi>North-Sea</hi> from the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:58825:25"/>
                  <head>Depths of the <hi>North Sea</hi> from the <hi>Fore-land.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN the Channel, from <hi>England, Fore-land,</hi> and the Sands of <hi>Flanders,</hi> you have twenty four Fathom; without the Shoald, between <hi>Zealand</hi> and the <hi>Texell,</hi> is twenty six Fathom, as far as the Shoald which the Fishers call <hi>Dog sand,</hi> or <hi>Doggar bank.</hi> In the Channel on <hi>England</hi> side, over against <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> is thirty five Fathom: And against <hi>Flambrough</hi> and <hi>Scarborough</hi> point, is thirty eight Fathom, where the White-shelf, called <hi>Dog-sand</hi> beginneth, from nine to sixteen Fathom, and so reaches Northward, so that the <hi>Depth</hi> encreases Northwards, excepting these Shoalds.</p>
                  <p>All these things laid together, any Judicious mans Opinion may be convinced, that the <hi>Isthmus</hi> here supposed is a meer <hi>Fiction,</hi> and that it could not be the cause of drowning the <hi>Neatherlands,</hi> they having been Sea long after this <hi>Isthmus</hi> could ever be in the World, as I have shewn. Were there an <hi>Isthmus</hi> now risen out of the Earth, it could not in the least endanger the <hi>Neatherlands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall add this, that in those Countries that are <hi>Peninsula's,</hi> we see the <hi>Isthmus</hi> lies on the end, and not on the sides of the Country, and where the Sea hath made a <hi>separation,</hi> yet there has remained some Neck of Ground that hath shot it self into the Sea, sharper and sharper, till it ended in a Point, an evident sign that the Sea has wrought away the Earth before it. But to make a Neck of Ground on the <hi>flat part</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> of twenty miles in length, and six in breadth, to be joyned to a Couple of <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>flat Clyffs,</hi> seems rather to build a Bridge, than to evidence an Isthmus.</p>
                  <p>As for that Argument, <hi>How</hi> Wolves <hi>and</hi> Foxes <hi>came into</hi> England? I think it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unnecessary to build them a Passage; for the same Reasons that induced <hi>Noah</hi> to preserve their kind, would also perswade men to Transport them; for their nature was not unknown to <hi>Noah,</hi> neither are those Creatures without their use, in Countries that are not thoroughly Inhabited, God having so ordered the <hi>natures</hi> of Animals, <hi>that one should destroy another,</hi> least the <hi>Beast of the field</hi> should too much increase upon <hi>Man!</hi> So that in Countries that are not thorowly Planted, at <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and some parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it has been a great question, <hi>whether they do not more good than harm,</hi> seeing that any Nation, when it is fully Peopled, can destroy them at their pleasure? as <hi>England</hi> hath done, by the Order of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and Others, when the <hi>Tribute</hi> of the <hi>Welch</hi> Princes was, <hi>so many</hi> Wolves <hi>Heads yearly,</hi> till at last there was none remaining.</p>
                  <p>If there were nothing else but the <hi>Recreation</hi> they afforded in Hunting, and do yet afford, where the Inhabitants are not so many, but they can suffer sometimes loss of Cattle; I say, if there were nothing else, we may easily suppose, <hi>that the First Planters of Countries, after they had setled themselves, would cause them to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for their Pleasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The World in its Infancy was much given to <hi>Hunting,</hi> as <hi>Nimrod</hi> is said, <hi>to be a great Hunter before the Lord,</hi> so was <hi>Esau,</hi> and <hi>Zenophon</hi> makes his young <hi>Cyrus</hi> take great delight in slaying of <hi>Wild Beasts;</hi> so that though these <hi>Wolves</hi> have been the destruction of two <hi>British</hi> Princes, <hi>Madan</hi> and <hi>Memprcius,</hi> yet they have been the delight of many more. There is no one Conveniency in the World, but some Inconveniencies or others may attend it.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reason why <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Wolves</hi> are not convenient for such Islands, as <hi>Wight, &amp;c.</hi> and so are never Imported into them, is, <hi>because those Islands, being small, cannot admit of them, either for sport or safety, by reason they must be mixt with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,</hi> for so small an extent of Ground, hath none or very little <hi>waste ground,</hi> where the Recreation can be carried on without mutual invading of Propriety; whereas in so large Countries as <hi>England,</hi> where there has been more <hi>waste ground</hi> than now there is, they have afforded most excellent sport, with little or no peril, or inconvenience.</p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:58825:25"/>
                  <p>But, if this Argument should hold against <hi>England,</hi> it would in like manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst many other Places in the known World, there being divers Islands that are far distant from the Continent than this is, and which were never supposed to be joyned with it, and have abounded with the very same, or as noctious Animals as these; And so in many places in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> as <hi>Java, Sumatra,</hi> and other large Islands, and of all the <hi>West Indies</hi> in general; for supposing that the vast Continent northward of <hi>New England,</hi> should joyn with some parts of the Continent of the Old World, yet were it impossible that way to bring those Creatures, by reason of the vast Ice and Snows, covering the Earth, would yield no nourishment for them in their passage, by reason there are no Beasts to prey upon in those Climates, unless the <hi>Deer,</hi> and the <hi>Bears,</hi> which, as Sea-men witness, abound in those parts under the Cold, the first for their <hi>swiftness,</hi> the other for their <hi>fierceness</hi> and <hi>strong natures.</hi> And if the <hi>Cold</hi> in those Countries do not stop or destroy them, want of necessary food would do it. Neither is it supposed for Beasts of Prey, to have any natural desire farther than the present Object, or that they would leave the <hi>Flocks</hi> and <hi>Herds</hi> in pleasant and fertile Countries, over which they had dominion, to seek out new Acquests in <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> places. On the South parts of <hi>America</hi> there is no passage for them, unless we suppose the Streights of <hi>Magellan</hi> once to have been conjoyned, a thing not easily to be granted to these <hi>Isthmus</hi> Makers; and what is as Ridiculous, as some Atlantick-Islands lying not far off <hi>Africa,</hi> should extend either to the Caribee-Islands, or St. <hi>Domingo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Granting a Passage at the <hi>Magellan</hi> Streights, yet the <hi>Heat</hi> of those Parts would stop their passage as much as the <hi>Cold</hi> on the Northern side, there being Beasts in the temperate parts of <hi>America,</hi> that can as little endure the heat of some, as the extream cold in other places.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> treating of this Subject, after he had laid down, <hi>that they were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for the delight of Man</hi> (meaning the Islands of the <hi>Old World) for as yet, many Centuries after the</hi> New World <hi>was not found, had recourse to the Ministery of Angels,</hi> and much more had it been necessary, had he lived in our daies, since, by the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Navigation,</hi> the <hi>New World</hi> hath been discovered, and several Islands in the Atlantick-Ocean. To instance in <hi>Barmudas,</hi> some hundreds of Leagues from any Continent, which nevertheless when they were discovered, abounded in some sorts of greater Animals.</p>
                  <p>I remember, in reading the Prodigies of <hi>Old Rome,</hi> in observing of which some Authors were very diligent, it is reported, that once, <hi>in viâ Fornicatâ,</hi> it rained a <hi>Calf,</hi> if true, was it not a work of the <hi>Prince of the Air,</hi> to terrifie and amaze the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by so sudden a surprize? I question not, but the Transporting of <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Foxes,</hi> will be rather thought a work of the <hi>Devil</hi> than <hi>Angels,</hi> especially by those that receive damage by them.</p>
                  <p>And in the stories of <hi>New Rome,</hi> which are very busie in employing of <hi>Angels,</hi> I find but one Monument of their Actions in this nature, and that is <hi>Our Ladies</hi> Chappel of <hi>Loretto,</hi> so that we will leave this solution of the Doubt, and pass to the <hi>third Way,</hi> the same St. <hi>Augustine</hi> proposes, and that is this, in his own words, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
                  <p>[<hi>But if they sprung out of the Earth, according to their first Original (when as, God said,</hi> Let the Earth bring forth a Living soul) <hi>then it appears much more evident, That</hi> all kind <hi>of</hi> Living Creatures <hi>were in the</hi> Ark, <hi>not so much for the increase and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of them, as to figure out sundry</hi> Nations <hi>for the Sacrament of the Church, in case the</hi> Earth <hi>brought forth many Creatures in those</hi> Islands, <hi>whereunto they could not pass.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>Here we see, St. <hi>Augustine</hi> grants, that the <hi>Earth</hi> might bring forth Animals after the <hi>Flood,</hi> by that spirit of <hi>Generation</hi> that God had first infused into it. This I leave to <hi>Divines</hi> to judge, as it is a mystical Relation, between the kinds of Beasts in the <hi>Ark,</hi> and those that were to spring out of the <hi>Earth</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is a flight peculiar to St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> whose volatile Soul often dived into those Depths, common Capacities are not able to fathom.</p>
                  <p>In my serious thoughts, this <hi>Solution</hi> seems more rational than the other, for who can ever imagine, that all <hi>Beasts</hi> of the Earth in their different <hi>kinds,</hi> every <hi>kind</hi> should have one beginning of its Race to which it referred its Original, and that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58825:26"/>
they had some principal who might be reckoned to be
<q>Dux gregis ipse caper —</q>
It is sufficient that the <hi>Ark</hi> bore the <hi>types</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> of all Species, and that the Earth in producing <hi>living Creatures,</hi> was to be subject to those Patterns God had preserv'd for it, and not to be extravagant or deficient in the number of the Species, and their forms, but to keep exactly to all those lines that God had drawn in those <hi>Creatures</hi> in the Ark, he having shaped them to that proportion of Limbs and strength, and distinguisht them in their several Natures and Capacities, as in his Infinite Wisdom he fore-saw would be most convenient for Mans use, and answerable to the Earths production. And this order and government of <hi>Nature</hi> we find in the least and minute Insects, which although they be various in their kinds, yet doth not one kind interfere with another, but a steady and certain method may be discerned in their Production, one answering another in the same kind exactly, that it is a great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to see the uniform symetery of their Parts, in so small and little Models, so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely preserved.</p>

                     <hi>out of the Earth,</hi> and that it was the certain Traditions of those Ancient times, wherein is also particularly described the manner of their Productions, with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of <hi>Fish, Beasts</hi> and <hi>Fowls,</hi> in the nature of their Generation, <hi>viz.</hi> How the <hi>Earth,</hi> being in the nature of one great Bogg, or Moor, which must be imagined so to be, and so to continue long after the general Deluge, out of the watery part of it produced <hi>Fish,</hi> whilst that part had more spirit, and was more refined, gave being to the <hi>Fowls of the Air,</hi> who following the volatile nature of their Original, took wing, some more, some less, according as they consisted of a grosser or purer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whilst the earthlier and drossy part of Matter gave being to those Creatures which are stiled <hi>Prona naturâ, &amp; humi fixa,</hi> heavily creeping upon that Earth, from whose deadest part they proceeded.</p>
                  <p>Not withstanding all this, we ought not to expect these Procreations from the <hi>Earth,</hi> who long since have disburthened it self of those <hi>Forms</hi> at first it retained in its womb, when it was pregnant with the Species of all Creatures, it having long since lost its <hi>Moisture</hi> which then opened its Womb, so that it is now become the dead Supporter, and final Receiver of its former and primitive Births; yet in some parts of it, as in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the Soyl is kept <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>moist</hi> by the Inundation of <hi>Nile,</hi> there is daily experience of its <hi>generations,</hi> though small and abortive, as in <hi>Mice,</hi> and such like Vermin: Creatures, though little in comparison of what it hath brought forth, yet great, in respect to what in other Places it produces. These re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main now the only Instances, and Monuments, of that wondrous fertility it once enjoyed: so I think, to bring the Originals of all Creatures from any particular quarter of the Earth, is a great disparagement to its other Parts. As the <hi>Jews</hi> fancy their Country <hi>the Navel of the Earth,</hi> this would be to make its <hi>Womb</hi> at <hi>Babylon,</hi> or some part of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where ever the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>Now, to return to <hi>England,</hi> I think it not necessary at all to build any <hi>Isthmus,</hi> in order to the bringing in of <hi>Wolves,</hi> or to solve such a little piece of Philosophy, to make this Ancient and Renowned ISLAND, once a hanger on, or part of the Continent.</p>
                  <p>It was ever the Glory and Safety of <hi>GREAT BRITAIN</hi> to be environed by the Sea, and to command those Waters that encompass it, and whilst other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are subject to daily Incursions, being separated only by <hi>Rivers, Hills,</hi> or <hi>Valleys,</hi> and imaginary <hi>Lines,</hi> by turns, one Kingdom often Elbows out another; But Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has set <hi>BRITAIN</hi> such distinct Bounds and Limits, that its Empire is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served entire; and as it abounds in All things, both for the necessary delight and support of Man, and needs not the World to sustain it, so was it alwaies esteemed, and called, <hi>Novus Orbis, &amp; Orbis</hi> BRITANNICUS, by reason of its <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and especially Separation from the <hi>Continent,</hi> for proceeding from the <hi>East</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:58825:26"/>
through that vast Tract of Ground which contains so many Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and arriving on the Coasts of <hi>France, Normandy, Picardy,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> ones Fancy tired with so long a Progress, would naturally imagine that on that Shoar was the uttermost bounds and limits of the Earth, and that there was nothing Westward but a vast Ocean. But as soon as the <hi>British</hi> Island discovered it self by its <hi>High</hi> and <hi>White Rocks,</hi> it is no wonder it should be called, <hi>a distinct <hi>WORLD</hi> by it self,</hi> being of so large an extent, that for many years after the <hi>Romans</hi> had discovered it, it was not known whether it was an Island, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of another Continent Westward. That it ever was joyned Eastward to the Continent of <hi>France,</hi> as there is no Tradition for it, so there is no real Truth in it, and so I shall leave it, as I found it encompast by the Sea, with these Verses (out of Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>) upon the Streights, the matter of which, I question not, will be verified in all Ages to come.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> When <hi>BRITAIN</hi> was first known to the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians,</hi> And how it received its Name from them.</head>
               <p>HAVING shewn that <hi>BRITAIN</hi> was originally an <hi>ISLAND,</hi> and in the greatest probability Peopled from the Continent by the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Nation; I come now to Treat of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who although lived upon the most Easternly part of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> as <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> yet by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Shipping, and the many Colonies they had upon the <hi>Streights,</hi> are supposed not to be long after, if not contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with the <hi>Cimbri</hi> in this Island. And from these <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> are the first Antiquities of this Nation to be derived, upon the account, that their Voyages hither may be proved by the Authority of the best Authors.</p>
               <p>Their Language is sufficiently known, being a Dialect of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Syrian</hi> Tongue, by which Language they are traced through all the Coasts and Islands of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, giving Names to those Countries they Arrived at, according to the respective Commodities they afforded, or the nature of the Soyl, or some such notorious qualities, which Names, though a little varied by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the <hi>Romans,</hi> remained till the fall of those Empires, and many of them remain unto this day.</p>
               <p>And as they gave Names to all places on the <hi>Midland-Sea,</hi> so passing the <hi>Streights</hi> they gave name to this <hi>ISLAND.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth of this will appear, when I shall have shewn that they were here long before the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> did take the name of <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> as well as of most other Countries, from them; And before I proceed, I will here speak something of the Custome of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in giving Names to places, they being not so early Marriners as the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and finding that all Countries had received some denomination or other from these Traders, they took the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Name and translated it into a word of their own, agreeing with it either in signification, or sound, The latter of which waies was the most ingenious, because by so doing they preserved something of the true Original, which will appear plainly in the fore-going Mapp of the <hi>Ancient WORLD,</hi> I have collected for that purpose. Thus from <hi>Cham</hi> they made <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Copher,</hi>

                  </gap>, and the like, and had they done no otherwise, certainly the Original of names of Places had not been so obscure.</p>
               <p>But we may find that in other Countries they were not so sincere, as when they changed some material Letter, and then placed some fable or other of their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, for the derivation of that Country, as making the <hi>Phoenician Itaria,</hi> or the Country of <hi>Pitch,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so derived it from a <hi>Calf,</hi> so <hi>Borsa</hi> became <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and the like, upon all which some ridiculous story or other depends.</p>
               <p>But, the greatest falsification was, when they understood the sence and meaning of a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Name, they translated it into a word of their own Language, agreeing in signification, but not sound; thus <hi>Gomet</hi> they made <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> therefore being the <hi>first</hi> Traders, from them are the Names of this Island, <hi>ALBION</hi> and <hi>BRITANNIA,</hi> to be derived, and that it may appear more evidently, I will <hi>first</hi> prove by sufficient Authors, that they first Traded hither and that very early. In the <hi>second</hi> place, from several Arguments drawn from the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58825:27"/>
                  <hi>Greek</hi> Writers themselves. <hi>Lastly,</hi> from the foot-steps of their <hi>Language,</hi> as likewise their <hi>Customes</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> setled in this ISLAND; of all which I shall make manifest in their Order.</p>
               <p>THE first discovery of this ISLAND, as may be gathered by Ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, was by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> some say by <hi>Hercules,</hi> others by <hi>Himiclo,</hi> who was sent with a <hi>Fleet</hi> through the <hi>Streights</hi> to discover the Western Seas, which he did [as <hi>Fuller</hi> reports] by the help of the <hi>Load-stone,</hi> which he will needs have the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to have known, and to have kept as a great Secret.</p>
               <p>But as their Voyages by Sea were so Famous and many, it gave occasion to <hi>Fuller</hi> to think, that they exceeded other Nations by the vertue of this Secret, so have we seen by what Motives he was mistaken; for because this Stone was called <hi>Heraclea,</hi> he imagined the Name might be given it from <hi>HERCULES,</hi> in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and not from <hi>Heraclea,</hi> a City in <hi>Magnesia</hi> (from whence also it was called <hi>MAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES</hi> by the Latins) <hi>because,</hi> saies he, <hi>it would have then been called</hi> Heracleotis, <hi>not</hi> Heraclea, not considering, or at least dissembling, if it was to be derived from <hi>HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CULES,</hi> it ought to be rather from the Greek <hi>Hercules</hi> than the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> because the Greek <hi>Hercules</hi> was in <hi>Lydia,</hi> and resided about <hi>Omphal,</hi> where he might find this Stone, for <hi>Magnesia</hi> is part of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I presume, it will never be granted that such a <hi>Secret,</hi> so useful and advantagious for Mankind, if it was known to the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> could ever have been lost. For granting that some Arts, once known to Mankind, have been by time forgotten, yet we shall alwaies find, that they rather concerned the <hi>pleasure</hi> and <hi>luxury</hi> of Man, than his real profit, and which were supplied by others with greater ease, and no less delight.</p>
               <p>However it be, we shall find that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were the first that discovered these <hi>ISLANDS</hi> long before the First <hi>Olympiad,</hi> [The beginning of which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Julian</hi> Account, was <hi>Anno</hi> 3938, from the Year of the World 3256, from the Temple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 263.] as I shall prove by and by.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> himself Learnedly proves, that these <hi>Cassiterides</hi> were the <hi>Scilly</hi>

               <p>Now, because these Islands were the first of all BRITAIN, as they were so called, that were discovered by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> lying exactly against <hi>Spain,</hi> on which Coast, it is supposed, the first.

                  <head>That these Islands of <hi>Scilly</hi> were the <hi>Cassiterides</hi> of the Ancients.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FIrst,</hi> We have the Authority of <hi>Strabo,</hi> as to their Position, full opposite to the <hi>Artebri,</hi> that is, <hi>Gallitia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> those Islands Northwards are discovered, <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> which are called <hi>CASSITERIDES,</hi> placed after a manner in the same Clime with <hi>Britain.</hi> This Description cannot suit with any other Islands in the West Sea, for the <hi>Asores</hi> bare westward of <hi>Gallitia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> when the <hi>Cassiterides</hi> are said to be northward; so that the <hi>Asores</hi> cannot be they, neither are the <hi>Asores</hi> near the Eighth Climate, which is the vttermost Climate of the South parts of <hi>England,</hi> and so could not be said by <hi>Strabo,</hi> to be almost in the same Climate; In another place <hi>Strabo</hi> saies, <hi>That the Sea, between</hi> Spain <hi>and the</hi> Cassiterides <hi>is broader than that which lieth between the</hi> Cassiterides <hi>and</hi> Britain; so that <hi>Olivarius</hi> his Opinion is cut off, who makes them <note place="margin">Olivarius.</note> 
                     <hi>Cysarga,</hi> for <hi>Cysarga</hi> lieth on the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coasts, almost close upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
                  <p>Next to him we have the Opinion of <hi>Solinus,</hi> in these words [<hi>The</hi> Cassiterides <note place="margin">Solinus.</note> 
                     <hi>look towards the Coasts of</hi> Celtiberia;] Now the <hi>Asores</hi> look no more towards that Coast, or bear no more upon it, than they do upon the Coast of <hi>Asrick;</hi> and as for <hi>Cysarga,</hi> lying upon <hi>Spain,</hi> it cannot be proper to say it looks towards it, for that term in Geography is used to Places that have some distance, yet lie in some relation as to Parallels and Clymes. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> writes, <hi>In the Islands next to the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <hi>Sea for their</hi> Tynn, <hi>are called CASSITERIDES,</hi> which description is only proper to the Islands of <hi>Scilly,</hi> for <hi>Cysarga</hi> is not next to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Sea, but in it, and as for the <hi>Asores,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Sea was never extended so far.</p>
                  <p>That which has made the greater doubt, is, the words of <hi>Eustathius; There be Ten Islands</hi> (saies he) <hi>called</hi> CASSITERIDES, <hi>lying close together Northward,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eustathius.</note> when as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> makes them in all One hundred forty five. <note place="margin">Cambden.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Answer this, let us consider that in no part of the Western Seas there are Ten Islands lying close together, no more, nor no less, and we must understand <hi>Eustathius</hi> either to have written of the Principal only, which are but Ten, namely, St. <hi>Maries, Annoth, Agnes, Samson, Silly, Brefer, Rusco</hi> or <hi>Truscaw,</hi> St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> St. <hi>Martins,</hi> and <hi>Arthur,</hi> which is not unusual in Geographers; or, which is most probable, that in those daies of the Ancients, they had no certain knowledge of these Remote parts of the Earth, more than we have now of the Islands of <hi>Mar del Zur,</hi> the passage through the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> being as full of Difficulties, or more, than those of <hi>Magellan</hi> are to us.</p>
                  <p>Neither can this number of the <hi>Cassiterides</hi> make, but that they are the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands, any more than the <hi>Hebades,</hi> which by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> are made Five, and the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades</hi> Thirty, take from the truth of those Islands, because in the discovery of them <note place="margin">Prolomy. Cambden. Bochartus.</note> they are not found now exactly of that number. The Chief of them that have Names are these;</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Maries,</hi> five miles over, nine in compass; <hi>Agnus</hi> Isle, six miles over; <hi>Annot, Minwisand, Smithy-sound, Suartigan, Rousuian, Ronsuiar;</hi> the <hi>Cregwin, Moncarthat, Inis-Welseck, Suechial, Rat</hi> Island, <hi>Anwell, Brior, Rusco,</hi> as great as St. <hi>Maries;</hi> the <hi>Round</hi> Island, St. <hi>Lides</hi> Island, <hi>Notho, Aving, Tyan,</hi> St. <hi>Martins</hi> Isle, <hi>Knolworth, Sni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiver, Menwetham, Vollis, Survihe, Vollis</hi> again, <hi>Arthurs</hi> Island, <hi>Guiviliner, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nech, Gothrois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which is most material, is, that they have Veins of <hi>Tynn,</hi> which no other Islands in this Tract have, and according to those descriptions of <hi>Strabo, Solinus, Diod. Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Eustathius,</hi> have, as witnesseth Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> and <hi>Bocartus;</hi> Besides Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> according to his usual manner, hath found two of the lesser of them to have their Names from the <hi>Mines,</hi> as <hi>Minan Witham,</hi> and <hi>Minuisisand;</hi> so that laying all Circumstances together in the words of Mr. <hi>Cambden: Seeing these Islands of</hi> Scilly <hi>are opposite to the</hi> Artebri, <hi>viz.</hi> Gallia <hi>in</hi> Spain; <hi>seeing they bend directly Northward from them; seeing they are placed in the same Clime of</hi> Britain; <hi>seeing they look towards the Coast of</hi> Celtiberia; <hi>seeing they are disjoyned by a far broader Sea from</hi> Spain <hi>than</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:58825:28"/>
Britain; <hi>seeing they lie next to the</hi> Spanish <hi>Sea; seeing they lie hard one by another to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North, and TEN only of them of any good account;</hi> that which is most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, <hi>seeing they have Veins of</hi> Tynn, <hi>as no other Islands have besides them in this Tract,</hi> I think we have as much demonstration, that these ISLES of <hi>Scilly</hi> were the <hi>Cassiterides</hi> of the Ancients, as we have for any Kingdom under the Sun, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription we find in Geographers.</p>
                  <p>This therefore being granted, that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Traded hither, which I shall <note place="margin">This Island took not us Name from <hi>Brit, Brith,</hi> or <hi>Canta.</hi>
                     </note> prove, from hence may be gathered the Name of <hi>BRITAIN</hi> it self, and that from these Islands, and part of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> this whole Island first received its Name not from <hi>Brit,</hi> or <hi>Brith</hi> and <hi>Canta,</hi> as some will have it: so that what Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> ends his History of <hi>Britain</hi> with, <hi>viz.</hi> the ISLES of <hi>SCILLY,</hi> from thence I shall begin to derive its Name, and clearly demonstrate to any, that the Western-name of this Island, in process of time denominated the whole, as in after Ages it happened to the Monarchy it self, the West <hi>Saxons</hi> taking in the Heptarchy, united the whole Kingdom under one entire Government.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reader is desired to recollect what before I have writ concerning the <hi>Greeks,</hi> their way of denominating of Kingdoms, and it will be found from whence and from whom they called these Islands <hi>CASSITERIDES,</hi> which could be from no other than the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who alone knew them, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made appear, but for the better satisfaction shall discourse it more at large.</p>
                  <p>WHAT the <hi>Graecians</hi> call <hi>CASSITERIS,</hi> or the Country of <hi>Tynn,</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Language, which was but only a Dialect of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (as all <note place="margin">
                        <hi>BRITAIN</hi> truly derived from <hi>Brat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anac.</hi>
                     </note> know that have read <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>Poenus,</hi> or any of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Records) is, <hi>BARAC-ANAC,</hi> or <hi>BRACANAC,</hi> the first <hi>a</hi> or <hi>Patha</hi> being, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Eastern</hi> Languages, silenced in a <hi>Sheva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this word <hi>Bratanac</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, signifies the very same thing as <hi>Cassiteris, viz.</hi> A Country, or Field of <hi>Tynn,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> Learnedly proves, <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> from whom I confess my self to have gathered it, and taken the first hints of this Derivation upon this very account, in all reason it is to be supposed, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> hearing the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in their Language call these Islands, to which they Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>Tynn, Bratanac,</hi> they gave them the name <hi>Cassiterides,</hi> signifying the same thing.</p>
                  <p>When the word <hi>Bratanac</hi> by the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Marriners prevailed more, and more, then the <hi>Greeks</hi> were obliged to receive it, but mollifying it after their manner, as I have shewn, yet not so far as at first to make it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> but preserved the last <hi>c</hi> of <hi>Bratanac,</hi> by which they acknowledged it a <hi>Phoenician</hi> derivation, which is very remarkable, so that <hi>Strabo</hi> all along calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Bretanica,</hi> not <hi>Bretania;</hi> so that <hi>Bretanica</hi> is Ancienter than <hi>Bretannia,</hi> as <hi>Punicûm,</hi> and <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum,</hi> derived from <hi>Phoenix,</hi> are Ancienter than <hi>Poenum,</hi> which yet seems to be of a more primitive extract, and nature. The same may be said of <hi>Afri, Marmoridae, Messabatae,</hi> later in time than their Primitives, <hi>Africa, Marmarica, Messabatica</hi> (as Learned <hi>Bochartus</hi> proves) from whence they were derived.</p>
                  <p>Now the reason of this Chang of <hi>Bretanica</hi> into <hi>Bretania,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is this, because <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> seems, according to the Idiom of their Language, to be an Adjective, and so defective in sence without <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> joyned to it, might give occasion of mistake in Readers to understand it, which was alwaies carefully prevented by the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who studied nothing more than Elegancy of stile.</p>
                  <p>In that little Book <hi>De Mundo,</hi> which is falsly fathered upon <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as, besides other Errors, the Luxury of the stile witnesseth, I find <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanica</hi> the primitive Substantive, by Error, turned into an Adjective. So that when once <hi>Bretanica,</hi> or <hi>Bratanac,</hi> came to be <hi>Bretannia,</hi> we ought not to wonder at the several Changes, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:58825:29"/>
                  <p>But to clear every point, I will further search this Termination of BRITANNIA, which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that being a frequent Termination of Countries in the World, as <hi>Germania, Pomerania, Transylvania,</hi> and <hi>Romania;</hi> this I believe was the reason too why <hi>Bretanica</hi> was turned into <hi>Britannia,</hi> because it corresponded with the Idiom of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Terminations; and Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> saies, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> makes the Composition, but if it end in a Vowel, as <hi>Mauri, Aqui,</hi> the <hi>T</hi> is put in for sounds sake, because <hi>Mauriania, Aquiania</hi> cannot sound well, and that <hi>T</hi> is a letter often used <hi>Euphoniae gratiâ</hi> [as it is aster <hi>ce</hi> in <hi>French, cet un,</hi> and <hi>n</hi> among the <hi>Saxons</hi> before a Vowel, as <hi>an Island,</hi>] among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> without any other signification; as any one versed in that Language may understand.

                  <p>Thus much considered concerning <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>And if <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>So that when <hi>Bratanac</hi> was mollified first into <hi>Bretanica,</hi> as in <hi>Strabo,</hi> than into <hi>Bretania;</hi> It is to be supposed, the People were called <hi>Bretani, Brittani,</hi> by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> or something like it, according to the Dialect of their Neighbours, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Brit,</hi> or <hi>Brith,</hi> but by diminution and corruption; as at this day we call a <hi>Switzar,</hi> a <hi>Swis;</hi> so that although the <hi>Saxons</hi> called the <hi>Britains,</hi> in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <gap reason="foreign">

For granting, just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Saxons</hi> daies they were called <hi>Brits, Brittae,</hi> yea and in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies too, yet this makes not that <hi>Britannia</hi> came from <hi>Brit,</hi> this Age being many hundred years subsequent to the first discovery of it by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and how <hi>Bratanac</hi> might be altered and changed in those daies, delivered only from mouth to mouth, in a Rude and ignorant Age, wherein they had few Records and Writings, I leave it to the wisest to judge.</p>
                  <p>And here it is carefully to be noted, that in deriving of Nations and People, we mistake not in the primitive and first Name, by thinking that to be it which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is only part of the whole, and not a distinct composure by it self, as here it is in <hi>Brit</hi> and <hi>ania,</hi> where <hi>Brit</hi> is only made part of the signification, and <hi>ania,</hi> because it corresponds with other like Terminations, is only a hanger on: To give one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of the Euxine-Sea, called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To shew a little of these sorts of Derivations, I shall instance in two only, BRITAIN, and <hi>LONDON</hi> its Famous Metropolis. I desire the Reader, for diversion sake, to imagine himself living two or three thousand years hence, as <hi>Ovid</hi> wittily makes his <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and suppose likewise that some fatal Barbarism should over-run the World, that most Writings and Records of <hi>Britain</hi> were lost, and only the Name of it, and some of our present Language and <hi>Roman</hi> Histories preserved, let us then see which way men would go to work; perhaps some or other might happily blunder upon <hi>Brutus,</hi> but, by the wary and judicious, that would soon be exploded, as too fabulous to derive <hi>Britannia;</hi> Well then, first <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that must be granted to have been a Termination of that Kingdom, which in the Reign of King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second (as we find on an English-Coyn was called BRITAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIA) so that it is evident it was named so in those daies, all the pudder will be about BRIT, but saies one I have found it, <hi>Britannia</hi> was called from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> word <hi>Bright,</hi> signifying <hi>Shining,</hi> and so, <hi>Britanni quasi Brightania,</hi> for I find that the <hi>English</hi> in those daies had a project to leave out those Letters as superfluous which sounded not in the Pronunciation, so that <hi>g</hi> and <hi>h</hi> being left out, <hi>Britannia</hi> is as much as the <hi>Light,</hi> or <hi>shining</hi> Country, for I find in a <hi>Roman</hi> Satyrist
<q>—<hi>minimâ contentos, noite</hi> Britannos.</q>
In which words the Poet intimates its derivation, for the <hi>Britains</hi> have but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Night,</hi> and in some parts none at all, so that the business now is ended, and we have a solid and unquestionable derivation of its Name.</p>
                  <p>In like manner would they proceed in deriving the Great and Famous Metropolis <hi>LONDON.</hi> I have seen, saies one, upon this great and noble River (but by what name the <hi>Thames</hi> will be then called, God alone knoweth) the Ruines of a CITY, which extends six miles in length, and in breadth not above one quarter of a mile, and this I guess was <hi>LONDON</hi> of the Ancients, or <hi>Long-Cown,</hi> so called by the <hi>English,</hi> by reason of its vast disproportion in <hi>length</hi> to the <hi>breadth</hi> of it; and so you see <hi>London</hi> is also dispatched.</p>
                  <p>But if in truth I may deliver my Opinion, there is no way more fallacious and deceitful, in deriving of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> than from the Language of the People, for I scarce think there is a <hi>Town,</hi> or any place in <hi>England,</hi> but by fertile Heads may be derived from some word or other that is now in use among its present Inhabitants, every place yielding something, either by <hi>Scituation, Soyl,</hi> or else Creek of <hi>Rivers,</hi> Prospect of <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Valleys, Customes</hi> and <hi>Manners, Battles, Buildings,</hi> with thon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of other Circumstances too tedious to mention, from whence they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                  <p>Now I leave it to any Rational man to judge, whether it be not more proper and consonant to Reason, to derive Places from their undoubted <hi>Trade,</hi> by which they were known to all the World, as the Isles of <hi>SCILLY</hi> were, by the name of <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terides</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Barat-anac</hi> or <hi>Bratanac</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them from the uncertain sound and coincidency of a word, with some light and trivial Custome among them.</p>
                  <p>The Reason that absolutely confirms me in the Opinion, the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands gave Name at last to this Great ISLAND, that now alone keeps the name of <hi>Britannia,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pliny.</note> is, because <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that this Island was called <hi>ALBION,</hi> when as all the Islands adjacent were called <hi>BRITAIN:</hi> so that we see the name of <hi>Bratanac</hi> first took place in the adjacent Islands, before it came on the main Land of <hi>Albion,</hi> but in succession of Time the Name gaining footing in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> it prevailed at last over all the Island, and the greater part swallowed up at last the Name of the whole, although corrupted and distorted by the several Dialects it ran through.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:58825:30"/>
                  <p>And that the exported Commodities of Countries gave Names anciently to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by which they were most commonly known, although they might have other Names peculiar to themselves, will be manifest, if we consider how <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Ebora,</hi> part of <hi>Spain,</hi> took their names from <hi>Corn, Iava,</hi> called of Old <hi>Iabaduc,</hi> from <hi>Barley; Carmania, Cremetes, Sicilia, Inychus, Anapus, Arvisium, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rambys,</hi> from <hi>Wine; Ruspina</hi> and <hi>Ebusus,</hi> from <hi>Figgs; Zaita</hi> and <hi>Uzita,</hi> from <hi>Olives; Lusitania,</hi> not from <hi>Lysus</hi> the Son of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> but from the abundance of <hi>Chesnuts</hi> called <hi>Luza,</hi> and the delicacy of them, a great Merchandize in those daies, and brought from those parts of <hi>Spain. Italy</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> took their Names from the <hi>Pitch</hi> they yielded; <hi>Cythnus</hi> from its <hi>Cheese, Calymna</hi> and <hi>Alabus</hi> from its <hi>Hony; Caristus, Achates,</hi> from certain <hi>Stones</hi> found there, and the <hi>British</hi> Islands from its <hi>Mettal;</hi> as also <hi>Chasus, Chryse, Odonis, Siphnus, Cimese, Carcoma, Orospeda,</hi> with many others.</p>
                  <p>For considering the many diversities of <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> in this Island, it is not reasonably to be supposed, that they had one common Name among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by which the whole Island was known, unless they had it from Forreigners who Traded with them.</p>
                  <p>If we examine the Original Names of all Nations, we shall find that the Name by which they are known to the World, differs much from those Names they have from themselves, and by which too they do distinguish one another; yet the Major part of the World which is <hi>ab extra</hi> to every particular Kingdom, prevails in the denomination, therefore it happens that those Kingdoms themselves so denominated, are obliged to conform to those Appellations given them by the Major part; and therefore that saying of <hi>Isidore, That the</hi> BRITAINS <hi>were called so from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isidore:</note> 
                     <hi>within them,</hi> in my reason as it makes no more for <hi>Brit, Painting,</hi> than for King <hi>BRUTUS,</hi> is to be neglected. For the same Motives that could make an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian write so much, might have enabled him to have writ more; for he that can positively affirm, that a NAME comes from within a Kingdom, and not from without, in my Opinion, ought to be particular in valuable Reasons, otherwise he had better be silent, being against the experience of the World; <hi>That Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Names not from themselves, but others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Isidore</hi> means, that <hi>BRITAIN</hi> had something <hi>within it</hi> from whence Strangers gave it that Name, then none can deny it, for it is true, that these Islands took their Name from the <hi>TYNN</hi> they yielded, though not all alike and at the same time.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot but wonder, that when Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> had laid down, that <hi>CUMERO</hi> was the primitive Name of the Inhabitants, by which they called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, he then in answer to his own Questions, <hi>Whence then came</hi> ALBION? <hi>Whence came</hi> BRITAIN? saies, <hi>that those Names came either from themselves, or from others,</hi> when just before he had given Examples, <hi>That Countries have different Names, some Names by which they called themselves, others by which they were called of Strangers, for as follows,</hi> I will set down his own words; <hi>They that were called</hi> Israelites, saies he, <hi>by the</hi> Greeks, <hi>were called</hi> Hebrews <hi>and</hi> Jews, <hi>by the</hi> AEgyptians <hi>Huesi,</hi> as witnesseth <hi>Manethon:</hi> so the <hi>Greeks</hi> named those <hi>Syrians</hi> (who as <hi>Josephus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Manethon. Josephus.</note> writes) called themselves <hi>Aramaeans;</hi> they which named themselves <hi>Chusians,</hi> were by the <hi>Graecians,</hi> for their black Faces, called <hi>AEthiopians,</hi> those which after their own Speech were called <hi>Celtae,</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> named <hi>Galatae,</hi> so those that nominated themselves, after their own Language, <hi>Teutsch, Numideans</hi> and <hi>Hellens,</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were named <hi>Germans, Mauri</hi> and <hi>Graecians:</hi> even so in these daies, not to speak of many others, they which in their own Idiom, <hi>Musselmans, Magier, Czec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> and <hi>Bessermans,</hi> are by all Nations in Europe named <hi>Turks, Hungarians, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> and <hi>Tartarians:</hi> so even we our selves in <hi>England,</hi> by our Native and natural Speech, call our selves <hi>English men,</hi> but by the <hi>Welch, Irish men,</hi> and the <hi>High-land Scots, Saffons,</hi> that is as much as to say, <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what follows from this, but that the Inhabitants of this Island being called <hi>CUMERO</hi> by themselves, were by some others named <hi>BRITAINS;</hi> No, for this will destroy all, then they could not give themselves <hi>Brit,</hi> &amp;c. from their <hi>Painting,</hi> which assisted much to the derivation of BRITANNIA, <hi>therefore</hi> (saies he) <hi>mark I pray you, they were upon some other cause, by themselves or others,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58825:30"/>
named</hi> BRITAINS. But why <hi>by themselves?</hi> when he had proved before they were called <hi>CUMERO</hi> by themselves, and by the Examples he brought, if they were proper, he ought to have inferred, <hi>they received their Names of</hi> Britains <hi>from Others,</hi> which indeed they did, as I have partly shewn, and shall shew more at large hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Grant we then that <hi>Brit</hi> or <hi>Brith,</hi> &amp;c. was the name of these Islanders, and that the name signifies in their Tongue, <hi>Painted, depainted, dyed</hi> or <hi>coloured,</hi> yet it is not reasonable to believe, that <hi>Brit</hi> signifying a <hi>Britain,</hi> came from <hi>Brith</hi> signifying a <hi>Colouring,</hi> but rather that <hi>Brith, Colouring,</hi> came from <hi>Britha,</hi> a <hi>Britain:</hi> my Reason is this; Because that <hi>Customes</hi> in Nations, arising from some general likings, and insensible creepings upon the People, are not so much taken notice of by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as by Neighbours and lookers on, so that although they may be remarkable in themselves, yet are they not so to those who by several gradations and steps have received them; for which cause I am not deceived, if I think that names of Countries arising from some strange and unaccountable <hi>Customes,</hi> have been given them by their Neighbours, who have been absolutely surprized by them for the novelty of them. For instance of which shall be <hi>Gallia Comata,</hi> not called so by themselves but their Neighbours, by reason of their immoderate nourishing their <hi>Long hair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The like may be said concerning the <hi>Aspect, Greatness, Scituation, Nature,</hi> and other Circumstances of People; and here is to be observed, that the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> had nothing in their own Denomination of themselves that signified <hi>Black,</hi> because it was no wonder in their own Country to be so, <hi>AEthiopem Albus derideat;</hi> neither ought we to think, that the Islands of the <hi>Cannibals,</hi> now called the <hi>Caribees,</hi> had any thing in their own Appellation given to themselves, that denoted any such <hi>barbarous</hi> Action. But it was the <hi>Complexions</hi> of the one, and <hi>Customes</hi> of the other, that gave occasion to Strangers to call them so.</p>
                  <p>This is a good Argument to induce me to believe, that the <hi>Britains</hi> were not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Brith</hi> by themselves, from their being <hi>Painted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which confirms most in this Opinion, is the connexion of Reason, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the coincidence of Words; <hi>It is certain,</hi> say they, <hi>that these Islanders were a</hi> Painted-people, <hi>Brit signifying</hi> Painting, <hi>and these</hi> Painted-people <hi>were called Brits, therefore Bryth must needs give them their Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I Answer, Let us consider how many names of Nations have become common Appellatives, of some <hi>Customes</hi> peculiarly belonging to such Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>To instance in a few: A <hi>Sybarite,</hi> signifying a <hi>debauched Person,</hi> from <hi>Sybaris,</hi> the most exquisite of <hi>Luxurious</hi> Commonwealths; a <hi>Ghaldean</hi> was a common name among the <hi>Jews</hi> for any <hi>South-sayer;</hi> an <hi>Egyptian;</hi> was as much as to say a <hi>Magician</hi> or <hi>Sorcerer:</hi> so it is supposed it happened with the <hi>Britains,</hi> when they were immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately given to <hi>Painting</hi> themselves, that their Neighbours, the <hi>Gauls</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by long use, might call whatever was <hi>painted</hi> by the name of <hi>Brit</hi> or <hi>Brith,</hi> as much as to say, <hi>Like a</hi> Britain, so that in time a <hi>Painted-man</hi> and a <hi>Britain</hi> might be all one, the proper name <hi>Britain</hi> being become a common Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>To evidence this plainer, let us look farther into the word <hi>Egyptian,</hi> and we shall see something more in its Derivatives that makes to this case. In the time of the <hi>Saracens</hi> possession of <hi>Spain,</hi> there entered a sort of People into <hi>Christendome</hi> calling themselves <hi>AEgyptians,</hi> as much as to say <hi>Subtile</hi> or <hi>Cunning People,</hi> and so took up the trade of <hi>Fortune-tellers, AEgypt</hi> having in those daies kept up the repute of such Sciences; These sort of People used to <hi>paint</hi> their Hands, Face, and Neck, as they do to this day, to make themselves appear more horrid and strange, and are now at this day, among us, called <hi>Gypsies,</hi> not that all came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended so, but because they use the same Arts in <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Fortune-telling,</hi> and in our Laws provided against them are called <hi>Gypsies,</hi> or People <hi>colouring</hi> their Hands and Face.</p>
                  <p>Now some have derived, though falsly, these <hi>Gypsies</hi> from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which signifies <hi>Paint,</hi> because a <hi>painted</hi> Person in that manner, and a <hi>Gypsie,</hi> is all one.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:58825:31"/>
                  <p>Now as <hi>Gypsie</hi> has no relation to <hi>painting</hi> it self, but by accident, and the syllable <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ought not to be the Root alone of its Derivation seeing it is derived from <hi>AEgypti,</hi> primitively and immediately from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> so I think it is with the word Brit, signifying <hi>Painting,</hi> that it came from the People called <hi>Britains,</hi> and not that the <hi>Britains</hi> came from it; so from <hi>Egypt</hi> comes an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> from thence a <hi>Gypsie,</hi> and from whence, if I am not mistaken, a <hi>Gyp,</hi> the meanest of Servants, a swarthy Turn-spit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In like manner I think that <hi>Brit</hi> comes from <hi>Britanni,</hi> and they from <hi>Britannia, Britania,</hi> from <hi>Strabo's</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which was the Bratanac of the <hi>Phoenicians:</hi> so <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> that their <hi>Painting</hi> comes in only by accident in the diminutive <hi>Brith,</hi> and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the Original Primitive of <hi>Britannia,</hi> the Root of which ought not to be <hi>Brit</hi> alone.</p>
                  <p>And although it is to be supposed that none can be so mad, as to derive <hi>Egypt</hi> from <hi>Gyp,</hi> the Antiquity of the name <hi>Egypt</hi> being sufficiently known, yet it has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the not considering of the Antiquity of <hi>Britannia,</hi> which really was the Bratanac of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> hath caused that <hi>Brith</hi> and <hi>Brits,</hi> whence <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the <hi>Saxons</hi> (many hundred years after the First <hi>Olympiad</hi> when this Island received the Name) which are diminutions and corruptions of the Primitive word, have been accounted the Original.</p>
                  <p>To manifest this, let us hear what <hi>Humphry Lloyd,</hi> a <hi>Gambro-Britain,</hi> and a <note place="margin">Humphry Lloyd.</note> Learned and diligent Searcher after Antiquities, saith, concerning <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> namely, he confidently and boldly affirms, <hi>that there is not any</hi> British <hi>word whose first Radical Letter is</hi> B; if this be true, then it plainly appears that the word <hi>Brith</hi> and <hi>Brit,</hi> if not the same with <hi>Pryd,</hi> are not genuine <hi>British</hi> words, but are derived from some Forreign Name, which crept by degrees into their Language, which exactly agrees with the Bratanac of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> or the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, words by Trading and Custome introduced into their Language, whose Idiom in their own genuine production admits not of a <hi>B</hi> in the first Radical.</p>
                  <p>Hence I believe it might proceed, that when the <hi>Greeks</hi> had named them <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, it must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity proceed from this Fountain.</p>
                  <p>The like may be said of <hi>Bretta,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> word <hi>Earth,</hi> from whence some have derived it; For if there be any kind of Truth delivered by Tradition of such a thing among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> then it must come from those <hi>Spaniards</hi> which in former times were called <hi>Iberi,</hi> that is, <hi>Diggers in Mines,</hi> and as the word importeth, it was derived from the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:58825:31"/>
                  <p>That these <hi>Iberi</hi> might be employed by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in the <hi>Tynn</hi> Mines in <hi>BRITAIN</hi> is not unlike, for <hi>Tacitus</hi> saies, That the Complexion of the South <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> part of <hi>Britain</hi> differs much from the Northern, and both from those parts that lie upon <hi>France;</hi> and therefore he is of Opinion, that <hi>the North parts were Peopled by the</hi> Germans, <hi>the Eastern Coast by the opposite Neighbours the</hi> Gauls, <hi>and the South parts by the</hi> Iberi. This he gathers by the different <hi>Complexion</hi> of the People, <hi>the North</hi> Britains <hi>being</hi> Fair, <hi>having large Limbs, long Yellow hair, as the</hi> Germans <hi>have; the South</hi> Britains <hi>being</hi> Swarthy, <hi>and Curled hair like the</hi> Spaniards; <hi>the Coast lying upon</hi> France, <hi>agreeing in Language, Customes, and in every thing with the</hi> Gauls.</p>
                  <p>It is difficult to perswade me, that Primitively any part of <hi>Britain</hi> could be Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled out of <hi>Spain</hi> by entire Colonies, but rather that it is more natural, that this Island being peopled by Colonies descending down the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and filling <hi>France, Belgium,</hi> and all that Tract of Ground, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came to the South part as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners only, being very active and expert in that Trade, having plenty of Mines in their own Country, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Histories witness, continued unexhausted even to <hi>Hannibals</hi> daies.</p>
                  <p>According to this account, it must certainly be vainly supposed of the derivation of <hi>Britain</hi> from Bretta, signifying <hi>Earth</hi> in <hi>Spanish,</hi> especially when considered, this Island once in conjunction with the Continent; but from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Mariners, who took Bretta from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Brat, the first syllable in Bratanac signifying <hi>Earth.</hi> For it will frequently happen, that the Truth of things is delivered down, though the Reason by which men would evidence them, are often vain and frivolous, according to the divers apprehensions and conceptions of Men.</p>

                     <hi>They</hi> (saies he) <hi>went beyond</hi> HERCULES Pillars, <hi>and there built Cities even to the middle of</hi> Lybia <hi>on the Sea Coast, a little while after the</hi> TROJAN <hi>War;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> saies, that he thinks that <hi>ALBION</hi> has some relation to these Actions in <hi>Lybia, quasi Alebion,</hi> so called by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> which in my opinion is the <note place="margin">Milton.</note> most probable Derivation I ever read of <hi>ALBION.</hi> However we see that the Navigations of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> into these Seas were Ancient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herodotus</hi> makes mention with wonder of some <hi>Phoenicians</hi> sent by <hi>Nero,</hi> how <note place="margin">Herodotus <hi>in</hi> Melpomene.</note> they failed round <hi>Africa</hi> and returned through the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> having in their Voyage the Sun on their Right hand, part of which story <hi>Herodotus</hi> will not believe. It must needs be true, for after they had passed the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> beyond which <hi>Africk</hi> runs out many degrees. Now this story so innocently told by <hi>Herodotus</hi> as a Wonder, argues the Ignorance of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had in those Seas, all along the Coast of <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, I conjecture, is the cause why men, beyond Reason, have drawn their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages even to the East <hi>Indies</hi> under King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and to the West under <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Himilco,</hi> a Fate we often see that attends Great Actions, when over-fond men out of a desire to magnisie things Famous beyond their true proportions, inconsiderately stretch them beyond the bounds of Truth and Modesty.</p>
                  <p>Having said thus much of the Derivation of BRITANNIA, that it came from the <hi>Phoenicians Bratanac,</hi> let us see whether the <hi>Graecians</hi> might not take the name ALBION from that Nation also; It is agreed on most hands, that it had its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of ALBION from its <hi>Whiteness,</hi> and it is observable that <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or rather <hi>Onomacritus</hi> calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>WHITE ISLAND,</hi> and the <hi>British</hi> Poets name it <hi>Inis Wen,</hi> the <hi>White Island,</hi> whether from the Plasterish <hi>Soyl</hi> (as <hi>Faucastorius</hi> thinks) or the <hi>White Rocks</hi> about it, is uncertain.</p>
                  <p>That it came from the Latins <hi>ALBIS RUPIBUS</hi> is impossible, because it was known to the <hi>Greeks</hi> by this Name long before the <hi>Latins,</hi> and that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, signifying <hi>WHITE</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue is very unlikely, because being called <hi>Albion</hi> when the rest of the Islands about it were named <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicks;</hi> It may be supposed to have gone by this Name long before the <hi>Greeks</hi> entered these Seas, when the <hi>Tynn</hi> Mines in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire</hi> were not yet found out; For upon the discovery of the Mines in those Countries the name of BRITAIN was given to part of this Island also, and ALBION by degrees began to grow out of use.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>ALBEN</hi> therefore in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, signifying WHITE, it may with most probability be derived, and as the <hi>Greeks</hi> translated <hi>Brat-anac,</hi> the Country of <hi>Tynn,</hi> into <hi>Cassiterides,</hi> and afterwards <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, were both originally derived from the <hi>Phoenician, Alben.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will only set down one conjecture more of the name of <hi>Albion,</hi> and that is <hi>ALPIN,</hi> which in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue signifies a <hi>high Mountain.</hi> In the Country of the <hi>Silures,</hi> now <hi>South Wales,</hi> there are many high Cliffs, which the <hi>Britains,</hi> from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> call <hi>Pens</hi> to this day.</p>
                  <p>Now seeing it may be supposed that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Landed in those parts, why might they not call that part of the Island <hi>Alben</hi> or <hi>Alpin,</hi> from whence <hi>Albion</hi> might afterwards proceed, the <hi>B</hi> and <hi>P</hi> being easily convertible, and seeing that the name of ALBION is so Ancient, it is far more probable it was taken from those parts where the first Traders arrived, than from the Cliffs of <hi>Dover,</hi> frequented only by the little Traffick of the Continent.</p>
                  <p>And that which maketh further to the confirmation of this Derivation of <hi>Albion</hi> from <hi>Alben, White</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, or <hi>Alpin, High</hi> and <hi>Mountainous</hi> in the same Dialect, is, that the High-land <hi>Scots</hi> who were once part of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and to this day retain the <hi>British</hi> Language, call that Country which they inhabite, <hi>Alban</hi> or <hi>Albin,</hi> whereupon <hi>Blondus</hi> terms the <hi>Scots, Albinenses</hi> as well as <hi>Albienses,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan, Albini,</hi> why might not therefore the whole Island in former times be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <note place="margin">Blondus.

                  <p>Moreover it is to be observed, as to the Derivation of <hi>Albion</hi> from <hi>Alpin,</hi> that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> inveighing against a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> by Nation, calleth him an <hi>Alpine Dog,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> would correct, and in the place of <hi>Alpin</hi> puts in <hi>Albin,</hi> by which name the <hi>Highlanders</hi> call their Country; <hi>Because,</hi> saith he, <hi>of</hi> Alpin <hi>Dogs I never remember I have read ought, but</hi> Scotish <hi>Dogs were very famous at</hi> Rome <hi>even in those daies.</hi> As if St. <hi>Hierom</hi> by <hi>Alpin</hi> Dog, meant a Dog of the <hi>Alpes</hi> and not of <hi>Scotland;</hi> I see therefore no reason why the word should be changed, for if the <hi>Greeks</hi> could call the <hi>Alpes</hi> as well <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Albions</hi> as well as <hi>Alpions,</hi> and that from the <hi>Phoenician Alben</hi> and <hi>Alpin,</hi> why might not St. <hi>Hierom</hi> call the <hi>Scots Alpins</hi> as well as <hi>Albins,</hi> upon the same account, especially seeing the change is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable.</p>
                  <p>What the <hi>Highlanders</hi> call <hi>Alban</hi> and <hi>Albin,</hi> the <hi>Irish</hi> call <hi>Allabany,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> putteth the question, whether this word <hi>Allabany</hi> may not have some token in it of the ancient ALBION? but why doth he not rather ask, whether <hi>Alban</hi> and <hi>Albin,</hi> by which the Natives call their Country, doth not rather carry some foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of <hi>Albion</hi> than <hi>Allabany,</hi> a Foreign word, pronounced after the broad and scattering manner of the <hi>Irish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reason is plain, <hi>Alban</hi> and <hi>Albin</hi> have nothing in them of the <hi>Scottish,</hi> which is also the <hi>British,</hi> or of the <hi>Irish</hi> Tongue, higher than which he never goeth. But <hi>Allabany</hi> will afford matter for a pretty Derivation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is Question,</hi> saith he, <hi>for a liberal and searching Wit to travel in;</hi> he gives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two Conjectures as touching the name of <hi>Allabany,</hi> but not one of <hi>Alban</hi> or <hi>Albin, might it not come of</hi> Whiteness, saith he, <hi>which they call Ban, and import as much as Ellan-Ban, that is a</hi> White Island, <hi>or from Banne, by which the</hi> Irish <hi>Poets call their Country, and</hi>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the Greek word, signifies</hi> ANOTHER, <hi>so that</hi> Allabany <hi>may sound as much as</hi> another Ireland; <hi>for,</hi> saith he (pray mark the Reason) <hi>Ancient Historians call</hi> Ireland, Scotland the Greater, <hi>and the Kingdom of the</hi> Scots <hi>in</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Scotland the Less; but I never heard that they were called <hi>Ireland the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and <hi>Ireland the Less,</hi> so that <hi>Allabany,</hi> allowing <hi>Banne</hi> in the Poets sence, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly derive it; as for his joyning a Greek word to make out the Derivation, I pass it over, seeing it is no more than what he hath done in <hi>Britain</hi> it self.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:58825:33"/>
                  <p>Thus you see he taketh care for the <hi>Irish Allabany,</hi> but as for <hi>Alban</hi> and <hi>Albin</hi> of the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> carrying the true foot-steps of <hi>Alpin</hi> and <hi>Alben</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, and the undoubted Mother not only of the Ancient <hi>Albion,</hi> but the more Modern <hi>Albania,</hi> and this corrupt <hi>Allabany</hi> he provideth not at all, yet I doubt not but the derivation of this Island from <hi>Alben</hi> or <hi>Alpin</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, and the Natives pure pronunciation thereof <hi>Alban</hi> and <hi>Albin,</hi> will be more satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the Enquirers into Truth, after the name of <hi>ALBION,</hi> than any thing that can be produced from the distorted Pronunciation thereof, ALLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BANY.</p>

                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> on the West Coasts of <hi>Africk,</hi> because Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> saies, that <hi>Albion</hi> has some relation to <hi>Lybia,</hi> I will be more particular, especially seeing he takes notice only of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and not <hi>Phoenicians</hi> who were many years before acquainted with those Places, and from whose Idiom <hi>Alebion</hi> is easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>

                     </note> set out in Greek by <hi>Sigismundus Gelenius</hi> at <hi>Bazil,</hi> Anno 1533, I find that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> on the West part of <hi>Africk</hi> built divers Cities: The question is what <hi>Hanno</hi> this was?</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>For my own part, I verily believe it was <hi>Hanno</hi> who is mentioned by <hi>AElianus,</hi> who desired to be esteemed as a God, no doubt as his Predecessour <hi>Hercules</hi> had <note place="margin">AElianus.</note> been, for his excellency in <hi>Navigation,</hi> a manifest sign he lived early in the <hi>Deifying</hi> Age of the World.</p>

                  <p>These Derivations I take to be truer than to fetch it from <hi>Erin</hi> of the Natives, and that from <hi>Hiere</hi> signifying the west Wind among them, because I have shewn before, that Countries that have their name from <hi>Scituations</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> receive them from <hi>ab extra,</hi> for to the Natives <hi>Ireland</hi> is no more a West Country than <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> unless they compare it with Eastern parts; But to speak the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, every Country by its <hi>scituation</hi> receiving a Name, has it from its Neighbours, as the <hi>West Indies</hi> and <hi>East Indies</hi> are called as they lie to us, there being no such name known among them. So Anciently <hi>Gallia</hi> was divided by the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Cisalpina</hi> and <hi>Transalpina:</hi> In like manner you may imagine the East <hi>Saxons</hi> were called by the <hi>West,</hi> and the West <hi>Saxons</hi> by the <hi>East,</hi> or else by some Third Person.</p>
                  <p>It is easie to imagine how <hi>Jerne</hi> might by long use come to be <hi>Erin</hi> among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, if we do but consider what strange Alterations and Mutations have happened in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue it self in a few years, yea how one Dialect varies from another, as may be seen in the Chapter treating of that Subject.</p>
                  <p>The Reason which concludes me in the Belief that <hi>Ireland</hi> took its name from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> is, because in the uttermost Coast of <hi>Spain</hi> westward, is a Promontory called by <hi>Strabo, Jerne,</hi> and the River next unto it is called by <hi>Mela, Jerne:</hi> so <note place="margin">Strabo: Pomp Mela.</note> that we see when <hi>Spain</hi> was the uttermost bounds of the knowledge of the <hi>Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Spain</hi> was called <hi>

                        </gap>,</hi> but when these Islands were discovered, then <hi>Ireland</hi> took the name as being the <hi>Uttermost:</hi> I cannot imagine how the Names should so exactly correspond, if they had not the same Original; Besides, in the farthermost parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> there is a River called by <hi>Ptolomy, Jernus,</hi> agreeing in name with the River <hi>Jerne</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and all this cannot be from <hi>Hiere,</hi> signifying <hi>West</hi> in <hi>Irish,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Ptolomy.</note> there is no Language in <hi>Europe,</hi> besides the <hi>Irish,</hi> that have any such kind of word to signisie <hi>the West;</hi> for we find those Countries that have any thing of <hi>West</hi> Position, are in the <hi>Teutonick</hi> called so, adding <hi>West,</hi> as <hi>Westrich, Westphalia,</hi> to <hi>Germany; Westminster, Westchester,</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> is much to be suspected, as guilty of a mistake in his Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Irish men,</hi> whom he fetches out of <hi>Spain</hi> from the point <hi>Jerna,</hi> from whence supposing they came. By the way of my discourse let me ask this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. By whom was the River and Promontory <hi>Jerna</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> called? if he saies, <hi>By the Inhabitants themselves, from</hi> Hiere, <hi>it being</hi> west <hi>of</hi> Spain, I would be glad to know from whence came this <hi>Hiere,</hi> it having no relation to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue, nor any Dialect or Language in <hi>Europe</hi> besides, and we know none that lived Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in those parts of <hi>Spain</hi> but were either <hi>Phoenician</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Colonies, which have nothing like in their Languages relating to <hi>Hiere,</hi> signifying <hi>the West;</hi> But in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue the derivation is so easie from <hi>Iberne</hi> or <hi>Herne,</hi> to bring <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Jerne,</hi> that seeing the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> lived <hi>west</hi> of any in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and called the uttermost part of both after that Name, as is manifest out of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> of <hi>Hanno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is therefore reasonably to be supposed, when they came to discover these Lands, and found <hi>Ireland</hi> the Uttermost, that then they gave it the name <hi>Jerne,</hi> so that the Derivation of <hi>Ireland</hi> runs thus: <hi>Herne</hi> or <hi>Iberne</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Greeks</hi> into <hi>Jerne,</hi> as <hi>Orpheus, Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Claudian</hi> have it; <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now I think the Derivation of it is not to be sought from <hi>Eria,</hi> and that from <hi>Hiere,</hi> which is made the Root of all these Derivations, according to Mr. <hi>Cambden's</hi> way, than which nothing is more easie and fallacious, but from the <hi>Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing we have said thus much of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it will not be amiss to treat of <hi>THULE</hi> also, a place Famous in the Writings of the Ancients, because the examination of the Name of this Island, and shewing of it to be of <hi>Phoenician</hi> derivation, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to the confirming and proving of what has been said concerning the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal name of <hi>BRITAIN.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:58825:34"/>
                  <p>For since it is not to be doubted but the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Traded into these parts, it could not happen by chance, that the Names of all these Islands should preserve so entirely (as they do in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Language) the very marks and foot-steps of those things for which they were so taken notice of by all the Ancients; so that the consent and harmony of the names of so many Places, with their very natures, both in sence and sound, confirms each others derivation, and puts it beyond dispute, that <hi>Britain</hi> was named <hi>Bratanac</hi> by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> for its <hi>Tynn,</hi> for which only thing it was famous to the then known World, as <hi>Ierue</hi> or <hi>Iverue</hi> was called so from its <hi>Western,</hi> and <hi>Thule,</hi> as shall be shewn, from its <hi>Northern,</hi> or <hi>Dark</hi> scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bochartus</hi> mentions three Opinions of the Ancients concerning the Position of <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> 
                     <hi>THULE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> and worst of them makes it <hi>Scandia,</hi> which is <hi>Procopius</hi> his Judgment, <note place="margin">Procopius.</note> but <hi>Scandia</hi> is not an Island as <hi>Thule</hi> was supposed to be, but a Peninsula, I think his Opinion is not so much to be blamed upon that account, seeing this was never absolutely defined. But his singularity is rather to be condemned in fixing of it in that quarter of the World, so remote from those parts others thought it lay upon.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> is of <hi>Pytheas Massitilensis,</hi> that it lies six daies Sail northward of <hi>Britain,</hi> and has the Summer Tropick, for the Artick Circle, and in the Solstice <note place="margin">Pytheas Mass.</note> has little or no <hi>Nights,</hi> and no <hi>Daies</hi> in Winter, which agrees exactly with <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> Opinion is of <hi>Marinus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> by whom <hi>THULE</hi> is <note place="margin">Marinus, Ptolomy.</note> made no great Island, scituated in the sixty third Degree, where the longest Day is twenty hours, and not above two daies Sail from <hi>Britain,</hi> which agrees with <hi>Schet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> one of the <hi>Orcades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I rather believe <hi>Bochartus,</hi> that there was no such particular place as <hi>Thule,</hi> but that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> sailing Northward on our Seas, and being obliged to return upon the account of the Suns turning from his Tropick, they gave the name of <hi>Thule</hi> to those places which were the Extreamest, and by reason of their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Darkness,</hi> put a stop to their further Navigations, and that the Tradition of this was delivered by them to the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and by them to the <hi>Romans,</hi> so that they called that <hi>THULE</hi> which was the <hi>Extreamest part</hi> of the then known World.</p>
                  <p>With this description of <hi>Thule</hi> agrees exactly the word <hi>Tule</hi> or <hi>Thule</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> signifying <hi>Darkness;</hi> for <hi>Teth</hi> by them is often expressed by <hi>Theta,</hi> as in <hi>Cadmus</hi> his Alphabet, although <hi>AEthicus</hi> writes it, <hi>Insula</hi> Tilae, and <hi>Gerirat</hi> Thule, <note place="margin">Cadmus <hi>his Alphabet.</hi> AEthicus.</note> is with the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> The <hi>Island of Darkness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We well know the <hi>Northern Climates</hi> of the World are taken notice of for their <hi>Darkness,</hi> not so much by reason of their long Nights, as their gloomy and obscure Daies, for with <hi>Homer,</hi>

                  <p>But to return to <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> The Reason which makes Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in all his Antiquities of Names to have recourse to the Language of the People, to the <hi>Welch</hi> for <hi>Britain,</hi> and to the <hi>Irish</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and so looked no higher, proceeds from an opinion he took by the mis-understanding of <hi>Polybius, That</hi> Britain <hi>was but late known, yea not long before the daies of</hi> Caesar.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>Polybius</hi> are these, faithfully translated out of his Third <note place="margin">Polybiur, <hi>lit.</hi> 3.</note> Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For as concerning</hi> Asia <hi>and</hi> Lybia, <hi>where they joyn with one another about</hi> AEthiopia, <hi>no one can say perfectly, to this day, whether it be a Continent running to the South, or whether it be encompassed by the Sea. So likewise, what lies between</hi> Tanais <hi>and</hi> Narbo, <hi>stretching Northward, is unknown to us at this present, unless afterwards by diligent Enquiring, we learn something of it. They that speak or write any thing of these matters, are to be thought to know nothing, and to lay down Fables.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are the words of <hi>Polybius,</hi> by which he only means, That as it was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether the Sea encompast the South parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> so it was unknown whether the North parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> above <hi>Narbo,</hi> were encompast too.</p>
                  <p>Now Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> understands the words, as if they were spoken in general, when indeed they related only to that particular Question, <hi>Whether the North Tract of</hi> Europe <hi>be environed with the Sea?</hi> which, notwithstanding the great improvement of Navigation, stands unresolved even to this day.</p>
                  <p>It is manifest <hi>Polybius</hi> spake not this in General, because he himself describes the Fountains of <hi>Rhodanus</hi> and <hi>Corbilo</hi> on <hi>Ligeris,</hi> and many other Places of <hi>France,</hi> which all lay above <hi>Narbo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his Third Book he promiseth, particularly to write of the Outer or West Sea, and of the Occurrences that happened in it; And, which is more to our purpose, to write of the <hi>Bretanick</hi> Islands, for so he calls them, and of their manner of making of <hi>Tynn,</hi> which promise of his requires more than a Cursory knowledge to perform, and urges that the Trade into those Seas was very great.</p>
                  <p>Nay this Promise he performed, as we gather out of the Second Book of <hi>Strabo,</hi> where <hi>Polybius</hi> is brought in describing of <hi>Europe,</hi> and comparing the Opinions of <note place="margin">Strabo. <hi>lib.</hi> 2,</note>

                  <p>This Work of his, had it not perished, would undoubtedly have made much for the Honour of Our Nation: And we might have expected (from so Ancient an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, living Three hundred and seventy years before Christ, and from so accurate and worthy a Person, as who, with <hi>Scipio</hi> the Great, had been an Eye-witness of most Places of Note, and had seen most <hi>Phoenician</hi> Records) some notable History of <hi>Britain;</hi> But thus much we are sure, that in his daies the Islands were called <hi>BRATANACS,</hi> preserving the <hi>C</hi> of their first Original, as in his Works is found.</p>
                  <p>Those three Persons, <hi>Pytheas, Dicaearchus</hi> and <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> whose Opinions <hi>Strabo</hi> introduceth <hi>Polybius,</hi> comparing and confuting (as they writ of <hi>Britain</hi>) all three of them, so were they much Ancienter than <hi>Polybius.</hi> As for <hi>Eratosthenes, Suidas</hi> makes him to live in the One hundred twenty sixth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Ptolomaeus Philadelphus. Dicaearchus</hi> was the Schollar of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> Ancienter than he; and <hi>Pytheas,</hi> cited by both of the former, precedes them both, so that I find three most Eminent Persons among the <hi>Greeks</hi> to have written concerning <hi>Britain,</hi> even in those daies when Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> imagin'd it to <hi>lie in a Nook of the World, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely, and unknown;</hi> For as the Trade of it was great for <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> so that the <hi>Graecians</hi> had none but what was brought from thence, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> himself confesses, so it manifestly appears that the <hi>Cassiterides</hi> were known before <hi>Homers</hi> daies, who writes of <hi>Lead,</hi> which otherwise he could not do.</p>

                  <p>Now let any judge, whether the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands could be discovered, and many Voyages made thither, and this Island of <hi>BRITAIN</hi> to be unknown.</p>
                  <p>As for those Verses of <hi>Avienus,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> seems to slight so much, as to call them <hi>Credulous,</hi> who give any belief to them, although he makes use of them afterwards, in his description of the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands. Thus much is to be said in general.</p>
                  <p>

                     <l>Relate, what we from thence did draw.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Certainly, it is unreasonable to condemn an Author upon no ground in the World but <hi>Humor,</hi> neither do I think it a fond Credulity but an act of true Judgment, to give Assent to a Person who professes himself to have read it, and especially where there is nothing related but what agrees with the whole consent and current of those times.</p>
                  <p>And this way of proceeding is unequal, to Reject, without being able to give some Reason; so it reflects upon the Authority of all Ancient Writers, whose Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city cannot be made out otherwise, than by their constant assevering, that they have Heard and Read such things which they relate, without Assent to which their Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries become dead and useless.</p>
                  <p>Now to deny that to <hi>Festus Avienus,</hi> which we grant to other Authors, without giving any Reason for our dislike, but only because it makes not to our purpose, seems to me rather the Act of a Judge, than an Inquirer or diligent Searcher after Antiquities; And looks as if it proceeded from the thoughts of having obtained the utmost heights and top of Truth and Antiquity, so that it is lawful to judge and condemn Authors at pleasure.</p>
                  <p>However <hi>Festus Avienus,</hi> in this matter, agrees with all Antiquity, as to the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> into the Western Sea, there arriving at the Isles of <hi>Scilly</hi> to Traffick for <hi>Tyun</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> with the Inhabitants, all which things are made out from <hi>Strabo, Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Solinus,</hi> and therefore needs not to lie so heavy upon the Credit of <hi>Festus Avienus,</hi> as though he were the only Person that sustained them.</p>
                  <p>And here it will not be amiss to take notice how Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> although he will not have <hi>Britain</hi> to be known long before <hi>Caesars</hi> time, that the beginning of his Antiquities (to speak the truth) in time are very much below the discovery of this Island, may seem to be of a higher date than indeed they are; yet where he speaks of the <hi>Plenty</hi> of this Nation, how the Ground was enriched with all sorts of Corn, he cites <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who reported it to be the very Seat of Lady <hi>Ceres:</hi>

                  <p>And saies, that this is meant of <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> which, if he means as he speaks, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he contradicts himself in saying, <hi>It was not known but by Name only to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> seeing that <hi>Orpheus,</hi> one of the <hi>Argonauts,</hi> treats in particular of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in this Country, in which it is blest above all Nations in the World even to this day.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:58825:35"/>
                  <p>But enquiring closer after the Truth, you will find <hi>Orpheus</hi> to be of a later date than he is generally thought to be of; for in his daies <hi>Britain</hi> was not discovered to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> who kept it private to themselves, as I shall shew hereafter out of <hi>Strabo,</hi> so that this feigned <hi>Orpheus,</hi> is indeed the true <hi>Onomacritus,</hi> as may be learnt out of <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> Poet who <note place="margin">Tacitus. Clem. A ex.</note> lived in the daies of <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> and, as they say, in the Fiftieth <hi>Olympiad,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Five and fiftieth, before Christ five hundred and sixty years, when the <hi>Graecians</hi> began, by the discovery of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> to enter the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and to be Eye witnesses of those Places they formerly had only by Hear-say.</p>
                  <p>And when (no doubt as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes) our Island was celebrated to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plin.</hi> Nat. hist.</note> not only for its Mines of <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> by which it was useful to all the World, but its plenty of <hi>Provisions</hi> also, by which it sustained and blest its Inhabitants; so that Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> forced by the Truth, oftentimes confesses what in other places he would have lie dark and obscure, namely, <hi>That</hi> BRITAIN <hi>for a long time was unknown,</hi> but here I suppose we must take him in his Poetical humour only, and so I shall leave him, and proceed to shew what Foot-steps the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> left among the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> of their <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> and what remains to this day.</p>
                  <p>And first I will begin with <hi>Strabo,</hi> because what he speaks of has relation to the Plenty of <hi>England</hi> for all sorts of <hi>Grain;</hi> in his fourth Book, <hi>Artimidorus</hi> asserts, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Strabo,</hi> lib. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>That there was an Island near</hi> Britain, I suppose one of the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands, and in most probability St. <hi>Maries, in which they worshipped</hi> Ceres <hi>and</hi> Proserpina, <hi>with the same Rites they did in</hi> Samothrace.</p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Artimidorus</hi> lived in the daies of <hi>Ptolemeus Lathyrus,</hi> before <hi>Colaeus</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> had ever discovered any thing of these Seas, so that the <hi>Graecians</hi> could not introduce the Worship of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proserpina</hi> into any <hi>British</hi> Island. It remains therefore, that they were brought in by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who had taught the <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thracians</hi> first their Worship, and the Mysteries of their <hi>Cabiri,</hi> which were so many that <hi>Juvenal</hi> takes notice of them:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>—<hi>jurent licet</hi> &amp; Samothracum</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Et nostrorum ar as</hi> —</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Now, that the Worship of the <hi>Samothracians,</hi> and consequently of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> who had the same Rites, were taught them by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> I will prove.</p>
                  <p>First, The word <hi>Cabiri,</hi> signifying their <hi>Gods,</hi> is a <hi>Phoenician</hi> word signifying <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Greatness,</hi> and they were worshipt chiefly at <hi>Beritus</hi> by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> as <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> witnesseth, which place was dedicated to the Honour of <hi>Neptune,</hi> a great God with them, and the <hi>Cabiri.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sanchonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Mysteries of these Rites were accounted so Sacred and Powerful, that whosoever was initiated in them, immediately received, as they thought, some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts of Holiness, and that in all their Dangers they had a present Remedy and Expedient about them to deliver and rescue them; but that which most affected the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> was a confidence they had, that those Religious Ceremonies preserved them from Dangers by Sea, Therefore it is no wonder that Arriving in <hi>Britain,</hi> they taught the Inhabitants that Worship, to which they held themselves most obliged for their Safety.</p>
                  <p>These Rites of the <hi>Samothracians,</hi> by their mysterious Obscurity (as it happens that things best understood are most admired) prevailed so much in the World, that besides many of the Ancients, as <hi>Jason, Orpheus,</hi> the Greek <hi>Hercules, Agamemnon,</hi> and <hi>Ulysses, Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> that were Devoto's to them; <hi>Philip</hi> the Father of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> a wise and politick Prince, was initiated in them; and from these mystical and unintelligible Rites of the <hi>Cabiri,</hi> in which I suppose the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> preserved the main part in their own Tongue, I conjecture the word <hi>Gibberish</hi> to <hi>Gaber,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us proceeds, a frequent name given by us to any long <hi>harangue</hi> of <hi>words</hi> which we understand not; And I find that these Rites were in <hi>Britain,</hi> or some Island nigh it, which could be brought by none but the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:58825:36"/>
                  <p>In the next place is sound in <hi>Hesychius</hi> that <hi>Cotes</hi> was a Priest of the <hi>Cabiri,</hi> and I find in Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> that <hi>Coi-fi</hi> (I know not what <hi>fi</hi> means in the Ancient <hi>British,</hi> but with them it was frequent to compound Monosyllables) is the name of a <note place="margin">Cambden, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Heathen Priest</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> when <hi>Paulinus</hi> preach'd the Gospel here; so that we see <hi>Cotes,</hi> a Priest in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> rites, continued its name even to the <hi>Saxons.</hi> But of this I shall speak more, when I come to treat about the Ancient <hi>British</hi> Gods. It will suffice in this place, that <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proserpina</hi> were worshipped in the <hi>British</hi> Islands, after the manner of the <hi>Samothracians,</hi> before ever the <hi>Greeks</hi> had any knowledge of these parts, and that this Worship could be introduced by none but the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next foot-steps we find of them is among the <hi>Silures,</hi> about which part of <hi>England</hi> it is to be supposed the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Landed; I find, in <hi>Solinus,</hi> an Island <note place="margin">Solinus.</note> called <hi>Silura,</hi> lying upon that Coast which the <hi>British Danmonii,</hi> or <hi>Cornish</hi> Men pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest.</p>
                  <p>This name <hi>Silura,</hi> with the transposing of one Letter, proceeds from the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician Sirula,</hi> signifying that Garment called <hi>Bracca,</hi> which the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> as well as the <hi>Gauls</hi> wore, as <hi>Martial</hi> witnesseth,
<q>
                        <hi>Quam veteres</hi> Braccae Britonis <hi>Pauperis—</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Martial.</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> might call the <hi>Britains</hi> from this Garment they sound them in (as part of <hi>France</hi> was called <hi>Braccata</hi> from the same) it stands with reason; and although all the <hi>Britains</hi> might use the same Garment as all <hi>France</hi> did, yet would not the Name pass through all the Island no more than it did in <hi>France,</hi> the novelty and edge of the Derivation being by Custome taken away when the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had greater converse with them.</p>
                  <p>It will not be improper in this place to put down the Conjectures of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who from the swarthy Complexion and curled Hair of the <hi>Silures,</hi> believes them to be <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> derived from the <hi>Iberi,</hi> which <hi>Iberi,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> makes out, were a Colony of the <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> 
                     <hi>Phoenicians</hi> placing themselves in <hi>Tartessus,</hi> for, as for any other <hi>Iberi,</hi> they had not the experience and knowledge enough to send out Colonies.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Coast of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire</hi> I find a Promontory, called <hi>HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CULES</hi> his Promontorv by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and called to this day <hi>Herty-point,</hi> containing in <note place="margin">Ptolomy.</note> it two pretty Towns, <hi>Herton</hi> and <hi>Hertland,</hi> whereof <hi>Herton</hi> is the greater and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly called <hi>Harton;</hi> Now as I will not aver as ever <hi>Hercules</hi> was here and named it so, as <hi>Franciscus Philelphus</hi> and <hi>Lileus Geraldus</hi> aver, because Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> saies there was three and forty <hi>Hercules's,</hi> as <hi>Varro</hi> will have it, he cannot admit of one <note place="margin">Franciscus Philelphus. Lileus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus. Varro.</note> of them to arrive at this point. Well let it be so, though I think <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to be competent Judges of the Voyages of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> yet I do believe that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> rather than the <hi>Gracians</hi> might give it the Name, and build some Temple in honour of their own <hi>Hercules,</hi> as he almost got the Honour of the Temple in the <hi>Streights,</hi> so has he almost robbed the <hi>Phoenician Hercules</hi> of this also.</p>
                  <p>But is it absolutely against Reason to say, that <hi>Hercules</hi> might arrive at this Island? Certainly No, as it hath some probability in it, if we consider what <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, <note place="margin">Pliny's <hi>Nat. Hist.</hi>
                     </note> viz. <hi>that</hi> Midacritus <hi>was the first that brought</hi> Tynn <hi>out of the</hi> Cassiterides. Now who should this <hi>Medacritus</hi> be? we are assured it is a <hi>Greek</hi> name, and a <hi>Gracian</hi> could not be the first that brought <hi>Tynn</hi> from thence, wherefore <hi>Bochartus</hi> thinks <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> it ought to be <hi>Milicartus,</hi> or <hi>Melcartus,</hi> a known name of <hi>Hercules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this <hi>Hercules Phoenicius</hi> many things are Recorded, as to his Voyages, even to this ISLAND, but we advise none to relie on the truth of them, we desire not to heap up Fables, as many have done, and usually do to make good their Opinions, for the truth of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Voyages into <hi>Britain</hi> under other Captains, appears plain enough, and their Trading into these Parts, only thus much may be averred, that where any remembrance of <hi>Hercules</hi> remains, it it rather to be attributed to the <hi>Phoenician</hi> than the <hi>Graecian,</hi> as the Learned know, especially upon Promontories and Sea-Port Towns, as <hi>Hercules</hi> Rock in <hi>Campania, Hercules</hi> Haven in <hi>Liguria,</hi> the Promontories of <hi>Hercules</hi> in <hi>Mauritania</hi> and <hi>Galatia.</hi>

                  <p>Now, because we have found one <hi>HERCULES</hi> his Promontory in our Seas, we will relate another Monument concerning him, found <hi>Anno</hi> MDXIIII, at the Mouth of <hi>Scaldis</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> where a Tower or Temple dedicated to <hi>Hercules</hi> was found. The Stone had this Inscription:</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Enidius</hi> and other <hi>German</hi> Writers, upon those words of <hi>Marcellinus, The</hi> Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enses <hi>following the Ancient</hi> Hercules, <hi>inhabited the Sea Coasts of</hi> Gallia, by <hi>Gallia</hi> they <note place="margin">Enidius.</note> think is meant <hi>Germany,</hi> because all <hi>Germany</hi> was called so Anciently, and by the <hi>Sea Coast, Beligium,</hi> and in particular an Island of the <hi>Zealanders,</hi> called <hi>Wallacheia.</hi> And this Inscription is brought by him to confirm his opinion.</p>
                  <p>Now as this Inscription is in Latin, as V. S. L. M. viz. <hi>Votum solvit Lubens merito,</hi> shews consequently of later date than <hi>Hercules</hi> his daies, and in memory only of him, so the word MARCUSANUS has puzzled the heads of many to find out its meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Geropius</hi> derives it from <hi>Marchius,</hi> signifying among that People the <hi>Bounds</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Geropius.</note> 
                     <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>the</hi> Romans, <hi>before the dominion of the</hi> Franks, <hi>had a</hi> Limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Castle in</hi> Zealand, <hi>from whence it was called</hi> Marchius <hi>on the Uttermost shoar, which was consecrated to</hi> Hercules <hi>the Preserver of</hi> Bounds <hi>and</hi> Limits, <hi>who upon that account was called</hi> Hercules Marcusanus.</p>
                  <p>But because this relies on the Credit of <hi>Geropius</hi> without any Authority, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it seems unprobable, upon the account that <hi>Marchius</hi> is a General word with them, signifying any <hi>Fort</hi> or <hi>Gastle</hi> upon the <hi>Borders</hi> of any Territory, it is thought <hi>Hercules</hi> could not be denominated from it, it being never found it was his office to serve instead of the God <hi>Terminus;</hi> besides Learned Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> observes, that <hi>Hercules</hi> (and I may add other Gods too) derived his Sir-names from proper Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellative <note place="margin">Sheringham.</note> names of Places, and was never called the <hi>City Hercules,</hi> or <hi>Town Hercules,</hi> or <hi>Castle Hercules,</hi> from <hi>City, Town,</hi> or <hi>Castle.</hi> Therefore Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> derives it from Man, and Cpyran, the first in the <hi>Cimbric</hi> Tongue signifying a <hi>Disease, loss,</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> and Cpyran to <hi>beat off,</hi> or <hi>quash,</hi> which word <hi>quash,</hi> as I take it, preserves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Cpyran.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58825:37"/>
                  <p>And this Derivation he grounds upon a Greek name given to <hi>Hercules;</hi>

As for Example: why may not <hi>Marcusanus</hi> as well be derived from Mapc, signifying a <hi>Horse,</hi> and Cpyran, <hi>to tame,</hi> both of the same Language, because we sometimes read <hi>Hercules,</hi>

                  <p>Besides, this Epithite <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was proper only to the Greek <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom <hi>Marcellinus</hi> brings not to this Coast, but saies, it was the Phoenician <hi>Hercules,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the <hi>Dorienses</hi> who came hither. So that the Derivation must (without doubt, be sought in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Language, in which I find <hi>Mat</hi> to signifie a <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Prince;</hi> and upon which account <hi>Cusanus</hi> comes in I know not, unless <hi>Marcusanus</hi> be from <hi>Mat Cus,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Cussites,</hi> of whose race were the <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enses</hi> whom <hi>Hercules</hi> Commanded, but rather as I think from the known Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Phoenician</hi> ought we to derive it, to wit, <hi>Melcarthus</hi> or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carthus, Mel</hi> and <hi>Mat</hi> signifying the same thing in their Language, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Prince,</hi> so allowing the abbreviation <hi>Marchus</hi> for <hi>Marcarthus,</hi> which is frequent in syllables of the same sound, I think we have an easie and true account of <hi>Marcusanus;</hi> But if any think it more natural to bring it from the <hi>Cimbric</hi> Language, I shall not contend, only I could wish that instead of Map a <hi>Disease,</hi> they would take Mop the <hi>Sea,</hi> it being more Honourable for so great a Traveller as the <hi>Phoenician Hercules,</hi> to be a Skilful <hi>Pylot</hi> than a <hi>Physician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>Silures</hi> derived their Name from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> so likewise did the <hi>Danmonii,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> in which two Counties the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were very conversant, by reason of their abounding in <hi>Tynn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this account some have derived them from <hi>Moina,</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue signifying <hi>Mines,</hi> but the Question is, whence the <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Dun</hi> proceeds? for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> calls them <hi>Dunmonii; Ptolomy, Domnonii,</hi> and in other Copies (as <hi>Cambden</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Solinus, Prolomy.</note> saith) trulier <hi>Danmonii,</hi> although I think the transposition is very easie and usual, and hides not at all the Original <hi>Dan</hi> or <hi>Dun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Ancient <hi>British</hi> Language, as also in the <hi>Phoenician, Dun</hi> or <hi>Cun</hi> (for in composition we sind both waies) signifies a <hi>Hill,</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> of the <hi>British, Down</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>English</hi> signifie <hi>Low.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whether we derive them from <hi>Dan,</hi> from their <hi>Low habitations</hi> in <hi>Valleys,</hi> or, which is righter, from <hi>Dun</hi> or <hi>Cun,</hi> or <hi>Monia,</hi> signifying Hills of <hi>Tynn;</hi> I sind both waies that they are of a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Derivation.</p>
                  <p>Besides, this word <hi>Dun,</hi> being a frequenter word in derivation, and extending to the Language of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who called an Hill <hi>Dun,</hi> I think more proper to derive <hi>Dunmonii</hi> from it, for from <hi>Dun,</hi> a <hi>Hill,</hi> many Cities of high Scituation both in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> take their Name, as <hi>Augustodunum, Axellodunum, Juliodunum, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunum, Melodunum, Noviodunum, Sedunum, Vellannodunum. Clitophon</hi> expresly, <note place="margin">Clitophon.</note> 
                     <hi>Lugaunum, Corvi Collem,</hi> because it was placed on a <hi>Hill;</hi> likewise <hi>Andomatunum,</hi> with a <hi>T,</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Metropolis of the <hi>Lingones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first Country of the <hi>Danmonii</hi> Westward is <hi>Cornwal,</hi> shooting into the Sea, and running into a Point of <hi>Belirium,</hi> the Name of which Country, if we examine the Original of it, and what at this day it is called by the Inhabitants, and the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude it bears with other places, exactly agreeing in Name and Nature with it, we shall find it could be called so by none but the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:58825:37"/>
                  <p>To prove this, let us consider it is agreed unto by all hands, that it received its Name from being like a <hi>Horn,</hi> running sinaller and sinaller, with little Promontories, as if they were <hi>horned</hi> on either side: And this is brought from <hi>Korn,</hi> Plur. <hi>Kern,</hi> signifying <hi>Horns</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Language.</p>
                  <p>Now as this <hi>Kern</hi> or <hi>Korn</hi> is derived from the <hi>Phoenician Cheren,</hi> signifying the same, so the manner of calling Places after that sort came from them also, a thing so frequent in the Eastern Countries, to call any Corner or Angle made, by the name of <hi>Horn;</hi> As for Example, <hi>Cyprus</hi> called <hi>Cerastis,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in <hi>Taurica Chersoneso;</hi> that we are not to doubt but <hi>Cornwal,</hi> called <hi>Kernaw</hi> by the Inhabitants, proceeded from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> here.</p>
                  <p>To give an Instance, the City <hi>Carnon,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> calls it, <hi>Carna,</hi> as <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> meerly <note place="margin">Pliny's <hi>Nat. Hist.</hi> Ptolomy.</note> upon the account of its standing upon an Angle, cut out by two High-waies that met there in a point on which <hi>Carna</hi> was built, one of which Roads from <hi>Mecca</hi> leads to <hi>Tasph,</hi> the other to <hi>Sanaa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this way of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> was frequently in Promontories whose Angles were more discernable, by being made of another Element, as we find <hi>Corsica,</hi> called by the <hi>Phoenicians Carnatha,</hi> afterwards mollified by the <hi>Greeks</hi> into <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and all this, from its having so many Promontories, which by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were called <hi>Kern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Cornwal</hi> was called <hi>Kernaw</hi> by them rather than the Inhabitants, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because there is no other Promontory in this Island so called, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>British</hi> Language was in use through the whole.</p>
                  <p>There are other Places that run into the Sea as much like a Horn as this, which, in my Judgment, is an evident sign of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in this part of <hi>England</hi> above others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because it is more natural to imagine, that Sailers (to whom the shapes of Countries appear at a distance, more than to the Inhabitants) should give the Name, than those that only ply'd upon the Shoars in small <hi>Carows,</hi> or <hi>Leather</hi> and <hi>Wicker</hi> Boats, as the <hi>Britains</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>It is to be observed that <hi>Meneg,</hi> a part of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> which of the South Sea does make another direct Horn, is also of a <hi>Phoenician</hi> derivation, agreeing to that description Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> gives of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a <hi>Demy-Island, Meneog</hi> of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> signifying kept in by the Sea, and which he proves in the <hi>Menna</hi> which <hi>Jornandus</hi> describes out of <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Writer of Antiquities; so that to Sailors afar <note place="margin">Jornandus <hi>ex</hi> Cornello.</note> off, <hi>Cornwal</hi> appears with two <hi>Horns,</hi> striking it self into the Sea, which part of <hi>England,</hi> I believe, was first discovered by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who, without question, finding a world of <hi>Tynn</hi> in them, secured them for themselves.</p>
                  <p>And although <hi>Meneg</hi> is now destitute of all Mettals, as long ago exhausted, yet that there were such Mines in it, hear the same Author:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It has great store of</hi> Mettal <hi>Mines, very full of</hi> Grass <hi>and</hi> Herbs, <hi>bringing forth more plentifully all those things which serve for Pastorage of</hi> Beasts, <hi>and nourishment of</hi> Man.</p>
                  <p>I will only mention one thing in this <hi>Peninsula,</hi> which seems to me exactly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve its <hi>Phoenician</hi> Name, and that is a Fortification of <hi>Stones</hi> only without any Cement or Mortar, lying as upon the Lake <hi>Leopole,</hi> a Fortification after the manner of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> describes them, <hi>Rudes &amp; informes Saxorum compages,</hi> which was the way of the Eastern Nations, as the Scriptures themselves inform <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> us.</p>
                  <p>This Rude heap of <hi>Stones</hi> the Inhabitants call to this day <hi>Erth,</hi> without giving any Reason for so Ancient a Rampier, and of so great a Compass as it is, so that none can induce me to believe but that it took its Name from the Lake on which it lies, for the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> call'd all <hi>Lakes, Arith,</hi> so that this Military Fence called, as I have said, <hi>Erth,</hi> I believe from thence received its Name.</p>
                  <p>There are many Places in these two Counties, <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> which retain exact foot-steps of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> that cannot be found any where else, which I shall omit as nothing easier than to fancy <hi>Similitudes</hi>

                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58825:38"/>
                  <p>The truth of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Trafficks in these Parts do not depend upon such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, but evidenced by Authentick Histories, so that I will not mention <note n="*" place="margin">Note, <hi>Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anac</hi> is a place of <hi>Tynn,</hi> from which <hi>Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> is derived.</note>

                  <p>To instance in the south-side of <hi>Cornwal</hi> only: <hi>Penrose, Pensans, Pengersick, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose</hi> again, <hi>Penwarron, Pendennis, Penkeivel, Penwyn, Pentuan, Penrock,</hi> to which may be added that infinite number of Towns beginning with <hi>Tre,</hi> as <hi>Treewofe, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowth, Tregenno, Trewarveneth, Trevascus, Trenona, Trewaridreth, Treworgan, Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernin, Trelistick, Trefusus, Tregamian, Tremadart, Tregonoc,</hi> which those very same Parts can have no other account given of them, if they proceed not from the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician Cira,</hi> and by contraction <hi>Cra,</hi> signifying a <hi>Castle,</hi> so that they were Forts built by them to secure their Trade.</p>
                  <p>Now give me leave to instance here in some <hi>British</hi> words that agree exactly with the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> which I shall put down in <hi>English</hi> Characters, leaving the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words, and the Roots of them, to the Learned.

                  <p>I will proceed now to shew, how that most of those Words of the Ancient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> brings to prove them one and the same Nation, proceeded from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and that there is as much, or rather more similitude between the <hi>Phoenician</hi> and <hi>British,</hi> than between the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Gaulish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I cannot but wonder, why there should be any dispute concerning the first Inhabitants of this Island, for, I think, it is not to be doubted but that we did receive them from the Continent of <hi>France,</hi> but whether from that Part now called <hi>Belgium,</hi> or from <hi>Piccardy,</hi> or any other particular place, 'tis impossible to be known. For as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> fetches his Antiquities little higher than <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> daies, so if we will bring the <hi>Britains</hi> from those particular <hi>Gauls</hi> that then inhabited that Country, I think it is not reasonably to be allowed him, because it is at least seven or eight hundred years after the Trading of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> into these Parts, in which time <hi>Gallia</hi> might have many and great Revolutions, there being nothing commoner in those daies, than great fluxes and refluxes of Nations, and incursions made by whole and entire People.</p>
                  <p>Now that the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> (I mean those that lived in <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> daies, or thereabouts) was the same, or alike, I think none will deny, or at least, that they agreed in several things. This is so far from needing proof, that I cannot imagine how it could be otherwise, considering the vicinity of them, and how the Sea Coast of <hi>Britain,</hi> as <hi>Caesar</hi> witnesseth, was inhabited by the <hi>Gauls</hi> that came thither to make War, and a prey of their Neighbours; Besides, several <hi>Britains</hi> that warred in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and so returning into <hi>Britain,</hi> might bring a great deal of their Tongue, for it was one of <hi>Caesars</hi> Reasons he gave for his entring <hi>Britain,</hi> that <hi>they had assisted his Enemies the</hi> Gauls, so that the <hi>Britains</hi> going into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and the <hi>Gauls</hi> coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Britain,</hi> they interchangably mixed their Language.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be doubted but that Traders hither, such as the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were, did impart much of their <hi>Language,</hi> as to the <hi>Britains</hi> especially, so to those Inhabitants of <hi>Armorica</hi> on the Sea Coast of <hi>France,</hi> which congruity in Language appears to have proceeded much from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> as shall be next shewn, and especially in those very Words Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> brings for Examples, to evidence the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> were the same People.</p>
                  <p>First then, for <hi>TARAMIS,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> calls <hi>Taranis,</hi> that it may agree better with his <hi>Caran, Thunder,</hi> was a <hi>Gaulish</hi> God, and without dispute worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the <hi>Britains</hi> under the same name. Now this God was <hi>Jupiter</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Tonans,</hi> the <hi>Thunderer,</hi> to whom <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> built a Temple, as many others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Caram</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue signifies <hi>Thunder,</hi> and is supposed so to signifie in the <hi>Gaulish,</hi> upon the account of the name of this God; But <hi>Carem, Thunder,</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, I believe is the Original of the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Gaulish</hi> word, and that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were the cause that this God called by the <hi>Britains Chor,</hi> whom (in treating particularly of the <hi>GODS,</hi> I will prove to be the most Ancient God <hi>Jupiter</hi>) was called <hi>Caram, the Thunderer,</hi> and I verily believe that <hi>Taram</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramis</hi> both, have the same Original.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gauls</hi> had another God called by <hi>Lucan, HESUS,</hi> this <hi>Hesus</hi> is thought to be <hi>Mars,</hi> as we may learn out of the History of the Ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> which not long since <hi>Antonius Gosselinus</hi> put forth; And the name <hi>Hesus</hi> comes from the <hi>Syrian</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>Mars;</hi> and in another place of the same Oration, <hi>Mars</hi> is called <hi>Hazizus</hi> of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> which <hi>Hazizus</hi> comes of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58825:39"/>
                  <p>That this <hi>Hesus</hi> was worshipped in <hi>Britain,</hi> methinks is very plain from many Places that retain his Name; besides <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> witnesseth, the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> had the same Gods; As for <hi>Heus,</hi> I cannot believe him to be the same with <note place="margin">Tacitus. Caesar. Lactant.</note> 
                     <hi>Hesus,</hi> but rather that he is confounded by <hi>Lactantius</hi> with the known name of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and <hi>Hues</hi> which was worshipped in these parts, as I shall shew in the particular Chapter of the <hi>British</hi> GODS; And granting him to be <hi>Anubis Latrans,</hi> and so his name to be preserved in the <hi>British</hi> word <hi>Haud,</hi> a <hi>Dog,</hi> yet could he be brought to these Countries by none but the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who received Him of the <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Tutates</hi> was worshipt in these Parts is most certain,
<q>Tutates <hi>horrensque feris Altaribus</hi> Hesus. <note place="margin">Lucan.</note>
                     </q>
                     <hi>Lucan</hi> declares; and that he was <hi>Mercury, Livy</hi> witnesseth in these words, <hi>Scipio in Tumulum obversus quem Mercurium</hi> Tutatem <hi>appellant.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Livy.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that this <hi>Tutates</hi> was a <hi>Phoenician</hi> God none can doubt, if they consider what <hi>Philo Biblius</hi> writes out of <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> the Ancient <hi>Phoenician</hi> Writer; <note place="margin">Philo Bibl. Sanchonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon.</note> 
                     <hi>Taautus</hi> was born of <hi>Misor,</hi> he invented the first Elements of <hi>Writing,</hi> whom the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> call <hi>Thoot;</hi> the <hi>Alexandrians, Thouth;</hi> the <hi>Greeks, Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercury:</hi> He was promiscuously called <hi>Thoot, Thouth,</hi> or <hi>Theuth;</hi> by <hi>Plato,</hi> in his <hi>Philaebo,</hi> he is called <hi>Theuth,</hi> and in his <hi>Phoedras,</hi> THAMUS King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who has a <note place="margin">Plato's Phil.</note> long conference with him of the use of Letters, where he is called the <hi>Father of Letters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tully</hi> calls him <hi>Thoyth</hi> and <hi>Theuth; Lactantius, Theutus</hi> and <hi>Thot;</hi> from whence it <note place="margin">Tully. Lactantius.</note> plainly appears, that this name of <hi>Mercury, Tutates,</hi> is not of a <hi>British</hi> Original, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> makes it derived from an Office of his, <hi>To guide in Journeys, Diw Caith,</hi> signifying the God of <hi>Travelling</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue.</p>
                  <p>This was but the smallest of this Gods employment, for although that Derivation may found prettily to them that know not the Antiquity of the Name, <hi>TUTATES,</hi> and seek not further than the <hi>Welch</hi> Dictionary, yet it is certain to those that exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine higher, that this God was brought by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and his name, <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,</hi> known long before either <hi>Diw,</hi> or <hi>Caith,</hi> might be in the World.</p>
                  <p>This God <hi>Teuth</hi> ought not to be confounded with <hi>Tuisco,</hi> their Offices, Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Regions from whence they proceeded, being so Geometrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, <hi>Teuth</hi> being a God of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> and came from the <hi>Phoenicians: Tuisco,</hi> on the other side, a great <hi>Warryor,</hi> and <hi>Leader</hi> of the Northern Nations. And seeing the <hi>Graecians</hi> had their Letters from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> it is to be considered whether the Letter <hi>Teth</hi> had not its name from <hi>Teuth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next word Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> brings is <hi>Dusit,</hi> by which the <hi>Gauls</hi> termed their <hi>lucubi,</hi> upon the account of their <hi>filthy Uncleaness</hi> practiced continually amongst them; but how this should come from the <hi>Welch Duth,</hi> signifying only <hi>Continually,</hi> without any thing of their Practice, I cannot imagine, for if one would strain Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies, one might as well bring it from <hi>Dud</hi> of the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> signifying the love of those <hi>unclean Spirits;</hi> but we desire here to be excused.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Divona,</hi> signifying <hi>Gods Fountain,</hi> according to <hi>Ausonius,</hi> in this Verse of his,
<q>Divona <hi>Celtarum lingua fons addite Divis.</hi>
                     </q>
It is acknowledged that <hi>Dyw,</hi> signifying <hi>Gods,</hi> and <hi>Uonan,</hi> a <hi>Fountain,</hi> in the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Tongue; but here we must consider, that as the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> used this word <hi>Dyw</hi> before they conversed with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and so could not receive it from <hi>Deus,</hi> as some may think, so it may easily be supposed that they received it from <hi>Dai</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> but we cannot be so bold as to derive the <hi>Uonan,</hi> although we know a River in <hi>Sicily</hi> called <hi>Danus</hi> by the <hi>Phoenioians,</hi> for its <hi>Weedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and we might bring this <hi>Divona</hi> from <hi>Daionus,</hi> but it shall suffice to shew that both Nations had their <hi>Dyw</hi> from the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58825:39"/>
                  <p>The next word Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> produces is <hi>Senae,</hi> and this he would read <hi>Lenoe,</hi> but it cannot be allowed him, as I shall evidence; For these <hi>Senae</hi> were <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Women,</hi> as <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> writeth, attending upon a certain God, whom the <note place="margin">Pomp. Mela.</note> 
                     <hi>Gauls,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Britains,</hi> worshipped.</p>
                  <p>Now this God, or rather <hi>Gods,</hi> I shall evidence to be the <hi>Phoenician Cabiri,</hi> when I come to treat of the <hi>British</hi> Idolatry, and had their Priests who were called <hi>Coies</hi> and <hi>Coes</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and by the <hi>Phoenicians Coen,</hi> and the Women <hi>Coenae,</hi> afterwards written with an S, <hi>Senae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> will derive his <hi>Lean-Minster</hi> from Consecrated <hi>Virgins,</hi> named <hi>Leanes</hi> by the <hi>Britains,</hi> now called <hi>Nuns,</hi> he must be contented with the word <hi>Laena</hi> of the <hi>Latins,</hi> which word was not alwaies of evil signification among the <hi>Romans,</hi> but taken from them, and used by the <hi>Britains</hi> in a good sense, although afterwards in an ill one; as <hi>Latro</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> and <hi>Villain</hi> and <hi>Knave</hi> among us. For undoubtedly these <hi>Senae</hi> are the same with <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius Mela's Cenoe,</hi> which <hi>Bochartus</hi> will have read <hi>Coenoe,</hi> and are not to be changed, and brought so low as to derive <hi>Lean-Minster.</hi> The words of <hi>Pomponius</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> 
                     <hi>Mela,</hi> are these;</p>
                  <p>SENA, <hi>in the</hi> British <hi>Sea, lying against the</hi> Osismick <hi>Shoars, is famous for an Oracle of some</hi> Gaulish <hi>God, whose devotaries being said to be</hi> Nine <hi>in Number, Sacred, by a</hi> perpetual Virginity, <hi>are called</hi> CENAE <hi>by the</hi> Gauls.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Sena</hi> is now caled <hi>Sayn,</hi> and lieth on the farthest <hi>Armorica.</hi> Now, what Reason there is to turn <hi>Senae</hi> into <hi>Lenoe,</hi> to make a similitude between the Antient <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Gaulish</hi> Language, let any judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Gauls, saith <hi>Polybius, in their own Tongue call their Mercenary Souldiers</hi> Ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satae, <hi>and at this day the</hi> Welch Britains <hi>call their hired Servants, Guessin.</hi> Thus <note place="margin">Polybius. Cambden.</note> Mr. <hi>Cambden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confess, not only <hi>Polibius,</hi> but <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Orosius</hi> say as much, but I am <note place="margin">Plutarch. Orosius.</note> afraid that this Opinion proceeded from the same motives <hi>Euphorius</hi> in <hi>Stephanus</hi> did, <hi>viz.</hi> because they derived them from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Gaza,</hi> signifying <hi>Mony,</hi> or <hi>Treasure;</hi> for <hi>Strabo</hi> makes them a distinct Nation, and so does <hi>Suidas.</hi> And Others derive them from a sort of Weapons called <hi>Gesa,</hi> as <hi>Servius</hi> on the Eighth <note place="margin">Servius, <hi>8th.</hi> AEneid.</note> 
                     <hi>AEneid,</hi> where he reports, that Valiant Men among them were called <hi>Gesi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that among these several Opinions, we must seek out the true Derivation, and not depend on the similitude between the <hi>Gessatae,</hi> and <hi>Guessin, hired Servants,</hi> upon the account only that the <hi>Gassatae</hi> might be <hi>hired.</hi>

                  <p>We find in the <hi>Syrian</hi> Dialect (which the <hi>Phoenician</hi> used) <hi>Gaisa,</hi> and in the Plural Foeminine, <hi>Gaisata,</hi> to signifie an <hi>Army</hi> or <hi>Armies,</hi> and from thence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly proceeded the <hi>Gessatae</hi> of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Guassdewr</hi> of the <hi>British,</hi> signifying a <hi>Valiant Man,</hi> and <hi>Guessin,</hi> an <hi>Hireling;</hi> for I suppose <hi>Gessata</hi> was equally communicated to the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>British.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To shew more plainly that this <hi>Gessatae</hi> was of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Derivation, let us consider <hi>Gessum,</hi> a <hi>Weapon,</hi> said to be peculiar to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and if we find the very name of it, and the same use of it to be among the Eastern Nations, lying upon <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> I hope none then will dispute but that it was received from them, for it was altogether unknown to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins.</hi>

                  <p>It was a kind of a sharp-pointed <hi>Spear-Dart,</hi> which they used to push or dart with as they saw occasion; It was made all of Iron (as <hi>Hesychius</hi> witnesseth) and <note place="margin">Hesychius.</note> every man carried a couple of them in his hand.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Syrians</hi> had the use of this Weapon, and the name of it from the beginning was called <hi>Gisa.</hi> In the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 14. they are called <hi>Gisessin</hi> with the <hi>S</hi> doubled. <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 14</note> And this Weapon was first carried by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> to <hi>Tartessus,</hi> and afterwards, without doubt, brought into our Seas.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Caterva</hi> of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Katurfa</hi> of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as they were the same as a <hi>Legion,</hi> and so consisted of divers sorts of Souldiers, I think they ought to be referred to <hi>Caterva,</hi> signifying the same thing among the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> To this word I think <hi>Kadwarr</hi> and <hi>Kadern,</hi> the <hi>strength of War</hi> in a <hi>Legion,</hi> both <hi>British</hi> words, ought to be referred; so likewise, if you please, <hi>Cateia,</hi> a Warlike <hi>Weapon</hi> among the <hi>Gauls.</hi>

                  <p>These <hi>Bagaudae</hi> were not Rural People only, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> makes, to derive his <hi>British</hi> word <hi>Beichiad,</hi> signifying <hi>Swine-heards,</hi> and Country <hi>Gnoffs,</hi> but many of the better sort, who being intollerably oppressed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were forced to take Arms, as <hi>Salvianus</hi> witnesseth, so that this word also is of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Original, <note place="margin">Salvianus.

                     <hi>Allobroges</hi> saith, an excellent Scholiast on <hi>Juvenal,</hi> were so called, because <hi>Broga</hi> in French, signifies a <hi>Region</hi> or <hi>Country,</hi> and <hi>alla, another.</hi> But <hi>alla</hi> signifies not <hi>another</hi> in the French, but in the Greek, and <hi>Broga</hi> is to be suspected.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>British Bro,</hi> a <hi>Region</hi> or <hi>Country,</hi> comes from <hi>Baro</hi> the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> and perhaps there might be such a word as <hi>Broga</hi> derived from it.

                  <p>Of the Religious Persons <hi>Cenae</hi> we have spoken before, and have made it appear they were of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> derivation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bardi</hi> are sufficiently known to be <hi>Poets,</hi> and <hi>Songsters,</hi> both in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> and 'tis also manifest, they never Rehearsed any thing to the People but in a <hi>tone,</hi> alwaies having some Instrument or other, to which they sang the Famous Deeds of their Ancestors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Posidonius</hi> witnesseth, that they were Poets, who, with Musick, recited the <hi>Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums</hi> of Great Persons, and <hi>Strabo</hi> calls them <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Singers,</hi> and <hi>Festus</hi> saies, <note place="margin">Posidonius, Strabo, Festus.</note> that a <hi>Singer</hi> in the <hi>Gaulish</hi> Tongue was called a <hi>Bard</hi> (and by the <hi>Britains,</hi> at this day they are so called) because he sang the <hi>Praises</hi> of Great Men.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, there can be no easier Derivation than to bring them from <hi>Parat,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying to <hi>sing</hi> in a Recitative manner, for <hi>P</hi> and <hi>B,</hi> likewise <hi>T</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> are Letters of the same nature and element, and in common Speech are every day confounded, not only in our present Language but in all as ever I cou'd hear of.</p>
                  <p>Now as the <hi>Bardi</hi> are derived from <hi>Parat,</hi> so I have shewn before, that the <hi>Nablium,</hi> or Instrument on which they played, was a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Instrument, and was called exactly so by the <hi>Phoenicians, viz. Nabal,</hi> so that we ought not to doubt, but that as well the names of the <hi>Persons</hi> as their <hi>Musick,</hi> were of <hi>Phoenician</hi> derivation.</p>

                  <p>Thus in short have I run over all the Words used by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> to prove the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> the same Nation, with intention not to deny but they were used by both Nations, with variation only in Dialect, but to shew that this consent and harmony, in some points of their Language, cannot evidently demonstrate them one and the same People, but that it proceeded from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Traffick into <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Mart for <hi>Tynn</hi> which they kept in <hi>Gaul.</hi> To which may be added, that the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as <hi>Caesar</hi> witnesseth, sent their Children into <hi>Britain</hi> to be Educated in <note place="margin">Caesar.</note> 
                     <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> where, without any doubt, they learnt great part of their Language; For <hi>Britain</hi> being the Learneder Nation of the two, could not proceed from any other cause than the Concourse of <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> to it upon the account of Trade, but especially the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> of whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves confess they received their Letters.</p>

                  <p>How that the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> about the time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, sayled into these Seas, first discovering the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands, and finding them full of <hi>Tynn</hi> Mines, they called them in their Language BRATANAC. From hence they carried all the <hi>Tynn</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> afterwards used, who from the <hi>Phoenician, Bratanac,</hi> called them in their Language word for word the same, namely, CASSITERIDES; But when <hi>Bratanac</hi> prevailed, then the <hi>Greeks</hi> used <hi>Bretanica</hi> long before <hi>Britannia,</hi> as has been proved. And that some Islands about <hi>Albion</hi> were called <hi>Britains</hi> before this it self was called so, I have manifested out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> which Islands could be none but the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands; But when the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had discovered the Mines of <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> then began the Name to prevail over this Island also. To make this evident, I have shewn many Foot-steps and Remains of their <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> remaining to this day among the <hi>Britains,</hi> and especially in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and have given a short Catalogue of Words, relating to the scituation and nature of <hi>Places</hi> which most frequently occur, in the composition of <hi>Towns, Cities, Forts, Hills, &amp;c.</hi> in the Western parts of <hi>England,</hi> where they most conversed.</p>
                  <p>And all this, that the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Voyages to Our Island might appear the more clear and evident, and that <hi>Britain</hi> it self received its Name from them, as well as other more particular Places, which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in one particular himself confesses, when he saies, <hi>That the</hi> Syrians, meaning the <hi>Phoenicians, sending out so many Colonies, left great part of their Language in most places of the World;</hi> Now if he had seriously considered, and not have deceived himself by misunderstanding <hi>Plybius, That</hi> Britain <hi>was but lately known,</hi> certainly he would have given a more exact account of this most Renowned Island, and never have derived its name from <hi>Bryth, Painting,</hi> a Custome among very few of them, and that many hundred years after it was called <hi>Bretanica.</hi>

                  <p>HAving discoursed thus much of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in this ISLAND, it will not be amiss to shew from whence they derive their Original.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bochartus</hi> (in his first Book, and first Chapter, concerning <hi>Canaan</hi>) learnedly and evidently proves, that they were the same with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> from the Identity of their <hi>Names</hi> (although promiscuously given them) <hi>Scituations, Language, Institutes, Arts, Manners, Customes, Gods, Rites</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> By promiscuousness, I mean, when as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is called, the Land of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> As for Example, the <note n="*" place="margin">Rahab.</note> Woman in St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Gospel is called a <hi>Canaanite,</hi> by St. <hi>Marks</hi> interpretation is made a <hi>Syrophoenician,</hi> which clearly demonstrates the promiscuous way of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that People, although all of one Original.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Bochartus</hi> further shews, that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were the Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> and therefore saies, that the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To treat now a little of the Correspondency and Agreement between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> will be necessary, and as we have had occasion to set down the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> so in brief shall that be concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when it is to be considered there happened so mutual a Friendship and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency between them.</p>
                  <p>The word HEBREW in most likelyhood proceeded from <hi>Eber,</hi> or <hi>Heber,</hi> the father of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> so called from the <hi>Confusion of Languages,</hi> and it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that all the Nations of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> by different Sir-names, were derived from the best known Authors of their Families, which in a particular manner is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Moses</hi> himself, in his Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> Chap. the <hi>10th.</hi> and so it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with <hi>Heber</hi> and <hi>Phalegs</hi> Generations, who were the Issue of <hi>Shem;</hi> yet all the People that sprang from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> differed not in their Language <note place="margin">Grorius <hi>in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad</hi> Gall. 114, <hi>p.</hi> 242. Hesychius.</note> save only in Dialect, and it is instanced in the <hi>Punick</hi> Language, to shew the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and them; and it is further Argued, that the difference in latter times did more plainly appear, foisting, by long continuance, many things into the <hi>Punick</hi> which were intrinsick thereunto, insomuch that those words that did agree with the Radicals of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> differed only in the flexions of Vowels in sound, and yet not in signification.</p>
                  <p>The Hebrew continued in its native purity until the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which Language, beginning from the Creation, was preserved very near Three thousand and forty years, and then, and not before, it degenerated from its primary Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their return from the Captivity, suffered the <hi>Chaldee, Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Philistin</hi> Idioms to intrude into it, and therefore no wonder there happened in process of time, some variance relating thereunto, that at last they lost both the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Worship they were born in.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the word HEBREW was particularly appropriated to <hi>Israel,</hi> it was because the <hi>Israelites</hi> possest the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by a divine Decree, and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had not enjoyed their Language so long as they did, had it not been for the benefit of the Patriarks, to make their Peregrination in <hi>Canaan</hi> the more easie.</p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:58825:44"/>
                  <p>In the first Ages of the World, between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> there happened a great disagreement in maintaining of <hi>Interests, Rights</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> but after some debate between them, the <hi>Jews</hi> taking a fancy to the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Worship, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> answered their kindness, by affecting their mysterious Doctrine and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and so, making <hi>Religion</hi> like a Merchandize of Goods, they exchanged the one for the other, the <hi>Jews</hi> sent them Traditions, Laws, and Mysteries, in lieu of which was returned, a set method of Idolatry, Custome; and the Name of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> which happened so early as to receive its first birth in the time of the <hi>Judges,</hi> yet grew not up to its nature and full perfection till <hi>Solomons</hi> time, and if the true Original of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> according to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is to be derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, intimating the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> which relates to the passage of the <hi>Israelites</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as they agree in Names, so must they be one and the same People without such need of distinction, insomuch that where <hi>Herodotus,</hi> under <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> the name of <hi>Phoenicians</hi> treats of the <hi>Jews,</hi> speaks, <hi>that those</hi> Jews <hi>that were Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised in</hi> Palestine <hi>were called</hi> Syrians, which was an additional name to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and a great probability of it, <hi>Syria</hi> lying as near <hi>Judaea</hi> as one County or Village in <hi>England</hi> can properly be said to border one upon another, so that in time, what by Commerce and Neighbour-hood, they might be best known by one and the same Name.</p>
                  <p>The cause of making the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> so early Marriners, was not only through their ambition of Empire, and particular genius to Navigation and Merchandize, but through necessity of inventing the best and safest way of escaping the hands of <hi>Joshua,</hi> who persecuted them with an Army of <hi>Israelites,</hi> who after they had made themselves Masters of most part of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they were driven up into a slender Nook of Earth, too narrow to contain so great and numerous a Body, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded themselves into good Shipping, to seek their Fortunes in most parts of the World, of whose Company <hi>Britain</hi> received a considerable share.</p>
                  <p>These were the People so publickly commended for distributing <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> and if we should attempt to trace them to the end of their long Voyages, value the Richness of their Merchandize, we must measure the Heavens, and number the Stars, which certainly is beyond the Art of Arithmetick to accomplish.</p>

               <p>The usefulness of those excellent Commodities imported from <hi>Britain</hi> into those Parts, rendered the <hi>Greeks</hi> very curious after the search of them; It is not to be doubted, but the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> very studiously concealed this Treasure from them, as we find they did from the <hi>Romans,</hi> because they being the great Trading Nation of the World, they were jealous least these Mines once discovered to their Neighbours (who by this time had learnt of them the Art of <hi>Navigation</hi>) they should lose the Advantages, that infinite Trade of <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> which had hitherto been a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Monopoly to themselves, and which they had dispersed and sold to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at their own prizes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That this is true,</hi> Strabo <hi>in his third Book of his</hi> Geography <hi>witnesseth:</hi> 'At the <note place="margin">Strabo, <hi>lib. 3. Geogr.</hi>
                  </note> beginning <hi>(saith he)</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> alone Traded to <hi>Britain</hi> from <hi>Gades,</hi> and concealed from others this Navigation; but when a <hi>Roman</hi> Vessel followed a certain Master of a Ship, that they themselves might learn this traffick of Merchandize, he upon a spiteful Envy ran his Ship on purpose upon the Sands, and after he had brought them, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after, into the same danger of destruction, himself escaped the Shipwrack, and out of the Common Treasury received the worth of the Commodities and Wares be had lost.</p>
               <p>Now if this diligence were used by them, after the <hi>Greeks</hi> had discovered the source of their Trade, how jealous ought we to imagine them to be of this Secret, when as it was preserved intirely and peculiarly to their own Nation; So that as the <hi>Greeks</hi> knew these Islands long before the <hi>Romans,</hi> so are they to give place to the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who were their Masters and Instructers in the Art of <hi>Navigation,</hi> as well as in all other Arts and Sciences whatsoever.</p>
               <p>But, although the <hi>Greeks</hi> were later than the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in these Coasts, yet they were far earlier than Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> will acknowledge them, which I mention because the Derivation of the word <hi>BRITANNIA</hi> depends altogether upon the true stating of this matter. For if the <hi>Greeks</hi> arrived hither not above one hundred and sixty years, or there abouts, before <hi>Caesar's</hi> time, under <hi>Phileus Taurominites,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> out of <hi>Athenaeus</hi> seems to intimate, higher than which he will not admit of the Antiquity of <hi>Britain,</hi> then it might be indeed supposed, that since all Nations were so far Civilized as to wear Garments to cover their nakedness, the hardiness and customes of the <hi>Britains</hi> to the contrary might give occasion to Forraigners, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate them and their Nation from the <hi>Painting</hi> of their Bodies, which but very few of them used as the only covering of their Nakedness in that more civil and resormed Age. But if the <hi>Greeks</hi> were in this Island in those Early daies, when it was not any strang and unusual thing for Travellers to find Nations rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed, it cannot be supposed this Island of all others should meet with the ill luck to have a Name stampt upon it, as a perpetual monument of its savage Custome, and Barbarity.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58825:45"/>
               <p>To omit here, that if the <hi>Greeks</hi> had named them from this Custome of <hi>Painting,</hi> they would have done it as they did by other Nations, by a word totally peculiar to themselves (as we find the <hi>Picti,</hi> on the same account, so called by the <hi>Romans</hi>) and not have borrowed the better half of the word from the <hi>Britains,</hi> and have made it up only with a termination of their own.</p>
               <p>We find no such respect shewn by the <hi>Greeks</hi> to any Nation they gave name unto, for their Ambition suffered them not to be so modest in imposing Names upon Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they discovered, by borrowing any thing from the Nation it self, as might be shewn in many Instances, as <hi>AEgypt, AEthiopia, &amp;c.</hi> and more particularly in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> For when they had learned the word <hi>BRATANAC,</hi> by which the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> called this Country of <hi>Tynn,</hi> they gave it a clear contrary name, though of the same signification in their own, <hi>GASSITERIS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be supposed it was a great while before they could be induced to follow the <hi>Phoenician</hi> name, till such time it made them as it were deaf, by being so rung in their ears by the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Marriners, so that it was grown so frequent in all mens mouths, that had any concern in Trade, that they saw themselves obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the universal consent of Saylors, in calling it something like <hi>Bratanac,</hi> viz. <hi>Bretanica,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Britannia,</hi> and all this long before any <hi>Greek</hi> had either set foot, or seen any part of these Islands; so that BRITANNIA was famous in the Monuments of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> long before either <hi>Brith</hi> or <hi>Brit,</hi> a diminutive Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the ancient Name had prevailed in this Nation. This will appear plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we shew the Voyages of the <hi>Greeks</hi> hither, are much Ancienter than what is commonly supposed, or is of necessity to be allowed by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in the making up of his Antiquities; for by his misunderstanding of <hi>Polybius,</hi> as has been evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently shewn before, he ran himself into this Error, <hi>That</hi> Britain <hi>was not known to the Ancients long before</hi> Caesars <hi>time,</hi> and upon that great Mistake, though but few apprehend it, begins his structure of the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of this Nation, not so high as he ought justly and truly to have done.</p>
               <p>And here I doubt not but it will be easily granted, that the <hi>Graecians</hi> arrival into these Parts, was not the same way we suppose these Countries to be Peopled by, that is, through <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and so by successive Colonies drawn along through those spacious and vast Territories, but that they came through the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar.,</hi> as Merchants, to Traffick in these Western Seas. This will more evidently appear, if we consider, that between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great, and long after, there was not the least mutual knowledge one of the other, so that their passage could not be over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> through <hi>Gaul,</hi> and as for <hi>Germany,</hi> we are certain how that was shut up to all Passengers by the reserved and Warlike temper of the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Livy,</hi> when he comes to write of the state of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Papirius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Liv7.</note> and <hi>Manlius,</hi> Consuls, when <hi>Alexander</hi> had arrived to the full pitch of all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and had now made himself <hi>Master,</hi> as he thought, <hi>of all the World,</hi> sets down the posture of Affairs in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the Nation, the excellent <hi>Commanders</hi> it enjoyed, their <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> in War, the Martial temper of the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> their long accustomedness to <hi>War,</hi> and the <hi>Experience</hi> they had gained in their habitual exercise in it, the severe <hi>Discipline</hi> they underwent, the least breach whereof was unpardonable, though in a <hi>Son</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> as was seen in <hi>Manlius.</hi> This concludes, that if <hi>Alexander</hi> had attempted them, as no doubt he would had he heard of them, he had found them an equal Match, and his full careir of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory had met with a sudden Rub, and probable obstruction in his design.</p>
               <p>This Argues, that the <hi>Graecians</hi> had not arrived to any knowledge of the Western Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> on the Continent, and that wheresoever we find them, as most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we do on the Sea Coast of <hi>Spain, France, Belgium, &amp;c.</hi> is to be attributed to their Sea Voyages, by which all along the skirts of <hi>Europe</hi> abounded with them.</p>
               <p>Thus we find St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> in his Questions upon <hi>Genesis</hi> (setting aside the ground of his Hypothesis) out of most Ancient and Authentick Writers, shewing the matter <note place="margin">St. Hieroms <hi>Quest. on</hi> Gen.</note> of fact, <hi>That the Sea Coast of</hi> Europe, <hi>and all the Isles throughout, even to</hi> Britain, <hi>were inhabited by the</hi> Greeks, and this he proves out of <hi>Varro's</hi> Book of Antiquities, <note place="margin">Varro's <hi>Antiq.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Sisinius Capito, Phlegon</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> and divers others.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:58825:46"/>
               <p>If then the <hi>Greeks</hi> did at first only inhabite the Sea Coasts of <hi>Europe,</hi> there must some competent time be allowed before they could penetrate very far into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Country, especially if we consider them as <hi>Navigators</hi> only, whose business was not to settle any considerable Colonies where they arrived, but to keep Marts only, and to fix themselves in convenient Parts for the carrying on of Trade.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, we find the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the very heart of <hi>Gaul,</hi> setled, both in their <hi>Customes, Language</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> which, in my opinion, is a perfect demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that they had long before been in those Western Seas. For can it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a Nation coming so far as they, and arriving at <hi>Britain</hi> and the Sea Coasts of <hi>Gaul,</hi> could (without Conquest) fix themselves, their Customes and Religions, and not some hundred of years past.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is to be supposed, the <hi>Greeks</hi> were much sooner in <hi>Britain</hi> than <hi>Gaul,</hi> and much more conversant, if we consider how the <hi>Gauls</hi> used to send their Children to be instructed of the <hi>Druids</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> and how in this Island, and in <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Anglesey,</hi> were publick Assemblies, and general Rendevouz held by all the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to which People from neighbouring Nations, and all Parts, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, we find the Greek Language not only in <hi>Britain,</hi> but even in those barren and Mountainous parts of <hi>Gaul,</hi> which the <hi>Helvetii</hi> inhabited. Learning by this time had found its way even unto those Parts out of which the Inhabitants themselves, weary of their Country, scarce could find a passage; For the <hi>Helvetii,</hi> after they had burnt their Houses, and agreed upon a general March of the whole Nation, to seek out some New Plantation, the first difficulty we find them encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with, is, how to get out of their Country, so securely bounded as it was with Hills and Rivers, that it seemed to them rather a Prison than a Defence, and yet upon their return, being beaten by <hi>Caesar,</hi> there was found (as he himself writes) and brought to him <hi>Table Books</hi> written in Greek Letters, wherein was Recorded exactly the number of all that went forth, how many bore Arms, besides old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children.</p>
               <p>We see what footing the <hi>Greeks</hi> had gotten in these parts, in the daies of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and therefore I leave it to the Reader to judge, Whether in a hundred, or two hundred years time, Traders out of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> could so fully plant them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Language in these Parts, as to be trusted with the managements of the Records of a whole Nation?</p>
               <p>The Foot-steps of the <hi>Greeks</hi> are so ancient and frequent in these Islands, that it has given occasion to many to think that they were the first Planters of them, and the Reasons they give are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They must needs be planted by Navigators, because they are I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Graecians,</hi> in the first Ages of the World, were esteemed among the best Navigators, taking in the <hi>Ionians,</hi> and the Inhabitants of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Islands, all of <hi>Greek</hi> extraction, and differing only in Dialect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is certain that their Colonies were very numerous through all the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi> and that they passed the Streights is undoubtedly true, after <hi>Colaeus</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> had first, of all that Nation, discovered the West Seas, so that 'tis probable, they wan'ed not People to plant even in these Islands also, as well as in several places in <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> that lay to the Sea Coast.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They suppose the Greek Language, or a Dialect thereof, altogether used in these Islands, till corrupted and grown out of use among the People, It was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served only entire among the <hi>Druids,</hi> whom they cannot otherwise imagine could have that Language, unless there had been some plantation of the People formerly in these parts.</p>
               <p>What makes them the more confident in this Judgment, is, That the <hi>Druids</hi> had the very same Interests, and used the very same practice as the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy do, in sticking fast to the Ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. And they took notice of a great jealousie in the <hi>Druids,</hi> least their <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> should be too much understood and divulged; so that it was grown to that height, that it was accounted almost unlawful to reveal any of their <hi>Mysteries,</hi> or to set down in writing, what they thought most safe and honourable for themselves to deliver by Tradition.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:58825:46"/>
               <p n="5">5. Their manner and expert way of fighting in <hi>Chariots,</hi> after the Ancient manner of <hi>Greece</hi> and the Countries adjoyning, when it was unknown to the <hi>Roman</hi> Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.</p>
               <p>Now this is a great Argument of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Antiquity in these parts, and <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Commentaries takes notice of it as a wonderful thing, and a great novelty, where he describes their way of Fighting, and much admiring their dexterity and agility of Body, their nimble and sudden turns; and here it will not be amiss to put down his very words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Fighting, for the most part, the</hi> Britains <hi>employed their Charioteers, first these drive about through all parts of the Battle, and fling Darts, and with the terrible sight</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caesars <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of Horse, and ratling noise of the Wheels, they do most commonly break their Ranks, and put them in disorder, and after they have once forced themselves within the Troops of Horse-men, they descend from their Chariots and fight on foot. The Chariot Guiders in the mean time withdraw a little from the hurry, and place themselves in such postures, that if the other be overpowred by the number of Enemies, they may readily, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hinderance, retreat in safety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus in their Fights, they performed the quick motion of Horse-men, and have the steadiness of Foot-men. By daily practice and experience so ready in their Service, that on the descent of steep Hills they can stop their Horses, although in full Carreer, quickly turn short, and yet moderate their Course, run along the spire-pole and beam of their Chariots, rest upon the yoak and harness of their Horses, and from thence jump again, with ease, into their Chariots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, by the by, we may take notice; that the expertness they had in their Chariots, argues, that they long had known the use of them, and consequently, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had been longer in these Islands than is for the most part conceived, and yet not so long as to be the <hi>first Planters;</hi> and that the Nakedness and <hi>Painting</hi> of some of them, was rather a corruption and degenerating from the <hi>Greeks</hi> Civility in those points, than the reason of their Name; For the <hi>Greeks</hi> are supposed to be here long before any such Custome, and if at first the <hi>Greeks</hi> did find them Naked, yet was it long before any such word as <hi>Brith</hi> was used among them, which is not conjectured by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> to be long before <hi>Caesars</hi> time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There were <hi>two</hi> different Nations in <hi>Britain</hi> taken notice of by <hi>Caesar,</hi> one of which proceeded out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> to which People I think Mr. <hi>Cambdens</hi> Antiquities only refer, who came out of a desire of Conquest, and so planted themselves on the Sea Coasts.</p>
               <p>The other sort were they within the Land, of Ancienter date and settlement, who acknowledged themselves to be derived from none of their Neighbours, either because they were ignorant of their Original, or perhaps thought, according as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did, that there was no greater honour than to be sprung from that Earth they possessed, and so gave out, according to the usual Custome of those times, that they were <hi>Aborigines,</hi> so that the <hi>Greeks</hi> called them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and this People it is they imagine to be of <hi>Greek</hi> Stock, and to be the primitive Planters of this Island, being, as <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> write, they were of a different Stature and Complexion from <note place="margin">Caesar. Tacitus.</note> those whom they gather to have come out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> besides their similitude of <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Another Reason they give for their Opinion, is, that although they do not believe all the History of <hi>Brute</hi> to be true in every point concerning the <hi>Trojans,</hi> who, on the matter, may be accounted <hi>Graecians,</hi> if we consider <hi>Dardanus</hi> their Founder, and the vicinity of the two Nations, so they cannot imagine but there was some Truth in the ground of that History, although so obscured with the Fabulous superstructures of some Writers, that not being able to undergo the test of Wise men, the whole Story has had the fate to be accounted Idle and Ridiculous. For, say they, if one consider the consonancy of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language with the <hi>British,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, several Manners and Customes the <hi>British</hi> had, which were peculiar to them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and to no other of these Western Nations, certainly we may reckon them to be of one Stock or Language, yet the first Historian finding this great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, might be ambitious (according to the Customes of those times) to derive his Country-men from a <hi>Trojan</hi> Race, and so put this general Truth into a particular dress of his own.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:58825:47"/>
               <p>These are the <hi>Reasons</hi> given by Wise men, by which they verily think the <hi>Britains</hi> to be primitively of a <hi>Greek</hi> Original, which though it cannot be true (considering how I have shewed before, that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Traded into these Islands some hundred of years before ever any <hi>Greek</hi> entered these Seas) yet does it plainly shew, that they were of longer standing in these Islands than is commonly supposed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now as for the <hi>first Reason</hi> given, <hi>That these Islands must be planted by Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">

                     </gap>
                  </note> I think will not hold good, unless we call there <hi>Navigators</hi> who in small <hi>Wicker</hi> Boats used to row between <hi>Britain, Gaul</hi> and <hi>Belgium;</hi> for, from that Continent do I rather believe the first Planters to come, than from the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> through the Streights.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the <hi>second Reason</hi> I answer, That the <hi>Greeks</hi> were not in the first Ages of the World esteemed the best Navigators, but that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> preceded them both in <hi>time</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> in those Arts, has been shewn already.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the <hi>Third,</hi> That although their <hi>Colonies</hi> were numerous, yet were they not so early as those of the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. To the <hi>Fourth,</hi> That although their <hi>Language</hi> was very frequent in <hi>Britain,</hi> and the <hi>Welch</hi> to this day has very much in it, yet cannot we reasonably suppose that it was the only <hi>Language</hi> of the Country, because we find not their Tongue in any Country so soon, and so much corrupted, so as in <hi>Caesar</hi> there is no notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it at all, which he certainly would have done, if he had found the <hi>British</hi> Tongue only a derivation from the <hi>Greek,</hi> or corruption in Dialect, and not a quite different Language.</p>
               <p>As for the similitude that is made between <hi>Druids</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy at this day (I think) it holds better, if we suppose the Religion and Worship of the <hi>Greeks</hi> brought hither, and preserved in its Native Language, than to conjecture, that the People understood it at first, but by <hi>time</hi> and <hi>ill manners</hi> lost the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To the <hi>Fifth,</hi> That the Chariots of <hi>Greece,</hi> as well as other <hi>Customes</hi> of theirs used by the <hi>Britains,</hi> argues the <hi>Greeks</hi> to have been here indeed, but proves not they were the only Planters, or brought those <hi>Chariots</hi> to take possession of an empty Country.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To the <hi>Sixth,</hi> Although there were <hi>two</hi> different Nations in this Island, yet <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> takes no notice of the Inland People, more than the <hi>Gaulish</hi> Britains, <note place="margin">Caesar. Tacitus.</note> as I may call them, as being of a more <hi>Greekish</hi> extraction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To the <hi>Seventh,</hi> That although there may be some Truth couched in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Brute,</hi> yet do not the Histories of <hi>Brute,</hi> prove, but that there were others before him in this Island, which makes me wonder at Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> and Others, that think, that in adhering to the History of <hi>Brute,</hi> we must cast off the search and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Antiquity of the Inhabitants of this Island.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> to prove that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> had no Commerce together, <note place="margin">Sheringham, <hi>de Orig.</hi> Angl.</note> brings in an Ancient Poet in <hi>Eustathius,</hi> who reckoning up all the Greatest Islands known to the <hi>Graecians,</hi> never makes mention of <hi>Britain,</hi> which he would have done in the first place, had he ever heard of it.

               <p>But to this may be Answered, That this Poet, as usually all Poets, do reckon only the Islands of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which were most obvious to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled not himself with the <hi>exactness</hi> of things, as we see by his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Besides, it may be Answered, That although the Islands about <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> it self, were known to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet at first they did not know this to be an Island, having nothing to do in the more Northern parts; It was not long before the <hi>Romans</hi> time, when <hi>Thule,</hi> and six daies say I beyond <hi>Britain,</hi> was discovered, of which <hi>Pythias</hi> makes mention, <hi>The</hi> Graecians, <hi>as well as the</hi> Phoenicians, <hi>at first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pythias,</note> 
                  <hi>themselves with the Commodities of the</hi> Southern <hi>and</hi> Western <hi>parts of these Islands, and no doubt but they secured themselves, by little and little, of the nature of the People, and conveniencies of Ports, and all other Provisions, before they ventured too far Northward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in my Opinion, this makes nothing against the <hi>Greek</hi> Voyages into these parts, to whom the <hi>Cassiterides,</hi> or the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands, and <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> might be known, yet they had not discovered <hi>Catness,</hi> or the extreamest point of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he saies afterwards, <hi>That before the Arrival of</hi> Caesar <hi>into this Island, the Name</hi> of Britain <hi>cannot be found,</hi> is a great mistake and madvertency, for <hi>Polybius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Polybius, <hi>lib. 3.</hi>
                  </note> in his Third Book, makes mention of it particularly, and by Name, where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to give an account, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of the <hi>British</hi> Islands, and the making and ordering of their <hi>Tynn,</hi> which he performed, if we may believe <hi>Strabo,</hi> who brings him in conferring and confuting the Opinions of <hi>Pytheas, Dicaearcbus,</hi> and <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> concerning the <hi>Magnitude</hi> of <hi>Britain.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringham</hi> ran himself into the same Error of Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> I suppose, by mistaking of <hi>Polybius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But granting that we do not find the Name of <hi>Britain,</hi> or very rarely, before <hi>Caesars</hi> time among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet the Name of <hi>Cassiterides</hi> was sufficiently known, likewise <hi>Albion</hi> was in frequent use among them. And if any Object, <hi>That this</hi> Island <hi>was not any of the</hi> Cassiterides, yet let any one judge, whether it be reasonable to imagine those <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands discovered, and yet <hi>Britain</hi> that lies in sight not to be known to them, especially considering, that <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire</hi> did not less abound in <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reasons why we meet not with <hi>BRITAIN</hi> oftner in the Writings of the Ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> may be these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it lay so far off, and did not concern or relate to any thing of the <hi>Greeks</hi> Polity, as to be taken notice of by their Historians; They sent no Governours hither, nor any that presided over the Colony, but the Commodities of the Country were sent either through <hi>France,</hi> up to a Mart in <hi>Narbo,</hi> or else to the <hi>Veneti,</hi> or else, by Sea, through the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> so that the Learneder sort of the <hi>Graecians</hi> could not attain to much information of those places, from whence they that went to them seldom retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, having no Reason so to do, upon the account of the <hi>plenty</hi> of the Soyl, and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of the Country, and the <hi>Dominion</hi> the wiser sort had gotten, by their <hi>Learning,</hi> over the minds of a rude and barbarous People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Besides, the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians concerned themselves, more, in relating the Actions of their Country-men, as they had respect to their Neighbours, extolling the puissance of their Commonwealth in comparison of those States that bordered upon, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten invaded them; Their resolute and vigorous defence of their Laws, and Liberties, against the frequent and numerous Expeditions made against them, is the greatest subject made use of by their Writers, in extolling their <hi>Policy,</hi> and <hi>Conduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It had been a vain thing, and besides their purpose, to have Recorded their New Discoveries and Acquests in the <hi>Western</hi> Seas, as <hi>Britain</hi> in particular, when all the World saw them strugling at home, not to increase Empire, but to preserve their Lives and Liberties.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would have been esteemed a strang and extravagant humour, if whilst they were almost over-run by the <hi>Persians, Athens</hi> burnt, and they forced to betake themselves, according to the Oracle, to their Wooden walls. And afterwards, when <hi>Philip,</hi> a powerful and politick Prince, had designed and almost perfected their Rume, with many other Calamities they underwent, both among themselves and from others, that their Historians then should be comforting themselves with their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58825:48"/>
great Atchievments in a New World, as these Islands, for their Remoteness might have been esteemed. What laughter would this have raised do we think in their Reader, if then they should have given blessed and exact descriptions of the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Islands</hi> as these were, thought probably to be esteemed by them, when they were every day contending for their own Country, of which they accounted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves '<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Aborigines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> being of so forraign a concern to them, as to the Polity of their Government, although they were concerned in the Commodities of <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>I. ead,</hi> I never could wonder why we hear no more of it in their Writers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I consider, that the <hi>Romans</hi> (whom for their increase and growth, the whole World began to have an eye on) were so lately discovered unto them, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is vain to infer, because the <hi>Romans</hi> were not mentioned either in <hi>Thucidides</hi> or <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that therefore the <hi>Greeks</hi> had no knowledge of <hi>Italy.</hi> Yet certainly, <note place="margin">Thucidides. Herodotus.</note> that Country is as little mentioned by the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians of that time, as <hi>Britain,</hi> although <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> some say, before others, after the daies of <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> had seated himself on the Sea Coasts, which afterwards was called <hi>Magna Graecia,</hi> and it is manifest to all that have read any thing of the <hi>Greek</hi> Voyages, that they traded to that part of <hi>Italy</hi> called <hi>Ager Brutiorum,</hi> by them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for <hi>Pitch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it happens with <hi>Britain,</hi> in this respect, the same as it did with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Italy,</hi> because the <hi>Greeks</hi> contented themselves to trade upon the Sea Coasts of <hi>Italy</hi> only, so that they make little or no mention of the Inhabitants; therefore we must think them to have no Commerce at all with them, when indeed it is only true, that they were ignorant of the higher and Northerly parts only, but not of the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Insomuch as we find in <hi>Stephanus,</hi> that in those daies <hi>Italy</hi> was no more (than the Country of the <hi>Brutii</hi>) with the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <note place="margin">Stephanus, <hi>in voce</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>
                  </q>
And if one had asked a <hi>Greek</hi> what <hi>Italy</hi> was, he would have told him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which was but a Province, and a small part of the flourishing Country. And, I seriously believe, the same account would he have given, should one have demanded, whether it were an Island or no.</p>
               <p>If it happened so with <hi>Italy,</hi> which was so nigh unto them, what great account can we expect of <hi>Britain</hi> from them, whose distance rendered it more capable of an exact account.</p>
               <p>For, although it be no question, but that the <hi>Greeks</hi> Traded hither, and that several Colonies of the <hi>AEolians</hi> had seated themselves in these parts, yet do I judge, that they were for a long time altogether ignorant of the greater part of this Island, nay, they knew not whether it was an Island or no, contenting themselves at first with the knowledge of the <hi>Scilly,</hi> and adjacent Islands, <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Anglesey,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> small parts of this large and spacious Dominion, and that the name of <hi>Britains</hi> was first given to them alone from the <hi>Phoenician Bratanac,</hi> or a Country of <hi>Tynn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What exact account can be expected from them, I say, who first must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to employ all their time in the Traffick of the Country, and the heaping up of such Commodities as would make amends for their great Costs and long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages?</p>
               <p>It is not to be supposed, that when they had set footing on so plentiful a Place, as this was ever esteemed, that they would return on purpose to give true Relations of it, to satisfie the natural Inquisitiveness of their Country Men after News, or quit the possession of a peaceable Trade, to run the hazards of continual War at home.</p>
               <p>Yet, seeing these ISLANDS are mentioned by their Historians, sometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Name, sometimes under another, and it is agreed on all hands, that the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands were the <hi>Cassiterides</hi> mentioned by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and that <hi>Polybius,</hi> above two hundred years before <hi>Christ,</hi> makes particular mention of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58825:48"/>
of <hi>Tynn</hi> thence exported, we may in all reason suppose them to have been discovered by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> though upon the aforesaid accounts given, their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors make no such particular relations of them, as some, in vain, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>Having premised thus much concerning any Intercourse that might happily pass, between them of <hi>Greece</hi> and their Country men that first Landed in these parts, I shall proceed to shew, what <hi>Remains</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> have left in this Island, and shall set down the Opinions of Authors as touching their <hi>Language,</hi> the progress they made in promoting their <hi>Customes</hi> and <hi>Language,</hi> and the designs they carried on in managing of their <hi>Authority</hi> with the People, and then I shall leave it to any to judge, whether that great esteem and veneration their <hi>Druids</hi> were in, when <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> entered this Island, and that vast opinion all had of their Judgment and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, so that recourse was made to them in all matters of moment and difficulty, could be acquired in so few years, as is generally supposed, and whether it be likely, that a Nation so stubborn and hardy as the <hi>Britains,</hi> are easily conjectured, would submit so quickly to forreign <hi>Customes,</hi> and yield their necks to the yoke of <hi>Greek</hi> Sacrifices, which spared not often their dearest Children, and nearest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Where, by the by, we may take notice, that this sacrificing of <hi>Men, Women,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> devoting the lives of Captives and Prisoners to the Altars of the <hi>Gods,</hi> as we find the <hi>Druids</hi> used to do, was a Custome left off by the <hi>Graecians</hi> of the latter Ages, and was the peculiar Blemish of their Fore-fathers, in the times of their Great <hi>Hero's,</hi> when the shedding of Blood was a Princely thing, and was so esteemed for its own sake; so that it is not to be in the least imagined, that these <hi>Druids,</hi> men generally reported of a moral and honest Conversation, would begin such Bloody Customes, had they not for a long time received them from their Predecessors, and so on, till we come to that Age of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> which first sent Colonies into these Nations, and brought over those <hi>Customes</hi> which were then esteemed commendable even in <hi>Greece</hi> it self.</p>

                  <p>THe Places where the <hi>Greeks</hi> first Landed, is guessed, by some, to be the two Islands, <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Anglesey,</hi> or one of them, and the Reasons given are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Because the <hi>Druids,</hi> whose Name proves them of a <hi>Greek</hi> Original, upon the discovery of this Island, the more known Parts of the World principally resided in these Two; There they had their Head quarters, as I may say, hither resorted as to publick Seminaries, all that desired to be instructed in their <hi>Learning,</hi> or initiated in their <hi>Religion,</hi> here they studied privately, and retired, sometimes twenty years together, to learn their Mysteries, which was not permitted them to carry away, otherwise than in their Memories; When <hi>Britain</hi> was invaded, to <hi>Anglesey</hi> then retired the Southern <hi>Druids</hi> and their Followers, not as a place of more Safety, for then they had fled Northwards to <hi>Scotland,</hi> because this was supposed to be their Original and Capital Seat, and so either out of Superstition, that, that Land which first gave footing to their Fore-fathers, would be most fortunate to them, or else, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was really best Fenced; It was looked upon as their own Patrimony, the <hi>Woods</hi> of it being so Sacred, and so inviolably preserved for the exercise of their Religious Adoration, that it yielded more shelter for them than any other Parts; Whatever the Reason was, certain it is, it hath given occasion to some to think, that these were their primitive Habitations to which they so naturally had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                  <p>What is said of the Southern <hi>Druids,</hi> and their Retirement into <hi>Anglesey,</hi> the same may be said of the Northern, into the <hi>Isle of Man.</hi> A President was kept there, to whom once every year they repaired from those parts to take Counsel for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs, and after They of <hi>Anglesey</hi> were expulsed that Island, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders fled hither as to their last Refuge, and here remained, until <hi>King Cratilinth, An. Dom.</hi> 277, with great difficulty drave them out.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:58825:49"/>
                  <p>Moreover, about those Parts they have this Tradition, <hi>Mon mam Cumri,</hi> Man <hi>is the Mother of the</hi> Cumri.</p>
                  <p>Now the more Northern <hi>Britains</hi> are supposed, Anciently, to be called, <hi>CUMERO,</hi> I mean, those <hi>Britains</hi> that lived in the Inland parts of <hi>Britain,</hi> and not the <hi>Gaulish-Britains;</hi> Sure I am this has given some Reasons to think, that the first <hi>Britains</hi> came out of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> auciently called <hi>Mona,</hi> and if they be of a <hi>Greek</hi> Stock, that the <hi>Graecians</hi> first Landed here; likewise there are who have thought, that these two Islands are the same which Anciently were celebrated by the Poets under the Name of the <hi>Fortunate Island,</hi> and the <hi>ELYSIAN Fields.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Isacius Tzetzes,</hi> a Greek Author, in his Notes on <hi>Lycophron,</hi> reports, <hi>they were</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isacius Tzer. <hi>in</hi> Lycoph.</note> 
                     <hi>among the</hi> Britains; and <hi>Homer,</hi> by one is brought in to say, <hi>they were on the Coasts of Britain,</hi> and here I will put down the following chief Reasons, and so leave it to the Reader to judge.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fortunate Islands</hi> lay in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, and so do these with the rest of the <hi>British</hi> Islands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fortunate Islands</hi> were Two, so are these, the lesser and bigger <hi>MONA,</hi> one the nearer, the other the farther off.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Fortunate Islands</hi> were a Type of the <hi>ELYSIAN Fields,</hi> and are so called promiscuously, sometimes by one name, sometimes by another. They were said to be Places of <hi>Ease, Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> from all Labours, to all who lived <hi>Vertuously</hi> and <hi>Regularly,</hi> as that the <hi>Conversation</hi> of just and upright Persons was the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Happiness.</p>
                  <p>The strict Life of the <hi>Druids</hi> might therefore render these Two Islands more valuable than others upon all the accounts aforesaid, as they were sequestred from the <hi>Cares</hi> of the World, Men of <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Conversation. Here was their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Meetings, here they taught and discoursed of nothing but <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> Their Solemn Assemblies were all concerning the Principles of <hi>Divinity, Morality,</hi> the <hi>immortality of the Soul,</hi> and the <hi>World to come;</hi> so that this <hi>Conversation</hi> might well be esteemed for its Retiredness and Gravity, to come nighest those <hi>Idaea's</hi> that the Philosophers and Poets, lovers of <hi>Vertue,</hi> had of the Rewards of another World.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Druids</hi> had that Authority, that they were made Judges of <hi>Controversies</hi> both in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> to which esteem they could never have arrived, unless they had been strict Enquirers and Searchers into the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> of those they had admitted into their Order.</p>
                  <p>Because these Two Islands were the Fountains from which proceeded all their Streams, no doubt but the greatest care was taken, that they should be preserved pure and untainted, and this strict enquiry, and severe examination of Souls, is supposed to be made by Judges, before their admission into the <hi>Elysian Fields,</hi> as the Ancient Poets witnes.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Retiredness,</hi> which is so much spoken of by the Poets and Philosophers of the <hi>Elysian Fields,</hi> is intimated in the very Names of these Islands, they being called MONA, as has been said before, from which Greek word the <hi>Monastick Life</hi> had its <note place="margin">Mirae</note> denomination.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Elysian Fields,</hi> or <hi>Fortunate Islands,</hi> were said to be full of <hi>Shades; Anglesey</hi> was called <hi>Ynis Dowil,</hi> a <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>Shady Island,</hi> because the <hi>Druids</hi> planted here many <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Groves,</hi> as necessary for the exercise of their superstitious <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Poets Anciently accounted the <hi>North</hi> their Right hand, and the <hi>South</hi> their Lest; from their way of looking to the West towards the <hi>Elysian Fields</hi> and <hi>Fortunate Islands,</hi> and, in the Judgment of the best Authors, were seated on the <hi>Western</hi> Coasts of <hi>Britain.</hi>

                     <hi>he was obliged to take the Sea, where, not being secure, nor permitted safely to Land upon the</hi> Spanish <hi>or</hi> African <hi>Coasts, being then in the</hi> Mediterranean <hi>Sea, he passed the</hi> Streights, <hi>and turning on the Right hand of the</hi> Spanish <hi>shoar, he met divers Saylors from the</hi> Fortunate Islands, <hi>seated 10000 furlongs from the Coast of</hi> Africk, <hi>to which Islands he intended to go, had not the</hi> Cilician <hi>Privateers (who understood his design) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken him.</hi> Thus <hi>Plutarch.</hi>

                  <p>The Islands <hi>MONAE</hi> are about the same distance, and the Ships coming from them, arriving from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coast, seems to make it more probable that they were Islands Northward on the <hi>British</hi> Coast, than those which go under the name of <hi>Fortunate Islands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if there be any likelyhood of truth in these Conjectures, certainly the Plantation of the <hi>Greeks</hi> here is very Ancient, and must of necessity be long before those times Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> assigns for the first discovery of these Islands by them; and so consequently <hi>Brith</hi> could not give name to them; For many hundred years before <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> daies, or before ever <hi>Philaeas Taurominites</hi> had been in <hi>Britain,</hi> the name of the <hi>ELYSIAN Fields,</hi> and <hi>Fortunate Islands,</hi> was sung by all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> reports out of <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Avesbury,</hi> That when Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the <note place="margin">Cambden <hi>cut of</hi> Rob. <hi>of</hi> Avesbury.</note> sixth had given the <hi>Fortunate Islands</hi> to <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> he made great preparations in mustering Men in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in order to the taking possession of them, that the <hi>English</hi> verily believed that all those Levies were made against them, and our <hi>Leigier</hi> Embassadors at <hi>Rome, Prudent Personages,</hi> as he calls them, were so strongly possest with this Opinion, that they withdrew from <hi>Rome,</hi> and hastned for <hi>England,</hi> to give warning of it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> after most of the former Conjectures, thinks, there are no Two such Islands, so probable as the <hi>Monae</hi> are to be the <hi>FORTUNATE</hi> ones, seeing <note place="margin">Milton's <hi>Hist of</hi> England.</note> undoubtedly they were in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea, and upon the <hi>British</hi> Coasts, as they were strongly reported to be in Ancient time.</p>
                  <p>But leaving these Conjectures, I come now to shew, what <hi>Foot-steps</hi> remain of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and certain <hi>Evidences</hi> of their being once very conversant in these Islands. And I shall begin first with their <hi>Language,</hi> and afterwards with their <hi>Customes, Manners, Habits,</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> which were continued even to <hi>JULIUS CAESAR's</hi> daies, and are not as yet utterly rooted out from among them.</p>
                  <p>And here it is to be observed, as touching the <hi>British</hi> Language, that above all Nations in the World they have been curious in preserving of it entire, without mixture, and carefully and studiously avoided the entertainment of any strang and forreign Words into it, as may be seen in <hi>Merlyn</hi> and <hi>Thaliassen,</hi> two of their <note place="margin">Merlyn, <hi>and</hi> Thaliassen.</note> Poets, who although writ so long ago, yet setting aside some sinall variations, is the very same Language spoken by them at this day, not only by the <hi>Britains</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but of <hi>Armorica</hi> also in <hi>France,</hi> a thing much to be wondered at, did we not consider the exact Orthography they preserved, so that if you take half a dozen Scribes, and dictate to them a sentence of their Language, they will all agree in the same way of writing, which exactness is not observed in Our, or any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but that there will be as many waies of writing, as there are men appointed for that purpose. This Observation was made by Sr. <hi>John Price,</hi> who made an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment <note place="margin">Sr. John. Price;</note> of it.</p>
                  <p>Now, this exact <hi>Orthography,</hi> and the natural care that through all Ages they had of preserving their Language, has been the cause that the Old Language of the <hi>Britains</hi> (setting aside what Words crept in by force from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> who conquered them) has been preserved so entire as it is.</p>
                  <p>The Foot-steps of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language is evidently seen not only in particular <hi>British</hi> Words, which agree in sound and sence, but in the very nature and Idiom of the two Languages.</p>
                  <p>Some are of Opinion, that the Greek Characters were used in <hi>Britain,</hi> and that <note place="margin">Joh. Price; Defen. <hi>Hist,</hi> Brit. c. 1.</note> they were changed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest, who alwaies were very careful to obtrude their Language upon them whom they overcame, as a certain sign of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them, and a surer Union with such Provinces; And this I am apt to credit, because <hi>Caesar,</hi> after the Conquest of the <hi>Helvetii</hi> (as I said before) found their Publick Records written in Greek Characters.</p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> had but Two and twenty Letters, no more had the <hi>Britains,</hi> and as afterwards the <hi>Greeks,</hi> for conveniency, did receive two more into their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, so have the <hi>Britains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:58825:50"/>
                  <p>Moreover, it is to be observed, that the <hi>British</hi> Letters agree exactly in sound with the <hi>Greek,</hi> as is most remarkable in <hi>c</hi> and <hi>g</hi> (not to instance in <hi>d</hi> and <hi>u</hi>) which <hi>c</hi> and <hi>g</hi> are alwaies pronounced by the <hi>Britains,</hi> as, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and not as now they are before <hi>i</hi> and <hi>e,</hi> where <hi>c</hi> is pronounced like an <hi>s,</hi> and <hi>g</hi> like an <hi>j</hi> Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Vowels,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> had Anciently six, now they have added a seventh, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>w,</hi> but this relishes of the <hi>Teutonick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Consonants,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> are divided into <hi>semivocales</hi> and <hi>mutas,</hi> and these again into <hi>tenues medias</hi> and <hi>aspiratas,</hi> which, in the flexion of Nouns and Verbs, pass one into another exactly after the Greek man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>R,</hi> in the beginning of words, is alwaies with an <hi>Aspirate,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongae, out of which Observations in the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Language, I would note these things.
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Druids</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> by the number of Letters having only twenty two, as may rationally be supposed, after the manner of the Ancienter <hi>Greeks,</hi> came into <hi>Britain</hi> very early, when the <hi>Greeks</hi> had not as yet learnt the use of their other Letters, or if they had, notwithstanding they were not frequently known among them.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Druids,</hi> using the same Characters which were common in <hi>Greece,</hi> in the time of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> it appears, that neither were they of so Ancient a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Island and <hi>Gaul,</hi> as the first and primitive Times of <hi>Greece,</hi> when the <hi>Greeks</hi> learnt their Letters from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and without doubt something nigh their Character.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, <hi>Pliny</hi> observes, out of an Ancient Inscription in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, that formerly the <hi>Graecians</hi> had very nigh the same Characters with the <hi>Latins;</hi> If I be <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plin.</hi> Nat. hist.</note> not mistaken, did write an <hi>H</hi> instead of their <hi>Aspiration,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Phoenician,</hi> and if the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> did not themselves bring the use of Letters, and the number of them into <hi>Britain,</hi> but contented themselves with Trading only hither, yet I am sure the <hi>Graecians</hi> had not only the first number of their Letters from them, but Characters also, and as may be very rationally conjectured, might bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Island, after they had new modelled them, and before they had added any new ones to them.</p>
                  <p>The true attaining to the just Circumstances of Time, as to the Navigations of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Graecians,</hi> makes much to the stating of the Antiquities of <hi>Britain.</hi> But care must be had, that as we bring not the <hi>Greeks</hi> too early into these Islands, as by the more Modern Characters they used do appear, so we must not assign the time, too late, of their discovering them, which their long setled Customes in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> the great esteem they had gained with the Islanders, the very Idiom of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language introduced, and their Religious Ceremonies and Rites, though never so cruel, allowed and approved by the whole State, argues them of a very Ancient standing in these Parts, and that not suddenly, but by long use, and against much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, they were at last admitted and entertained.</p>
                  <p>Seeing we have here spoken of the Concordance of the <hi>British</hi> Tongue with the <hi>Greek</hi> Idiom; it will not be much out of the way, if we take notice, that as the number of their Letters agree exactly with the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> though we will not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to have received them immediately from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> but the <hi>Graecians,</hi> so there are a world of Words in the <hi>British</hi> Language (as partly has been shewn upon another occasion) which agree exactly with the <hi>Syrian</hi> or <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue; For, I verily believe, that the extream number of <hi>Aspirations,</hi> and guttural pronunciations, were peculiar to no Western Nation, but only the <hi>Britains</hi> of <hi>Armorica,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> (which may well be supposed to be peopled out of <hi>Britain,</hi> or else to have been Traded unto by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> themselves) is an evident sign of the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> once conversing in these Islands; For it is to be observed that the Eastern Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and that they as well as the <hi>Greeks,</hi> contributed much to the making up of that Language which was used here in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, and since, the mixture of the <hi>Saxon, Roman,</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Tongues, only excepted.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:58825:50"/>
                  <p>But to return to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> besides the peculiar conformity of Idiom, which the <hi>Britains</hi> have of their Language in general with the <hi>Graecians,</hi> it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that the <hi>Numerals</hi> of both Nations are most the same, where sometimes our <hi>Britains,</hi> sometimes they of <hi>Gaul,</hi> have the greatest resemblance. As for Example, I will set down in order.

                  <p>Most of these may easily be supposed to come from the <hi>Greek;</hi> if we consider how variously that Language alters the Letters of Forreign words it receives. And if any think that some of these may better be referred to the <hi>Romans</hi> than <hi>Graecians,</hi> as <hi>Un, Daw, Tri, Cant</hi> and <hi>Mil,</hi> I shall answer them in Mr. <hi>Sheringhams</hi> words, <hi>That</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sheringham, <hi>De</hi> Angl. <hi>Orig.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>besides these so like the</hi> Greek <hi>Numerals, the</hi> Britains <hi>have no other to express themselves by. But if these words were lately introduced, it behoved that the Old Terms should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in their Writings, as the Old</hi> Saxon <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>words, though out of use, remain still in the Writings of the Ancients;</hi> But I fear, by his words <hi>lately introduced,</hi> he supposes the objection made, as if they were brought in later than <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, perhaps by the Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> otherwise it is not improbable but they had some of these from the <hi>Romans,</hi> although there be no mention of any Ancienter words of the same sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification in their Old Poets, because they have no Writings of such Antiquity, and <hi>Numerals</hi> are (of all other words) used according to the acceptation of the present time. But the greatest Argument, in my opinion, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had not any of them from the <hi>Romans,</hi> is, because that the <hi>Armorican</hi> Britains in <hi>Gaul,</hi> who fled over (not long after the coming of the <hi>Romans</hi>) into this Island, cannot be supposed (in so short a time) to change so considerable a part of their Language, do notwithstanding keep the same <hi>Numerals</hi> as our Britains of <hi>Wales</hi> do, setting aside some small variation,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58825:51"/>
as <hi>Dow</hi> for <hi>Daw,</hi> which is rather to be attributed to a difference in Dialect, than that they had them from the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, besides the names of <hi>Numbers,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> have in their Language a whole Lexicon of Words, whose Original is undoubtedly <hi>Greek,</hi> I will put down some Examples out of Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> which he collected, most of which, as he writeth, hath no synonimous words to express them.

                  <p>And thus <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> but let these few Examples suffice to shew the Agreement of the <hi>British</hi> Language with the <hi>Greek,</hi> which could proceed from no other cause than some Plantation of <hi>Greeks</hi> in this Island.</p>
                  <p>If any object, that in the <hi>Saxons</hi> Language, there are many Words likewise which may be referred to the same Original (as appears in Mr. <hi>Cambden's Remains</hi>) let them consider first, that their Number is not so great, also that the Idioms of the two <note place="margin">Camb. Rem;</note> Languages are very different, which is not so with the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> as is visibly seen in their Flexion of words and Aspirations, by which Letters they are easily resolvable into others of the same kind.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, It is to be supposed that the <hi>Germans</hi> bordering upon the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and alwaies infesting and incroaching upon them, even unto <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, when scarcely they could be quieted, might either take some <hi>Druids</hi> in War, or else entertain them in times of Peace, to learn those <hi>Religions</hi> and <hi>Rites</hi> for which they were in much esteem among their Enemies.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:58825:52"/>
                  <p>And, that which induces me to believe this, is, because the <hi>Saxons,</hi> a People of <hi>Germany,</hi> in their Tongue, as <hi>Alfricus</hi> writes, called a <hi>Wise man</hi> or <hi>Diviner</hi>

                     </note> which carries with it the very Name and Profession of the <hi>Druids,</hi> they being very much given to the Art of <hi>Magick,</hi> of which, the <hi>fore-telling</hi> of things to come, was alwaies an inseparable Companion.</p>
                  <p>Besides the Names of things common to all Nations, as, <hi>Fire, Air, Earth, Water, Hills, Rivers</hi> and <hi>Vallies,</hi> the use of which is understood by all Nations, and so cannot be supposed to want Appellations in any; There are other words which depend upon skill, either in <hi>Physick, Astronomy, Geometry, Agriculture, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, Habits, Wars, Customes</hi> and <hi>Religions, &amp;c.</hi> which cannot be supposed in any Nation before the use of the thing it self, and that particular Science be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; Where we see two or more Nations agreeing in these Circumstances, we may rationally think, that the more Learned Nations did not only communicate the things themselves, but the Names also with them, as we see, to this day, the Inventions of Arts and Sciences, to the great honour of Industrious people, preserved entire in the Language of the first Inventors.</p>
                  <p>In regard, to treat of this Subject fully would be endless, we will confine our selves to some particular Words that Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> has brought, to prove the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> one and the same Nation, and will shew, that, in all probability, those very words were introduced by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as we have shewn in others by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and that in all likelyhood, the things themselves as well as Names were brought in by them, and therefore the promiscuous use of them in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> argues no more the Nations to have the same Original, than the word <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> or <hi>Geography,</hi> used by both, will prove them <hi>Graecians,</hi> or the word <hi>Admiral, Turks</hi> or <hi>Saracens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first I shall instance is <hi>Thireos,</hi> which he collects out of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> by <note place="margin">Cambden <hi>cut of</hi> Pausanias.</note> which word the <hi>Gauls</hi> call their <hi>Country Shields,</hi> and the <hi>Britains</hi> to this day <hi>Carian,</hi> but I pass over the similitude of these two words, which I doubt not but some will count very little.</p>
                  <p>Let us consider <hi>Thireos</hi> without the Termination <hi>Pausanias</hi> puts upon it, and we shall find it to have a far greater relation to <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a <hi>Breast-plate</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and if some shall say that <hi>Thireos</hi> signifies not a <hi>Breast-plate</hi> but a <hi>Shield,</hi> let him consider that in the nature of a defence they are the same, and although the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Breast-plate,</hi> might be brought in by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> accompanying themselves in Skirmishing and sudden On-sets, rather than to set or fixt Battles, that which was fastned to their Breasts they thought more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to wear loose before, than in the nature of a Shield, from the weight of which they could easier disengage themselves upon any sudden occasion of retreat, and served better, or at least as well, to desend their Bodies; And this I think is the true Original of their <hi>Thireos,</hi> the shape and make of which was, without any doubt, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from their Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>As for the word <hi>Carian,</hi> by which the <hi>Britains</hi> in our Island and <hi>Armorica</hi> called their <hi>Shields,</hi> I think it may have more relation to <hi>Caran, Thunder,</hi> by reason of the <hi>flames</hi> on all sides painted on their Shields, issuing out like Lightning from Thunder, or else from a God much of that name, who with their <hi>Shields</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served them in War, and affrighted their Enemies; For the <hi>Britains</hi> had on their Shields a terrible visage painted like a <hi>Gorgon,</hi> to amaze their Enemies, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the horrid manner of those Times, represented their Deities, may very easily be supposed some Tutelar God, under whose protection they thought themselves se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in the day of Battle; Others there be that derive it from <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The <hi>Galathians,</hi> who spake the same language with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> had a little Shrub which they called <hi>Coceus,</hi> by which they dyed <hi>Scarlet,</hi> and the <hi>Britains</hi> called this Colour <hi>Coch;</hi> Now as I believe the use of Dying, so this colour also of highest estimation among the <hi>Greeks</hi> was brought by them into these Parts, for it is manifest

                     </gap>; It is very easie to imagine, that when the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> found the use of this Herb, they might give it the name of <hi>Coch,</hi> from the tincture it produced.</p>

                  <p>All which things put together, as they argue the <hi>Greek</hi> to have brought many words both to the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Gaulish</hi> Language, so if we shall add these words with those that have been already shewn to be <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> we shall find no ground to judge, that the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> were the same people, seeing that most of the words brought in by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> to prove them so, relate to publick <hi>Customes, Magistrates, Honours, Manners of War, Gods, Arms, Arts, Priests, Habits, Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, Measures, &amp;c.</hi> the use of all which, as is manifest they did, so might they receive the very names of them from some third Nation, and that they had them so, some from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> others from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as has been apparently shewn.</p>

                     <hi>Suivians,</hi> but in Language came nearer to the <hi>Britains.</hi> Now seeing there were People in <hi>Gaul</hi> that differed from them both in <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Habits,</hi> in the first of which they agreed with the <hi>Britains,</hi> in the latter with the <hi>Suivians,</hi> a People in <hi>Germany,</hi> I am apt to believe, that these <hi>Estii</hi> had something of <hi>German</hi> Original by their <hi>Habits,</hi> and therefore that their agreeing with the <hi>Britains</hi> in Language, that is (as I judge) both differ from the pure <hi>German</hi> or pure <hi>Gaulish,</hi> argues the <hi>British</hi> to be somewhat of a <hi>German</hi> Race, although mixed with their Neighbours the <hi>Gauls.</hi> That they have something of them it plainly appears, if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider there were two sorts of People in this Island, the <hi>Maritime</hi> and <hi>Inland,</hi> the latter of which did pretend to be <hi>Aborigines,</hi> which they never would have had the confidence to have done, had they been of the same Language with the Maritime Gaulish <hi>Britains,</hi> or the <hi>Gauls</hi> themselves.</p>
                  <p>Besides, in comparing the Old <hi>Gaulish</hi> Language and the <hi>British,</hi> we shall alwaies find the <hi>British</hi> to have something more of the <hi>Teutonick,</hi> even in those very words they received from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and others. This cannot spring from the <hi>Saxons</hi> conquering them, since the <hi>Armorican</hi> Britains, who were long before in <hi>Gaul,</hi> ere the <hi>Saxons</hi> were called to the <hi>Britains</hi> to assist them, retain the very same <hi>Teutonick</hi> Dialect.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> to avoid the words of <hi>Tacitus</hi> concerning the <hi>Estii,</hi> a People of <hi>Gaul,</hi> who agreed with the Britains in <hi>Language,</hi> and the Germans in <hi>Habit</hi> (because this implies the <hi>Britains</hi> to differ from the <hi>Gauls</hi> in Language, seeing that the <hi>Estii,</hi> a People of <hi>Gaul,</hi> spake not the same Language as the <hi>Gauls,</hi> but seem'd of a <hi>German</hi> Race, and so speak like the <hi>Britains</hi>) saies, That the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> most remote in some parts agree.

found many <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> words in the <hi>Taurica Chersonesus.</hi> By this Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> implies, as if it were absurd to think they of <hi>Taurica Chersonesus,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> have any relation one with another. But of this we shall have more occasion to Treat in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Original, wherein shall be proved they are of the same Original, both by their Idiom, way of Numbring, and several particular words that agree with the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and so must refer it to its proper place; so that if according to Mr. <hi>Cambdens</hi> own words, <hi>Languages most remote in some points agree, it is no wonder if the</hi> British <hi>and</hi> Gaulish <hi>have some similitude;</hi> If we take away the words which were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> either by the <hi>Phoentcians</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> or last of all by the <hi>Romans,</hi> possibly no two Languages may be judged more remote than theirs was, and then Mr. <hi>Cambdens</hi> large Catalogue of Words will be reduced to a small number indeed.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> resenting this noble and generous Action of their King so highly, they thought no Man in the Commonwealth, nay not his own Son, worthy to succeed him as King, resolving that as he had proved himself to be the best of Kings, so they, in honour to his Memory, would make him the last, intimating that all <hi>Royal Qualifications</hi> departed with him, therefore laying aside <hi>Monarchy</hi> they constituted <hi>Princes</hi> for term of life, differing from Kings only in this, That the one claimed by the right of <hi>Succession,</hi> the other by <hi>Election</hi> and favour of the People.</p>

                  <p>This Pretence gained him such credit and esteem among the Common People, that when he complained in a Publick Assembly, That his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Country had raised him up such implacable Enemies, that he could not pass the Streets without danger of his life, shewing at that instance some <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Cuts,</hi> which he said, he had lately received for their sakes, though really he gave himself those Wounds on purpose to promote his Interest, they voluntarily and unanimously, it being unknown to them, allowed him a Guard for defence of his Person, with which Ingratitude to the People he seized on their State-House, taking upon him the Government of <hi>Athens,</hi> from which he was soon after expelled, and beaten, partly by the dis-inclinations and ill resentment the People bore towards <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and partly by the sudden friendship and union of the two other Factions.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius</hi> lived only long enough to give the first blow and onset on the <hi>Gracians,</hi> dying not long after the defeat he received at the Battle of <hi>Marathon,</hi> leaving his Son <hi>Xerxes</hi> Heir both to the Empire and this War; he was so earnest and intent on the prosecution of it that he would hear none of his Counsellours, nay, he hated all those that laid before him the Inconveniences he might probably meet with in that War, as his Father had done to his great dishonour; But on the contrary, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the disaster at <hi>Marathon,</hi> proceeded meerly from the sinall number his Father had levied for that Battle, he gave order for the raising such vast numbers, both for Sea and Land, that the very noise of his Preparations might save his Army the labour of reducing them by their Swords, under his obedience. Their great Forces, by the Wiser sort, were lookt upon more for ostentation, yea impediment, than use, for the <hi>Greeks</hi> from thence perceived his fear and folly under his painted Vizard, and ever after esteemed their own Valour as very considerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Xerxes</hi> commanded, that a Bridge should presently be framed on six hundred threescore and fourteen Gallies, lincked together, for the transporation of his Army over the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> putting to death the chief Workmen that built the other, which a little before was torn asunder, and separated by a Tempest; in the space of seven daies and seven nights his Army, which consisted of Seventeen hundred thousand Foot, and Fourscore thousand Horse, past over into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Xerxes</hi> being seated on a convenient place, where he might take a general view and survey of all his Forces, began to think on the many miseries and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by their Obstinacy, were in a short time likely to come to, yet not without some reflexions on his own Happiness, who was absolute Commander of so great an Army, compounded of so many different Countries; but those thoughts soon passed over, and gave place to others of a quite different Complexion, when he found how briskly his whole Army was entertained by an inconsiderable number of <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and a few of their Confederates, who two daies together defended the Streights at <hi>Thermopylae</hi> against the whole Army; a narrow passage lying between the Mountains which divide <hi>Thessaly</hi> from <hi>Greece,</hi> and might have done longer, to the Infinite disadvantage of the <hi>Persian,</hi> had not a <hi>Graecian</hi> Renegado taught them a secret way of ascending those Mountains, by which the distressed <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and their Confederates that stayed with them, miserably encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed; yet they so resolutely maintained their Post that they had undertaken, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shewing any kind of fear or desire of flight, that though the <hi>Persian</hi> came off Conquerour, yet the glory and honour of this Battle ever was attributed to the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> and <hi>Xerxes</hi> himself raised such a conclusion from the success he had in this Fight, that he ever after seemed to mistrust the strength of his Forces and goodness of his Fortune, especially when he heard that <hi>Greece</hi> had more Men of the same temper and Courage.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Athenians,</hi> against whom this War was chiefly intended (for that they with the <hi>Ionians,</hi> late Rebels to the Emperour of <hi>Persia,</hi> had taken part with them against that Crown, and been equally instrumental in the sacking of <hi>Sardis,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Lydia</hi>) abandoned their Country to the fury and malice of their Enemy, their Wives and Children they secured in <hi>Troezene, AEgina,</hi> and <hi>Salamis.</hi> The Common Treasury, and a great part of their private Wealth was laid out in building a Navy, which afterwards was the Reason they became the most famous and strongest part of <hi>Greece,</hi> from whom the <hi>Persian</hi> received the greatest overthrow; for being better Sea-men, and having more Shipping than all <hi>Greece</hi> could shew, besides not only by <hi>Themistocles,</hi> encouraged by a Stratagem of his, forced the rest of the <hi>Graecians</hi> to venture one brush at Sea with this invincible Armada; For the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a <hi>Persian</hi> Army was sent to invade their Country, were resolved to leave the Common good of <hi>Greece,</hi> and to defend, with the best of their blood, their private interest at home.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Themistocles</hi> knowing the ill consequence, this their separation might prove to all <hi>Greece,</hi> sent privately to the <hi>Persian,</hi> under colour of Friendship, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing him of the flight, and consequently of the fear of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> telling him
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58825:55"/>
withal, that if he sent part of his Navy about the Island <hi>Salamis,</hi> where the <hi>Graecian</hi> Fleet lay, they might be circumvented, as formerly were the Forces under <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> at the Streights of <hi>Thermopilae.</hi> The <hi>Persian</hi> took all the advantage they could of this Information, for in the Morning the <hi>Greeks</hi> found themselves encompassed, and obliged to fight, if they respected their own safety, and the delivery of their Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Themistocles,</hi> whose contrivance this was, well knew the advantage a small Fleet had over a vast and numerous Navy in narrow Seas, therefore animating the rest of the <hi>Greeks</hi> by his own personal Valour, he gave the <hi>Persian</hi> a very memorable and signal Overthrow, which proceeded partly from the good conduct of so excellent an Admiral; From the fright and confusion of those vast numbers, <hi>Xerxes</hi> was so timerous and heartless after it, that being cunningly forewarned by <hi>Themistocles</hi> of the intent the <hi>Greeks</hi> had in breaking down the Bridge, if he did not secure himself by sudden flight, made such hast out of <hi>Greece,</hi> that he is said to have escaped in a small Vessel obscurely, respecting neither Ceremony nor Honour, although he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attended with such a numerous Retinue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mardonius</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> General staid behind, with Three hundred thousand under his Command, who had flatteringly undertook and promised <hi>Xerxes,</hi> either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Greece</hi> under his obedience, or at least put a stop to the <hi>Precipice</hi> of his too hasty declining Fortune; But he and his Army were utterly cut off, by the united Forces of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>In the Evening of the same day, the rest of the <hi>Persian</hi> Forces which lay at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cale,</hi> a Promontory of <hi>Asia,</hi> was totally disabled and broken by the Conduct of <hi>Leutychides</hi> the <hi>Spartan,</hi> with <hi>Xantippus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> Admirals of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Navy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Xerxes,</hi> after this, being altogether incapable of making an offensive War upon <hi>Greece,</hi> gave the <hi>Athenians</hi> leisure enough of re-building their City, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setling their frighted and dispersed Families; They also, the better to secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the future, fortified and encompast their City with a strong Wall, contrary to the advice of the State of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who were grown already too jealous and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of their rising Greatness; However, they wisely dissembled their dislike till their Affairs were in a better posture.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus managed at home, the <hi>Athenians</hi> were resolved to carry the War into the Emperours Dominions, to receive some satisfaction for the loss they had so long sustained by those vast multitudes of <hi>Barbarians</hi> in their own. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of which, the <hi>Athenians</hi> set forth thirty Gallies, strengthened with twenty others from <hi>Sparta,</hi> and some of the Cities Confederate, who came in to their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, with which they took several considerable places in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> After this, they embarked and set sayl for <hi>Thrace,</hi> where they stormed and took <hi>Byzantium,</hi> now <hi>Constantinople;</hi> The <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> whether wearied with these continual Sea-fights, or somewhat discontented that the best of their Actions were eclipsed by those of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> as being more expert in Maritim affairs, soon after recalled home their Forces, leaving the prosecution of the War to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> the rest of <hi>Greece</hi> also, except <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> committing the management of their Affairs solely to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and disposal of that People.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> glad that they were thus peaceably left Lords of the Sea, and without any Copartners in the profit and glory they expected, dispatched <note n="†" place="margin">Cimon <hi>their Admiral.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Cimon,</hi> Son of the brave <hi>Miltiades,</hi> with a considerable number of Gallies, well Mann'd, to set upon the <hi>Persian</hi> Fleet, then riding in the River <hi>Eurymedon</hi> in <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> which he soon overcame, taking some, and sinking others; he overthrew also their Land Forces, encamped on the Shoar, and on the same day (happily meeting with a Fleet of <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> coining to the aid of the <hi>Persians</hi>) he seized upon their Navy, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken by the Owners almost before he could put himself into a posture of Battle, or, as King <hi>Edward</hi> said of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth of <hi>France,</hi> concerning the Dutchy of <hi>Guien, Took it without ever putting on his Armour.</hi> The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> at the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Cimons</hi> making up to them ran their Vessels on shoar, escaping, as many as could, this victorious Enemy by Land.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> being thus quite disabled at Sea, and the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> worsted and defeated in every Battle, the confederate Cities also, out of a strange Largness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding

rather to pay in what mony the <hi>Athenians</hi> allotted them, to find Ships and serve in them, themselves, against their common Enemy the <hi>Persian.</hi> It must be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therefore to any mans Reason, from all these Accidents concurring together, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> must needs prove the expertest and ablest Sea-Men, and exceed any Nation at that time in the number of Shipping, it being made out that most of their strength consisted in their Navy. And I hope it will not be irrational to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they traded into <hi>Britain,</hi> from these following Reasons.

                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why might not some false and cowardly Renegado <hi>Phoenician,</hi> who had formerly Traded hither, discover to them the <hi>scituation</hi> and <hi>fertility</hi> of this Island, as well as a Renegado <hi>Greek,</hi> shew the <hi>Persian</hi> a way over a ledge of Mountains, whereby the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were encompassed, at the Streights of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> which otherwise, in all probability they had never found out; Neither could they long be well ignorant, of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> transporting their Commodities of <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> from this Island, considering the great number of their Ships roving in most Seas, so that some of them must needs meet with the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in their way homewards, whom constantly they set upon as Assistants to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> at the Invasion of their Country.</item>

                           <hi>Fourthly</hi> and lastly, They were likely to understand the <hi>goodness</hi> of this Island from the <hi>Phoceans,</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> Colony, who dreading the <hi>Persian</hi> Tyranny, set sail with their Families, never setling themselves till they landed in <hi>France,</hi> where they founded <hi>Marseilles.</hi>

                  <p>Now, that these <hi>AEolians</hi> traded into these parts, is sufficiently proved in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent discourse, and that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who had abundantly revenged their wrongs on the <hi>Persian,</hi> had intelligence from these, is probable enough from the nature of Mankind, who after their afflictions past, are inclined to let their Friends and Allies know, how happily they live in other parts, which is daily confirmed from those that come from the West <hi>Indies,</hi> extolling the Fruitfulness of the place, partly to invite others over to live with them of the same temper, and partly by such Accessions to strengthen their Colony, whereby they may enjoy it more secure.</p>
                  <p>But suppose the <hi>Athenians</hi> themselves were not acquainted with these Parts, yet the <hi>Phoceans</hi> being of their Colony, very probable were inclined to the same form of Government, and did retain in general many of their Customes, though they differed in some circumstances, wherefore it is hoped that this present account may not altogether prove ineffectual, especially to those whose education or business has not given them full opportunity, of being acquainted with the Customes of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all these several Defeats, the <hi>Athenians</hi> grew so proud and conceited with the strange notions of their own Merits, that now every private Citizen lookt upon himself able enough to be a States-man, and nothing but <hi>Democracy</hi> would please their palate, as if <hi>Themistocles</hi> had managed the War against the <hi>Persian,</hi> not so much by his own cunning, as by the direction of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Commonalty; Now they began to oppress (and insolently Lord it over) their Allies, now it is that we hear no mans Vertue, or Innocency, was sheilded strong enough against the malicious darts of an envious Tongue; The People condemned rather by reports or events, than by a just enquiry and search into the matter. This made <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> when he was commanded to return from <hi>Sicily,</hi> and answer for his life at home, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to go, as a thing very dangerous and uncertain, for being asked, <hi>Wilt thou not trust thy Country which begat thee, to be thy Judge? No, not her</hi> (said he) <hi>that brought me forth, least she not receiving the Truth, mistake the</hi> black <hi>for the</hi> white <hi>Stone.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> formerly Condemned by <hi>Black Stones,</hi> and Absolved by <hi>White.</hi>

                  <p>But these two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Pride towards their Confederates, and an over hasty Condemnation of their best Captains, in the end proved their Ruine; the one weakning their Army, the other alienating the affections of their Friends, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians,</hi> who had long lain still, but ever jealous of the aspiring Greatness of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and consequently watchful in taking all advantages of them, at last entred into the War, which was called the <hi>Peloponnesian;</hi> It was fought a long while between them with various success, but at last the <hi>Athenians,</hi> through the sudden and frequent revolt of their Allies, the banishment of the old, and neglect and inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the new Captains, were totally beaten at the Battle of <hi>AEgos Potamos,</hi> by the fortunate Conduct of <hi>Lysander,</hi> and were at last forced to submit to these Conditions; <hi>That the long Walls, leading from the Town to the Port, should be thrown down; That all the Cities subject to that State, should be set at liberty; That the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <note place="margin">

                  <p>After this <hi>Athens</hi> was Governed by thirty Tyrants, who under the notion of compiling a body of Law, and Governing the People accordingly, soon abused their Authority to the grievance of that City, which at first they had governed with great Moderation, and to the good liking of the People, but afterwards they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned any Citizens, if by them suspected, as they had formerly done the lewdest and worst, without due tryal or legal proceeding, from which Tyranny they were delivered by <hi>Thrasibulus</hi> and his Party, after which they continued free till the death of <hi>Alexander.</hi>

of which the peoples Votes were necessary, remained firm for a longer time. Before any Decree came out, the Senate sate in Consultation, to weigh and consider of the <hi>advantages</hi> and <hi>disadvantages</hi> it might bring upon the State, then the <hi>Prytanies</hi> wrote upon certain Tables, on such a day, and about such a time will be an Assembly, to Consult of these, and these Affairs.

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The Customes and Manners of the <hi>BRITAINS;</hi> Their Laws and Government.</head>
               <p>IN speaking of the <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Customes</hi> of the <hi>BRITAINS,</hi> we shall distinguish and sort them according to the several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, from which (in most likelyhood) they received them. Some <hi>Usages</hi> they had particular to themselves, of which no account can be given, but others there are (which, as they differ from those of their Neighbours) so they carry an apparent congruity with other more remote Nations, such as the <hi>Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who, upon the account of Trade, planted themselves in these Parts.</p>
               <p>As this Work was never yet undertaken by any, so I hope it will receive the more favourable Construction, seeing all that is aimed at or intended is but to lead the way, and incite others to a more exact and curious Enquiry into the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this Nation, and no: to rest upon so low a foundation as hitherto hath been laid.</p>
               <p>Although the <hi>Customes</hi> of the <hi>Britains</hi> herein mentioned, are collected out of <hi>Caesar, Tacitus, Strabo,</hi> and many other Latin and Greek Authors, whose Writings are far <note place="margin">Caesar. Tacitus. Strabo, &amp; <hi>Alii.</hi>
                  </note> inferiour in Time to the Customes themselves, yet these <hi>Customes</hi> have Originals which they themselves that wrote of them understood not, partly because Books, and the Intelligence between Nations, was not then so universal, or perhaps, because they neglected to give serious accounts of a Nation, which, in their esteem, was then justly to be accounted Barbarous.</p>
               <p>But that which more especially moves me to this undertaking, is, the hopes I have, that when this similitude of <hi>Customes</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> between the <hi>Britains</hi> and the aforesaid Nations, shall be shewn, there will be no ground to doubt but that their <hi>Commerce</hi> with these Nations was Ancient, and that, without question, the <hi>Bretanick Islands</hi> (for so, Anciently, they were all called) as they were named <hi>CAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SITERIDES</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> signifying Islands of <hi>Tynn,</hi> so did they receive their name from the Phoenician <hi>BRATANAG,</hi> signifying the same in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> or <hi>Samaritan</hi> Dialect, but of this I have more largely discoursed in another place.</p>
               <p>The most Ancient Order of People in <hi>Britain</hi> are justly esteemed the <hi>BARDI,</hi> and these were before the <hi>Druids,</hi> although in time these got the start of the other in great Esteem. They were (as <hi>Strabo</hi> writes) <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Songsters,</hi> and at this day <note place="margin">Strabo. Posidonius. Festus. Diodorus. Hesychius.</note> are called by our <hi>Britains, Bards, Posidonius</hi> and <hi>Festus</hi> writes, <hi>they sang in Recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Musick, the praises of Great Men,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus</hi> calls them, <hi>Composers of Verses</hi> only, and to that purpose must that of <hi>Hesychius</hi> be interpreted, who writes, the <hi>Bardi</hi> were <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Singers</hi> or <hi>Poets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Name of these <hi>Bardi,</hi> as likewise the <hi>Nablium</hi> and <hi>Cynira</hi> on which they played, we have proved word for word to be <hi>Phoenician.</hi> They were not <hi>Harps,</hi> but some think like to them. The <hi>Cynira</hi> had Ten strings, and was play'd on with a quill, or some such thing; the <hi>Nablium</hi> had Twelve strings, and was play'd on by the Fingers. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> (I suppose) relying on <hi>Ammianus,</hi> calls them <hi>Harps,</hi> but <hi>Diodorus</hi> saies they were Instruments only like <hi>Harps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These sort of People were (no doubt) at first of a Religious Order, and made use of in the Deifying of Great men, singing the <hi>Praises</hi> of <hi>Hero's</hi> at their <hi>Apotheosis,</hi> which in Ancient times was not only esteemed glorious for the Dead, and useful to the Living, but also a Religious and acceptable act to the Gods.</p>
               <p>This Custome was derived from the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations, first to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the <hi>Latins.</hi> The Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> had not only the whole body of their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irnity</hi> in Verse, but upon all occasions, as <hi>Marriages, Funerals, &amp;c.</hi> their Religious
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58825:58"/>
                  <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were performed in them, likewise upon occasion of some great Deliverances and notable Victories, they sang the praises of their Gods in Verse, composing <hi>Odes</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> which in solemn manner, and with musick, they rehearsed to the People.</p>
               <p>This sort, exactly as the <hi>Bardi</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, were called '<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>No</hi> Bard <hi>as yet has Sacred Marriage prais'd.</hi>
Which proves there had been <hi>Bards,</hi> or <hi>Songsters,</hi> before him, although they had not treated of that subject.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> received this manner of Composing of <hi>Songs</hi> from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Herodotus,</hi> lib. 5. cap. 48.</note> from whom also they received their Letters themselves, and from whom <hi>Homer,</hi> one of the first of necessity, must have learned that the Earth was incompassed with the Ocean, the <hi>Greeks</hi> having not as yet encompast the Western Sea.</p>
               <p>But that which makes me believe that the <hi>Britains</hi> did receive this Custome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and not from the <hi>Graecians,</hi> is, because the <hi>Britains</hi> preserve the very <hi>Phoenician</hi> name of these <hi>Singers, viz. Bardi,</hi> entirely, although the <hi>Greeks,</hi> after their Custome, translated it into '<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifying the same thing.</p>
               <p>It happened that in continuance of time, the <hi>DRUIDS</hi> got the upper hand, so that these <hi>Bardi</hi> (who formerly were the only Religious Order, and whose compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures were used in the most solemn <hi>Rites,</hi> and whose Persons, without doubt, were esteemed most honourable) degenerated, by degrees, into the nature of common Ballad-Makers, and they who formerly sang of the <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> the <hi>works of Nature,</hi> the <hi>course of Coelestial Bodies,</hi> the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>harmony of the Sphears,</hi> the <hi>Praises of the Gods,</hi> the <hi>Encomiums</hi> and <hi>Vertues of Great Men,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the divulgers of idle and empty <hi>Genealogies,</hi> in which they studied more their proper gain than the advancement of <hi>Vertue.</hi> Instead of rehearsing the past Actions of <hi>Worthy Men,</hi> which were useful to the encouragement of the People to Great <hi>Enterprises,</hi> they gave themselves up to the composing of <hi>Mystical Rhimes,</hi> stuft with Prophesies of things to come, to <hi>Charms, Spells, Incantations,</hi> the Art of <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Necromancy,</hi> insomuch they had sundry Verses to that purpose, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of wonderful power and energy.</p>
               <p>That <hi>BRITAIN</hi> was sorely infected with these <hi>Doctrius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors <note place="margin">Many <hi>Roman</hi> Authors. Sr. <hi>Joh.

               <p>The next Order of People in <hi>Britain</hi> were the <hi>DRUIDS,</hi> who did not totally abolish all the Customes and Opinions of the <hi>Bards,</hi> but retained the most useful parts of them, such as the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> to which they added the <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration</hi> of it, according to the Opinion of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> about whose time, or a little after, I believe the <hi>Greeks</hi> entred this Island. Moreover they continued the customes of rehearsing things in Verse, which they either brought out of <hi>Greece,</hi> or continued it as they found it establisht here.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That which followeth in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quod ut cum iis quadrat, quae de eorum Aureis Ornamentis, tinct is vestibus, armillis, rasis</hi> Britannorum <hi>genis, &amp; mento, at que id genus aliis à</hi> Caesare &amp; Strabone <hi>recensentur viderint quorum interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How this can agree with the description given otherwise of them, namely, of their <hi>Golden Ornaments, painted Garments, Bracelets,</hi> and the <hi>shaving</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> used, which are delivered by <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> let others judge; And indeed the business is not so intricate to be judged, for that <hi>Golden Ornaments</hi> in a Statue should be exprest, is both difficult and unnecessary, as likewise their <hi>painted Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Bracelets,</hi> not to be preserved in Stone. As for the <hi>Shaving</hi> of the <hi>Britains,</hi> we know that the chief distinction they used from other Nations, was in their <hi>Upper-lip,</hi> and if all this should fail, the <hi>Druids</hi> were Priests of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces as well as <hi>Britain,</hi> and it may easily be supposed (as we find it even in these daies) that they being <hi>Priests,</hi> and proceeding from <hi>Greece,</hi> might preserve their own Customes in so small circumstances, and not conform with the Laity in those points, whose Manners only <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> describes.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Druids</hi> committed nothing to publick Writing, both which Customes relish of the Ancient <hi>Greeks;</hi> For <hi>Pisistratus</hi> (as <hi>Agellius</hi> reports) was the first that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to common view, Books of the liberal Arts and Sciences at <hi>Athens,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Agellius.</note> way of composing altogether in Numbers, was left off in <hi>Greece</hi> a little before the daies of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> who notwithstanding entituled his Books by the names of the <hi>Muses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The way of delivering their Mistery by the secret <hi>Cabbala</hi> savours of the <hi>Jews,</hi> from whom in all probability the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> learnt the Custome, and so taught it to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but it was preserved longer in <hi>Britain</hi> than in <hi>Greece</hi> it self, so that to the daies of <hi>Caesar</hi> the Commonalty were kept in Ignorance, and none permitted to understand any thing, unless they admitted themselves of this Order, and underwent the severities of a long and tedious Discipline.</p>
               <p>Their Publick Records were preserved in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, and in <hi>Greek</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, <note place="margin">Caes. Com. lib. 1.</note> which being unintelligible by the Vulgar, none could have recourse unto but persons of Repute and Learning; They were not permitted to take any thing away in Writing, but by Memory only, and a Trust was reposed in some particular Persons, who by their singular integrity, and long experience of their Fidelity and Learning, were chosen for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Britain</hi> was divided into several Petty Governours, as to Civil Affairs, <hi>Kent</hi> alone having four distinct Kingdoms within it; The Government of the <hi>Druids</hi> was Universal over the whole Island, and some part of <hi>Gallia</hi> also, so that their Power and Interest was infinitely the greater, being subject only to two Primates, whereof one precided over the North <hi>Druids,</hi> the other over the South; the former of which is supposed to have his Residence in the Isle of <hi>Man,</hi> the other in <hi>Anglesey,</hi> although it is thought by some, there was but one in Chief, so that although the Secular Power might often clash by reason of its many decisions, as parcelled out into many Kingdoms, the Interest and Authority of the <hi>Druids</hi> was preserved
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58825:59"/>
entire by their unity under one head, to whom once a year they had recourse in publick Meetings and Assemblies. This Custome of the <hi>Druids,</hi> I am of opinion, was received from the <hi>Bardi,</hi> and delivered down from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
               <p>For in the Eastern Nations, as <hi>India, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> we find that the power of the Priest was in a nature distinct from the Civil Government, and calling of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and general Meetings was absolutely in their power, and independent of the Temporal Magistrate, which Custome nevertheless in those daies was often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged by wife and politick Princes.</p>
               <p>The Primate of these <hi>Druid</hi> Priests was constituted by Election, and being a <note place="margin">

               <p>They had <hi>Excommunications</hi> much after the manner of ours, this (as <hi>Caesar</hi> reports) <note place="margin">Caesar, <hi>Com. lib. 6.</hi>
                  </note> was the greatest Punishment that could be inflicted. A Person so interdicted could not be admitted to any Sacrifice, but was esteemed in the number of the <hi>Profani,</hi> i. e. <hi>Wicked wretches;</hi> All persons studiously avoided his Person, not daring to approach near him, or converse in Talk, although at a distance, for fear of being infected with the contagion of so dangerous a Curse. They were utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any Honourable office, and excluded from the benefit of the Law, as to their Estates.</p>
               <p>Many other waies the <hi>Druids</hi> had to punish the Contemners of their Religion, and yet had considerable Rewards for the Obedient.</p>
               <p>They were made Judges of all Controversies, both private and publick, as <hi>Murther</hi> or <hi>Man-slaughter, Theft, &amp;c.</hi> or if Suits arose about <hi>Inheritance,</hi> or Strife about the <hi>bounds of Lands,</hi> they absolutely gave Judgment, and used not to execute their Decrees by the Temporal Authority, but issued out their Excommunications upon the Non-performance of them, which, as they were of all punishments the most grievous, so were they thundered out not only upon private, but publick Persons, which <hi>publick Persons,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Caesar,</hi> no doubt, extended to their Magistrates and Governours themselves: A Custome used in Ancient daies by no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion else but the Eastern.</p>
               <p>They were the sole Interpreters of <hi>Religion,</hi> in the exercise of which their Persons were absolutely necessary to be present; they proclaimed publick Sacrifices as they saw occasion, and no private ones could be performed without them; They sacrificed <hi>Men</hi> as well as <hi>Beasts,</hi> which were for the most part Enemies, or Malefactors, but sometimes innocent Natives, by which means they were feared and reverenced by the People; The absolute power rested in their hands to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what person was fittest for that purpose, and whose Blood would be most acceptable to the Gods.</p>
               <p>Probable it might be, that this sacrificing of Natives, entered upon the small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Decrees and Excommunications, and not upon the will and pleasure of the Priest, but however it was, no doubt, it commanded such an awe upon their persons, as due Obedience was offered unto all their Commands.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Druids</hi> were exempted from the services of War, and paid no Taxes as the rest of the people did, by which Immunities many were invited, on their own free wills, to enter themselves into that Order and Discipline, and many were sent by their Friends and Relations to learn it, and although it was taught in <hi>Gaul</hi> as well as <hi>Britain,</hi> yet most perfectly in this Island, although more probably in the Isles of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Anglesey,</hi> whither, they that desired to be fully instructed, repaired, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Caesar</hi> writes, that the Order it self began in <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Druids</hi> had the <hi>Oak</hi> in great veneration, but especially the <hi>Missletoe</hi> upon <note place="margin">Plin. <hi>Nat. hist. lib. 16. cap. 4.</hi>
                  </note> it, or any thing they found growing to it; neither did they perform any Sacrifice without a branch of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Missletoe</hi> it self they gathered with many superstitious Ceremonies, and great devotion, cutting it down with a golden Bill; They chose Groves of <hi>Oak</hi> only to officiate Divine Service in, for which purpose they planted many in the Island,

from whence they received their Name, and from whence they were also called <hi>Saronides,</hi>

                  </gap> I have spoken of in another place.</p>
               <p>When they found <hi>Missletoe</hi> upon an Oak, they accounted it a sure sign the God they served had chose that Tree; and the Circumstances they observed in gathering are many.</p>
               <p>First, They principally observed that the Moon was six daies old, for on that day they began their <hi>Months,</hi> and <hi>New Years,</hi> and their several Ages had their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution every Thirtieth year; And Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> notes, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the Judgment of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> was by the <hi>Greeks</hi> included in the same measure of <note place="margin">Learned <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
                  </note> time.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Having prepared their Sacrifices and Feasts under the Tree, they brought two young Bullocks, milk white, whose Horns, then, and not before, was bound up.</p>
               <p>Then, the Priest who clymb'd the Tree, being cloathed in a white Vesture, cut it down, and they below received it in a white Souldiers Cassock, then they sacrificed and blest the Gift, by mumbling over many Orations; all which Ceremonies duly performed, it was esteemed a soveraign Antidote against all manner of Poyson, and an especial Remedy against <hi>Barrenness,</hi> both in Men, Women, and Beasts.</p>
               <p>This Institution undoubtedly sprang from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who had their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>Hamadryades;</hi> And Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> in comparing the <hi>Druids</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> with those <note place="margin">Sheringham, <hi>de Orig.</hi> Angl.</note> of <hi>Greece,</hi> takes notice that the latter Nation had only them of the Female Sex, whereas the <hi>Druids</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul</hi> were of both. And although the <hi>Druids</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> were esteemed Nymphs, and half Goddesses, yet no doubt, principally they were Maidens, who dedicated themseves and their Virginities to the Gods, and to that purpose retired into Groves and Deserts, to have freedom in their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>This seems to be another Argument, that these <hi>Druids</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi> Originally came out of <hi>Greece,</hi> in the early Ages of the World, and not so lately as some have imagined, when the names of <hi>Dryades,</hi> and <hi>Hamadryades</hi> were grown out of use in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Geropius Becanus,</hi> is certainly much mistaken in the derivation of the <hi>Druids</hi> of <note place="margin">Geropius Becanus.</note> 
                  <hi>Britain,</hi> who brings them from <hi>Trowis,</hi> signifying in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue one <hi>skilful in Truth,</hi> for, setting aside the harshness of the Etymology, the <hi>Germans</hi> had no <hi>Druids,</hi> as <hi>Caesar</hi> writes, or if they had, they were so few as not to be taken notice of, so that 'tis very absurd to bring the derivation of an Order of People from a <note place="margin">Caes. Com.</note> Nation who were altogether ignorant of such an Order.</p>
               <p>Others there are, who are guilty of the like absurdity, and derive them from <hi>Trutis,</hi> signifying, in the Old <hi>British</hi> Tongue, a <hi>God,</hi> and that they were called <hi>Truti,</hi> as much as to say <hi>Religious persons,</hi> for, as I said before, they could not receive their Names from a People that knew them not, or had only heard of them, so that they being undoubtedly <hi>Greeks,</hi> and writing in <hi>Greek</hi> Characters, in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, they were undoubtedly called <hi>Derwydden</hi> by the <hi>Britains,</hi> from <hi>Derw</hi> and <hi>Deru,</hi> both proceeding from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an <hi>Oak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Druids</hi> held an Opinion, that the life of a Man, either in a desperate Sickness, or in danger of War, could not be secured unless another suffered in his stead, so that in such cases they either offered <hi>Men</hi> in sacrifice, or else vowed so to do after their delivery.</p>
               <p>The most acceptable Sacrifice to their Gods, they esteemed <hi>Murtherers, Thieves,</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi> and also other Criminals, but for want of these Innocents often suffered. In some places this Custome was observed, which, I suppose, was common to the <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul; They made a Statue or Image of a MAN in a vast propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whose Limbs consisted of Twigs, weaved together in the nature of Basket-ware: These they fill'd with live Men, and after that, set it on fire, and so destroy'd the poor Creatures in the smoak and flames;</hi> the strangness of which Custome, I have here thought not amiss to represent to the view.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:58825:60"/>
               <figure>
                  <head>The Wicker Image</head>
               </figure>
               <p>The Ceremony observed in sacrificing of <hi>Men</hi> to their Idols, in a <hi>Wicker</hi> Image, as it was strange, so, without any question to be made, it was not begun by chance, but upon some great occasion, and something extraordinary may be sought for in the Magnitude of the Statue it self, whence it proceeded.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Heathens,</hi> in their festival Fires, which were most usually attended with the Sacrifices of <hi>Beasts,</hi> but sometimes of <hi>Men,</hi> as this was alwaies used to represent the occasion of the Solemnity, which they did by some visible sign of an apparent signification, a Custome not left off at this day, as sometimes by burning the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the person, either to his Honour, as in Deifying him, or else in publick detestation of some high and notorious Crime and Misdemeanour; sometimes they burnt Living persons themselves (even for <hi>pleasure,</hi> on their publick Feast daies) to the Honour of their Gods, and the mirth and jovialty of their Barbarous Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators. Thus <hi>Nero</hi> wrapt the Christians in <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Pitch,</hi> and made them serve as Torches to his Theater in a mock (as some write) of that saying, <hi>Ye are the Lights of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:58825:61"/>
               <p>But certain we are, that in these great festival Fires, they alwaies had something which set forth to the Eyes the occasion of the Solemnity. I cannot believe, but the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> (in making these vast Images) did represent something, which had been formerly in great detestation amongst them.</p>
               <p>Now, there is nothing that doth so easily occur to our first apprehension, as that they might do it in the Remembrance of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who were Men, as shall be shewn, of vast and exceeding stature, who for a long time had subdued and kept them under (and without doubt, if Credit may be given to the <hi>British</hi> History) they were those Giants that so long infested the Land; Wherefore in publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of that Slavery they once endured under them, this vast figure of a Man, made up in <hi>Wicker</hi> or <hi>Osyer</hi> work, might be introduced as in scorn and derision of them, having now lost their power over them, although the cause why they were first made (as it often falls out) might be forgotten, and so the Representation only remain.</p>
               <p>Many idle Tales and Fables have been reported concerning <hi>Giants,</hi> which some have advanced to that incredible Greatness, that many have had just cause to suspect, whether there were ever any that exceeded the usual stature of Men. Of this opinion is <hi>Geropius Becanus,</hi> to which also Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> seems to incline: That the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were Men of exceeding stature Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> learnedly proves, and <note place="margin">Gerop. Bec. Cambden. Sheringham, <hi>Orig.</hi> Angl. <hi>cap.</hi> 1, &amp; 4.</note> the Scripture it self testifies.</p>
               <p>I will set down some Monuments, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> which do confirm this Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lazius</hi> reports, that he was an eye witness of many Monuments (near <hi>Vienna</hi>) dug <note place="margin">Lazius.</note> out of the Earth, but almost worn out by Time, in which Monuments were the Bones of vast proportions found, and Epitaphs upon them in <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters, which the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> used without points, and out of many he collected four only; The first of which I will set down out of the Translation of <hi>Franciscus Stancharus</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> and <hi>Christopher Milander,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> by Birth and Conversation. The Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption <note place="margin">Franciscus Stancharus, Christoph. Milander.</note> was thus word for word.</p>

               <p>By this Inscription, and the others there mentioned, and the wonderful Greatness of the Bones, besides the concordance of time with the <hi>Canaanites</hi> expulsion (from their Land) by the <hi>Jews,</hi> we may gather that they were <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who planted themselves there.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Essex,</hi> in a Village called <hi>Eadulphness,</hi> the Monk of <hi>Cogshall</hi> reports, that there <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Monk of</hi> Cogshal.</note> were found two Teeth of a certain Giant of such a huge bigness, that two hundred such Teeth as men now adaies have might be cut out of them; These Teeth, he sales, he saw himself, but not without great Admiration. And a Gentleman, named <hi>R. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendish,</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> reports also, that he saw some Relicks of <note place="margin">R.

               <p>That which <hi>Geropius</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> answer to this, out of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> seems fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, That the Bones of <hi>Sea Fish</hi> have been taken for <hi>Giants</hi> Bones; Men certainly may easily distinguish between them, neither is it ever to be rationally supposed men ever entombed <hi>Fishes,</hi> as those in <hi>Germany</hi> were found to be.</p>

               <p>But that which comes nearer to our purpose, concerning the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and their Gigantick bodies, is the Tradition which has been preserved in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> a place they most resided in for the sake of their <hi>Tynn</hi> Traffick, which Tradition of the being of Giants in those Parts was preserved to the daies of <hi>Havillan</hi> the Poet, who lived four hundred years since; In some of whose Verses the <note place="margin">Havillan <hi>the Pott.</hi>

               <p>This description of them agrees exactly with the Character the <hi>British</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, all along, gives of those Giants that lived before <hi>Brutes</hi> entrance into this Island, which Histories, though by some are esteemed Fabulous, yet let any one consider, whether it be not much more probable to imagine, that there were many Truths delivered down, and so taken up and corrupted by those Writers, than to think they had no grounds to begin their Histories, or that they were so unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably given to Deceiving, as to have no other motives in the publishing their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but to put Tricks and Cheats upon the World, especially in the matter of <hi>Giants,</hi> a thing which they could not but fore-see, would (in all Ages) be hardly credited.</p>
               <p>Now, if there be any truth in the <hi>British</hi> Histories, those men of vast Proportions, called by them, GIANTS, could be none but the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> as the Time of the being of such Giants, <hi>viz.</hi> about the year MMDLX, this Island correspond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> MMDLX.</note> with the Age of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Navigation hither, doth plainly shew.</p>
               <p>I do verily believe (from their hard usage of the Islanders, whom they found at their first entrance, and whom all along they oppressed) this custome of making of <hi>Wicker</hi> Statues, and firing them upon special occasions was introduced; for we see even to these daies, the burning of Persons, in <hi>Effigle,</hi> is preserved in many civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd Nations, but the making them in <hi>Wicker</hi> rather than any other Materials, may very easily be attributed to the manner of the Boats the <hi>Britains</hi> used on their Coasts, thereby, in their own little Models, representing the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Navigation, their <hi>Wicker</hi> Vessels, becoming an Emblem of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Ships that enslaved them.</p>

Although, after the manner of those Historians, the greatness of their Stature, and the cruelty of their Natures, may be too much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, yet seeing the Trading of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> is made out from undoubted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (as from <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Historians, whose testimony, in matter of Fact, is necessary in other respects) we ought not to question but they were the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> men of Great bodies, who gave first the occasion of this Tradition, and who by their Traffick hither might bring that Thraldom on the People, the remembrance of which they preserved after the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> themselves had forsaken them.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Customes of the <hi>Britains.</hi> They used a Drink made of <hi>Barly,</hi> as <hi>Solinus</hi> witnesseth, a Custome used by us at this very day, a thing unknown in <note place="margin">Solinus.</note> former Ages in any Country of <hi>Europe, Britain</hi> only excepted; For in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they used <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> either by themselves or intermixt, even in colder Countries than <hi>Britain,</hi> which of it self is not deficient to produce <hi>Grapes,</hi> and to ripen them, so that excellent Wine, may, and is daily produced, did not the richness of the Soyl invite the Natives to more useful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>We do not find any Country that had the use of making drink of <hi>Barly,</hi> but if the Country of it self would not bear Wine, they had it brought them from hotter Countries, or else pleased themselves with Water only. Now we must seek else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for this Custome of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and we shall find that this also they might have from the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> To the proof of which, let us consider, that the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians,</hi> by their Colonies, planted themselves on all the Sea Coasts of <hi>Africk,</hi> even to <hi>Carthage</hi> and the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> that <hi>Egypt,</hi> a place of great fertility without any question, was much frequented by them.</p>
               <p>We read in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did make a sort of drink with <hi>Barly,</hi> and the invention of it was very Ancient in that Kingdom, the particulars thereof <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> he describeth.</p>
               <p>Now, why may not this Custome be thought to come from them by the means of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who found <hi>Britain</hi> very fruitful in that Grain, and not inferiour to <hi>Egypt</hi> it self in the wonderful production of it. For as <hi>Egypt</hi> was esteemed the Granary of those parts, so was <hi>Britain</hi> of these; yea, as <hi>Orpheus</hi> calls it, The very <note place="margin">Orpheus.</note> Seat of the Lady <hi>Ceres,</hi> so that the usefulness of this Invention of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (who abounded in Corn) was not less to the <hi>Britains.</hi>

               <p>This Drink which we call <hi>Ale,</hi> by the <hi>Britains,</hi> at this day, is called <hi>Kwrw,</hi> by the <hi>Gauls, Korma;</hi> so <hi>Athenaeus,</hi>

Dioscorides</hi> names it not wrong, seeing <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> agree with him; For although at this day the word be depraved into <hi>Kwrw,</hi> by our <hi>Welch Britains,</hi> yet (no doubt) Anciently and Primitively it was called <hi>Corma, Cormi,</hi> or <hi>Curmi,</hi> or else something like it; By transposing of the <hi>R</hi> and <hi>M,</hi> making <hi>Comra</hi> for <hi>Corma,</hi> we have the very <hi>Phoenician</hi> word of this Liquor, which the <hi>Britains</hi> drank instead of Wine.</p>
               <p>If any shall say, that <hi>Chomra</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue signifies Wine and not Ale, let them consider that at this day we give that name of <hi>Wine</hi> to Drinks not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of the Grape; And seeing the <hi>Britains</hi> used it instead of Wine, no doubt (as <hi>Bochartus</hi> saies) they gave it the same Appellation.</p>
               <p>Now, seeing this Custome was used only in <hi>Britain,</hi> and the parts adjacent, having <note place="margin">Bochartus:</note> plenty of that Grain, and in respect we read of no other Nation but the <hi>Egyptian</hi> that used it, since the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were frequent in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and Traded also into these Islands, and more especially since the name of this <hi>Rwrw,</hi> or <hi>Curmi,</hi> is <hi>Phoenician,</hi> we have not the least cause to doubt of the original of this Custome, but that the <hi>Britains</hi> received it from this fountain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of the <hi>Britains,</hi> that in some solemn Feasts and Sacrifices they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured <note place="margin">Plin. Nat. bist.</note> themselves like <hi>AEthiopians</hi> all over their Bodies, being naked at the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; whence could the <hi>Britains</hi> have this Custome, if not from the same Original. As in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> so in <hi>Britain</hi> (as <hi>Gildas</hi> saies) <hi>Ugly Spectres, meerly Diabolical,</hi> nay, in the number of them, <hi>Britain,</hi> as he reporteth, rather exceeded <hi>AEgypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These they placed upon their Walls, within and without, and as they cut them in the same shapes as the <hi>Britains</hi> did, so, I suppose, by the like placing them, they esteem'd them of a <hi>Talismanical</hi> nature, to expel Mischief, and to defend their Walls. Some of these Representations were remaining, in the Ruines of their Cities, to <hi>Gildas</hi> his daies, who describes them to have ugly Lineaments, with stern and grim looks, after the manner of those of <hi>AEgypt;</hi> Perhaps they might be <hi>Monkies,</hi> or <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> 
                  <hi>Baboons,</hi> Creatures much worshipt in those Countries. But of this I shall treat of more fully in the Chapter which concerns the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Britains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the same Original may be reduced the great opinion the <hi>Britains</hi> had of the Art, <hi>Magick,</hi> which by a peculiar name was called, the <hi>Learning</hi> of the <hi>AEgyptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> saies, the <hi>Britains</hi> were so wholly devoted to it, and had such entire Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, in the performance, as a man would imagine, that the <hi>Persians</hi> learnt all their <note place="margin">Pliny <hi>Nat. bist.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Magick</hi> from them; which Flourish of <hi>Pliny,</hi> I conjecture, gave occasion to <hi>Annius Viterbiensis,</hi> in his seigned <hi>Berosus,</hi> to make <hi>Magus</hi> a King of this Island, who taught <note place="margin">Annius Viter.</note> this Art, and spread it abroad in the World. Upon such slender foundations, do Confident men ground their own idle and ridiculous Inventions, and these very Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes the <hi>Britains</hi> learnt of the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> sets down a <hi>British</hi> Custome, namely, that when any Great man died, his Relations made great enquiry of his Wives (if they suspected cause) concerning <note place="margin">Selden.</note> his death; If they found them guilty, with Fire, and other Torments, they proceeded against them. Sr. <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> refers to this Original the Law of <hi>England,</hi> for burning Women that kill their Husbands, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> as <hi>Caesar</hi> reports, did not esteem it lawful to eat either <hi>Hare, Hen</hi> or <note place="margin">Caes. Com.</note> 
                  <hi>Goose,</hi> but kept them for pleasure; and their delicate Diet, as <hi>Pliny</hi> saies, were the <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Chenerotes,</hi> Fowls less than wild <hi>Geese,</hi> which some have made to be <hi>Brauts,</hi> or <hi>Soland Geese,</hi> so that <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> do (after this account) disagree in their Relation, unless we believe that the <hi>Britains</hi> had left off this Custome not long after the Arrival of the <hi>Romans</hi> into this Island. However this distinction of Meats, their making some lawful, others unlawful, some clean, and others unclean, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished something of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and was rarely observed in any but Eastern Nations, as <hi>Phoenicia, AEgypt,</hi> and <hi>Syria, &amp;c.</hi> with whom the <hi>Jews</hi> conversed. With the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> agreed in that Custome, in not eating of <hi>Fish,</hi> but seeing this is by <hi>Dio Nicaeus</hi> only reported of the Northern <hi>Britains,</hi> and that the Custome of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi> do vary according to the diversities of Ages, it cannot be expected that exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts <note place="margin">Dio Nicaeus;</note> can be given of it.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:58825:63"/>
               <p>Their usual Diet was of any sort of prey, as <hi>Venison, Fruit</hi> and <hi>Milk,</hi> but they <note place="margin">Caesar. Strabo.</note> had not learnt to make <hi>Cheese</hi> of it. They inured themselves to Hardness, so as to be able to endure any <hi>cold, hunger</hi> and <hi>labour</hi> whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dio Nicaeus</hi> reports of them, That they would stick themselves in Boggs up to the heads, and there continue many daies together without any sustenance, and upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, <note place="margin">Dio Nicaeus.</note> retiring and hiding themselves in the Woods, they fed on the Barks and Roots of Trees, as the <hi>Indians</hi> at this day are wont to do; But I cannot imagine, what Meat that should be which <hi>Dio</hi> saies they preserved on all occasions, whereof, if they eat but the quantity of a Bean, it satisfied their hunger and thirst. <hi>Dio Siculus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports <note place="margin">Diod. Sic.</note> in general, That the Food they eat was simple, not dainty, according to the luxury of rich Nations, likewise, that they howed their Corn, and brought it in by Sheaves, but never threshing out more than what served their present occasion, which is a perfect sign that they did Till their Grounds; <hi>Pliny</hi> saies, <hi>They did manure them</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Plin. <hi>Nat. hist.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>with Marle. Dio Nicaeus</hi> writes of the Northern <hi>Britains,</hi> that they Till'd no Ground; and <hi>Strabo</hi> saies, That some of them were altogether ignorant not only in <hi>Gardning</hi> and <hi>Planting</hi> of Orchards, but in all other parts of Husbandry.</p>
               <p>Thus what <hi>Dio Nicaeus</hi> saies of the Northern <hi>Britains</hi> only, and <hi>Strabo</hi> of a few of them, Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> confounds the whole Nation, making <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> to <note place="margin">Speeds <hi>Chron.</hi>
                  </note> contradict <hi>Dio Nicaeus</hi> and <hi>Strabo,</hi> whereas indeed, their Authors treat only in those places of <hi>particular People</hi> in <hi>Britain;</hi> For it is manifest that there were two sorts of the <hi>Britains,</hi> one of which was more Civiliz'd, namely, those that lived upon the Sea-Coasts, and (as <hi>Caesar</hi> saies) they of <hi>Kent</hi> exceeded all the rest.</p>
               <p>These had their sumptuous <hi>Houses, Gardens</hi> and <hi>Orchards,</hi> after the manner of the <hi>Gauls;</hi> they did not go Naked, but had their Apparel after the Custome of the same Nation, and were experienced in the most exquisite way of Manuring their Grounds with <hi>Marle.</hi> They were daintier of their Diet, having particular Dishes in great request among them, and positively, not superstitious, in the eating of <hi>Hen, Hare</hi> or <hi>Goose,</hi> as the <hi>Chenorotes,</hi> their delicate Diet, may witness.</p>
               <p>It is very probable they understood the use of <hi>Milk</hi> in all its productions, Cheese not excepted, for <hi>Strabo,</hi> when he speaks of the ignorance of the <hi>Britains</hi> in those points, speaks only of some particular places, as may be easily gathered from his own words. <hi>Some of them</hi> (saies he) <hi>for want of skill, can make no Cheese, although they have plenty of Milk.</hi> This is not to be understood of the Maritim Countries (for it is probable, that the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> who Traded into this Country (insomuch as <hi>Cythims</hi> received its name from them upon the account of the abundance of <hi>Cheeses</hi> there made) taught the <hi>Britains</hi> the use of it) which necessary Art, in a Kingdom abounding with <hi>Milk,</hi> cannot be supposed ever to be utterly lost.</p>
               <p>Another sort of People there was in this Island, whom necessity or choice made them seem more Barbarous; These had no Houses or Cities, not because they knew not the use of them, but by reason the Circumstances of their lives did not permit them to build any, living continually in War, and making daily excursions upon their Richer Neighbours, so they that had built Houses would have been daily subject to spoil; and it could not be but altogether against their design to settle themselves in any fixt Habitations, whose business was to Range about at liberty, whose livelyhood depended upon sudden Excursions, private and obscure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats.</p>
               <p>These are they of whom <hi>Strabo</hi> is to be understood, when he saies, <hi>That Woods stood them instead of Cities and Towns;</hi> For when they had, by felling of Trees, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compast <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> and fenced a spacious round plat of Ground, there they built for themselves <hi>Hutts</hi> and <hi>Cottages,</hi> and for their Cattle set up <hi>Stalls</hi> and <hi>Foulds,</hi> all for the present use, and not to stand long, just after the manner of the <hi>Cossacks</hi> in the <hi>Ukraine,</hi> who, although are daily exercised in the Sieges of great and sumptuous Cities, and know all the Arts of Building and Fortifying, yet live exactly after the manner of these <hi>Britains,</hi> retiring into these Tabors, made like the <hi>British</hi> Holds described by <hi>Caesar,</hi> senced in with Trees, and trencht about with Ditches and Rampiers, into which they draw all their Cattel and Carriages, the necessity of their condition being much the same as these <hi>Britains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being attacqued by the <hi>Polanders</hi> lately, they retired into their Bogs and Fastnesses,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58825:63"/>
just as the <hi>Britains</hi> did, living upon Barks of Trees, and enduring the same hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, so that we must not esteem a People barbarous, for those Customes, to which the necessity of their forced condition, not Ignorance, leads them unto.</p>
               <p>These were the <hi>Britains</hi> which till'd no ground, because they tarried not so long in any place as to expect a Crop; They went naked, keeping no Sheep, a Creature slow in motion, and apt to be surprized, besides subject to Beasts of Prey, as <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Foxes,</hi> which were in great number in the Wood-land Countries of this Island. They made no <hi>Cheese,</hi> as it was heavy in Carriage, but satisfied their Hunger with the prey of Venison, and natural Fruits of the Earth; It had been a piece of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in them to have made delicate Gardens, or planted curious Orchards, when they could not tarry so long as to enjoy the fruits and pleasures thereof.</p>
               <p>These Inland <hi>Britains,</hi> as they exceeded the Sea-Coast or <hi>Gaulish Britains,</hi> so I believe they were in perpetual Hostility with them, being, as may be conjectured, of a quite different Original, the Custome of these Inlanders exactly corresponding with the <hi>German</hi> Nations that <hi>Caesar</hi> describes, which Customes of the <hi>Germans</hi> I will set down in his own words, because it seems to be an exact description of these <hi>Britains,</hi> and may partly evidence the Primitive Inhabitants of this Island, not to have been of the <hi>Gauls</hi> but <hi>German</hi> Race.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Germans <hi>spend their lives in Hunting, and in the exercise of Military Affairs, from their Youth they give themselves to Labour, and to endure Hardships. They cover</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>half of their Bodies with the Hides of</hi> Rhenos, <hi>they take little or no notice of Tillage, the greatest part of their Diet is</hi> Milk, Cheese <hi>and</hi> Flesh; <hi>they have no measure or certain bounds of Lands, least by Tillage they should forget the use of Arms; they build no curious Edifices to keep out Cold or Heat, least the more powerful should drive out the weaker; they keep their People in unity by making all things Common.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This seems to be the Method the Inland <hi>Britains</hi> used, who by the very same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were induced to it, so that seeing there was two sorts of <hi>Britains</hi> in this Island, it is carefully to be heeded, least in reckoning up their Customes, we take those to be general which indeed were peculiar only to a part of them; This is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served either in <hi>Caesar, Pliny, Tacitus, Strabo, Solinus,</hi> or any other that writes of them, so that they do frequently contradict each other, and sometimes agree not with themselves.</p>
               <p>In this particular Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> is strangely confused, for in his relating the Customes of the <hi>Britains,</hi> he makes no distinction of the times of his Authors writing, but <note place="margin">Speeds <hi>Chron.</hi>
                  </note> huddles up a Rhapsody of their Manners, without the due consideration of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Circumstances the <hi>Britains</hi> were in, partly by long continuance, and partly by the Subjection they underwent by the <hi>Romans.</hi> To give one or two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; <hi>Caesar</hi> (saies he) <hi>reports, that they used to dye themselves with</hi> Woad, <hi>to make</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caesar.</note> 
                  <hi>themselves more terrible in Battle; Herodian</hi> saies, <hi>They did it out of an opinion that it was very gay and handsome;</hi> and thus he brings these two Authors clashing, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering <note place="margin">Herodian.</note> that when <hi>Caesar</hi> entred this Island, the <hi>Britains</hi> had some sort of Rayments, as is clear by his own Writings, and that a few of the Inlanders only went naked, the rest painting their <hi>bands</hi> and <hi>faces;</hi> But in <hi>Herodotus</hi> his daies, the <hi>Romans</hi> had reduced all the <hi>Britains</hi> in general, that held against them, to the same Method of living, which formerly only Inlanders used.</p>
               <p>Now, it is no wonder if they used the same hardships in going Naked, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht themselves one from another by the shapes of Beasts, curiously worked upon their skins, when they had no Rayments else to deck and adorn their Nobility; so that, that might become a badge of Honour in time, and upon such necessity of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which was first introduced for Terrour to their Enemies; The like confusion he makes in the description of their <hi>Persons,</hi> sometimes their Hair is long, sometimes short and curled; now they are cloathed, presently again they are but in part, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not at all; So they are Cruel, Barbarous, build Houses, have none at all; Tyll the Ground, and by and by understand nothing of it; have Houses, and yet live only in Woods, with a thousand other ridiculous Contradictions in themselves, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless must be granted to be all true, upon the testimony of his Authority, which indeed are true if understood aright, as distinguishing them into the diversity of their Originals, the circumstance of Time, and the different waies of Living, by the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences the Inlanders were obliged unto.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:58825:64"/>
               <p>Having premised thus much concerning the diversities of <hi>Customes</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> according to the diversity of Nations in <hi>Britain,</hi> I will treat of the Custome of <hi>Painting</hi> and <hi>Dying</hi> their Bodies, a thing so frequent and universally used among them, that Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> derives the Name of <hi>BRITAIN</hi> from it.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Caesar</hi> reports, that all the <hi>Britains</hi> did stain themselves with <hi>Woad,</hi> which <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> createth a <hi>blew colour,</hi> to make themselves more terrible to their Enemies in fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> saith, <hi>Their bodies are dyed with Woad;</hi> whether it be to make a gallant shew, or for what else, is uncertain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dio Nicaeus</hi> saies of the Northern <hi>Britains,</hi> that, <hi>They went Naked, and Unshod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> saies, There groweth an Herb in <hi>Gaul</hi> like unto <hi>Plantain,</hi> named <hi>Glastum,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dio Nice s.</note> that is, <hi>Woad,</hi> with the juyce of which the Women of <hi>Britain,</hi> as well marryed Wives, <note place="margin">Plia. <hi>Nat. hist.</hi>
                  </note> as their young Daughters, anoint and dye their Bodies all over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solinus</hi> saies, That the Country is partly Peopled with <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who, by the means of Artificial Incisions of divers forms, have, from their Childhood, sundry <note place="margin">Solinus.</note> figures of Beasts printed upon them, and having these Characters deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on their Bodies, as the Man grows in stature, so do these painted Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters also. Neither do these Savage Nations think any thing shews their Courage more, than undergoing these lasting Stars, by which their Limbs drink in much <hi>Paint</hi> or <hi>Colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodian</hi> saies, They knew no use at all of Garments, but about their Belly and Neck they wear Iron; their Bodies they mark with sundry <hi>Pictures,</hi> representing all <note place="margin">Herodianus.</note> manner of living Creatures; and this is the cause they will not be clad, for hiding forsooth, the <hi>painting</hi> of their Bodies.</p>
               <p>These are the Authorities upon which the <hi>Painting</hi> of the <hi>Britains</hi> is built, but as they must not be questioned, yet let us consider a few things concerning them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was the first of the <hi>Romans</hi> that entered this Isle, only saies, that <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> Britanni <hi>se Glasto inficiunt, quod caeruleum efficit Colorem, atque hot horribiliore sunt in pugnae aspectu.</hi> Here is no mention made of any delight and pleasure they took in the variety of Figures, but only a plain colouring and dying of their <hi>Hands, Arms, Faces</hi> and <hi>Necks,</hi> much like to <hi>Gypsies</hi> now adaies, whereby they thought they looked more terrible; That they painted their <hi>whole</hi> Bodies in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, I cannot believe, seeing he reports of the Inlanders (which of all were the most Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous) that most of them were cloathed with <hi>Skins,</hi> so that then they had no Pride, as in <hi>Herodians</hi> daies, to shew their naked Bodies, or to discover the curious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery of <hi>Scars</hi> and <hi>Colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place, it may be thought, that they used only this Custome in <hi>War,</hi> or <note place="margin">Plin, <hi>Nat. hist.</hi>
                  </note> in some particular <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention of, at which they danced naked after the Customes of the Heathens; For if promiscuously they all used this Custome both in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> how could they expect by that means to look more terrible in Battle one to another; Neither can it be expected they <hi>dyed</hi> themselves to amaze forraign Enemies alone, and I am confident this will not be granted by those who stand most for their <hi>Painting;</hi> It remains therefore, that they put on these terrible vizages when they went to War, when one side would not lose that small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of looking as grim as the other. Neither did they use this Custome when they went to the Wars in <hi>Gaul,</hi> for, under hand, they assisted that Nation against <hi>Caesar,</hi> which they could not but publickly have done, had they been so notoriously branded and stigmatized, as in after Ages they have been reputed; Besides, <hi>Caesar</hi> reports, that before his entrance into this Island, he strictly enquired of Merchants <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> and could hear nothing of them, concerning the nature of the People in <hi>War,</hi> or their Customes by which they lived, which, had their <hi>Painting</hi> been so general, then (as is pretended) he could not but have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Whereas he speaks, that all the <hi>Britains</hi> stained themselves with <hi>Woad,</hi> the word is <hi>Britanni,</hi> meaning the Men only, and such as were in Wars, for, without doubt, at his arrival all put themselves into a Warlike defence and posture. I cannot believe, that <hi>Comius,</hi> and the Embassadours that came to him into <hi>Gaul</hi> to leave Hostages for the <hi>Britains,</hi> were any waies depainted; or, that in the daies of <hi>Claudius Caesar, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racticus</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:58825:64"/>
had any thing unseemly about him; Since we find that <hi>Claudius,</hi> and his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>Agripptna,</hi> were taken with his Behaviour. And if any say, that upon such great occations they might wash off the <hi>Painting,</hi> I will not deny it, but since they thought themselves to look terrible by it, certainly in Peace, and in their familiar Conversations, they did not use it; Besides, <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in laying down the Nature of <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> the <hi>Britains,</hi> guesses at a different Original, upon the account some looked Swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their, others Fairer, which could not have been distinguisht had they all been Painted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gauls</hi> sent their Children into <hi>Britain,</hi> to be instructed in the Mysteries of <note place="margin">Caesar.</note> the <hi>Druids;</hi> now what opinion could the <hi>Gauls</hi> have of the Civility of a Nation, which, contrary to the practice of the whole World, did so barbarously disfigure themselves. Certainly it would have amazed their Youth, to have seen a whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland in that shape, by which their Priests, in their Sacrificing, did represent their <hi>Daemons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we read of the wisdom and good nature of <hi>Comius</hi> the <hi>Britain,</hi> praised by <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was intimate with him, the great conduct of <hi>Cassibelan</hi> the <hi>British</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, his prudent and politick management of the War, by <hi>Caesars</hi> own confession, we cannot naturally suppose them to be so barbarous as this Custome would make them, and seeing we have no Authority to believe it practiced only in War, where it was not without its use, we ought to think that <hi>Caesar's</hi> words, <hi>Omnes</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, is meant of the <hi>Men</hi> only, and that in time of Battle.</p>
               <p>In after Ages, wherein the Authors afore-mentioned lived, in succession, it came to pass that the <hi>Britains,</hi> being driven out by the <hi>Romans</hi> of their Possessions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themselves, Men and Women, to their Arms, having Leaders promiscuously on either part, whose Authority they followed; Then came the use of <hi>Painting</hi> into much request, partly because it was terrible to their Enemies, so that many had continual use of it, partly because they were reduced to a Savage life, wanting. Cloaths, had this only for the distinction of Dignities, then <hi>Women</hi> as well as <hi>Men</hi> Painted themselves with terrible Creatures, but never (as I could read of) with Flowers, because <hi>Women</hi> as well as <hi>Men</hi> were in Arms, and because being exposed naked in Fields, and often subject to wet Weather, then, and not before then, do I believe, they took up the custome of making Incisions into the flesh, whereby to keep in their <hi>Painting.</hi> From hence, in succession of Time, these <hi>Britains</hi> were called <hi>Picts,</hi> from their Colouring, but were not named <hi>Britains</hi> on the same account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Isidore</hi> gives the Derivation of the <hi>Picts</hi> rightly, but when he speaks of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> he saies they received it from a word of their own Nation, but declares not <note place="margin">Isidore.</note> what that word signified, which he would not have failed to have done, if both the Names had had the same Original.</p>
               <p>Now, as for the word <hi>Brith,</hi> signifying <hi>Painted,</hi> I conjecture it came from <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi> rather than <hi>Brithon</hi> from it, for 'tis usual now to call <hi>Tawney,</hi> or <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnt</hi> Persons, <hi>Gypsies,</hi> and the Borderers (as I have shewn before more largely) might bring the name of a <hi>Britain</hi> to be the common Appellative of a <hi>Painted</hi> Person.</p>
               <p>Certain I am, that the <hi>British</hi> Islands were famous in the Monuments of the <hi>Greeks</hi> for <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> but as for this Custome of <hi>Painting</hi> themselves, it made no such noise in the World, as to be ever likely to give Name to the Island, no not in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, who (had it been so remarkable as later Authors make it) would not surely have given so slight an account of it as he has done, especially, as he doth not stick to acquaint the World of their superstition in <hi>Hares, Hens,</hi> and <hi>Geese.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for those Fancies of Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> according to which he hath modelled the Cuts of the Naked <hi>Britains,</hi> where he brings in the Maid, with <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Herbs,</hi> pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted curiously on her Body, whereas Married persons were pounced with the stamps of all sorts of <hi>Ravenous beasts,</hi> I shall omit them, as I am jealous of the Authority he grounds them on, or if they were true, yet they relate to a more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern time than those Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> we are treating of; For it would be endless to speak of the divers and barbarous Customes of the wild <hi>Britains,</hi> which they took up after the <hi>Romans</hi> had reduced them to a Savage and brutish life, insomuch that the <hi>Attacotti,</hi> a <hi>British</hi> Nation, according to St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> feed upon <hi>Mans flesh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">St. Hieroms.</note> nay, so much were they given to it, that when they lit upon any flocks of <hi>Sheep,</hi> or herds of Cattle, they preferred the Buttock of the Herdsmen or Keepers before the other Prey, and accounted the Paps and Dugs of Women the most delicious Diet.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:58825:65"/>
               <p>I shall only only treat in this Chapter of the <hi>Customes,</hi> which in all probability were taken up before <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, referring the rest as they shall fall in the course of the History, to which later number, I think, their delicate and various <hi>Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> may be referred, and, as I suppose, is more properly to be reduced to the <hi>Picts,</hi> than <hi>Britains,</hi> of whom <hi>Claudian</hi> writes,
<q>Perlegit exanimes <hi>Picto</hi> moriente figuras.</q>
                  <note place="margin">Claudian.</note> As if the breathless Shapes seem'd to languish at the death of their Supporters, and the Painted Figures die away by degrees, as their Master loseth his strength.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> in confirming his Opinion concerning the <hi>Painting</hi> of the <hi>Britains,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> has produced many Names of their Chief Leaders, in the composition of which he relates the manifest Prints, and some Colour to remain; For Example,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coch</hi> or <hi>Goch, Red</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, is seen in <hi>Cogidunus, Argentocoxus, Segonax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Du, Black,</hi> is seen in <hi>Mandubracius Cartismandua, Togodumnus, Bunducia, Cogidunus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gwin, White,</hi> in <hi>Venutius</hi> and <hi>Immanuentius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gwelw,</hi> a <hi>Wan</hi> or <hi>waterish Colour,</hi> appeareth evidently in <hi>Vellocutus, Carvillias,</hi> and <hi>Suella.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glass, Blew,</hi> in <hi>Cuniglasus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aure,</hi> a <hi>fair Yellow</hi> or <hi>golden Colour,</hi> in <hi>Arviragus, Cungetorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ceg,</hi> a <hi>lively</hi> and gallant Colour, in <hi>Prasutagus</hi> and <hi>Caratacus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (he saies) if the <hi>Britains</hi> borrowed the Names of mingled Colours, together with the very simple Colours themselves, then from</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prasius, Leek-blade green,</hi> comes <hi>Prasutagus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Minium, Red, Vermilion, Acliminius,</hi> King <hi>Cenobelins's</hi> Son.</p>
               <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Cambden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, it is confest the <hi>Britains</hi> did take many Names of <hi>Colours</hi> from the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Werith</hi> for <hi>Veridis, Green; Melin</hi> for <hi>Melinus,</hi> that is, a <hi>Quince yellow</hi> Colour; <hi>Aure</hi> from <hi>Aureus,</hi> a <hi>Golden</hi> Colour, because perhaps the Mixture of these Colours was taught them by that Nation; But where does Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> read that the <hi>Britains</hi> ever painted themselves with such divers Colours, seeing he brings in many Names of Persons so coloured, who never had any thing to do with the <hi>Romans,</hi> but were alwaies in hostility with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> saies, they dyed themselves with <hi>Blew</hi> only, and we see in all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Names, <hi>Cuniglasus</hi> has the most resemblance with his Colour, <hi>viz Giass, Blew;</hi> why may not the Colour <hi>Ceg,</hi> as well as <hi>Du</hi> in <hi>Togodunus,</hi> and <hi>Coch</hi> in <hi>Cogidunus,</hi> so that the former Person will be <hi>black,</hi> and yet of a <hi>lively</hi> and gallant Colour, the latter <hi>black</hi> and <hi>red.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> saies, there are not above four or five more Names of <hi>Britains</hi> in Ancient Writers, and doubts not, but the skilful in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue might reduce them to some Colour, I am verily of his mind, and methinks my Eyes begin to open, and I see the very prints and express tokens of <hi>Coch</hi> in <hi>Comius,</hi> and <hi>Melinus</hi> in <hi>Cunobelinus, Ceg, Taximagulus,</hi> as plainly as he did <hi>Gwin</hi> in <hi>Venutius,</hi> and <hi>Gwellw</hi> in <hi>Suella, Vellocatus</hi> and <hi>Carvillius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we do but consider the great numbers, and wonderful power of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Syllables, in putting themselves into any shape as well as colour, I believe, one would find it no difficult matter to find four or five Names in any Language what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, which had not some relation to some of them.</p>
               <p>But I suppose Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> when he derived <hi>Britannia</hi> from <hi>Brith, Painted,</hi> was resolved to bring in as many Colours as possible he could, although he could not be ignorant that it was called <hi>Britannia,</hi> before any such diversity of <hi>Painting</hi> was used, namely, in <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> daies, when in all probability they were wont only in time of War, or Sacrifices, to discolour themselves, and that only with <hi>Glastum</hi> that gave a <hi>blew</hi> Tincture, which seems to be more reasonable, upon the account that other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the East, from whom our <hi>Britains</hi> received many Customes, used this manner of Colouring themselves, as I have read in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> at their Sacrifices, and if I <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> am not mistaken, in their very Wars also.</p>
               <p>As for the word <hi>Brith,</hi> if I may have leave to give my conjecture, I believe it is of a <hi>Phoenician</hi> derivation, from <hi>Borith,</hi> signifying any thing used by Fullers to get
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58825:65"/>
out Spots or Stains, with which <hi>Borith</hi> they besmear'd their Cloaths first, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cleansed them, and this <hi>Borith,</hi> in time, I believe, might be brought to signifie any thing <hi>stayned, painted, dyed</hi> or <hi>coloured;</hi> so that if any will yet contend for the derivation of <hi>Britannia</hi> from <hi>Brith,</hi> they may understand, that this way also it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> Thus much for the <hi>Painting</hi> used by the <hi>Britains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> as to their <hi>Persons,</hi> are said (by <hi>Strabo</hi>) to be taller of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than the <hi>Gauls,</hi> an Argument that they were not of <hi>Gaulish</hi> Extraction, their Hair <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> not so yellow, nor their Bodies so well compact, knit and firm, and but bad Feet to support them; And, he saith, he saw divers Youths at <hi>Rome</hi> made after that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, but as to the other lineaments of their Bodies, they were well made, and had excellent features.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodian</hi> writes, that about their Bellies and Necks they wore Rings of <hi>Iron,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that to be a great Ornament and sign of their Riches, esteeming it as highly as <note place="margin">Herodianus.</note> other Nations do Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> reports, that in his daies <hi>Iron</hi> Rings, and <hi>Brazen</hi> pieces, was their Mony, <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> but makes no mention of their wearing of them about their Necks and Bellies, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, a Custome took up afterwards, when they were driven about by the <hi>Romans,</hi> which being first begun out of a necessity of Carriage, afterwards became an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is observable in their Coyns, that one sort of them had a figure of a Shield embost, and on that side a certain Image, the device was within, which kind of Coyn was in use in no part of the World but in some places belonging to <hi>Greece,</hi> which, although it be not (as some do imagine) a sign of a <hi>Greekish</hi> extraction, yet it is a proof of the long continuance of <hi>Graecians</hi> in this Island.</p>
               <p>It seems <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Brass</hi> were in much esteem among them, although they wanted not better Mettals of their own, the abundance of which brought down their value, as may appear by the little Commodities they exchanged them for. <hi>Strabo,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Traffick, saies, That for <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead, Skins</hi> and <hi>Furs,</hi> they received <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> 
                  <hi>Earthen Vessels, Salt</hi> and <hi>Brazen wares</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who first of all Traded hither, and concealed their Navigations from others. And, although Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> makes only mention of their <hi>Skins</hi> and <hi>Furs,</hi> and saies that their Trading was inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet their <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> were the greater Commodities, from which the <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands, likewise <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> received their names of <hi>Bratanac</hi> first, and afterwards <hi>Cassiterides.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Brass</hi> was so much esteemed among them, upon the account they received them from Forreign Nations, the latter of which is more Malleable, and the former more serviceable than their Native Mettals.</p>
               <p>They wore the Hair of their <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>upper Lips,</hi> long, and shaved it off in all other parts, according to <hi>Caesar;</hi> where we read of their going Naked, or the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> of some, in covering only those parts which Nature would have hid, it must be attributed either to the Inland <hi>Britains,</hi> or to those whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the same Exigences, being it is related by Authors, that lived when it was a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, who stick not, in a horrid manner, to describe those Barbarisms of the Inlanders, to which they themselves had brought them.</p>
               <p>As for their divers <hi>Complexions,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> their <hi>good Constitution of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus. Plutarch. Strabo. Solinus.</note> 
                  <hi>Body,</hi> taken notice of by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> so that they lived to an Hundred and twenty years; as likewise their <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>good Dispositions,</hi> recorded by <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Solinus;</hi> the <hi>Beauty</hi> of their Women, their making of <hi>War</hi> under the conduct of them; their Riches in <hi>Cattle</hi> and <hi>Lands,</hi> their small <hi>Carroghs,</hi> in which, as long as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sayl, they never used to eat any thing; with many such things, recorded by <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, after their Conquest of them, I purposely omit, and will treat of some of their Customes which seem to be of long continuance in the Island, of which some account may be given.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Britains</hi> as well as the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as has been toucht of before, exactly (according to the Customes of the Eastern Nations) began their day at the setting of the Sun, not at his Rising, as the <hi>Romans,</hi> or at Midnight, as we now use it, so that what the <hi>Latins</hi> call <hi>Septimanae,</hi> at this day they call <hi>With-nos,</hi> that is, <hi>eight Nights,</hi> and two <hi>Septimanae, Pimthec-nos,</hi> that is, <hi>sixteen Nights,</hi> following the Law of Nations, wherein <hi>Darkness</hi> precedes <hi>Light,</hi> which was observed in those Countries that most conversed with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who by <hi>Moses</hi> were taught, <hi>That the Evening and the Morning were the first day.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:58825:66"/>
               <p>This Custome, I belive, was brought into <hi>Britain</hi> by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who, in all likelyhood, used it.</p>
               <p>Add to this their observation of the <hi>New Moon,</hi> the beginning their <hi>Months</hi> and <hi>New Years,</hi> yea their several Ages according to the Cycle of <hi>Thirty Years,</hi> in her first Quarter, and methinks there is something of the same Nation in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that the <hi>Druids</hi> called an Herb <hi>Samolus,</hi> which grew in wet places, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plin.</hi> Nat. hist.</note> and used these Ceremonies in gathering it; First, they were <hi>fasting,</hi> next, they ought not to <hi>look back</hi> during the time of their plucking it, lastly, they were to use their <hi>left hand</hi> only.</p>
               <p>Now what Herb this <hi>Samolus</hi> was, he doth not tell us, but it seems very probable, that from the last Ceremony, namely, in gathering it with the <hi>Left hand,</hi> the Herb took its name, that is to say, <hi>Samol,</hi> signifying in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, the <hi>Left hand.</hi> Seeing many of the Plants have <hi>Greek</hi> names given them by the <hi>Britains,</hi> why may not this receive its name from the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> This Herb so gathered with all its due Ceremonies, was esteemed of soveraign vertue to the curing of all Diseases in <hi>Swine,</hi> or other Cattle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Habits</hi> of the <hi>Britains</hi> were much after the manner of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> according to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and, I believe, had much the same Names, many of which we have proved <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> to be of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Derivation, in the Chapter treating of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> so that we need not here speak much concerning them.</p>
               <p>I will only mention two more; The first out of <hi>Varro,</hi> is called <hi>Gannacum,</hi> from whence our word, <hi>Gown,</hi> seems to be derived; It was a thick covering made of <note place="margin">Varro.</note> Course Wool, and had a Nap upon it on both sides, much after the nature of <hi>Freeze,</hi> it was called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

I suppose the Name was introduced by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> into these Parts, for the <hi>Galdees</hi> called it <hi>Gouneca,</hi> or <hi>Gunca;</hi> It was worn by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and better sort of <hi>Britains</hi> to keep out the Cold.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Gaunacum</hi> in the Glossary of <hi>Isidore</hi> is expounded <hi>Gausapa,</hi> and may have its original from <hi>Gulpak,</hi> signifying thick and hairy Garments, so that <hi>Martial</hi> esteem'd it a Paradox,

               <p>
                  <hi>Bardiacus</hi> (which as <hi>Bochartus</hi> thinks) was called <hi>Bardus,</hi> from whence <hi>Bardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cucullus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isidore.</note> was compounded (of which I have spoken of before) was a Garment wore <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> by the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> of which <hi>Martial</hi> thus writes,</p>
               <lg>

               <p>This Garment was of divers Colours woven together, and made a gaudy shew, without doubt very pleasant to the <hi>Britains</hi> in those daies, as we find the <hi>Indians</hi> to be much taken with the like. It is called <hi>Bardes</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Dialect, and <hi>Bord</hi> or <hi>Borda</hi> by the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and no doubt by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> was brought into these parts, which words are very sufficient also to prove from whence the <hi>Bardi</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Name. The <hi>Arabians</hi> wore it mixt only with black and yellow, but generally it was made up of some colours in the nature of our Fools Coats. Hence it is that St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> in his <hi>68th.</hi> Epistle of the <hi>Circumcelliones,</hi> saith, <hi>Presbyterum</hi>

               <p>If Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> from the divers Colours which he finds out in the Names of the <hi>British</hi> Princes, would make them to be diversly Painted, he had better have looke for it in these Coats than in their Skins, for, as for their Bodies, they used but one Colour in the dying of them.</p>

                  </note> the Circumstances of time, how that it was long after they were called <hi>BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAINS</hi> they took up that Custome; To Answer him, Since I suppose <hi>Britain</hi> to be truly and rightly derived from <hi>Bratanac</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, signifying
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58825:66"/>
a Country of <hi>Tynn,</hi> and upon the account, that from hence that useful Commodity was dispersed by them through the whole World; upon the very same account are these Islands called by the <hi>Greeks</hi> the same as <hi>Bratanac,</hi> namely, <hi>Cassiterides,</hi> the <hi>Tynn</hi> Islands.</p>
               <p>I will represent one Person of the <hi>Bretanick</hi> Islanders, who lived, I suppose, in the <hi>Forelings</hi> or <hi>Scyllies,</hi> in which Islands, together with <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> Mettal most abounded. The description of which is given by <hi>Strabo. They are Inhabited</hi> (saies <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> he) <hi>by Men wearing black Garments, clad in side Coats descending to their Ankles, going with Staves like the Furies in Tragedies; Mines they have of</hi> Tynn <hi>and</hi> Lead, <hi>which they exchange for</hi> Earthen-Pots, Salt, <hi>and</hi> Brazen ware.</p>

               <p>These are the <hi>Silures</hi> of whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes, That their Hair was black and <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> curled, differing from the rest of the <hi>Britains</hi> in their swarthy Countenances, by which he reckons them to be of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Original, namely, the Off-spring of the <hi>Iberi,</hi> who were great Miners, but we have shewn (treating in the Chapter of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi>) that in all probabillity they were called <hi>Silures</hi> from some Colony of <note place="margin">Pliny.</note>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58825:67"/>
the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> Trading with them, as their Name in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue importeth. And we may observe, that as the adjacent Islands (the <hi>Sorelings</hi> especially) were <note place="margin">Solinus, <hi>cap.</hi> 22:</note> called <hi>Bretanick</hi> upon the account of their <hi>Tynn</hi> Mines, when this was known by the name of <hi>Albion</hi> only, so there was an Island called <hi>Silura,</hi> lying off of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> which, I believe, gave the Name to the <hi>Silures</hi> in South <hi>Wales;</hi> So that <hi>Britannia</hi> in general, and the <hi>Silures</hi> in particular, both took their Names from <hi>Bretannick,</hi> or <hi>Tynn Islands,</hi> which we have proved to be first discovered by the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Habits of these Western <hi>Britains</hi> were remarkable for their <hi>Length</hi> and <hi>Colour,</hi> the former of which, together with the Staff they used to carry, argues that some Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Colonies, and especially the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> traded with them, and although by the Black colour of their Hair and Garments, their Swarthy complexions, and their Staves, they seem'd like <hi>Furies</hi> in Tragedies, yet are they described by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to be of a gentle and kind Disposition, of a fair and honest Behaviour, simple and sincere in their Conversation, and generally the <hi>Britains,</hi> by most Authors, are so set out. <hi>They have not,</hi> saies Diodorus Siculus, <hi>the craft and subtilty of other Nations, but are fair Condition'd People, of a plain and upright Dealing.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Diod. Sic.</note>
               </p>
               <p>They had all things in Common amongst them, and would not admit of any Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety at all, after the manner of the <hi>Germans</hi> described by <hi>Caesar,</hi> from whom in all probability they descended, insomuch that the same Author reports, That ten or <note place="margin">Caes. Com.</note> twelve of them agreed together in the promiscuous use of one Woman, Brethren with Brethren, nay Parents with their own Children; The Issue they had by them they nurtured and brought up by a Common-stock, though they were reputed his in a more especial manner, who married the Mother in her Virginity.</p>
               <p>This incestuous Custome was frequent among the <hi>Athenians</hi> before <hi>Cecrops</hi> daies, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> notes, and I conjecture was only used by the wilder sort of <hi>Britains,</hi> and continued it was a long while after the <hi>Romans</hi> had subdued this Island; For we <note place="margin">Selden.</note> read that <hi>Julia</hi> the Empress of <hi>Severus,</hi> twitted the Wife of <hi>Argentocorus</hi> with it, who replied in this manner, <hi>We,</hi> British <hi>Women, do truly differ herein from you</hi> Roman <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for we satisfie our selves with the accompanying with the Worthiest men openly, but you with every Base fellow in a corner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the most memorable <hi>Customes</hi> used by the <hi>Britains,</hi> in which they agreed sometimes with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> sometimes with the <hi>Germans,</hi> according as they were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from either, and some <hi>Customes</hi> we have shewn they had particular to themselves, of which no account can be given, and others also which could have no other Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal but from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> or <hi>Graecians,</hi> which Originals (besides the congruity the <hi>Britains</hi> had with no other Western Nation, their Neighbours) is evidently shewn out of the very Names of the <hi>Customes</hi> themselves. Certainly, it would take up a Volume, if any one better skill'd in the <hi>Phoenician, Greek,</hi> and <hi>British</hi> Tongues, and in the <hi>customes</hi> of these three Nations, would sit himself down, seriously and fully to compare their respective waies and manner of Living, their <hi>Habits, Coyns, Laws,</hi> and other Circumstances; In all which, as likewise in their manner of <hi>Warring,</hi> there seems such an apparent similitude between the aforesaid Nations, that they seem rather Neighbours than to be so far disjoyned as they are; But it will suffice, if by this small account given of them, a way may be opened to an ingenious Undertaker, to search deeper into the matter, and so I shall pass on to their Customes in <hi>War.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The Custome of the <hi>BRITAINS</hi> in their Wars, and Manner of Fighting.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> at the first entrance of it by <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> was divided into a great many petty States and Governments, insomuch that the different Interest of Princes was the cause of continual Wars and Dissensions among them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Ambition, only to encrease their Rule and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, prompted some to make Incursions on their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, so that they who had the greatest desire to sit quiet, were obliged to stand in a posture of Defence, and to be alwaies ready against such Invasions, whose greatest strength and force lay in their being swift and sudden; Sometimes the <hi>Druid</hi> Interest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Secular Power in its Quarrels, every Prince desiring to advance a Creature of his own to the Primacy and Superintendency over the whole Island; The whole Nation being alwaies in a Warlike posture, it is no wonder to hear what some ancient Authors write of them;</p>
               <p>That <hi>every one delighted in picking Quarrels;</hi> that <hi>it was their daily exercise and pleasure to be Skirmishing;</hi> that <hi>they were continually going out in Parties, Fortisying, and Intrenching, many times rather out of delight, than any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For being constrained to keep standing Forces, it was absolutely requisite they should be kept in Exercise, for it was impossible, in the circumstances this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was then in, for any Prince (though desirous of Peace) to keep his Souldiers in Order and Discipline, unless they were sometimes let loose, and afforded those liberties and advantages which other men of Fortune had, under more Ambitious and turbulent Governours.</p>
               <p>But the greatest bone of Contention among them, which never suffered these Dissensions to heal and close up, was the eternal fewd, as I suppose, between the Inland <hi>Britains,</hi> the first Possessours of the Island, and those that came over from <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Belgium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These drave all the Ancient Inhabitants from all the Sea-Coasts, seizing their Estates, and securing the Trade of the Island into their own hands.</p>
               <p>And although, in process of time, these different forts of People might mix very much in their <hi>Allyances, Language, Customes</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> yet the first Injuries of the Invaders was, no doubt, upon occasion, very often, severely resented by the Inlanders, and I believe, in their common Union, against <hi>Caesar</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> never heartily forgotten.</p>
               <p>This being the condition of Affairs in <hi>Britain</hi> at that time, it is no wonder that <hi>Caesar,</hi> at his Arrival, was much deceived in his expectations, for by the small pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations he made at his first Invasion, we may guess what a low opinion he had of the <hi>Temper, Courage</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>Britains;</hi> and at his second Attempt, by the increase of his Levies, and number of Ships, being in all Eight hundred, we may on the other side judge, what warm entertainment he received the first time from them; So that the Courage of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and their skill in War, is not to be questioned, in respect they lived among themselves in the continual exercise of it.</p>
               <p>It remains only, that their <hi>Manner of Fighting,</hi> with the several <hi>Customes</hi> they used, differing from other Nations their Neighbours, be described and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:58825:68"/>
               <p>The first and most memorable thing that occurs, is their Fighting in <hi>Chariots,</hi> after the manner of the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> (as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> expresses) at the <note place="margin">Diod. Sic.</note> 
                  <hi>Trojan</hi> War. Of this Custome of theirs I have treated in the Chapter of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and I doubt not (since it was peculiar to the <hi>Britains,</hi> and a few ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent parts in <hi>Gaul,</hi> that <hi>Coesar</hi> relates it for a wonder, in the Western parts) but that will be thought to proceed either immediately from that Nation, or else from the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Names of the Charriots they fought in, are clearly <hi>Phoenician,</hi> as <hi>Benna, Carrus</hi> or <hi>Carrum, Covinus, Essedum, Rheda,</hi> and so it is but reason to think, primitively were introduced by them; The <hi>Gracians</hi> added and altered them according to the Custome of their Country, for one sort they called <hi>Petori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> from its four Wheels, and of the ordinary <hi>Rheda</hi> they made their <hi>Epireda,</hi> I suppose with two stories in it to carry the more Men.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Waggons</hi> and <hi>Chariots</hi> they thus fought in, were exceedingly well Harnassed and Armed, for at both ends of the <hi>Axeltrees</hi> they fastned Hooks and Scyths, so that driving furiously into the Enemies battle, they made whole Lanes of slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Men, the Scyths cutting them off in the middle who did not give speedy way, and such as escaped them were caught up with the Hooks, which were placed for that purpose, so that hanging upon them they were miserable Spectacles, and suffering intollerable pains and torments, were constrained to write upon the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of their Conquerours, being drag'd along before and behind their Chariot Wheels.</p>
               <p>These sort of Chariots were called <hi>Covini,</hi> and in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue at this day, <hi>Cowain,</hi> signifies to <hi>carry in a Wagon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucan</hi> calls it <hi>constratus Covinus,</hi> being possibly of an evener and broader make, more open than their other sorts of Chariots, and probably it carried no men at <note place="margin">Lucan.</note> all, but only him that guided it; For we read in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that <hi>Covinarius</hi> is as <note place="margin">Tacitus, <hi>in Agric.</hi>
                  </note> much as to say, <hi>Auriga;</hi> And this they did that the Chariot might be more expedit, and the Horses with more ease might draw the Scyths and Hooks through any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Essedum,</hi> called by the <hi>Phoenicians, Dassedan,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was another sort of Chariots, which, I believe, carried no Scyths or Hooks, in which <note place="margin">Caes. Com. lib. 4.</note> were only Armed men.</p>
               <p>How the <hi>Britains</hi> used these we read in <hi>Caesar;</hi> The Charioteers, called <hi>Essedarii,</hi> ride through all the parts of the Battle, and bestowed their Darts, with the terrible appearance of their Horses, and the noise of their Wheels, usually break their Ranks; And when they have wrought themselves into the Enemies Horse, they fling themselves from their Chariots and fight on foot, the Chariot Guiders in the mean time withdraw a little way out of the Battle, and place themselves so, that if their Party were over-powered with the number of Enemies, they might retreat with more ease and security.</p>
               <p>By this means, in their fighting, they perform the nimbleness of Horse, and the steadiness of Foot; By daily use and exercise they arrived to that perfection, that in the steepest descent of a Hill they could hold their Horses to a full Careere, stop of a sudden, turn short, run upon the Spire-pole and Beam of the Chariot, stand upright on the Yoak and Harness of their Steeds, and immediately again whip into their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots.</p>
               <p>This exceeding nimbleness and dexterity in the management of their <hi>Esseds,</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times foiled <hi>Caesar</hi> and his heavy Legions. Sometimes they would feign themselves to flie, by that means to draw his light Souldiers to follow them, and immediately turning again, and skipping off their Chariots, they often gave them notable Repulses, driving them to their main Body, where they were forced to shelter themselves. Upon this very account they never fought thick or in clusters, but dispersed themselves into diverse and distant stations, which before hand was, for the most part, agreed upon; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving one another as they saw occasion, and retiring when weary, so came on again as they had refresht or relieved their Horses.</p>
               <p>By this their scattered way of Fighting, the <hi>Romans</hi> knew not which way to bend their main strength, besides hindered on all sides to make Excursions, were obliged
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58825:68"/>
to close Marches, not able to forrage in parts, a thing very destructive to them in a strange Country, so that by the conduct of <hi>Cassibelan</hi> their General, the <hi>Roman</hi> Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were in a manner made useless, serving only as a Refuge for the Horse, who were often beaten upon them.</p>
               <p>It is very difficult to distinguish among so many Names they had of their Wagons and Charriots, to what proper and particular uses they put them.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Carri</hi> or <hi>Carra,</hi> from whence our word <hi>Cart</hi> proceeds, were made use of in carrying of their Arms and Baggage, and seem not to be engaged with the Enemy, but were alwaies secured by a Trench and Rampier, insomuch the <hi>Britains,</hi> upon any Rout given to them, retired, and taking out their fresh Horses left their wearied ones to recruit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Benna,</hi> called by the <hi>Germans</hi> at this day <hi>Benne,</hi> and the <hi>French, Banneau,</hi> seems to be the same with <hi>Petoritum,</hi> both receiving their names from their Wheels, one from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the other from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> but whether these were used for their pleasure only, or in War, is uncertain; that they differed from all the rest in the numbers and make of their Wheels, is unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Covinus</hi> was the Chariot with the Scyths and Hooks, as <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, and their <hi>Esseda</hi> were not Armed Chariots, but carried Men only in them, as <note place="margin">Pomp. Mela.</note> may be understood out of <hi>Caesars</hi> words, where he saies, That <hi>the ratling noise of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> 
                  <hi>the Wheels, and terrible appearance of the Horses, put his Men into dis-array,</hi> making no mention of their <hi>Scyths,</hi> which certainly he would have done if in these <hi>Esseda</hi> there had been any.</p>
               <p>It is very probable, in their first Skirmishes with <hi>Caesar,</hi> they would not be brought to a set Battle, as they used these <hi>Esseda</hi> only, and reserved their <hi>Covini</hi> for other occasions, as they should be offered.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Rheda,</hi> from whence proceeds <hi>Rhediad, a Course, Rheder, to Run, Rhedec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fd, a Race,</hi> in the <hi>British.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we look to the Original, being <hi>Rheda</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Dialect, as it is used in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrase upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 25. where mention is made of <hi>Charriots of AEgypt,</hi> then we may conclude it was a Charriot of <hi>War,</hi> but whether with <hi>Scyths,</hi> or <note place="margin">Exod. 13. 25</note> without, is uncertain, although the former be more probable, seeing that the Eastern Countries, as likewise <hi>AEgypt</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> where many Colonies of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had seated themselves, used the like. But that it might be made and used without <hi>Scyths,</hi> and was the Charriot wherewith they ran <hi>Races,</hi> and at publick <hi>Games</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised themselves, as it cannot be denied: So <hi>Eporeda,</hi> a City of the <hi>Salassians,</hi> seems to testifie, which received its Name, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> from <hi>Horse-breakers,</hi> and possibly might be called <hi>Hipporedia</hi> from them. Add to this <hi>Rheda</hi> the <hi>Epitheda,</hi> with a <hi>Greek</hi> addition to a <hi>Phoenician</hi> name, and we have all the sorts of <hi>Charriots</hi> which were ever mentioned, or may be gathered of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> or <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we are to observe, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes concerning the management of these Charriots, that the greater Personage guided them, and that his waiters and followers <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> fought out of the same, which is not taken notice of by <hi>Caesar,</hi> and may not be used in his daies; For we find in him, that the Charriot Drivers often retired out of the Battle, and there waited the success of those he had carried in, that he might bring them off again, which office can very hardly be supposed to be executed by their Princes and Leaders.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Horses</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> used in their Chariots (according to <hi>Dio Nicaeus</hi>) were <note place="margin">Dio Nicaeus.</note> small and swift, but whether their breed was generally so, or whether they chose them such, as easier to be managed, and fitter to climb Hills and endure Labour, is not resolved me by any.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Harness</hi> they put on them, may be gathered to be not only substantial, but cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously wrought and engraven upon, out of the words of <hi>Propertius,</hi>

               <p>Because this their way of <hi>Fighting</hi> may be better described and set out to the eye, than painted out in words, I have thought good to expose to view their three sorts of <hi>Chariots,</hi> the <hi>Covinus, Essedum</hi> and <hi>Epireda,</hi> which seem to have the greatest difference one from another, as may be seen in: this following Figure.

               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> fought in Bodies called <hi>Caterva,</hi> now <hi>Caturfa,</hi> as the <hi>Romans</hi> had their <hi>Legions,</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians</hi> their <hi>Phalanx,</hi> and this <hi>Caterva</hi> we have shewn to be of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Derivation, and to this word Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>Cad,</hi> signifying <hi>War</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, and <hi>Kaderue,</hi> a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their strong <hi>Holds</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> (according to <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi>) were nothing else <note place="margin">Caesar Com. Strabo.</note> but a round spot of Ground, fenced about with Trees fell'd down for that purpose, and secured on all sides with a Ditch, and Rampire, and this served them in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, and this is all that can be learnt of their general way of Fighting.</p>
               <p>We will proceed now to particulars.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> were very swift in Running, neither did they burthen themselves with any Armour, which they could not at their pleasure fling from them. They had a <hi>Shield</hi> and <hi>short Spear,</hi> in the nether part whereof hung a <hi>Bell,</hi> by the shaking of which they thought to affright and amaze their Enemies; They used <hi>Daggers</hi> also,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58825:69"/>
those that went Naked, girded their Swords by their sides by an Iron Chain.</p>
               <p>There is no mention made of Authors, by what Names the <hi>British</hi> Arms were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The <hi>Gaulish</hi> Weapons are <hi>Spatha, Gessum, Lancea, Sparum, Cateia, Matara</hi> or <hi>Mataris, Thyreos,</hi> and <hi>Cetrum</hi> or <hi>Cetra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Cetra</hi> is attributed to the Old <hi>Britains,</hi> by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and we have shewn it to be the <hi>Phoenicians Cetera;</hi> Many others of them are reduced, by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> to the <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>British</hi> Tongue, and are supposed by him to be (in his making the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> the same Nations) used promiscuously; by both those words cited by him, I have proved to be <hi>Phoenician,</hi> and by all probability brought by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> into <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain;</hi> It will not be amiss to shew, seeing the other Weapons might be in use here in <hi>Britain,</hi> that they are also of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Derivation, for seeing that the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians</hi> Traded into the <hi>Bretanick</hi> Islands, it would be unreasonable to imagine, that the <hi>Britains</hi> did not learn the use of the same Weapons from them, as the <hi>Gauls</hi> may be proved to do, setting aside, that it is very probable that the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as they sent their Children to be Instructed in this Island in <hi>Arts, Sciences,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> so might they learn of them also many things very conducible in their Wars.</p>
               <p>The first sort of Weapon (for we omit those we have spoken of in the Chapter of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi>) is the <hi>Spatha,</hi> the Italians <hi>Spada,</hi> and the Spaniards <hi>Espada, Isidore</hi> calls it <hi>Spata,</hi> and saies it was a <hi>two edged Sword,</hi> with which they cut and did not <note place="margin">Isidore.</note> thrust, for <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> saies, it had no <hi>point.</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> wore <hi>Daggers</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Polyb. <hi>lib. 2.</hi> Livius, <hi>lib. 32.</hi>
                  </note> which served to thrust with; some have derived it from the <hi>Chaldee</hi> word, <hi>Sphud</hi> or <hi>Spud,</hi> signifying a <hi>Spit,</hi> which the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Spedo,</hi> the <hi>Dutch, Spett,</hi> we our selves call <hi>Spit,</hi> and the <hi>Germans, Spissz,</hi> but the Derivation cannot hold with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the <hi>Spata,</hi> which was nothing like a <hi>Spit,</hi> and was not for <hi>thrusting</hi> but <hi>hewing</hi> and <hi>slashing.</hi> It is more probably derived from <hi>Spatin</hi> in the same Dialect, which being a plural word, and signifying only <hi>Staves,</hi> yet by adding the word <hi>Biszel,</hi> or <hi>Iron,</hi> they are general interpreted words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sparum,</hi> another Weapon used in <hi>Gaul, Festus</hi> derives from <hi>Spargendo,</hi> but probably it may be supposed to be called <hi>Sparon</hi> by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> from the Root <hi>Sapar,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Festus.</note> from whence comes <hi>Sophron,</hi> signifying an <hi>Iron Edge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cataia,</hi> according to <hi>Isidore,</hi> is a Weapon made of the softest Mettal, which, by reason of its weight, did not fly far, but with great force brake through wherever <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> it lit; and why may not this come from <hi>Catat,</hi> signifying to break in pieces, and scatter the Enemies Forces. <hi>Bochartus</hi> thinks these <hi>Cataia</hi> are meant, those <hi>Ingentes Clavae,</hi> made mention of by <hi>Ammianus,</hi> which were set on fire, and which, he saies, <note place="margin">Ammianus, lib. 31.</note> the <hi>Barbarians</hi> flung on their Enemies, and with which, together with their Swords, they brake through their Left wing, but I never read of any <hi>Fire</hi> ever made use of by the <hi>Britains</hi> in their Fights, but only when the <hi>Romans</hi> invaded <hi>Anglesey,</hi> and whether they were these <hi>Cataiae</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls <hi>Fire-brands,</hi> it is hard to judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lancea</hi> comes, according to <hi>Festus,</hi> from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and perhaps was brought immediately by the <hi>Graecians</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> for it is very difficult to bring <note place="margin">Festus.</note> it from <hi>Romcha,</hi> changing <hi>R</hi> into <hi>L,</hi> although there wants not several Examples of that nature, as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matara,</hi> another Weapon, which I suppose was their <hi>Darts</hi> they flung out of their Charriots, it is also called <hi>Mataris</hi> and <hi>Materis,</hi> but by <hi>Hesychius, Madaris.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hesychius. Strabo. Pollux.</note> 
                  <hi>Strabo</hi> saies, it is of the kind of Weapons called <hi>Palta;</hi> And <hi>Pollux</hi> saith, <hi>Paltum</hi> was a <hi>Medish</hi> Dart, so that we may gather it had its Original in the Eastern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in whose Dialect <hi>Matara</hi> signifies <hi>to dart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these names of their <hi>Weapons,</hi> I will only add two more of their Instruments in War; The first <hi>Manga, Mangana,</hi> and <hi>Mangonale,</hi> an Engine to fling Stones with; the <hi>French</hi> call it <hi>Mangoneaux,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but whether brought by them or the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> into these Parts, is doubt worthy, but in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <hi>Manganon</hi> signifieth the same Engine.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:58825:70"/>
               <p>Add to this <hi>Carnon,</hi> a <hi>Trumpet</hi> in the same Language, in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Dialect is called <hi>Carnon,</hi> in the <hi>Syrian, Carno</hi> or <hi>Carna,</hi> so that this also proceeds from the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> And now, this shall suffice to have been spoken of the Armour used by our <hi>Britains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> before they undertook any War, are reported (according to the Customes of other Nations) to have enquired into the Entrals of <hi>Beasts,</hi> yea, and of <hi>Men</hi> also, and, I suppose had the same methods of judging, whether Success was portended or no.</p>
               <p>They fought under the Conduct of <hi>Women,</hi> discoloured their Faces, and shaped their Bodies into divers figures; they used Superstitious and Magical Exclamations in the beginning of their Battles, with many other Rites and Usages, which will more properly be shewn in the course of the History, seeing they relate to the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> after they were subdued by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and are not of so Ancient a date as to be placed here, where nothing was designed to be spoke of but what was almost of equal standing with the first Plantation of this Island it self.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The <hi>BRITISH</hi> Idolatry; their several GODS, and superstitious Rites and Ceremonies of Worship.</head>
               <p>IT is certain, by the Testimony of <hi>Caesar</hi> and other approved Authors, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had the same GODS with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> and agreed with them in their manner of Worship, using the same religious Rites and superstitious Ceremonies they did; Neither indeed could it be otherwise, if we do but consider what care the <hi>Druids</hi> took (who were the common Priests of both Nations) to preserve the unity of Religion, and the exact observancies of their Order; For besides the yearly Synods held in the Isle of <hi>Anglesey</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> under a President (who had Jurisdiction over all <hi>Britain,</hi> and great part of <hi>Gallia</hi>) they had a solemn and general Sessions in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Carnutes</hi> about <hi>Charters,</hi> a Country held to be in the middle of all <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this great Assembly resorted the <hi>Druids</hi> from all Parts to hear Causes, and to consult about the affairs of Religion, in which Consultation the <hi>British Druids</hi> carried the most eminent Authority; having learned their general Discipline in a Country where it was first begun, and more exactly taught, and to whose Schools the <hi>Druids</hi> of <hi>France</hi> resorted to be more fully instructed in the more hidden and more abstruse Mysteries of their Religion.</p>
               <p>This consent of both Nations in the uniformity of Worship, does not argue them to be of the same Original, but is to be attributed to a <hi>Druid</hi> Interest, who, notwithstanding the continual Animosities arising between petty Princes, and the great Heart burnings between the Inland <hi>Britains,</hi> and the <hi>Gauls,</hi> that had invaded them; Nevertheless they kept up their Authority and Interest on all hands, partly by the Holiness of life, and partly by the assistance of the Secular Power, thereby so brought it about that they were the only Interpreters of Divine Mysteries, that no Sacrifice, either publick or private, could be performed without their assistance, or solemn Feasts proclaimed without their consent, and upon this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenoe it past currant, as necessary for the maintaining of any Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is to be supposed, that in their publik Assemblies they agreed upon the number of their Gods, and the particul Honours due to them; they also Instituted publick Feasts, and set Sacrifices, upon set times of the Moon, that the day might be celebrated uniformly through all their Jurisdictions.</p>
               <p>And seeing the GODS of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> as <hi>Apollo, Minerva, Jupiter, Mars, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, &amp;c.</hi> were <hi>Greek</hi> Gods, and Idolized by the <hi>Britains,</hi> with the same Rites and Ceremonies as in <hi>Greece,</hi> and had the same Offices ascribed to them, it is manifest they were introduced by the <hi>Druids,</hi> and so worshipped in <hi>Britain</hi> before <hi>Gaul,</hi> and from thence translated into that Nation; So that considering the Original of the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Gaulish</hi> Gods, proceeded from the same Authors of their Religion, and considering likewise the great care the <hi>Druids</hi> used in preserving Uniformity, least they should break out and divide into Factions among themselves, it is not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned (the Authority of <hi>Caesar</hi> also bearing witness) but that the Gods of the <hi>Gauls</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> were also worshipped in <hi>Britain.</hi> And although in many particular places, the People might have private and Tutelar Gods, whose Denominations extended not beyond a <hi>Hill, River, Fountain</hi> or <hi>Spring</hi> (as shall be shewn in the sequel) and which <hi>Gildas</hi> numbers amongst the <hi>British</hi> Idolatry, yet as to those Gods called (by the Latins) <hi>Dii</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gildas</note> 
                  <hi>majorum gentium,</hi> of the highest rank, and whose Power was universal, they were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly common to both Nations; These Gods, I will endeavour to set down their Names, Originals, and Offices, from what Countries they were derived, and by whose means they were brought into <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> by which Circumstances it will more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, the great Confinity and Alliance once made between these Nations, and the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi>

                  <hi>JUPITER</hi> was worshipped under the name of <hi>Taramis,</hi> or the <hi>Thunderer,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">JUPITER,</note> and <hi>Caran,</hi> or <hi>Caram,</hi> signifies at this day in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue <hi>Thunder,</hi> as <hi>Donder</hi> in the <hi>German,</hi> and <hi>Thor</hi> in the old <hi>Swedish</hi> Tongue, from whence the <hi>Germans</hi> called <hi>Jupiters</hi> day <hi>Donders-dagh,</hi> the <hi>Swedes, Thors-dag,</hi> and we <hi>Thursday.</hi>

                  <hi>Adam Bremensis</hi> of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> writes, that they held <hi>Thor</hi> to rule and govern the <note place="margin">Adam Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensis <hi>of the Swedes.</hi>
                  </note> Air, and that from him proceeded <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning, Winds</hi> and <hi>Storms,</hi> likewise that the gave <hi>sair Weather,</hi> and brought forth the Fruits of the Earth; likewise in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, that he was made holding a <hi>Scepter</hi> in his hand, and was esteemed the same as <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the <hi>King of the Gods,</hi> in which sense he was called in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, <hi>Moloch.</hi> It is observable, that as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> (of which Country <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia</hi> was a part) offered humane Sacrifices to that God, <hi>making their Children to pass through the Fire,</hi> so likewise did the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> to this <hi>TARAMIS,</hi> or <hi>Thunderer,</hi> whose very Name, in another place, we have shewn to be the <hi>Phoenician Carem,</hi> in their Tongue signifying <hi>Thunder.</hi> Of this God <hi>Lucan</hi> thus writes,
<q>
                     <hi>Et Taramis</hi> Scythicae <hi>non mitior ara Dianae.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Altars erected in Honour of this <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the <hi>British</hi> Blood was often <note place="margin">Lucan.</note> poured out in great abundance, but perhaps more in <hi>Gaul,</hi> by reason that that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is more infested with sudden <hi>Thunders</hi> and <hi>violent Storms,</hi> that they ostner attoan'd that Power under whose hand they lay, than the <hi>Britains,</hi> who enjoyed a more <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi> and <hi>evener Weather.</hi> And although to this God, as likewise to some others, they offered for the most part heynous and notorious Malefactors, yet oftentimes the Innocent Natives suffered, and men, for their <hi>health</hi> in some dangerous sickness, or upon some great necessities and streights in <hi>War,</hi> often vowed to sacrifice Humane Off-springs, which Vows they were obliged to performat their <hi>recovery</hi> or <hi>deliverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Custome, together with the Name of this God <hi>TARAMIS,</hi> was brought in by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who are described by <hi>Havillan</hi> the Poet, writing of their Race in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> That their <hi>Spectacula,</hi> or Publick Games, in Honour of their Gods, were <note place="margin">Hntillan.</note> the <hi>slaughter of Men,</hi> and not only so, but they drank their <hi>Blood.</hi> Neither did the <hi>Druids</hi> (who were otherwise men of civil and upright Conversation) alter these bloody Ceremonies, because it is to be supposed that they came out of <hi>Greece</hi> in those early daies, when the sacrificing of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> was also useful in that Nation.</p>
               <p>Another God they had named <hi>TUTATES,</hi> and him they had in especial Honour <note place="margin">TUTATES, <hi>viz.</hi> MERCURY.</note> above all the rest. He was esteemed the God of <hi>Travelling,</hi> and by the <hi>Britains</hi> may be supposed to be called <hi>Diw Caith,</hi> the <hi>God of Journeys,</hi> and the great Honour they gave him above all other Deities, is conjectured by some to be a sign of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> Peregrination from far Countries, and upon that account they so particularly honoured him as their <hi>Guide</hi> and <hi>Leader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>Livy</hi> he is called <hi>Mercurius Tutates,</hi> where he writes, That <hi>Scipio turned up to a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Livy.</note> 
                  <hi>Mount called Mercurius Tutates,</hi> by this it appears that the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> did cast up <hi>Mounts,</hi> and consecrated them to his Honour, especially where many waies met. Upon these ascents of Ground there was frequently erected a Statue of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which pointed out the different Waies, or if there was no Statue, yet the place was called a <hi>Mercury</hi> from the Advantage of ground, which gave them opportunity to discern out and discry to what parts the different waies would lead them. These places they called <hi>Mercuries</hi> sometimes with an addition of some other of his Names, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Village, Hill</hi> or <hi>River,</hi> adjoyning. But seeing in <hi>Livy</hi> the name <hi>Tutates</hi> is added to <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Hermes</hi> (for so he was called without doubt by the <hi>Druids</hi>) I am induced to believe that <hi>Tutates</hi> hath some other Original than <hi>Diw taith,</hi> or the God of <hi>Travelling,</hi> because it seems a kind of tautology to put two Names to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the same signification; This <hi>Tutates</hi> therefore is to be referred to the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician Ca-autus,</hi> according to <hi>Sanchoniathon,</hi> the most Ancient <hi>Phoenician,</hi> cited by <note place="margin">Sanchonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon <hi>cited by</hi> Philo Biblius, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Philo Biblius. Ta-autus,</hi> saith he, <hi>was the Son of</hi> Misor, <hi>he was the first Inventer of</hi> Letters.</p>
               <p>The <hi>AEgyptians</hi> called him <hi>Thoot,</hi> the <hi>Alexandrians, Thouth,</hi> the <hi>Greeks, Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercury.

So that we see here is two Inventions assigned to him, besides his office of <hi>Directing of Travellers,</hi> namely, the Invention of <hi>Letters</hi> and the <hi>Sickle.</hi> And seeing he was esteemed above all the rest of the <hi>Druids</hi> Gods, and had in more especial veneration and Honour, I am apt to believe it was rather upon these latter accounts than the former; For we find, that the first Inventers of useful Arts and Sciences (though they may seem never so mean and Mechanical) had their Names recorded to all Posterity, in grateful remembrance of the usefulness of the things they Invented, when the swelling Actions of Ambitious men, although they might seem great, and fill the World with more noise, are buried in the dust; and in perpetual oblivion.</p>
               <p>The Scripture it self takes notice of <hi>Tubal-Cain</hi> for his excellent skill and his first experiments upon <hi>Iron,</hi> and this <hi>Tubal</hi> is Recorded for his Invention of <hi>Musical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> when the Founders of great Kingdoms, and builders of famous Cities, were not so much as once mentioned.</p>
               <p>We read also, that when men have arrived to the greatest Empire, and have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Altars to be raised, and Sacrifices to be offered to themselves, although an Age or two, perhaps, in obsequious Flattery to them and their Successors, has performed it, yet we seldome read that they lasted above three or four Generations, when as the Inventers of Arts and Sciences have been Deified throughout all Ages, and their Altars extended as far as the Inventers themselves: Upon this, it seems to me more reasonable to ground the Name of <hi>TEUTATES,</hi> and the Honours performed to him in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> upon the account of his Invention of <hi>Letters,</hi> and the use of the <hi>Sickle,</hi> than upon the supposition of <hi>Diw Caith,</hi> the God of <hi>Travelling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Phoenicians</hi> who taught the <hi>Greeks</hi> the use of <hi>Letters,</hi> which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have learnt of this <hi>Theut,</hi> whom they delivered to them as a God or Divine Person, might also bring his Name into <hi>Britain</hi> to be worshipped; And this, I think, is the true Original of <hi>Teutates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for those who would have this <hi>Teutates</hi> to be the same with the <hi>German Tuisco;</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> from whence we call <hi>Mars</hi> his Day, <hi>Tuesday.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus. Livy.</note> But if we consider how, by <hi>Livy,</hi> he is called <hi>Mercury,</hi> they have no other ground for their Opinion, but only the like founding of part of the first syllable, and so they may easily be convinced.</p>
               <p>To this God <hi>MERCURY,</hi> there is no mention made what Sacrifices were offered to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> writes, that there were a great number of Statues erected in his Honour, and <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> that the Invention of all Arts and Sciences were attributed to him. That he was the Leader in all Journies, and Guide in all waies, and that he had moreover a wonderful efficacy for the promoting gain in Mony, or any Merchandize, a power no doubt highly esteemed of by the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MARS</hi> was worshipped by the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> under the Name of <hi>Hesus,</hi> and this <hi>Hesus</hi> we have proved to be of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Derivation, in another place, <note place="margin">HESUS.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. Hizzus,</hi> by which Name the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> as well as <hi>Britains</hi> called their <hi>Mars,</hi> so that there is no doubt to be made, from whence, and from whom this God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> saies, the <hi>Gauls</hi> attributed to this God the government of <hi>War;</hi> He was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">Caesar Com.</note> called <hi>Camolus</hi> or <hi>Camulus,</hi> signifying in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue a <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Governour.</hi> In an old Coyn of <hi>Cunobelinus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> reports he saw the <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> portraiture of an <hi>Head</hi> stamped, with an Helmet on it, also with a Spear, and these Letters, CAMU.</p>
               <p>From this <hi>Camulus</hi> came <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> or <hi>Mars. Hill,</hi> now <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Essex;</hi> And methinks the very name of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Dunum</hi> a <hi>Hill,</hi> are yet preserved in its Name.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Hesus, Mars</hi> or <hi>Camulus,</hi> I conjecture, was not only worshipped as the God of <hi>War</hi> but of <hi>Peace</hi> also: We find one Coyn with an Ear of Corn upon it, with these Letters <hi>CAMU,</hi> likewise a Tree, with I know not what Beast lying by it, with the same Inscription, and these both <hi>Cunobelins's</hi> Coyn, Prince of <hi>Camolodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> Besides, there was a little Altar cast out among Rubbish-stones, near <hi>Rible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> with this <hi>Roman</hi> Inscription;</p>

               </p>
               <p>This will give some light to what I have in another place written, of the Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption found in <hi>Zealand,</hi> namely,
<q>HERCULI MARCUSANO.</q>
                  <hi>HERCULES the Lord of the</hi> Cusites, <hi>viz.</hi> those of the <hi>Dorienses,</hi> that followed him out of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> into these Western Parts.</p>
               <p>But to come to <hi>HEUS;</hi> This name was given to <hi>Bacchus</hi> from one of those bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and loud Exclamations used at his solemn Feasts, namely, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which are all of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Derivation. <hi>hues,</hi> as <hi>Bochartus</hi> thinks, signifies <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> 
                  <hi>He is the Fire! Att-es, Thou art the Fire!</hi> for at his <hi>Orgia</hi> the People used, in his Honour, so to call him, for he was esteemed by the Ancients to be the Fire. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, was the term used by the Ancients in Exclamation to any that they found to be Drunk, and <hi>Saboi</hi> in the same <hi>Phoenician</hi> Dialect, proceeds from <hi>Saba, to be Drunk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From these different Roots many of <hi>Bacchus</hi> his Ancient names are derived, but it will be too long here to discourse of them all; It shall therefore suffice, that <hi>Heus</hi> here mentioned by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> in all probability was <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and introduced by his Country-men, the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> into this Island.</p>
               <p>We find in the Superstitions of the <hi>Britains,</hi> something very like unto <hi>Bacchus</hi> his <hi>Orgia,</hi> although the Name of the God be not put down by <hi>Pliny,</hi> where he saies, <hi>That the</hi> Britains <hi>dyed themselves like</hi> AEthiopians <hi>at some solemn Sacrifices, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their worship with Men and Women going naked.</hi> For this was the Custome of <note place="margin">Pliny:</note> the ancient Heathens, that at the publick Feast of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> having drank up a large quantity of Wine, and using many shrill and horrid Out cries, he was esteemed most Religious who could run about the maddest, insomuch as they tore their Cloaths from their backs, and not only so, but the weaker sort were oftentimes endangered in their Limbs. In this manner they ran promiscuously, Men and Women together, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and slashing each other till the heat of their Wine was allayed, either by loss of Blood, weariness, or want of sleep.</p>
               <p>Now, the reason of the <hi>Britains</hi> Painting themselves like <hi>AEthiopians</hi> at these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, might proceed from the imitation of <hi>Bacchus</hi> himself, who was feigned by the Ancients, to have maintained long Wars in <hi>India</hi> and <hi>AEthiopia,</hi> and was alwaies painted with a swarthy and black Complexion, and drawn with <hi>Tygres,</hi> Beasts very frequent in those hot Countries.</p>
               <p>As for that <hi>Heus,</hi> named by the Author of <hi>Queroli Anubis Latrans,</hi> viz. <hi>the barking Anubis,</hi> for as he was made in the form of a <hi>Dog,</hi> so he is to be referred to those deformed <hi>Spectres</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> mentioned by <hi>Gildas,</hi> who exceeded almost in <note place="margin">Gildas</note> number those of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and without doubt were derived from that Country by the <hi>Phoenicians;</hi> So that it being an <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Hieroglyphick in the shape of a <hi>Dog,</hi> might be called <hi>Huad,</hi> or something like it, <hi>Huad</hi> signifying in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, <hi>a Dog,</hi> but as for <hi>Hesus,</hi> the name of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Hues,</hi> of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> they have no reference at all to it, but were general Gods both to <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> and were the <hi>Hizzus</hi> and <hi>Hues</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> whereas these sorts of deformed <hi>Spectres</hi> were found only upon the Walls of Cities, according to <hi>Gildas,</hi> and it may be in some particular places only, and had the Tuition of such Cities and Towns, according to the Superstition of the <hi>AEgyptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the God <hi>Hues</hi> or <hi>Bacchus,</hi> I suppose those <hi>Priests</hi> mentioned by <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Marcellinus;</note> and called <hi>Euuges,</hi> or <hi>Eubages,</hi> are to be referred, for, as the Acclamations from whence <hi>Bacchus</hi> received that Name, was <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>These Magnificent Inscriptions to <hi>BELATUCADRUS Deo &amp; Deo sancto,</hi> as likewise the distance of places these Altars were found in, proves, that he was not a particular Tutelar God, but rather that he was worshipped over the whole Island, and was that <hi>Belinus,</hi> or <hi>Belis,</hi> to which the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> were much devoted, who was the very same with <hi>Belus</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> but what the addition of <hi>atucadrus</hi> may signifie, I will lay down some conjectures.</p>
               <p>We must know that <hi>Bel,</hi> or <hi>Belus,</hi> was the God of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and from that Country brought into <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and there Idolized. Now the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> who called <hi>Assyria Atur,</hi> and the <hi>Sun Cares,</hi> why may not <hi>Belatucadrus</hi> be as much as <hi>Bel-atur-Cares,</hi> signifying, <hi>APOLLO the Lord of the Assyrians,</hi> for I have shewn before that <hi>Bel</hi> was <hi>Apollo,</hi> or the <hi>Sun,</hi> in those Nations. As for <hi>D</hi> in the last syllable, it is not much to be regarded, because the mollifying of words is often set before <hi>R;</hi> Probably <hi>Bel-atu-cadrus</hi> might be <hi>Bel-attir-cares,</hi> or <hi>Apollo</hi> the Ancient <hi>Bel,</hi> for in reality there were two <hi>BELS,</hi> the <hi>Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Tyrian.</hi> To the latter of which the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> attributed all the famous Actions of the other, and upon that vanity might call him the <hi>Ancient;</hi> or perhaps he might be called <hi>Belatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadrus</hi> from <hi>Bel-hoddu-cadar, viz. BEL of the black Indians,</hi> for <hi>Cadar</hi> signifies in that Dialect to be made <hi>black</hi> by the heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Hoddu</hi> is an <hi>Indian,</hi> or perhaps it might come from <hi>Bel-Atur-Cadar,</hi> for the <hi>Assyrians</hi> were of a <hi>Swarthy Complexion,</hi> to which Colour also <hi>Cadar</hi> is referred, and is the same with <hi>Hazle</hi> in the <hi>French,</hi> namely <hi>Sun-burnt</hi> or <hi>Tann'd,</hi> from which <hi>Cadar</hi> the <hi>Arabians</hi> called <hi>Kadareni,</hi> a Nation of the <hi>Saracens</hi> had its name.</p>
               <p>But I cannot imagine, how this <hi>Belatucadrus</hi> of the <hi>Britains</hi> could be a particular God, as some would have him, unless we derive the last part of his Name from <hi>Gadir,</hi> signifying an <hi>Uttermost bound,</hi> so that he was placed as <hi>Terminus</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon the <hi>Limits</hi> of grounds, and his Office to decide and determine all Controversies arising upon those accounts, as the peculiar Overseer of Land-marks, but I think some of the forementioned Conjectures are more reasonably to be heeded.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:58825:74"/>
               <p>Seeing I have entered so far into the Derivation of <hi>BELATUCADRUS,</hi> and the last part of it <hi>Cadrus,</hi> I will take notice of two other Inscriptions, that possibly may have some relation to this God; They were drawn out of the River at <hi>Risingham</hi> in <hi>Northumberland.</hi> The first had in it, DEO MOGONTI CAD; the second, DEO MOUNO CAD, and may be seen at large in Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> who reports that the Inhabitants have a Tradition, That a God <hi>MAGON</hi> made good this place (against a <hi>Soldain,</hi> or Heathenish Prince) for a long time. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions are <hi>Roman,</hi> but the God is <hi>British,</hi> for I have shewn that the <hi>Romans</hi> worshipt the Gods of the Nations they conquered.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> makes this a Tutelar God, and interprets CAD, <hi>Cadenorum,</hi> the Protectour of the <hi>Cadeni,</hi> but it seems the People were called <hi>Gadeni,</hi> so that it should be <hi>Gad</hi> not <hi>Gad,</hi> but granting time might make this small alteration, yet we find not in other Inscriptions to the Tutelar Genius's of particular places, that the name of the Place is signified in any, neither was it reasonable it should, being that such Altars were made for private use only, and needed no Inscription to signifie what they were.</p>
               <p>In my opinion the signification of these Inscriptions are to be sought further. The God <hi>Magon</hi> or <hi>Mogon,</hi> to whom these Altars were erected, seems to be brought into <hi>Britain</hi> by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and in all probability may be the God of the <hi>Canaanites, Baal-Magon,</hi> the Lord <hi>Magon;</hi> For as from <hi>Dag,</hi> a Fish, they made their Idol <hi>Dagon,</hi> so this Idol of the <hi>Sun,</hi> from the melting quality that Planet hath, might from <hi>Mag</hi> (which signifies <hi>to melt</hi>) be called <hi>Magon,</hi> and that this <hi>Magon</hi> the <hi>British</hi> God was the <hi>Sun,</hi> and so consequently of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Original this addition of <hi>Cad</hi> seems to verifie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Assyrians</hi> (from whom the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had his name <hi>Belus</hi> also) called the Sun, according to <hi>Macrobius, Cad,</hi> and <hi>Cadcad,</hi> by duplication, and <hi>Macrobius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Saturnal. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. c. 31.</note> saies, that the interpretation of his name signifies, <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Only,</hi> and <hi>Cad</hi> in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> and <hi>Syrian</hi> Tongue signifies <hi>One;</hi> And this Attribute they gave to him, because (as the same Author reports) he was the greatest and almost the only God, and all the rest accounted but his Assisters and Coadjutors.</p>
               <p>In the Inscription,
<q>DEO MOUNO CAD,</q>
                  <hi>MOUNO</hi> is the same in Greek as <hi>CAD</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Dialect, <hi>viz.</hi> the <note place="margin">

               <p>To <hi>Agli-Belus,</hi> and <hi>Malach-Belus, Native</hi> or <hi>Country Gods,</hi> that is, as some interpret <note place="margin">The Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> it, <hi>To the Winter, and Summer Sun;</hi> for upon the Marble on which this Inscription was found, He was both waies represented, but the <hi>Britains</hi> represented him with a <hi>Harp,</hi> as may be seen in an Ancient Coyn of <hi>Cunobelinus,</hi> and without question had all the opinions of him, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> had.</p>
               <p>That this was a God greatly reverenced in <hi>Britain,</hi> we may gather from <hi>Cunobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> and <hi>Cassobelinus,</hi> two great Princes who bear his Name; and as in the Eastern Countries it was esteemed a great Honour to be descended of him; so a Poet in the commendation of a Bowl, saies,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>— Belus, &amp; omnes</l>
                  <l>A Belo — —</l>
               </lg>
               <p>That it was the Cup of <hi>BELUS,</hi> and his Race, so undoubtedly many Princes in <hi>Britain</hi> esteemed it an Honour to be called by his Name.</p>
               <p>We will see therefore what is the meaning of <hi>CUNO,</hi> for it is no more the part of <hi>Cunobelinus,</hi> than <hi>CASSI</hi> is of <hi>Cassibelinus,</hi> who, by <hi>Ninnius</hi> the <hi>Britain,</hi> is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ninnius</hi> the Britain.</note> called simply <hi>Bellinus,</hi> and by <hi>Dio, Suellan</hi> for <hi>Vellan,</hi> or <hi>Mellin,</hi> which are all corruptions of <hi>Belin,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> himself confesseth. <hi>Cuno</hi> therefore being not part of the Name, but in all likelyhood some Honourable Office or Title of this Prince, let us see what it might signifie among the <hi>Britains,</hi> for seeing this God came from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> why might not this Title of <hi>Cuno</hi> also be derived from them.</p>
               <p>Upon this we may suppose, that <hi>Cuno Belinus</hi> might be as much as <hi>Cohen Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Belinus,</hi> according to that saying
<q>Rex idem Hominum <hi>Phoebique</hi> Sacerdos;</q>
The <hi>Priest-hood</hi> in those daies being worn by the greatest Princes, so that <hi>Cuno</hi> might become (upon that account) an Honorable title, as worn by several Kings, as <hi>Cuneglasus, Cunedaglus, Cungetorir,</hi> the last signifying a <hi>High Priest,</hi> as likewise <hi>Hanibal, Asdrubal,</hi> and <hi>Maharbal,</hi> of the same signification among the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all these Names might have very easie Interpretations relating to this way (were it not too far beyond my purpose) likewise <hi>Cuno Belinus,</hi> may signifie the <hi>Son of Belinus,</hi> for <hi>Cuno</hi> signifies <hi>born</hi> or <hi>begotten.</hi> And as the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> esteemed it their highest Honour and Credit of their Princes to be derived from <hi>Bel,</hi> why may not the Old <hi>Britains</hi> desire to initiate them in this, so that all the significations of <hi>Cuno,</hi> mentioned by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> may very rationally relate to this Original.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Belinus</hi> or <hi>APOLLO,</hi> he is called by the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Yellow,</hi> and from hence, possibly, <hi>Belinus</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Language might come to signifie that Colour, but that the colour <hi>Belinus</hi> should give name to this God, as Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> supposes, is impossible, for these following Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because he is called <hi>Belis</hi> as well as <hi>Belinus,</hi> but the Colour <hi>Belinus</hi> (in all its corruptions) retains the N, as <hi>Belyn, Melyn, Felyn, Villan</hi> and <hi>Suellan.</hi> To speak the truth, <hi>Melinus,</hi> not <hi>Belinus,</hi> is the proper name for <hi>Yellow,</hi> the word of which Colour was also taken from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Melinus</hi> cannot be imagined to give name to <hi>Cuno Belinus,</hi> who lived in the daies of <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when <hi>Caesar</hi> had only visited this Island, and no <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies had been planted here to change the <hi>British</hi> Language. And here I will take notice, that <hi>Dio</hi> calls <hi>Cassobelinus, Suellan,</hi> which <hi>Suellan</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> derives from <hi>Gweliw,</hi> signifying a <hi>waterish</hi> Colour, not a <hi>yellow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such confusion hath the Suppositions of divers coloured <hi>Paintings,</hi> among the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> created.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:58825:75"/>
               <p n="2">2. In all Inscriptions of this God we find him written BEL, not <hi>Fel, Vel,</hi> or <note place="margin">R. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Mel,</hi> which might have happened, had he received his Name from that Colour. Besides, in all the Additions to his name this Colour is absolutely excluded, as he was entituled <hi>Belsamen</hi> by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> that is, <hi>Lord of Heaven;</hi> so possibly in <hi>Britain,</hi> for his Sister the Moon was called <hi>Belisama,</hi> as much as to say, <hi>Queen of Heaven;</hi> Not <hi>yellow Heaven,</hi> or <hi>yellow Moon,</hi> which is very absurd, but it might happen, that <hi>Dio</hi> not knowing the Original of this God <hi>Belinus,</hi> and knowing that <hi>Belinus</hi> signified <hi>Yellow,</hi> might mistake, and call <hi>Casso Belinus Suellan</hi> for <hi>Belin,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating <note place="margin">Dio. Cass</note> thereby a Colour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and lastly, As I have shewn before, the <hi>Britains</hi> did not use so many Colours, but were called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the variety of Shapes, not Colours; and <note place="margin">R. 3.</note> such as have sought for this Invention in the <hi>Britains,</hi> have made the same Princes of divers Colours. Thus <hi>Gildas</hi> calls <hi>Cuneglasus,</hi> a <hi>tawny</hi> and <hi>dark hu'd Butcher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> makes him <hi>blew;</hi> but to pass over many great Contradictions, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <note place="margin">Gildas. Cambden</note> that it happened by chance that this colour coincidated with the name of the God <hi>Belinus,</hi> but concludes no more that he received his name from <hi>Yellow,</hi> than the God to whom the Inscription DUJ was found in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> received his from <hi>Dû</hi> Black, in the same Tongue; so that <hi>Cunobelinus</hi> had his Name from the worship of <hi>Belinus</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in one place grants) and <hi>Belinus</hi> is derived from <hi>Bel</hi> of the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To omit an <hi>AEstuarium</hi> or Frith in <hi>Britain,</hi> called <hi>Belisama</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> possibly <note place="margin">Ptolomy.</note> from some Temple of that God, I shall prove it from the Moon worshipt in <hi>Gaul</hi> under the name of <hi>Belisama,</hi> as is gathered from an ancient Inscription,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>MINERVAE</l>
                  <l>BELISAMAE</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Found on an old Stone in <hi>Aquitain,</hi> by which some have concluded that <hi>Belisama</hi> was the <hi>Gaulish</hi> name of <hi>Minerva;</hi> But seeing that <hi>Belisama</hi> is the same as <hi>Belsamen,</hi> this being the Lord, and that the Lady of Heaven, it is more probable that by this is meant the <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Urania,</hi> called by the <hi>Canaanites</hi> the Queen of Heaven, and once a great Idol of the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>DIANA,</hi> who is the same with the <hi>Moon,</hi> was much worshipt in those parts, as <hi>Poliaenus</hi> testifies, <hi>Camma</hi> (saies he) <hi>was a Votress of</hi> Diana, <hi>whom the</hi> Gauls <hi>most</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>DIANA,</hi> viz. the Moon. <hi>Poliaenus,</hi> lib. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>especially honoured,</hi> but that <hi>Diana</hi> should be confounded with <hi>Minerva</hi> is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if it be considered how frequent it was for the Ancients to bestow the Attribute of one Deity upon another, as they favoured them in honour and affection.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Diana</hi> was worshipt in <hi>Britain</hi> is very certain, an Image of hers, <hi>Anno</hi> 1602, was dug out of the ground in <hi>Monmouthshire,</hi> being girt about, and short truss'd, bearing a Quiver, but her Head, Hands, and Feet, were broken off. It was found upon a pavement of square Tile in Checker-work, and by an Inscription not far off it was found to be her own Image.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> gives many Reasons, That where the Reliques of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church standeth, there was formerly a Temple of hers. But because this may proceed from the <hi>Romans</hi> rather than <hi>Britains,</hi> I will only mention her name <hi>Ardurena</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doena,</hi> being the same in the <hi>Gaulish,</hi> as <hi>Nemorensis</hi> in the Latin Tongue, namely, <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Woods</hi> or <hi>Mountains,</hi> for we may suppose <hi>Den</hi> to have signified in the Ancient <hi>British</hi> Tongue, a <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Mountain</hi> (as <hi>Den</hi> Forrest in <hi>England</hi>) and not <hi>Arden</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> would have it, for <hi>Ar</hi> signifies <hi>Upon</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, so that <hi>Arden,</hi> is, <hi>upon a Wood;</hi> For although there be a great Wood in <hi>France</hi> called <hi>Arden,</hi> yet it is not unlikely but it might first have been called <hi>Den,</hi> and that the Provinces lying on it, <hi>Arden,</hi> and afterwards the Wood it self; for it runs out to such a vast extent, and takes up such a quantity of ground, and lies upon so many Countries, that Travellers may be said to be alwaies upon it, but never truly in it, or well out of it.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:58825:76"/>
               <p>But to return to <hi>DIANA,</hi> the <hi>Britains,</hi> no doubt, were great admirers of her, for their Habitations were most in the Woods. Hunting was their chiefest Recreation, having most excellent Dogs for that purpose, as <hi>Strabo</hi> witnesseth, and Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> takes notice; that Dogs called <hi>Agasaei</hi> by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and so much praised and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them, were of the <hi>British</hi> Race, and to this day are called by us <hi>Gase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds.</hi>

                  <hi>ONVANA,</hi> a Goddess of the <hi>Gauls</hi> is supposed to be <hi>MINERVA,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ONVANA, <hi>or,</hi> MINERVA. Stephanus.</note> whom <hi>Caesar</hi> accounts one of them, and very probable it may be so, for <hi>Minerva</hi> by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> was called <hi>Onca</hi> and <hi>Onga,</hi> as in <hi>Stephanus.</hi> Now changing the <hi>G</hi> into a <hi>V,</hi> as <hi>Walls</hi> for <hi>Gauls,</hi> or <hi>wave</hi> in English, <hi>wage</hi> in High and Low Dutch and French, and we have this very <hi>Phoenician</hi> name of <hi>Minerva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Minerva</hi> was much worshipt in <hi>Britain,</hi> and where the Cathedral Church of <hi>Bath</hi> now stands, there was a Temple erected to her Honour, but whether ever worshipt by the name of <hi>Onvana</hi> I know not, but if that name be allowed to be <hi>Phoenician</hi> then there is no doubt of it. I dare not be too bold as from her name <hi>Onca,</hi> to derive the famous Hill <hi>Badonicus,</hi> as much as to say <hi>Bath-Onca,</hi> the Temple of <hi>Onca,</hi> although this Mountain be not far from the City, and alwaies written <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donicus,</hi> not <hi>Badon</hi> or <hi>Badonis,</hi> which, in my judgment, is an Argument it might be once <hi>Badoncus,</hi> and corruptedly made an Adjective, but however it be she was the Patroness of the Baths, and upon this account was the City <hi>Bath</hi> called by the Ancient <hi>Britains Caer Palladur,</hi> or the City of <hi>Pallace</hi> or <hi>Minerva's Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Goddess the <hi>Britains</hi> had, called <hi>ANDRASTE</hi> by <hi>Dio,</hi> and in <note place="margin">ANDRASTE</note> another place of the same Author, <hi>Andrate,</hi> although corruptly for <hi>Andraste</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draste,</hi> for so by some it is read.</p>
               <p>This was the Goddess of <hi>Victory,</hi> that British <hi>Amazon Boodicia</hi> called upon, after her great Victories over the <hi>Romans,</hi> having destroyed 80000 of them; Her words were these, <hi>I yeild Thee thanks O</hi> Adraste, <hi>and being a Woman, I call upon thee O Woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> made great enquiry after her Name in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, but could find nothing (which related to her being a <hi>Goddess of Victory</hi>) but <hi>Anaraith,</hi> signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great <hi>Overthrow;</hi> but I think this will hardly derive her Name. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider therefore what Goddess she was, that so we may the easier arrive to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it.</p>
               <p>She was supposed by many to be <hi>VENUS,</hi> but then the question will arise, which way she could be the Goddess of <hi>Victory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pausanias</hi> writes, That the <hi>Cytheraei</hi> (taught by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi>) worshipt <hi>Venus</hi> Armed, and esteemed her the <hi>Goddess of War,</hi> and the <hi>Cyprians</hi> (taught by the same <note place="margin">Pausanias.</note> 
                  <hi>Phoenicians</hi>) made her with a <hi>Spear</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The Spear called <hi>Hastata.</hi>
                  </note>; the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> set up her Statue in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; <hi>Ausonius,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Armatam vidit Venerem</hi> Lacedaemone <hi>Pallas.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ausonius.</note>
                  </q>
The <hi>Romans</hi> had a Temple of <hi>Venus Victrix,</hi> or the Conquerour, the same as <hi>Victorii</hi> of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and at the Dedication of this Temple twenty <hi>Elephants</hi> fought in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tully</hi> de nat. Deor.</note> the <hi>Circus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, let us take the <hi>Phoenician</hi> name of <hi>Venus,</hi> and we shall find it not to differ much from <hi>Adraste</hi> of the <hi>Britains,</hi> viz. <hi>Astrate,</hi> by which name <hi>Cicero</hi> also calls <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> Her.</p>
               <p>This Goddess had a Temple at <hi>Camalodunum</hi> or <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> and before the destruction of that Colony by <hi>Boadicia. Tacitus</hi> writes thus, <hi>That the Statue of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> 
                  <hi>Victory at</hi> Camalodunum, <hi>of it self fell down and was turned backwards, as if it yielded to the Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seems the Goddess favoured the <hi>Britains,</hi> although forceably detained by the <hi>Romans,</hi> for in those daies they had a Custome of chayning the Statues of Captive Gods, and so forced them to their Protection.</p>
               <p>To this Goddess <hi>Nero</hi> for a long time was strangly devoted, but it seems, finding her extreamly dull and stupid, upon a sudden humour he made a <hi>Pissing-block</hi> of her, first profaning Her himself, and then leaving her to all Passengers; to be affronted by his Example.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:58825:76"/>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> had Her in great veneration, they sacrificed to her in Temples and in Groves, which were called by her Name the <hi>Groves of Andate.</hi> Here, in a most savage and horrid manner they sacrificed Prisoners alive, spending the time in Feasts and Banquets.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Astrate</hi> some refer the <hi>Saxon</hi> Goddess <hi>Eoaster,</hi> and there are many Towns in <hi>England</hi> bearing Her name, as <hi>High Easter, Good Easter,</hi> and <hi>Easter-Ford</hi> in the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> but whether so called by the <hi>Britains</hi> or <hi>Saxons,</hi> I am not able to say; But it may not be a wonder that <hi>Astarte,</hi> a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Goddess, was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in <hi>Germany,</hi> seeing that part of the <hi>Swedes</hi> sacrificed to <hi>IRIS,</hi> a known Idol of the <hi>AEgyptians;</hi> but of this I shall have occasion to speak further in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Idolatries.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have treated of the chief and general GODS of the <hi>Druids,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <note place="margin">Caesar. Com.</note> by <hi>Caesar,</hi> namely, <hi>Mercury, Apollo, Mars, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Minerva,</hi> to which are added <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Adraste, Diana</hi> or <hi>Belisama.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very much to be observed, that the <hi>Druids</hi> attributed the very same Offices to these Gods, as had been formerly given him in <hi>Greece,</hi> which will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we compare the opinions the <hi>Greeks</hi> had of them, with those of the <hi>Druids;</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Apollo, Alexiacus,</hi> because he dispelled Diseases; <hi>Minerva, Tala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergos,</hi> because she was the teacher and performer of curious Works; <hi>Jupiter, Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> from his governing the Heavens; <hi>Mars, Polemistes,</hi> by reason he presided in War.</p>
               <p>The very same sentiments had the <hi>Druids</hi> of them; I will put down the words of <hi>Caesar. The</hi> Druids <hi>believe</hi> APOLLO <hi>the expeller of Diseases;</hi> that, MINERVA <hi>taught the first rudiments of Arts and curious Works,</hi> and although this was attributed to <hi>Mercury</hi> also, yet he had other Employments; He was the Guide of Waies and Journies, and had great power attributed to him in procuring gain in Mony and Merchandice. MARS <hi>was their God of War, and</hi> JUPITER <hi>had the Empire of Heaven;</hi> So that we see all these GODS, <hi>Belinus, Onva, Taramis, Hesus, Teutates,</hi> though they came into <hi>Britain</hi> from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Original, yet the Greek <hi>Druids</hi> gave them many and particular Titles of their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I will take notice here of what <hi>Strabo</hi> writes in his fourth Book, where <hi>Artemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> affirms, That in an Island near <hi>Britain, CERES</hi> and <hi>PROSERPINA</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">CERES, <hi>and</hi> PROSER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PINA. Strabo, <hi>lib. 4.</hi>
                  </note> were worshipped with the same Rites and Ceremonies as in <hi>Samothrace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I have shewn, that in the daies of <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> who writ under <hi>Ptolemaeus Lathyrus,</hi> none of the <hi>Greeks</hi> had entered this Island; It remains therefore, that <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proserpina,</hi> and the Rites and Ceremonies performed to them were brought hither by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> from whom the <hi>Samothracians</hi> themselves had learned them; to evidence which, I will shew <hi>1. What these Gods were; 2. What Ceremonies were used in their Worship;</hi> and Lastly, <hi>What Island this might be;</hi> to which I will add and shew, That in all probability they were worshipped in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> also, and that in this sence, this Island might be called the <hi>Seat of Queen</hi> CERES.</p>
               <p>The Worship the <hi>Samothracians</hi> received from the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> were the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Cabiri,</hi> which <hi>Cabiri</hi> it seems were in a <hi>British</hi> Island also. The <hi>Cabiri</hi> (in another place) I have shewn to signifie as much as <hi>Powerful Gods.</hi> Now what these GODS were I will also shew out of Learned <hi>Bochartus,</hi> who has proved <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> them to be of <hi>Phoenician</hi> Derivation; as first,</p>

               <p>And for those <hi>Phoenician</hi> names of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proserpina,</hi> time hath quite worn them out in <hi>Britain,</hi> the names of their <hi>Priests</hi> only are remaining; <hi>Cohen</hi> signifies a <hi>Priest,</hi> and the soeminine <hi>Coena,</hi> a <hi>holy Votary</hi> in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue, and from this Root proceeds <hi>Coies</hi> or <hi>Coes,</hi> a Priest of the <hi>Cabiri;</hi> from hence came an Heathenish Priest in <hi>Britain</hi> called <hi>Coi-fy,</hi> as I have shewn in another place.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Mela.</note> writes, That in <hi>Gaul,</hi> religious Women attending upon a certain God (for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serpina</hi> and <hi>Pluto</hi> were promiscuously used) were called <hi>Cenae</hi> not <hi>Lenae,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> would have it. Without doubt this God or Goddess was <hi>Proserpina</hi> or <hi>Pluto,</hi> for their Priests we find to be called <hi>Coenae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Island mentioned by <hi>Strabo,</hi> where these Rites were performed to <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proserpina</hi> after the <hi>Samothracian</hi> or <hi>Phoenician</hi> Custome, in all probability was the <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> 
                  <hi>Sayn</hi> lying upon <hi>Armorica,</hi> anciently called <hi>Sena,</hi> and possibly from these, <hi>Coenae,</hi> but the Devotresses themselves were not called <hi>Senae,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> writes, but <hi>Coenae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The worship of the <hi>Cabiri</hi> was performed in this Island by these Women, being Nine in number, according to <hi>Mela,</hi> and here was an Oracle according to the same Author.</p>
               <p>This is all I can gather of these sort of People about <hi>Britain,</hi> but it is to be judged, as <hi>Proserpina</hi> and <hi>Pluto,</hi> had the same names, so they might very well have the same worship; and seeing they were worshipt here as the <hi>Cabiri</hi> in <hi>Samothra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> it will not be amiss to put down some material particulars of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>They were called <hi>Sacred Mysteries,</hi> and I have shewn before, that many Great persons had been initiated in them, accounting the Ceremonies of these <hi>Cabiri</hi> to be of great Holiness, and wonderful Power to protect them against any Dangers.</p>
               <p>The words used at the solemn performance of these Rites were in an unknown Tongue, and mystical <hi>Circumlocutions,</hi> from whence, I suppose, our word to <hi>Gaber,</hi> and <hi>Gaberish</hi> might proceed.</p>
               <p>I will add, that the Statues or Effigies of these Gods were made in ridiculous <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> postures, like to the Statues of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> which made <hi>Cambises,</hi> when he entred his Temple at <hi>Memphis,</hi> instead of being devout, he burst out in laughter at the strange posture he was carved in. And the same <hi>Cambises,</hi> when he entred the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of the <hi>Cabiri,</hi> to which none but Priests were admitted (in the burning of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fanum,</hi> a place of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> their Statues) he would not refrain from Jesting, seeing in what Antick manner they were represented. Hence it proceeded, that the <hi>Jews</hi> called a <hi>Bussoon,</hi> or a Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Fellow, <hi>Samodracos,</hi> as much as one of the <hi>Samothracian</hi> Gods: That these sorts of Ridiculous Spectres were worshipped in <hi>Britain,</hi> I have shewn out of <hi>Gildas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Gauls</hi> referred their Original to <hi>PLUTO; Caesar</hi> calls him <hi>Dispater,</hi> and <note place="margin">Caesar Com. Bochartus.</note> 
                  <hi>Bochartus</hi> thinks him to be <hi>Diespiter,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> to this day when they affirm any thing, say, <hi>Ouy Dea,</hi> from the <hi>Greeks</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There was an Altar found at <hi>Gretland</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> with this Inscription, D U J, without any particular name of a God joyned to it, so that whether this might be <hi>Pluto</hi> or no, I am not able to say, although by a general name calling him God, not particularizing him, they might seem to mean <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>Pluto</hi> and <hi>Proserpina,</hi> I suppose the Nocturnal Sacrifices of the <hi>Britains</hi> were performed, but especially upon the encrease of the Moon, when she was six daies old. In these Night Solemnities, the Heathens committed very strange and horrid Villanies; The Blood of Sacrifices, mixt with Wine and Milk, they poured on the ground to these Infernal Deities, and made Merriments with the Flesh and remaining Wine, provoking one another to horrid Lusts, and unnatural Incests.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58825:77"/>
This might be the cause that the <hi>Britains,</hi> by the frequent use of these Sacrifices, might esteem it at length no crime at all, although Fathers with Sons, and Brothers with Brothers, promiscuously joyned in the use of one Woman, a Custome (by <hi>Caesars</hi> reports) was very frequent and common among them. <note place="margin">Caesar.

               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> had, besides their great Gods, other particular Deities or Genius's, and Tutelar Gods of private Places, as <hi>Viterinus, Verbeia, &amp;c.</hi> some being called by the names of <hi>Springs,</hi> others <hi>Mountains</hi> and <hi>Groves,</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> and to all these the <hi>Britains</hi> used to sacrifice.</p>
               <p>No doubt but their Idolatry was as various as other Nations, but I will not treat of any but what may be derived from the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> or <hi>Graecians,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially such as do most prove the Antiquity of those Nations in <hi>Britain.</hi> When the <hi>Romans</hi> entred this Land, a way was cut open for all the Luxurious Pomp and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Gods of <hi>Rome,</hi> as shall be shewn in its proper place.</p>
               <p>Considering thus much, I will conclude the <hi>British</hi> Idolatry with the Life of <hi>OGMIUS,</hi> or the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Hercules, who was worshipped in these parts, partly because this Hero or Worthy, has many remarkable things in his story, and partly, because herein will be manifest the Artifice and vanity of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the Actions of Great Men to some of their own Country, but more especially, because hereby will clearly and evidently appear, the first progress of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Colonies, which, in time, grew to be of so large an extent, and so exceeding nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, that there were few Countries of the then known World, to which, by their great skill in Navigation, and wonderful propensity to Trade, they had not an easie and frequent access unto.</p>
               <p>In writing his Life, I have curiously avoided on the one hand, least I should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found his History with the fabulous Reports of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who made forty three Hero's of this name (as <hi>Varro</hi> reports) and so make him a sharer only in their Actions, On the other side, I have studiously heeded, least I should depress his Honour with the great load of those Actions the Ancients attributed to the same Name, but to different Persons. I am perswaded, that his Credit was so great in the World in these primitive Ages, upon the account of his many Voyages, that there were few who desired not to be called by his Name. The <hi>Graecians</hi> esteemed it the greatest Honour they could give to their Hero's, if they attributed the Title of <hi>HERCU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LES</hi> to them, so that in reading his Life, if we meet with strange and incredible Monsters destroyed, vast Giants and great Nations subdued in a moment by his Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess, we are to bewail the calamity of those Times, who never thought they advanced the Dignity of them they undertook to praise sufficiently, unless they stretcht their Atchievments beyond a just proportion, and advanced them to the levels of Gods and not Men.</p>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF THE Phoenician Hercules, AN HERO.</head>
                  <p>THIS <hi>Hercules</hi> was the Son of <hi>Demarus</hi> King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> as his Name <hi>MELICARTUS</hi> signifies, namely, <hi>King of the City,</hi> for so the <note place="margin">Philo Biblius, <hi>ex</hi> Sanch.</note> 
                     <hi>Phoenicians</hi> called <hi>Tyre.</hi> The <hi>Amathusians,</hi> who descended of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> named him simply <hi>MALIGA, The King.</hi> He was called by the <hi>Greeks Mánners,</hi> from the <hi>Phoenician Machario,</hi> signifying <hi>Terrible.</hi> From his admirable skill in Navigations the <hi>Graecians</hi> made him the God of the <hi>Sea,</hi> but feigned him to be the Grand-son of <hi>Cadmus,</hi> calling him <hi>Palaemon,</hi> and having modelled him according to their own Fancies, they gave him a numerous Off-spring. But from <hi>Cadmus</hi> to the <hi>Theban</hi> Hercules are numbred Ten Generations, all which time is far inferiour to this <hi>Hercules,</hi> who, by many, is supposed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with <hi>Moses,</hi> and to have flourisht in the daies of <hi>Josbuah,</hi> when the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> expelled the <hi>Canaanites</hi> from their Land, part of them flying into <hi>Boetia,</hi> part into <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> This is manifest out of two Pillars found in the Kingdom of <hi>Tangeir,</hi> upon the Streights, with a <hi>Phoenician</hi> Inscription,</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>WE FLY FROM THE <note place="margin">Procop. <hi>Van. lib. 4.</hi>
                        </note>
                     </l>
                     <l>FACE OF JOSHUA THE</l>

                     <l>ROBBER.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>By this it appears, that in those daies the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> began to frequent those Parts. And although the <hi>Greeks</hi> do attribute these Voyages to their <hi>Hercules,</hi> yet the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Streights, dedicated to that God, manifestly proves him to have been a <hi>Phoenician,</hi> for he was worshipt according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and not <hi>Graecians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Temple is said to be built by the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> and magnificent Sacrifices perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him after the manner of that Nation. <hi>Strabo</hi> is particular upon what ground <note place="margin">Strabo: Applanus. Diodorus. Arrianus. Philostratus.</note> it was built, and the occasion which moved the <hi>Tyrians</hi> to the Work, all which may be read in that Author.</p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:58825:79"/>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>HERCULES;</hi> Leaving his own Country, and being attended with a multitude, who were forced to the same necessity, he coasted about <hi>Spain</hi> and <note place="margin">AEschylus. Strabo. Dionysius, &amp; <hi>alii.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Africa,</hi> and by the care and diligence of his Followers he built many Towns and Cities, conquering all <hi>Iberia,</hi> and those Western Tracts, is said at last to come into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and there built <hi>Alesia</hi> and <hi>Nemausus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a Battle against the <hi>Ligurians,</hi> and their two Leaders, <hi>Bergion</hi> and <hi>Albion,</hi> or as others say, <hi>Alebion</hi> and <hi>Dercynus;</hi> when he had no other Weapons left him, they feign'd it rained Stones from Heaven in his favour, and that all the fields were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them. The occasion of this Fable is the multitude of Stones lying scatter'd between <hi>Arelate</hi> and <hi>Massilia,</hi> which to this day is called <hi>La Crau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is said also to have passed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> but this is looked upon by <hi>Livy</hi> as a Fable also; for the truth is, it is not probable that his occasions would permit him to make too great Inroads into the Continent, but by far likelyer, that he contented himself with possessing the Sea-coasts, the Ports and Havens of those Countries to which he arrived. In <hi>Liguria</hi> there is a Haven that bore his Name, at this day it is known by the name of <hi>Monaco,</hi> and was anciently called <hi>Herculis Monaeci Portus,</hi> the Haven of <hi>Hercules Monaecus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At his first Landing the <hi>Ligurians</hi> opposed him, and of this Fight not only the Poets and Historians make mention, but the Astronomers also, and they do not only mention it, but add, that the Remembrance of it is placed in the Heavens, in the Sign which <hi>Firmicus</hi> calls <hi>Ingeniculum,</hi> or the bending of the Knee, for by weariness in the fight <hi>Hercules</hi> it seems was reduced to that posture, and so placed in the Heavens. <note place="margin">Firmicus.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have attended <hi>HERCULES</hi> in his Voyages within the Streights, I shall now follow him into the Western Sea, and that upon the Authority of <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Marcellinus <hi>upon</hi> Timagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> who recites <hi>Timagines</hi> for his Author, <hi>viz. That the</hi> Dorienses <hi>followed the Ancient</hi> Hercules, <hi>to inhabit the Sea-coasts of</hi> Gaul, <hi>lying upon the Ocean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us see now by what Circumstances <hi>Marcellinus</hi> writes this Voyage of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> that the truth of it may more evidently appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> He complains of all former Writers, <hi>Timagines</hi> only excepted, namely, that in their Histories of <hi>Gaul</hi> they had delivered down things by halves only, and so had given the World a very slender, or little or no account of the Original of that Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He applauds <hi>Timagines</hi> for his diligence in searching out those things which were unknown to other Authors, and that he did it out of many Records.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> and lastly, He promises out of <hi>Timagines,</hi> to report the truth clearly and distinctly.</p>
                  <p>Now, these Records that this <hi>Timagines</hi> searcht into were in all probability <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi> or <hi>Syrian,</hi> and for that very reason unknown to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> for this <hi>Timagines</hi> (as <hi>Bochartus</hi> proves) was a <hi>Syrian,</hi> and so understood their Language, and <note place="margin">Bochartus. Plutarch.</note> 
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, that he wrote a History of <hi>Gaul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Authority therefore of this <hi>Timagines,</hi> we find that this <hi>Hercules,</hi> with his <hi>Dorienses',</hi> possest the Sea-coast of that Nation that lies upon this Western Ocean. That this <hi>Hercules</hi> was the <hi>Phoenician</hi> no doubt is to be made, seeing he is called the <hi>Ancient,</hi> and that the <hi>Dorienses,</hi> his Attendants, received their name from him (as I have in another place evidenced) <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Dora</hi> a City in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and not from the <hi>Graecians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing that <hi>Hercules</hi> arrived into those Seas, why may he not be supposed to be in <hi>Britain</hi> also. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that <hi>Midacritus</hi> first brought <hi>Tynn</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> now it is certain (as before has been shewn) that Mettal was carried from the <hi>Cassiterides</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Plin. <hi>Nat. bist.</hi>
                     </note> long before any <hi>Greek</hi> had entered the Western Sea. This very thing induces <hi>Bochartus</hi> to think that for <hi>Midacritus, Melicarthus</hi> should be read, and that this <hi>Hercules</hi> first of all shewed the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> those Mines, which afterwards proved so profitable to that Nation. As upon the Sea-coast of <hi>Belgium</hi> there was an Altar inscribed to <hi>Hercules,</hi> so in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> a Country abounding in <hi>Tynn,</hi> there was a Promontory called by his Name, which to this day retains something in two little Towns, <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> or <hi>Hertland, alias Herton,</hi> as also in the Promontory it self, called <hi>Herty-point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Add to this, the Opinion the Ancients had concerning the <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields, how they were supposed (as I have writ in another place) to be upon the Coast of <hi>Britain,</hi> or at least in the Western Ocean, as likewise the story of <hi>Isacius Tzetzes,</hi> an Author of no small credit with Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> concerning <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> which story, though it
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58825:79"/>
be a Fable, yet it shews the Opinions of the Ancients, namely, That <hi>Caesar</hi> was carried, by I know not what Spirit, from <hi>Gaul</hi> into a Western Island inhabited by Ghosts only, and by the same brought back again. We have little reason to doubt, but that <hi>Hercules</hi> his discent into Hell, might be grounded upon his Navigation into these parts.</p>
                  <p>After his death, He was worshipt as a God in all Nations; in some places young Youths were sacrificed before him, and no Women admitted into his Temple. His Bones were preserved in his Temple upon the Streights, and Divine Honours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to them; although the main part of his Worship was <hi>Phoenician,</hi> yet the <hi>Greeks</hi> intruded also, hanging up several Trophies of their own inventions.</p>
                  <p>He was placed upon a Stone Altar, a <hi>Hydra</hi> on one side, and <hi>Diomedes</hi> his Horse on the other, in memory of those two Monsters destroyed by him. He was worshipt in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> under the name of <hi>OGMIUS,</hi> and possibly from the <hi>Phoenician</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lucian.</note> 
                     <hi>Og,</hi> signifying <hi>the Compass of the Sea,</hi> and especially the Western Ocean, which Ocean <hi>Hercules</hi> was the first that discovered it. From this <hi>Og</hi> the <hi>Graecians</hi> had their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, signifying the same thing. <hi>Bochartus</hi> is of opinion, that he is to be derived <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> from <hi>Agemion,</hi> signifying a <hi>Stranger</hi> and <hi>Forreigner,</hi> but I scarcely believe the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> or <hi>Gauls</hi> would borrow a <hi>Phoenician</hi> word to revile one of their own Nation.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>OGMIUS</hi> was represented (as may be seen in the foregoing Figure) <hi>An Old and decrepid Man, bald Pated, his Hair white, a wrinckled Skin, and Sun-burnt,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lucian.</note> 
                     <hi>after the manner of Old Sea-men, a Globe in one hand, with a Compass in the other, to shew his excellent skill in</hi> Geometry <hi>and</hi> Astronomy.</p>
                  <p>There is but one place in <hi>Britain</hi> bearing his Name, and that is <hi>Hartlow;</hi> many Effigies of him have been dug out in several places, as at the <hi>Baths</hi> he was found <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hartlow</hi> in <hi>Devonshire.</hi>
                     </note> streyning two <hi>Snakes.</hi> All Hot Baths (according to <hi>Athenaeus</hi>) were consecrated to him; Likewise in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> near <hi>Risingham,</hi> two Altars were inscribed by <note place="margin">Athenaeus.</note> his Name, but these of later date than what I intend here to speak, and so I will pass them over.</p>
                  <p>He was pictured drawing a multitude of Men after him, with golden Chains pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from his Mouth, and fastned to their Ears, to shew his Eloquence. Likewise he was esteemed the God of <hi>Woers,</hi> as he gave good success to Lovers, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he was named (as some think) <hi>Diodus,</hi> from <hi>Dioda,</hi> signifying in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue <hi>Love.</hi> But I rather think he might be called so from his wandring life, which word will bear the same Derivation as a <hi>Wanderer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a brief account of the true <hi>Phoenician Hercules,</hi> called OGMIUS, as much as relates to our present purpose. As for his great Labours and Atchievments, I have purposely omitted, because they seem rather Allegories than real Actions, and require rather a skilful Mythologist, than an honest Historian.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This division of Ages is generally received with such great approbation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is made use of to the utter overthrowing of all the <hi>BRITISH</hi> History, as taking its beginning Three hundred and thirty years besore the first Olympiad; But here it is to be considered, that in relation to the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Nations, the division of <hi>Fabulous</hi> and <hi>Historical</hi> Ages from those Periods is partly true, although in this also Authors differ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> makes the Historical Age of <hi>Greece</hi> not to begin till the One and fiftieth <note place="margin">Pliny <hi>Nat. hist.</hi>
                  </note> Olympiad, and all the time before to be Fabulous, upon this account respect must be had to the Nations for which those Periods are designed, Had <hi>Varro</hi> lived, and written among the <hi>Jews,</hi> it would have obliged him (according to the Custome of that Nation) to have acknowledged every Age <hi>Historical,</hi> and not to have curtail'd their Histories to the fisty first of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> or the first of King <hi>Jotham,</hi> because then <hi>Iphitus</hi> began the Olympiads.</p>
               <p>On the other side there has been Nations so ignorant and barbarous, that could not extend their <hi>Historical</hi> Ages beyond the daies of their Grandfathers, and all the time preceding was rather absolutely Obscure than Fabulous, so that respect must be had to the Learning of every Nation, their several waies and methods of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the Actions of their Ancestors, and the advantages some People might have above others. For this very cause, the measuring of the <hi>British</hi> Histories are not so strictly to be examined by the Standards of other Nations, neither can they abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely be rejected upon that account, without manifest Injustice done to them.</p>
               <p>It is certain the <hi>Britains</hi> had their <hi>Bards</hi> and <hi>Druids,</hi> and Traded very early with two Learned Nations, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> and <hi>Graecians;</hi> Their <hi>Priests</hi> had peculiar Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of composing and rehearsing the Lives of Famous persons, and so continued their Memories to Posterity by mystical Rythms and Numbers. Neither can it be gathered out of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that any Law or Superstitious usage of the <hi>Druids,</hi> obliged the <hi>Britains</hi> not to transmit to Posterity the memorable Actions of their Ancestors. All that was forbidden, was the divulging in writing the mysterious Doctrines and Ceremonies of their Religion, but in most matters else, both private and publick, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which <hi>History</hi> is one; the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue was allowed them, neither could the same Policy which restrained them in Religious matters, have any weight as to move them to keep the People in ignörance and darkness, as touching the knowledge of Times and Ages.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:58825:82"/>
               <p>So, that although in the <hi>British</hi> Histories there are many things altogether impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, others very improbable and fabulous (as indeed, what Histories are free from such Vices?) yet because there may be a great many Truths couched under those Fables, I have thought it not amiss to give an account of them, partly upon that very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and partly, because many Judicious Persons do not utterly reject them.</p>
               <p>In the progress of the History, I shall make some reflections upon the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable Circumstances, as they carry either the appearance of Truth, or the marks of Falshood and Forgery, contenting my self that this Chronicle be divided (as the Ages of the World since the Flood) into <hi>Fabulous</hi> and <hi>Historical,</hi> following rather the Ancient Custome, in yielding something to the Zeal of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> whereby the Original of Nations is made more venerable, than by erring on the other hand, to bring the Antiquity of a Nation lower than its just proportion.</p>
               <p>Yet, in following of the Judgment of <hi>Varro,</hi> I have ventured to bring down the Genealogy of <hi>SILVIUS,</hi> or <hi>Sisillius,</hi> who is supposed to Reign in <hi>Britain</hi> about <note place="margin">Varro.</note> the first Olympiad, in another Method than hitherto hath been done; And if the Progeny of <hi>AEneas</hi> must needs be granted to govern this Island, I shall shew that it is far more probable to suppose him the First rather than <hi>BRUTE,</hi> whose Name was never known in <hi>Alba</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> till the first Consul, by a feigned stupidity, had contracted it, so that it is not likely that the name of <hi>Brutus</hi> could be given as a disgrace to the Consul, which before had been an Honourable Title of one of their Princes Sons.</p>
               <p>But referring the disquisition of this matter to its proper place, I will begin with the most Fabulous part, namely, the <hi>GELTICK Kings,</hi> as they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Berosus,</hi> or, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith, Fathered upon him by <hi>Annius I'iterbiensis,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Berosus. <hi>Learned</hi> Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> and thrust into the World under the specious name of a <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Priest, to which I will add the Succession from <hi>Bardus</hi> out of <hi>Count Palatine,</hi> not yet extant in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue. We must understand therefore, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NOAH</hi> divided the Earth into three Parts, according to the number of his Sons, giving <hi>SHEM</hi> the possession of that part now called <hi>Asia,</hi> to <hi>HAM</hi> or <note place="margin">Prima Terrae divisio.</note> 
                  <hi>CHAM, Africa,</hi> and to his Eldest Son <hi>JAPHET, Europe,</hi> and all the Islands appertaining to it, of which <hi>BRITAIN</hi> was the Chief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>JAPHET</hi> divided <hi>Europe</hi> among his Sons; <hi>Mesech</hi> for his Lot, received all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>JAPHET,</hi> the first Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Monarth.</note> the Countries lying between the River <hi>Rhyne,</hi> and the <hi>Pyraenean</hi> Mountains; He is supposed to be called <hi>SAMOTHES,</hi> and <hi>DIS,</hi> and is made the founder of the <hi>Celtick</hi> Kingdom. Others make these Parts to have been Peopled first by <hi>Gomer,</hi> and asterwards driven out of their Seats by <hi>Samothes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be endless to trace all the Absurdities and Contradictions herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, seeing that <hi>MESECH,</hi> the Son of <hi>Japhet,</hi> is supposed upon better grounds, to be the Father of the <hi>Moschi,</hi> and <hi>GOMER</hi> not of the <hi>Gauls</hi> but <note place="margin">Bochartus.</note> 
                  <hi>Phrygians,</hi> his latter Mistake arising from not distinguishing that People in <hi>Gallia,</hi> their Ancient Possession, and in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> their after Conquests.</p>
               <p>Now, as in all Forgeries there must be some marks of Truth to carry it out, so this <hi>Samothes</hi> must be called <hi>Dis,</hi> because <hi>Caesar</hi> writes that the <hi>Gauls</hi> derived their <note place="margin">Caesar. Com.</note> Original from <hi>Dis Pater,</hi> or <hi>Father Dis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His name <hi>Samothes</hi> is given him, because he must be made the Father of a Sect falsly called (as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> proves) <hi>Samothei</hi> for <hi>Semnothei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

That it was a holy place we read in <hi>Genesis,</hi> that blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> dwelt among the Oaks of <hi>Mamre,</hi> where he pitched his Tent, and built a Tabernacle and Altar unto the Lord, in which he offered <hi>Rams, Geats, Calves, &amp;c.</hi> in Sacrifice, and moreover that he performed there all other Sacerdotal Rites and Ceremonies appertaining to his Priestly-office in those daies; From these Oaks of <hi>Mamre</hi> (which some call otherwise <hi>Palm</hi> Trees) sprang the Original Sect of <hi>Druids,</hi> which reached up as high as <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and it is positively recorded by some Authentick Authors, that the <hi>Druid</hi> Colledges flourished also very eminently in the daies of <hi>Hermio,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Prince, which happened not long after <hi>Abrahams</hi> death; This I esteem to be very much assisting to a clearer proof and evidence of the Antiquity of that Sect, whom I do make appear were Ancient <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Governours</hi> in Ecclesiastical and Civil matters in this Nation; And by Reason <hi>Abraham</hi> lived under those Oaks of <hi>Mamre</hi> so piously, the <hi>Druids</hi> in Example thereof (although degenerating from the true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and intent of so good an Example) chose Groves of Oaks under which they performed all the invented Rites and Ceremonies belonging to their Religion.</p>
               <p>To speak further, we must confidently (according to the Rule and Method of the <hi>British</hi> History) believe <hi>Sarron</hi> to have Reigned as a <hi>British</hi> King, from <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> MMVII, to MMLXVIII, when being Ambitious to extend his Empire, he ended his life and kingdom, and now we hear of <hi>Druis</hi> his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>DRUIS</hi> the Son of <hi>Sarron,</hi> or as <hi>Basing stochius</hi> writes, his Grand-son, by his Son <hi>Namnes</hi> who died before him, succeeded in the Kingdom. He is made the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Druids,</hi> a famous Sect of Philosophers, he began his Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> MMLXVIII, and held the Government but fourteen years. Then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BARDUS</hi> the Son of <hi>Druis,</hi> next entered upon the Kingdom. This is the King of Poets. Musicians and Heralds called from him <hi>Bardi,</hi> they were very much given to composing of Genealogies, and rehearsing them in publick Assemblies, but notwithstanding their great skill in this matter, we see they have the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be put after the <hi>Druids</hi> in Succession, whereas, in the fore-going An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, it is probably made out, they were an Ancienter Order than they in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:58825:83"/>
               <p>This <hi>Bardus</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> MMLXXXII, and possest the Scepter seventy five years.</p>
               <p>Now, who would not have thought <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> or <hi>SAMOTHEA,</hi> an happy Island, having so many Philosophers for their Kings, but see the mischief of it. Let <hi>Samothes, Magus, Sarron</hi> and <hi>Druis,</hi> teach never so Divinely, and <hi>Bardus</hi> Sing or Pipe never so sweetly, yet the People will be Adders still, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of the Multitude; No wonder therefore, that giving themselves to a loose and luxurious life, and not keeping up to the strict Rules that had been prescribed to them, they were the sooner conquered and subdued by the Giant <hi>Albion,</hi> so that <hi>Samothea</hi> was wrested from the <hi>Celts,</hi> the Line of <hi>Japhet,</hi> and brought in subjection to the Progeny of <hi>Ham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is that stories complain of the miserable Thraldom of this Island by the Sons of <hi>Neptune,</hi> and the delivery of it in part by the death of <hi>Albion,</hi> slain by <hi>Hercules,</hi> though long after it was molested by Giants until the Arrival of <hi>Brutus,</hi> all which Circumstances I will pass over, not because they are more Fabulous than the rest, but because they seem (if they were well timed and cleared of all the Ignorant Rubbish, that by age and malice of Writers has over-burthened them) to carry some foot-steps of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in this Island, who were Men of exceeding proportion, and of the Linage of <hi>Ham,</hi> and early Traders into these Parts.</p>
               <p>Likewise the story of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> or, as Mr. <hi>Hollinshead</hi> corrects it, <hi>Danaus</hi> his <note place="margin">Hollinsheads <hi>Chron.</hi>
                  </note> Daughter, I will omit, as too tedious a Fable, and so proceed to the succession of the <hi>Celtick</hi> Kingdom, of which <hi>Britain</hi> is feigned a part. This I do not for Truths sake, but Convenience; It follows therefore out of <hi>Basin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoak:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LONGHO,</hi> the Son of <hi>Bardus,</hi> succeeded him in the Kindom of the <hi>Celtae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He made War upon <hi>Scandia,</hi> and gave name to the <hi>Longo Bards,</hi> who afterwards proceeded from that Country. I pass over, how ridiculously and against all Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, <hi>Scandia,</hi> by <hi>Basinstochius,</hi> is placed about the Coasts of <hi>Britain,</hi> and made an Island.</p>
               <p>These are small faults; He begun his Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> MMCLVII, and reigned twenty eight years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BARDUS</hi> the Second succeeded him; He carried Musick into <hi>Germany,</hi> which had been first taught in <hi>Celtica</hi> by his Grand-father. He Reigned seven and thirty years, and left a young Son called <hi>Celtes,</hi> who being not ripe enough to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Kingdom,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LUCUS</hi> was elected King, who Reigned but Eleven years, and then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CELTES</hi> assumed the Crown; From this Prince the <hi>Celtae</hi> took their Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. His Mother was called <hi>Galathea,</hi> in honour of whose Memory he gave that name to his Daughter, and afterwards married her to <hi>Hercules,</hi> by whom she had a Son named <hi>Galathes,</hi> from whom the <hi>Galli</hi> are derived. He reigned but thirteen years, and then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HERCULES</hi> and <hi>GALATHEA</hi> succeeded. This <hi>Hercules</hi> built <hi>Alexia,</hi> and passing the <hi>Alpes,</hi> he gave his younger Son <hi>Tuscus</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Italy,</hi> and his elder Son <hi>Galathes</hi> the <hi>Celtick</hi> Dominion. The first Prince reigned nineteen years; <hi>Galathes</hi> held the Kingdom of the <hi>Celts</hi> forty nine years, and then left it to his Son</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NARBON,</hi> the Son of <hi>Galathes,</hi> during his Fathers life had the Island of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothea</hi> intrusted to his Government, but after the death of his Father he passed into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and there built a City after his own Name, he reigned eighteen years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LUGDUS</hi> his Son succeeded him; he built <hi>Lugdunum</hi> and reigned fifty one years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BELIGIUS</hi> followed, who gave name to the <hi>Belgae,</hi> formerly called <hi>Beligici,</hi> he died without Issue after he had reigned twenty years, and the Kingdom of the <hi>Celts</hi> devolved on</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>JASIUS.</hi> This Prince was of the Line of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the year before was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted King of <hi>Italy,</hi> so that the two Kingdoms of <hi>Celtica</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> were conjoyned in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58825:83"/>
one Man, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> MMCCCLXXXIV. This raised Envy in his Brother <hi>Dardanus,</hi> who began a Civil-War, but not being able to prevail by force of Arms, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto Policy, so that feigning Reconciliation with his Brother, he takes all his Goods, and Shipping them, enters into his Brothers Palace, and there Murthers him as he was Bathing, this being effected, he flies into <hi>Samothrace,</hi> afterwards into <hi>Phrygia. Jasius</hi> had a Son named</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CORYBANTUS,</hi> he succeeded his Father in the Kingdom of <hi>Italy,</hi> but not of the <hi>Caeltes. Jasius</hi> reigned fifty years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ALLOBROX,</hi> of the line of <hi>Hercules,</hi> obtained the Kingdom of the <hi>Celti,</hi> he Reigned sixty eight years, and</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ROMUS</hi> his Son succeeded him, he Governed twenty nine years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PARIS</hi> the Son of <hi>Romus</hi> Ruled thirty nine years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LEMANES</hi> the Son of <hi>Paris</hi> Reigned sixty seven years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OLBIUS</hi> the Son of <hi>Lemanes</hi> Reigned five years. From this <hi>Olbius, Basinsto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> derives <hi>Albion,</hi> the Name of this Island.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GALATHES</hi> the Second succeeded him, and Reigned eight and forty years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NAMNES</hi> followed and Governed forty four years, and being about to end his daies he bequeathed the Kingdom to his Son <hi>Remus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>REMUS</hi> the Son of <hi>Namnes</hi> Reigned forty years. He left only a Daughter, which he had married before to <hi>Phranicus,</hi> a Prince of the Blood of <hi>Hector.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PHRANICUS</hi> held the Scepter in right of his Wife, but leaving <hi>Samothea</hi> to be Governed by the <hi>Druids,</hi> he betook himself to the Continent called by his Name, <hi>France,</hi> so that the <hi>Britains</hi> readily received King <hi>BRUTUS</hi> at his Arrival into this Island, as is pretended by those who desired to claim an honourable Title from that Race of the <hi>Trojans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the account of the <hi>Celtick</hi> Kings before <hi>BRUTE,</hi> according to <hi>Berosus</hi> and <hi>Basinstochius;</hi> Who can but wonder at the exact and punctual Chronology in <note place="margin">Berosus: Basinstochius:</note> things of so vast a distance, the Religious care of the Historiographers, lest the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutest Circumstances should be omitted? Who can but admire at their ingenious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, least the Reigns of these things should want some diverting Circumstances, and their Governments run dully without the usual rubs of <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Usurpation.</hi> If we seriously consider these matters, we may easily find that the Government of these Princes began not many hundred years ago. The Opinion of <hi>Isacius Tzetzes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isacius Tzet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</note> concerning imaginary Regions in the <hi>British</hi> Seas was never more true, then when we consider these Aiery Princes, and their phantastical Governments, so that hitherto we find rather an History of <hi>Utopia</hi> than <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Samothes</hi> his Reign, beginning <hi>An. Mundi</hi> MDCCCCX, which is 254 years after the Flood, to the end of <hi>Phranicus</hi> his Reign, are 945 years, so that the Entrance of <hi>Brute</hi> into this Island, according to this account, is in the year of the World MMDCCCLV, and after the Flood 1199 years; But, as if there were some great truth in this matter that required wonderful Exactness, we find much variance in Authors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Berosus</hi> makes <hi>Samothes's</hi> Kingdom about 152 years after the Flood, and that it continued 335 years in his Posterity. Mr. <hi>Hollinshead</hi> saies, 310, and then <hi>Albion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Berosus. Hollinshead.</note> Arrived, but from <hi>Samothes</hi> to the end of <hi>Bardus</hi> his Reign, is but 247 years, so that here a vast <hi>Inter-regnum</hi> is made between <hi>Bardus</hi> and <hi>Albion;</hi> Besides, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between 254 and 152 years, in which <hi>Samothes</hi> is said to begin his Kingdom, cuts short the seventy five years of <hi>Bardus</hi> his Reign, which are assigned him by the Count <hi>Palatine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Entrance of <hi>Brute,</hi> according to this Computation, differs something from <note place="margin">Basinstochius.</note> that which is generally received, namely, That he arrived at this Island in the year of the World 2887, and after the Flood 1231, in the Eighteenth year of <hi>Eli</hi> his Priesthood, and before Christ 1059. And here Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> comes upon <hi>Brutes</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story with his Scripture Chronology, like a <hi>Goliah, Let us see to what purpose.</hi> Brute (saith he) <hi>is the fourth discent from</hi> AEneas, namely thus, <hi>AEneas, Ascanius, Silvius, Brutus.</hi> Now allowing, favourably, according to <hi>Herodotus</hi> (and I add according <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> to the <hi>Britains</hi>) Thirty years for a Generation, we shall find (that if <hi>Brute</hi> entred this Isle <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2887) that the <hi>Trojan</hi> War in the daies of <hi>AEneas,</hi> happened <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2768, in the Eight and thirtieth year of <hi>Gideons</hi> Government.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:58825:84"/>
               <p>But this cannot be saies Mr. <hi>Speed;</hi> why not? <hi>Because</hi> (saies he) Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus <note place="margin">Speeds <hi>Chron.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>alleadged out of</hi> Pergamenus <hi>and</hi> Letus, <hi>placeth the</hi> Trojan <hi>War fully Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years after, namely, in the Reign of King</hi> Solomon, <hi>so that</hi> Brute <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not this Island in</hi> Ely's <hi>Priesthood, but in the Usurpation of</hi> Juda's <hi>Kingdom by</hi> Athaliah, <hi>in the year of the World 3118. and so we see</hi> Brutes <hi>Antiquity cut off Two hundred and thirty years.</hi> O wonderful exactness in Chronology! will any one hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be able to defend <hi>Brutes</hi> History? no certainly, especially if they consider the deadly blow that is coming. <hi>Josephus</hi> (saies he) <hi>confidently affirms, he is able to prove by</hi> Phoenician <hi>Records, that the City</hi> Carthage <hi>was built by</hi> Dido, <hi>Sister to</hi> Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon, 155 <hi>years after the Reign of King</hi> Hiram, <hi>which was</hi> Solomons <hi>Friend, and 143 years and eight months after the building of his most beautiful Temple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Dido</hi> and <hi>AEneas,</hi> according to <hi>Virgil,</hi> were contemporary. By this compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">Virgil.</note> we find <hi>Troys</hi> destruction fell out about the twentieth year of <hi>Joash</hi> his Reign over <hi>Judah,</hi> which was in the year of the Worlds Creation 3143, to which if we add One hundred and twenty years for the Four discents from <hi>AEneas</hi> to <hi>Brute,</hi> then will <hi>Brutes</hi> Conquest of this Island fall with the twelfth of <hi>Jothams</hi> Reign, in <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3263, and thus we see <hi>Brute</hi> hath miserably lost again 375 years of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
               <p>The greatest loss is to follow, and here it is that Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> saies, that he has made a deep breach into <hi>Brute's</hi> History. <hi>Manethon</hi> (saies he) <hi>the Historian, Priest of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Manethon.</note> Egyt, <hi>in his second Book cited by</hi> Josephus, <hi>affirmeth, that the</hi> Israelites <hi>departure from</hi> AEgypt <hi>was almost 1000 years before the Wars of</hi> Troy, and this, Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> saith, <hi>Josephus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Josephus.</note> seems to allow; By this measure <hi>Brute</hi> is lessened 752 years, but I would fain know why he thinks <hi>Josephus</hi> allows this Computation, when as before <hi>Josephus</hi> is brought in confidently maintaining another Account, and that out of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Annals. <hi>Josephus</hi> might allow this Computation of <hi>Manethon</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> perhaps according to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> manner of Years, which consisted of three Months, and so the 1000 years will (in reality) be but 250, effectually.</p>
               <p>But what makes all this against <hi>Brute,</hi> whose time depends upon the timing of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, for can any one be so mad or simple, as by any Scripture Computation to bring down the War of <hi>Troy</hi> below the daies of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and almost equalling it with the <hi>Punick. Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> might erre in this Chronology, and <hi>Virgil</hi> is generally reproved for making <hi>AEneas</hi> and <hi>Dido</hi> contemporary. The <hi>Trojan</hi> War it self is so disputable, that who can expect an exact timing of it. If the Author that <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> pretends to have translated, did place the Entrance of <hi>Brute</hi> under the Priesthood of <hi>Ely,</hi> it was a fancy grounded upon some Computation of his own, which whether it be true or false, concerns not the question of <hi>Brutes</hi> Arrival, who knew not, and consequently, could not deliver down his Entrance in the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Ely?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are too many Circumstances that condemn the story of <hi>Brute,</hi> and it is vain to confute an Author in a small matter, whereas greater things may be laid to his charge, like him, who declaiming against <hi>Nero,</hi> insisted most in his defects in <hi>Musick;</hi> so if there were nothing to be said against <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>Samothes's</hi> stories but the ill harmony of Time, possibly they may be found as perfect in those points as most Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories. But the destroying of <hi>Brute</hi> by any Computation, is, as if one would by the same Weapons prove there was never a <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, or <hi>Minerva's</hi> fatal Statue, and so I proceed to <hi>Brutes</hi> History.</p>

               <p>To clear this Controversie, that the Reader may better judge of the whole matter, I will set down the Progeny of <hi>AEnaeas</hi> by both his Wives;

               <p>
                  <hi>AEnaeas</hi> dying, he left his Kingdom to, <hi>Ascanius,</hi> whom he had by his first Wife <hi>Creusae. Lavinia</hi> his second Wife surviving and finding her self big with Child, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dread the power of <hi>Ascanius,</hi> least the odious name of a Step-mother, and the jealousie of an half Brother, and Competitor in the Kingdom, might carry him on to some violence against her Person; Upon this she fled into the Woods, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a Son, whom she named <hi>Silvius Posthumus,</hi> from the place of his Birth, and by reason he was born after the decease of his Father.</p>
               <p>But, it seems (the People ill resenting the flight of <hi>Lavinia) Ascanius</hi> was obliged to re-call her, and giving to her and her Son the City <hi>Lavinium,</hi> he built <hi>Albae Longa,</hi> where he Reigned. At his death he bequeathed his Kingdom to his Son <hi>Iulus,</hi> between whom and <hi>Silvius,</hi> Controversies arose concerning the Right of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at last it was found that the People inclined rather to <hi>Silvius,</hi> as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of <hi>Lavinia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Latinus,</hi> and inheriting the blood of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> the whole Kingdom devolved on him. By this, <hi>Iulus</hi> was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take up with the Priest-hood.</p>
               <p>There is great uncertainty in <hi>Roman</hi> Authors concerning the Line of <hi>AEnaeas,</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> doubts whether <hi>Iulus</hi> was the Son of <hi>AEneas</hi> by <hi>Creusa</hi> or <hi>Lavinia,</hi> but <note place="margin">Livy.</note> this seemeth to be the clearest Genealogy.</p>

                     <hi>John</hi> of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamstead.</note> of St. <hi>Albaens,</hi> a right Judicious Man, had respect in his Censures long ago upon <hi>Brutes</hi> History, where he saith, That <hi>Ascanius</hi> begat no such Son as had for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name <hi>SILVIUS,</hi> but left Issue an only Son <hi>Iulus,</hi> from whom the Family of the <hi>IULII</hi> afterwards proceeded, and that <hi>Silvius Posthumus</hi> (whom perhaps <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> meaneth) was the Son of <hi>AEneas</hi> by his Wife <hi>Lavinia,</hi> who begat <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeas Silvius,</hi> and in the Eight and thirtieth year of his Reign, ended his life by a Natural death. How therefore could he be slain by his Son <hi>Brute?</hi> or if any such thing had happened, how came so memorable an Accident to be omitted? This argues the story to be Poetical (as he saith) rather than Historical, and that <hi>Jeoffery,</hi> or whoever compiled it, was altogether ignorant of the Genealogy of <hi>AEnaeas,</hi> which will appear more evidently by the sequel. Let us see therefore to which Line our supposed <hi>Brute,</hi> can with most reason be referred.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Book, which <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> pretends to have translated, makes <hi>AEnaeas</hi> his Genealogy thus;
<figure/>
               </p>
               <p>In this he seems to confound <hi>Silvius</hi> with <hi>Iulus,</hi> making them the same Persons, who indeed were but Competitors in the same Kingdom, so that <hi>Silvius</hi> in the Line of <hi>Lavinia,</hi> is brought into the Line of <hi>Creusa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others, to mend the matter, make <hi>Brute</hi> descend of <hi>AEnaeas</hi> and <hi>Lavinia,</hi> but then they bring <hi>Ascanius</hi> of the Line of <hi>Creusa</hi> in to the Line of <hi>Lavinia,</hi> and so make him the same with <hi>Silvius Posthumus,</hi> by that to have begotten <hi>Iulus</hi> the Father of <hi>Brute,</hi> whereas <hi>Silvius Posthumus</hi> begat <hi>Silvius AEnaeas,</hi> and was the Father of those many <hi>Silvii</hi> who succeeded in the Kingdom of <hi>Alba.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto we see <hi>Brute</hi> the Grandfather of <hi>AEnaeas</hi> by a mixt Genealogy, but <hi>Gyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan Villani,</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>Hollinshead,</hi> brings his Line absolutely from <hi>AEnaeas</hi> and <note place="margin">Gyon. Villani <hi>cited by</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshead.</note> 
                  <hi>Lavinia,</hi> and seems to make him the Grand-child of <hi>AEnaeas,</hi> by his Son <hi>Silvius Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthumus,</hi> who (marrying the Neece of his Mother <hi>Lavinia</hi>) had Issue <hi>BRUTE</hi> so called because she died in Travail of him. I suppose he means <hi>Brotus,</hi> but how ridiculously <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is made to signifie any such thing, I leave it to the Judicious to determine.</p>
               <p>But how comes it to pass, that he should flie his Country, fearing (as is said) his Grandfather <hi>Silvius Posthumus,</hi> when as there is no mention made in <hi>Gyonan Villani</hi> of another <hi>Silvius</hi> (in this Line) the Son of <hi>Silvius Posthumus,</hi> and the Father of <hi>Brute.</hi> However it comes to pass, <hi>Brute</hi> must be the Off-spring of <hi>AEneas,</hi> and we must not be too busie in asking questions, for if one demand, how the name of <hi>Brute,</hi> (which was afterwards given to the first Consul for his feigned Stupidity) to be a name of the Princes Son in the same Kingdom, it will be answered he was called <hi>Brotus,</hi> not <hi>Brutus,</hi> because his Mother died in Child-bed of him.</p>
               <p>If it be asked, why he sted for the accidental killing his Father? the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> saies, it is a mistake, for it was only a Rumour spread of him and the truth was rather by other discontents that he was moved to flight. If enquiry be made, how it comes to pass that the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers (who reckon up the Progeny of <hi>AEneas</hi>) and the <hi>Silvii,</hi> make not the least mention of him, and <hi>Gildas</hi> the Ancient <hi>Britain</hi> hath <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> 
                  <hi>Altum silentium</hi> in this point? The Reply is easie, <hi>That it is not the business of every Author to mention every particular, for the</hi> Romans <hi>contented themselves with what related to their own Nation, and</hi> Gildas <hi>made no mention of it, being a thing beyond dispute.</hi>

               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:58825:85"/>
               <p>For the present we will attend this <hi>BRUTE,</hi> the supposed Son of <hi>Silvius,</hi> with the same care and diligence we have done the <hi>Celtick</hi> Kings.</p>
               <p>Being of the Age of fifteen he left his Country, and arriving at <hi>Greece,</hi> he found a number of the scattered <hi>Trojans,</hi> who lived under the Dommion of <hi>Pandrasus.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pandrasus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">

                     </gap>
                  </note> Finding them a discontented Party, he managed his Interest wisely with them (often inculcating the Nobility of their Ancestors, and the slavery of their present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) he offered himself to be their Head and Leader, and so encouraged them to stand upon honourable Terms; They willingly embraced this motion, and many of them being in Authority under <hi>Pandrasus,</hi> revolted, and so brought over great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BRUTE</hi> being thus strengthened, great numbers continually flockt to him, with encouragements to execute his designs; securing himself in Woods, and making sure to him many considerable Forts and strong Holds, but first writes a smart Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Pandrasus,</hi> wherein he demands the liberty of his <hi>Trojans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King amazed at his sudden Imperiousness, but considering with calmer thoughts the Paucity of the Rebels, resolved (by force of Arms) to chastise their Arrogance, by reducing them to Obedience; In all haste he levies a considerable Power, and marching against him with greater heat than conduct, and supposing his Enemies to be hid in the Woods, near a Town called <hi>Sparatinum,</hi> he is set upon by <hi>Brute,</hi> who had three thousand of his well appointed <hi>Trojans</hi> in Ambuscado for that Expedition, so that <hi>Pandrasus</hi> his Army marching loosely, and without order or discipline (as if they had not expected an Enemy so near them) were quickly routed and put to flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brute</hi> pursues his Victory to the River <hi>Akalon,</hi> in which many of the <hi>Graecians</hi> mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably perished; Neither could the Courage of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Pandrasus,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, although he often, from small Parties, rallyed and made Head against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for by the general Consternation of his Men he was defeated and taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</p>
               <p>After this success, <hi>Brute</hi> entred <hi>Sparatinum,</hi> and placing a Garrison in it of six hundred Men, he returns with the rest of his Body into the Woods, bringing them the joyful News of his eminent Victories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pandrasus</hi> being overcome (with shame and sorrow, for the loss of his Brother and this unexpected Defeat) resolves at last, with a greater Power, and more care and circumspection, to renew the War. To this end, he gathers up his dispersed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and with fresh supplies from all parts of his Kingdom, laies Siege to <hi>Sparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> wherein he thought <hi>Brute</hi> in Person resided.</p>
               <p>This Opinion made him carry on the Siege with more violence, storming it at several places at once, but finding greater resistance than he expected, altered his resolution, hoping to reduce them by want of Provisions, so that beleaguring the Town on all sides, with great impatience, expected a surrender.</p>
               <p>The Garrison (by a private Messenger) signifying their mind to <hi>Brute,</hi> by way of Requests, for speedy Assistance, not being able to answer them with Forces, had recourse to Policy, swearing <hi>Anacletus,</hi> whom he had taken Prisoner, to be faithful to him; By the means of this Guide he marched by Night, and in the dark sets upon <hi>Pandrasus</hi> in his Trenches, which Enterprize took such good effect, that the King himself was made his Captive.</p>
               <p>The excellent luck of this our HERO was attended with an honourable Peace, the Conditions of which are very observable, in that they were advantagious for <hi>Brute</hi> only, as I find no Consideration for the Kings satisfaction; The Articles were these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> Brute <hi>should marry</hi> Innogen <hi>the Kings Daughter, and in consideration of her Dower, should have a Fleet given him, with liberty to transport all such as would be willing to follow his Fortunes, without the least let or molestation from the</hi> Graecians.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder that we find not <hi>Antigonus</hi> included in these Articles, because it may be supposed he desired not Liberty, for who would not desire to follow so Happy a man as <hi>Brute,</hi> the Darling of <hi>Fortune,</hi> who could make those Terms with a Prince, and yet (as Mr. <hi>Hollinshead</hi> saith) never toucht the Prerogative of his <note place="margin">Hollinshead <hi>Hist. of Brit.</hi>

                  <hi>BRUTE,</hi> with his Wife <hi>Innogen</hi> embarks, and after two daies and one nights sail, arrived at an Island called <hi>Leogetia,</hi> or <hi>Lergetia,</hi> for Authors differ. Where this Island should be, let <hi>Geography</hi> it self speak, I am ignorant, but here it was that <hi>Brute</hi> first learnt to bend his Knee, and prostrating himself before the Oracle of <hi>Diana,</hi> he desired her to assign him some place for a fixt Habitation, in these words.</p>

               <p>This was delivered to him in a Dream, and I doubt for no other will it be taken, but, hoysing up his Sails, passes the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and Coasting on the Right hand, see the luck of it, he met with another Company of <hi>Trojans</hi> led thither by <hi>Antenor,</hi> lying upon the <hi>Tyrrhen</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Hollinshead</hi> corrects this mistake in the <hi>British</hi> History, and will needs have it <note place="margin">Hollinsheads <hi>Brit. Hist.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Pyraenean</hi> Sea; But, what had <hi>Antenor</hi> to do in the Ocean in the West of <hi>Spain?</hi> We read in History, that he brought his Colony to the <hi>Tyrrhen,</hi> but never to the <hi>Pyraenean</hi> Sea, so that here we find the late fortunate <hi>Brutus,</hi> with some Magick or other, brought back again through the Streights, and cast into the very mouths of his Enemies, even upon the Coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> to answer for the death of his Father, or else some other misdemeanour.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this Geography, we must suppose him on the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he meets with <hi>Corinaeus</hi> the present Captain of these dispersed <hi>Trojans,</hi> who understanding <hi>Brute</hi> to be of the same Nation with himself, a Man of great Spirit, and the Master of so powerful a Nation, makes Propositions of uniting to him, which <hi>Brute</hi> g'adly received, so that joyning Forces, they proceed together in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out new Adventures, and after thirty daies sail, <hi>Brute,</hi> with his new Confederates, entred the River <hi>Ligeris</hi> in <hi>Aquitain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goffarius</hi> (was King of this Country) Sirnamed <hi>Pictus,</hi> descended of the <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyrses,</hi> a <hi>Painted Nation,</hi> and some hold that this Country from hence was called <hi>Poictou,</hi> and that part of <hi>Britain</hi> was named <hi>Pight-land</hi> upon the same account of <hi>Painting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goffarius</hi> being informed of the Landing of these Strangers, sent some of his Officers to learn their Numbers, and to observe their Motions, who meeting with two hundred of the <hi>Trojans</hi> that went a Hunting with their Leader <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> there happened a dispute between them, insomuch that <hi>Imbert,</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> shot an Arrow at <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> which proved the engagement of a terrible Battle, and <hi>Corinaeus</hi> to require him, with one slash clave his Head asunder, upon which Accident followed a Victory to the <hi>Trojans.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:58825:86"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goffarius</hi> by this time had mustered up his Forces, and resolved to revenge this Insolence committed on his Subjects: Fortune seconded not his Attempt, for <hi>Brute</hi> with the assistance of <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> defeated all his Army, and forced his security by flight.</p>
               <p>It seems these two Overthrows did but whet the Revenge of <hi>Goffarius,</hi> and so with new Forces sets again upon the <hi>Trojans,</hi> over-powring them in Numbers, for it is said he had Thirty for One, and at last constrained them to take refuge in their Camp, where he olosely besieged them with his whole Army; <hi>Brute</hi> and <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Messages, resolved to set upon him on both sides at one instant, whereupon <hi>Corinaeus</hi> with three hundred Men, lying in Covert all night, charged the next Morning the <hi>Gauls,</hi> then <hi>Brute</hi> seconds him with a brisk Sally, and here again <hi>Goffarius</hi> is defeated, yet not without great slaughter on both sides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brute</hi> in this Battle lost his Nephew <hi>Turinus,</hi> a valiant Youth, in honour of whom he built <hi>Turonium,</hi> now called <hi>Towres,</hi> and in Revenge harasses the Country of <hi>Gof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farius,</hi> and with Fire and Sword prosecutes his Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goffarius</hi> being thus expelled his Kingdom, sollicited his Neighbour Princes to undertake his quarrel, and now all <hi>Gaul</hi> was united against the Common Enemy, which <hi>Brute</hi> understanding, calls a Council of War, where it was finally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That upon the account of their great Losses received in the former Encounter, they should not prosecute <hi>Goffarius</hi> any further, considering more especially it was beside their main design, this not being the Country allotted them by the Oracle: so that collecting all their Forces, they embarked, making as must haste as they could to the Promised Island, where, after a few daies sayl, they arrived at the Haven now called <hi>Totness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time of <hi>Brutes</hi> Landing is supposed, about the Year of the World 2887, <note place="margin">The time of: <hi>Brutes</hi> Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Britain</hi> is judged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</note> and after the Universal Flood, 1231. The <hi>Count Palatine</hi> places it in the Year 2855, and Mr. <hi>Hollinshead</hi> 2850, and after the destruction of <hi>Troy</hi> 66; but of the great difference in Calculations I have treated already, and once for all it may be said, That a true and just Chronology cannot be expected till the coming of <hi>Julius Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brute</hi> having at last (through many dangers and difficulties) attained the long wished for Island, he Lands his <hi>Trojans,</hi> and marches up into the Country to take possession.</p>
               <p>Joyful was he to see the pleasant prospect of so large a Dominion, and blest the Gods that they gave him so glorious a Reward for all his labours. But all things were not so well as he imagined, for, from the Clyffs and craggy Rocks, he began to perceive mighty Giants arising; This sight he communicated to <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> who, at first, was much surprized at the Object, but at last they both pluckt up their wonted Spirits, and with a few <hi>Trojans</hi> valiantly assailed these Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>In a few Conflicts they found not their Weapons to want success, so that they soon convinced these <hi>Goliahs,</hi> that no strength or vastness of Limbs, was able to resist a <hi>Trojan</hi> Puissance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> after several general Engagements, had a longing desire to enter into a nearer trial of skill with some one of them: <hi>Gogmagog</hi> undertakes him, and a day of wrestling was appointed, and attended with great expectation.</p>
               <p>The Giant at his first grapling, by a close-Hug, breaks a Rib of <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> but sorely paid for it, by the fall <hi>Corinaeus</hi> gave him from the Clyff of <hi>Dover</hi> to his utter destruction, which from hence is said afterwards to be called <hi>Cwymp y Cawr,</hi> or <hi>the fall of the Giant.</hi> This was a good Omen of the <hi>Trojans</hi> further success, and <hi>Corinaeus</hi> for this piece of service was rewarded with the Principality of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brute</hi> by degrees destroyed the whole Race of these Giants, and quietly posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Island, the first work he undertook was the building of a City, which he called <hi>Troy-novant,</hi> now <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this City he kept his Royal Court, ordaining and enacting, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth the whole Island should be called after his Name, <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> and so the Inhabitants, <hi>Britains,</hi>
               </p>

               <p>Being at the point of Death, in the fifteenth year of his Reign, and the four and twentieth of his Arrival, he divided his Kingdom to his three Sons; To <hi>Locrinus</hi> he bequeathed that part now called <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> To <hi>Camber, WALES,</hi> To <hi>Albanact, SCOTLAND,</hi> and so called it after his name, <hi>Albania.</hi>

                  <p>To make this pretended <hi>Brute</hi> to be a <hi>Trojan,</hi> and to fasten him upon a Genealogy contrary to the truth of those Histories from which that Genealogy is fetcht, and upon whose Credit it depends, is the thing for which <hi>Brutes</hi> History is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>

                     <hi>Segibertus Gemblasensis</hi> might have the same design in deriving his <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Brutus,</hi> as the <hi>Britains</hi> might derive their <hi>Britannia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not deny, but <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> might have several hints of <hi>Brutus,</hi> nay a <hi>British</hi> History of him, but it will not justifie the Fiction, neither can the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Authors, in, or about that time, take away from the Credit of Ancienter Historiographers, as <hi>Caesar, Tacitus, Gildas, Ninius,</hi> and as many as wrote twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">Caesar, Tacitus, Gildas, Ninius.</note> years since, who make no mention of any such Person; more than that, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess by all their Enquiry, they could learn nothing of the <hi>Britains</hi> concerning their Original, so that whatever Original is pretended, nevertheless the story of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan Brute,</hi> and all the Legend of his life, seems to be brought into the World not long before those times, as appears by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> and <hi>Speed,</hi> nay, Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> of late in his Vindication of this story, in one place ingeniously confesses, <hi>That these Tales</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>might be invented, and so intruded upon the Vulgar.</hi> But where ever the story of <hi>Brute</hi> is to be told, the Character of it, and the Compiler ought never to be omitted.</p>
                  <p>It is the saying of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Newborough,</hi> who lived in the Age of <hi>Geoffery ap Arthur</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and writes thus of him; <hi>In these our daies</hi> (saith he) <hi>a certain

                  </p>
                  <p>About the same time was <hi>Francio</hi> invented for the <hi>Francks, Scota, Pharaolis</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the <hi>Scots, Hiberus</hi> for the <hi>Irish, Danus</hi> for the <hi>Danes, Brabo</hi> for the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banders, Gothus</hi> for the <hi>Goths, Saxo</hi> for the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and is <hi>Brutus</hi> for the <hi>Britains</hi> any thing truer? who can think it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scriverius,</hi> in his Preface to the Antiquitics of Ancient <hi>Batavia,</hi> falls severely <note place="margin">Scriverius.</note> upon <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and gives his History the name of, <hi>Groote grove lange dicke taste lijck ende unbeschaemte, logen,</hi> that is, <hi>A most impudent Lie, a great one, a heavy one, a long thick one,</hi> which (like the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Darkness) was so palpable it might be felt. Never had a <hi>Lie</hi> so many dimensions given it before, nor so much substance ascribed to it. Well fare <hi>Brute</hi> and his <hi>Trojans,</hi> above all stories this carries the Honour of the day.</p>
                  <p>That which gave some Authority to this Fiction, was the use King <hi>Edward</hi> the first made of it, in vindicating his Title to <hi>Scotland</hi> against the pretence of Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who laid claim to that Kingdom, by Ancient Right, as part of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, and that Churches Demesne.</p>
                  <p>This Action of the King stampt some Character upon this late Invention, and the Judgment of so wise a Prince in favour of <hi>Brute,</hi> in a matter of so high a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, brought this new Embrio into some credit in the World. It will not be amiss therefore, to examine the whole Circumstances of this debate between the King, Pope, and Barons of this Realm.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> having made a considerable progress towards the Conquest of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and being there in Person, receives a <hi>Prohibition</hi> from the Pope (who was backt on by the <hi>French</hi> King) to proceed any further in that business, until he had proved his Title at <hi>Rome,</hi> to which place the Pope by his <hi>Bull,</hi> drew the hearing of the Cause; the King received this Message from the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who, through many hazards, brought the <hi>Bull</hi> to him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and thereby finding that the Pope had started an unheard of Claim to that Kingdom, returns this Answer to the Bishop, <hi>That he could not reply to the Popes Letters without the consent of his Barons, most of which were at that time in Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next year coming into <hi>Britain,</hi> he summons a Parliament at <hi>Lincoln, Octabis Sancti Hilarii,</hi> to advise with his Prelates, Nobles and Commons, how to defend the Rights of his Crown against this new Papal claim. Upon reading of the Popes <hi>Bull,</hi> it was long debated whether the King should return any Answer to it, but in fine the Affirmative carried it.</p>
                  <p>The King, to justifie his Title to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to prove it was alwaies a Feuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Nation, and that their Kings through all Ages, paid Homage to the Kings of <hi>Britain,</hi> begins his Claim from <hi>Brute,</hi> and the division of the whole Island among his Three Sons, <hi>Locrine, Camber,</hi> and <hi>Albanact,</hi> wherein this constitution and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of <hi>Troy</hi> is asserted, <hi>Ut dignitas haereditatis Primogenito perveniret,</hi> and so he followeth on his Title through many <hi>British</hi> Princes, as it may be seen at large in the Records in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London, Anno 29. Edvardi primi.</hi> Here we see <hi>Brutes</hi> story <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Records of R.</hi> Edw. l. An. 29</note> made use of in a Claim to a Crown, then in real debate, so that here a few things must be considered.</p>
                  <p>Who were the Persons that might be thought to have a great stroak in compiling this Letter. The Writs the King issued out were to no less than three and forty <hi>Abbots, Priors</hi> and <hi>Deans,</hi> besides many others of the Clergy, to search the Records of their Monasteries and Covents, and to send up to <hi>Lincoln</hi> any thing which might concern the present question.</p>
                  <p>It appears, that the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Fryers</hi> had a great hand in making out this Title by <hi>Brute,</hi> whose Story now was new vampt, and from all Parts sent out of those shops where at first it had been forged and hammer'd out; And this doth more evidently appear, if we consider many other parts of the same Letter, as it is found in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords cited by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> but especially that Miracle of King <hi>Adelstane,</hi> who (<hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam</hi>) to give an evident sign of his Right to <hi>Scotland,</hi> with his Sword struck such a blow upon a Rock near <hi>Dunbar,</hi> that he clest it, at least, an Ell wide.</p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:58825:88"/>
                  <p>It is no wonder if King <hi>Edward</hi> did oppose the <hi>Spiritual Right</hi> of the Pope with no less Aiery Titled, and it was not unnecessary that he should endeavour to beat him at his own Weapons, having so many <hi>Myrmedons</hi> to assist him, who were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently skill'd, and so fitter to return upon <hi>Rome</hi> a Title which had no less pretences of <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> than the Popes, so that the Fable of <hi>Brute</hi> here made use of, in the Circumstances of those Affairs, was <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>Politick,</hi> yet makes not to the credit and reality of his History, but shews, that a wise Prince took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to destroy an impertinent Demand with a Politick return.</p>
                  <p>Besides, <hi>Albanact</hi> the Son of <hi>Brute,</hi> by this time had been received by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were as Ambitious to derive their Nation from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> as the <hi>English</hi> were contented with a younger Brother for their Prince, seeing the <hi>English</hi> had preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them in the right of Primogeniture by <hi>Locrinus,</hi> so that <hi>Locrinus's</hi> Title against <hi>Albanact</hi> is good, although, in truth, neither be valuable. And so I leave the story of <hi>Brute</hi> and his <hi>Trojans</hi> to the Credit of its first Devisors, and how far it may be taken hath been sifted sufficiently by all Authors. I will only reply to one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, often produced in favour of <hi>Brute,</hi> to which hitherto I have seen no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                  <p>It is taken from the words of <hi>Thaliassen,</hi> an Ancient Poet, supposed to live in <note place="margin">Hannes Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liassen, <hi>a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Poet.</hi>
                     </note> the daies of <hi>Mailgon</hi> King of <hi>Venedotia,</hi> or <hi>North-Wales,</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>Hannes Thaliassen,</hi> or the Errors of <hi>Thaliassen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <lg>

                     <l>
                        <hi>I return to the Relich of</hi> Troy.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Now granting this to be the true work of <hi>Thaliassen,</hi> I see not why, from hence, the <hi>Britains</hi> must be concluded of <hi>Trojan</hi> Original. The Phrase of <hi>Reliquiae</hi> Trojae, <hi>aut Reliquiae</hi> Danûm, may elegantly be used to express any Nation that is miserably brought from its Ancient Glory, and reduced to so small a number as the <hi>Britains</hi> were by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and especially by the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a Poetical Elegancy used by <hi>Thaliassen</hi> to express the Calamities of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet such small Figures have often created great Kings in the Inventions of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Men, as <hi>Magus</hi> the <hi>Celtick</hi> King took birth from the Poetical saying of <hi>Pliny,</hi> and I believe verily, <hi>Brutus</hi> from this of <hi>Thaliassen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have not time to instance in all the ridiculous particulars in <hi>Brutes</hi> History, and how <hi>Troy-novant</hi> could signifie <hi>Troia nova,</hi> before ever the <hi>Romans</hi> had brought the <note place="margin">More of <hi>Troi-novant,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Lud.</hi>
                     </note> word <hi>Novum</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> but it may be supposed that this conceit of <hi>Troy-novant,</hi> took its beginning from that Cities standing in the Country of the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> so called by <hi>Caesar,</hi> and they who followed on the contrivance of a <hi>Trojan</hi> Original, might make use of the least similitude of Words to confirm their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>And this might give occasion to those words of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, to streagthen the Priviledges of the City of <hi>London,</hi> as to their <hi>Hustings</hi> and other Courts, for he saith of the same City thus, <hi>Fundata erit olim &amp; adificata ad instar, &amp; ad modum, &amp; in memoria Veteris Magnae</hi> Troiae. Every Fiction muttlye sometime in the Womb, before it can be brought to perfection, and so it happened in thus, that first the matter of a <hi>Trojan</hi> Original being prepared, and by Tradition only received, it grew up by the use Princes made of it; Afterwards it received its form from the Writing of the Learned in those daies, and so finally brought to maturity, and delivered by <hi>Jeoffery,</hi> and all this structure, perhaps, lying upon no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation than <hi>Britannia, Brutus, Trinovant, Trivovantes,</hi> and that elegant saying of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liassen,</hi> Y Weddillhion Croia, and this more evidently appears where I have treated of the Custome of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in giving Names to Nations, and feigning of false Originals.</p>
                  <p>Many of the like I omit, because they have, by all Authors, been sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the view of the whole World, I will only mention how the <hi>Count Palatine</hi> makes the <hi>Britanni</hi> and <hi>Brotones,</hi> two different Nations, and that the former were in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58825:88"/>
this Island before <hi>Brutes</hi> Arrival, and the latter took their Name from him; For my part let <hi>Brute</hi> enjoy his <hi>Britones,</hi> so the <hi>Britanni</hi> may be freed from so fond an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, but both sides will not agree in this composition, and I am afraid the case will be the same as when <hi>Caesar</hi> with his two Names subscribed two Consuls, <hi>That</hi> (as one said) <hi>if</hi> Julius <hi>be safe,</hi> Caesar <hi>has no reason to complain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let therefore the case of <hi>Brute</hi> remain (as it did in Mr. <hi>Cambdens</hi> daies) to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the Senate of <hi>Antiquaries</hi> and great <hi>Clerks,</hi> to the number of which cited by him, namely, are, <hi>Boccace, Ludovicus Vives, Hadrian, Junius, Polidore, Buchanan,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Learned Writers against Brutes Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</note> 
                     <hi>Vignier, Genebrad, Molinaeus, Bodine,</hi> who all reject this story.</p>
                  <p>I will now add that famous Antiquary Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who askes this Question. <hi>If the right of Primogeniture invested the eldest Son absolutely in the Kingdom, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr. Seldens</hi> Question, not yet answered.</note> 
                     <hi>to the Custome of</hi> Troy, <hi>as it is found in the succession of the</hi> Trojan <hi>Kings, How comes it to pass that this Custome was not brought over into Britain?</hi> a Question not hitherto fully Answered, no not by Mr. <hi>Taylour,</hi> Author of the History of <hi>Gavel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> who will have Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> to be in jest and merriment, when he demands upon this account, <hi>How our Britains claim their descent from the Trojans,</hi> when as this Question was but sober and rational, and hath true reference to the Custome of <hi>Troy,</hi> where the Eldest Son alwaies Inherited the entire Dominion of his Father, which by many of the <hi>British</hi> Kings was not observed. Nay, this usage of <hi>Troy</hi> was Religiously observed by the Successors of <hi>AEnaeas</hi> in the Kingdom of the <hi>Latins,</hi> for when <hi>Silvius Posthumus</hi> and <hi>Iulus</hi> contended about the Right of <hi>Government, Iulus</hi> was utterly deposed, and invested only with the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and there was no thoughts of sharing the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>By this, it is manifest Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> had relation to the Custome of <hi>Troy,</hi> and not to any <hi>Gavel-kind</hi> among the <hi>Welch;</hi> And now I will proceed to the second <hi>British</hi> King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LOCRINE,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Brute,</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2874, over this part of the Island since called <hi>England,</hi> which Portion was allotted to him by the division of his Father, as being the fairest parcel of his Empire.</p>
                  <p>During his Reign, his Brother <hi>Albanact</hi> was Invaded by <hi>Humber,</hi> King of the <hi>Hunns,</hi> or <hi>Scythians,</hi> and finally by him slain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Locrine</hi> and <hi>Camber</hi> raised Forces to revenge the death of their Brother, and so marched into the North to seek out <hi>Humber,</hi> and finding him upon the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> then called <hi>Albania,</hi> they gave him battle, and speedily vanquisht him, so as himself and Army, after a hot Chase, were drowned in a River, and from that time the River was named <hi>HUMBER.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this pursuit he took three fair Ladies, the most beautiful of which, named <hi>Estrild,</hi> a <hi>Scythian</hi> Princess, he most doted on, that notwithstanding a former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between him and <hi>Guendolaena, Corinaeus</hi> his Daughter, resolved to take this Lady to wife, but the power and authority of <hi>Corinaeus</hi> forced him to lay aside that present Resolution, so that marrying <hi>Guendolaena,</hi> nevertheless privately enjoyed his beloved <hi>Estrild,</hi> keeping her in secret during the life of his Father in Law <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinaeus,</hi> which he performed (saith the <hi>Count Palatine</hi>) by the help of a Vault, to <note place="margin">C. Palatine;</note> which (under pretence of sacrificing to the Infernal Gods) he often resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>No sooner <hi>Corinaeus</hi> was dead but he owned her for his Queen, which so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed <hi>Guendolaena,</hi> that although <hi>Locrine</hi> was strengthened by the accession of <hi>Cambria,</hi> upon the death of his Brother, yet she goes into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and by powerful Sollicitations in the behalf of her self and young Son <hi>Madan,</hi> the <hi>Cornish</hi> are brought to assist her.</p>
                  <p>With these Forces she marched again <hi>Locrine,</hi> and in a pitcht Battle nigh the River <hi>Stour,</hi> he is overcome and slain, upon this (according as she would have it) the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fell to her Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>MADAN,</hi> the Son of <hi>Locrine</hi> by <hi>Guendolaena,</hi> although a Child, yet succeeded his Father <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2894. During his Minority his Mother was made Regent of the Kingdom, which she administred with all Justice until the full Age of her Son, and after the resignment of her Power she retired into <hi>Cornwal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Kings severity, in putting the Laws in Execution, was esteemed a Tyrant, and after he had Reigned forty years, he was devoured with Wild Beasts.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:58825:89"/>
                  <p>He built <hi>Madancaster,</hi> now <hi>Dancaster,</hi> but <hi>Dancaster</hi> or <hi>Doncaster</hi> took its Name, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> supposes, from the River <hi>Dona</hi> upon which it standeth. This <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> left two Sons behind him, <hi>Mempricius</hi> and <hi>Manlius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>MEMPRICIUS,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Madan,</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2949, over the whole Island, but <hi>Manlius</hi> his younger Brother rebelled against him. To suppress this Rebellion, <hi>Mempricius</hi> signified a desire to Treat with his Brother, who consenting to it was treacherously, at a meeting, Murthered.</p>
                  <p>The King having put an end to that trouble, wallowed in Ease and Luxury, and not content with his Wives and Concubines, he falls to horrid Rapes, and at last to unnatural <hi>Sodomy;</hi> but in the conclusion of all, was slain by wild Beasts, after his Government had lasted about twenty years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>EBRANCKE</hi> the Son of <hi>Mempricius</hi> by his lawful Wife, began to Rule <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 2969, he had two and twenty Wives, of whom he had Issue twenty Sons and thirty Daughters, the Eldest of which was named <hi>Guales,</hi> or <hi>Gualea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Daughters, under the Conduct of their Brothers, he sent to <hi>Silvius Alba</hi> the Eleventh King of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the sixth King of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and this he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he heard the <hi>Sabines</hi> would not give their Daughters in Marriage to the <hi>Latins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a ridiculous Prolepsis is this of an Action that happened many years after, in the daies of <hi>Romulus,</hi> and how, without any sense or reason, is it ascribed to these Times? The <hi>Sabines</hi> denied their Daughters to that scum of People <hi>Romulus</hi> by his <hi>Asylum</hi> had pickt up, but why should they do it while the Kingdom of the <hi>Latins</hi> was in splendour under the Kings of <hi>Alba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In making of <hi>Silvius Alba</hi> the sixth King of the <hi>Latins, Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> is in the right, and now we have a Clue to lead us in to the understanding of this Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of <hi>AEnaeas,</hi> namely, he makes the Kings of <hi>Alba</hi> to succeed lineally from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son, and therefore because <hi>Silvius Posthumus</hi> followed <hi>Ascanius</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he is ignorantly supposed his Son, whereas <hi>Iulus</hi> was the Son of <hi>Ascanius,</hi> who being deposed by the People, <hi>Silvius</hi> the Son of <hi>AEnaeas</hi> by <hi>Lavinia</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Crown, succeeding <hi>Ascanius</hi> his half Brother, not his Father in the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>By the same Mistake we find, in the <hi>British</hi> History, One and twenty Kings from <hi>Porrex</hi> to <hi>Minnegen</hi> to be made of a Lineal descent, and yet but Ninety two years allowed for all their Reigns, so that they begat one another at four or five years old, whereas, if there be any truth in the Lives of those Kings, they ought to have been made Contemporary, and to have Ruled different parts of the Island, as the Government thereof was found divided in the daies of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> (when <hi>Kent</hi> alone had four Princes) a little before whose time these KINGS are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Ebrancke;</hi> After that his Sons had conducted their Sisters under the Conduct of their Brother <hi>Assaracus</hi> to <hi>Silvius Alba,</hi> being provoked by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> they entred that Nation, and, by the assistance of <hi>Silvius,</hi> Conquered it: Some write, they were Aided by their Father, who had Invaded, and by this time Conquered all <hi>Gallia,</hi> so that we see a vast part of <hi>Europe</hi> in the possession of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancke,</hi> and his Sons.</p>
                  <p>The Line of <hi>BRUTE</hi> never in so fair a way as now, towards the Conquest of the whole Earth, promised by the Oracle, and performed (as the <hi>Britains</hi> say) in the Person of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great.</p>
                  <p>This Prince built <hi>Caerbrancke,</hi> now <hi>York,</hi> and erected a Temple to <hi>Diana,</hi> in which he placed an <hi>Archi flamen.</hi>

                  <p>He was a good Prince till the latter end of his daies, when falling in to several Vices and Enormities, created great Dissensions in the Nations, which ended not in his life.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He built a City which he named <hi>Caer Gaut,</hi> or <hi>Kaerkin,</hi> now <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and there placed a <hi>Flamin,</hi> likewise <hi>Caerquent,</hi> now <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Caer Septon,</hi> or <hi>Caer Palladur,</hi> supposed to be <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and having Reigned thirty nine years he died.</p>

                  <p>It is seated in a Low Valley, and the same not great, encompast about with Hills almost of an equal height, from which certain Springs and little Rivulets of Water descend to the great commodity of the City. Within the City it self there boils up three Springs of Hot-waters, which were caused by the wonderful Art of this <hi>Blay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> named <hi>Cloyth,</hi> i. e. <hi>Bleyden the Magician,</hi> but as the Monks will have it, it must be by <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>William</hi> of Malmsb.</note> St. <hi>David,</hi> who coming to <hi>Bath</hi> cured the Infection of the Waters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts and by his Prayers and Benedictions gave them a perpetual Heat, and made them very healthful and soveraign for many Diseases, to the wonderful comfort and assistance of all <hi>England</hi> to this present time.</p>
                  <p>These are the two Opinions, <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Monkish,</hi> that are given concerning the production of these Springs.</p>
                  <p>The Water that bubbles or boils up is of a blewish or Sea-colour, and sends up a thin Steam and Vapour of a strong scent, caused by the veins of <hi>Brimstone,</hi> and some Bituminous matter it passeth through.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:58825:90"/>
                  <p>These Baths are not wholsome at all hours, but do require a time of purgation from that filth, which by the exceeding heat and fermentation of them is cast up, so that until (by their Sluces) they cleanse themselves, they are shut up, and none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enter them.</p>
                  <p>The first and greatest is called the <hi>Kings Bath,</hi> in the very heart and bosom of the <note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the BATHS.</note> City, and nigh to the Cathedral Church. It is enclosed within a Wall, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with two and thirty Seats of Arched-work for Men and Women to sit upon, who, when they enter, are covered with Linnen Garments, and are conducted by Guides who attend for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>Where the Cathedral Church now stands, in Ancient times (as the Report goes) was that Temple consecrated to <hi>Minerva,</hi> the Patroness of <hi>Hot Springs,</hi> and this is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of <hi>Solinus,</hi> who writes of these Baths in <hi>Britain.</hi>

                  <p>The other two are in a Street on the West side of the City, not two hundred foot one from the other; One of which is called the <hi>Cross-Bath,</hi> from a Cross that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly stood in the midst of it. It is of a mild and temperate warmth, and hath twelve Seats of stones upon the brinks of it, and encompast with a Wall.</p>
                  <p>The other is much hotter, and is called the <hi>Hot-Bath.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>LEIR</hi> the Son of <hi>Baldud</hi> succeeded, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3105; He built <hi>Caerleir,</hi> called <hi>Legecestria, Leogora, Legeo-cester,</hi> and now <hi>Leicester,</hi> and there placed a Flamen; He had never a Son, but three Daughters, <hi>Gonorilla, Regana,</hi> and <hi>Cordeilla</hi> his Darling.</p>
                  <p>In his Old Age, being jealous of their Affection, he called them before him, and demands, that they would give him some assurance of their Love.</p>
                  <p>The two Eldest called Heaven and Earth to witness, that they loved him ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times dearer than their own Souls, that they were not able to express their infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Kindnesses, and at last concluded their Flattery, with horrid Oaths and Asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations of their Sincerity.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:58825:90"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cordeilla</hi> could not be heard amidst all this noise of Affection, so that her Father turning towards her quickly, by his Countenance gave her to understand that he had expected something from her also, wherefore with a modest look and humble deportment, she assured him that as a Father she had ever loved and honoured him, and as her bounden duty was, as a Father, she should reverence and alwaies esteem him.</p>
                  <p>This Answer satisfied not the old King, but he shewed his Resentments by his neglect of her, and the sudden advancement of her Sisters, marrying <hi>Regana</hi> to <hi>Henninus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and <hi>Gonorilla</hi> to <hi>Maglanus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albania,</hi> reserving no Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Cordeilla,</hi> but it so happened that <hi>Aganippus,</hi> King of <hi>Gallia,</hi> hearing of her Vertue, desired her in Marriage, to whom she was welcome without any Dower but her own Excellence.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Leir</hi> having thus disposed of his Daughters began to grow Gray, yet Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, giving hopes to his Subjects of a long life and Government. This pleased not <hi>Gonorilla</hi> nor <hi>Regana,</hi> who began by this time to reflect upon their Father as the only obstacle of their Happiness, often wishing him removed, and from <hi>wishes</hi> they passed on to <hi>desires</hi> and <hi>longing expectations</hi> after his Death. This brought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Age, and afterwards neglect and hatred of his Person; finally, being instigated and assisted by their Husbands, they offered so many Indignities and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences to him, that in the end he was constrained to leave the Realm, and take Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge with <hi>Cordeilla.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This rejected Daughter of his received him with all signs and testimonies of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and, what was more significant, assisted him with powerful Aids, and in Person went to revenge his wrongs, so that bringing a great Army into <hi>Britain,</hi> she destroyed his Enemies, and restored him to his Crown, which he held for the space of two years, whose Reign in all is computed to be full sixty years, and was buried at <hi>Leicester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CORDEILLA,</hi> the youngest Daughter of <hi>Leir,</hi> was admitted for Queen <hi>An. Mundi</hi> 3165, She governed the Realm discreetly for five years, during which time her Husband <hi>Aganippus</hi> died. <hi>Margan</hi> and <hi>Cunedage,</hi> her Nephews by her Sisters, <hi>Gonorilla</hi> and <hi>Regana,</hi> disdaining to be under the Government of a Woman, rebelled against her, and so prevailed that they took her Prisoner, but being a Woman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a high Spirit, she slew her self, rather than to live under their Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CUNEDAG,</hi> and <hi>MARGAN,</hi> possessing the whole Government, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3170, they divided the Land between them. To <hi>Margan</hi> fell <hi>Albania,</hi> to <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedag</hi> all the Country on this side of <hi>Humber. Margan</hi> was not long content with his Portion, so he invaded his Brother, but driven by him into <hi>Wales</hi> and there slain, giving the name of <hi>Glan-Margan</hi> to that Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cunedagius</hi> Ruling alone, erected a Temple to <hi>Mars</hi> at <hi>Perth</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> placing there a <hi>Flamens</hi> Seat; He also built a Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> at <hi>Bangor,</hi> and one to <hi>Mercury</hi> (Mr. <hi>Hollinshead</hi> saith, <hi>Apollo</hi>) in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> he died and was buried in <hi>Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novant,</hi> after he had Ruled 33 years.</p>

                     <hi>RIVAL,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cunedag,</hi> came to the Crown <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3203, in his time it rained Blood for three daies together, from the putrefaction a noysom and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Flie was bred, which in swarms infested the whole Land, and brought a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion both on Man and Beast, and great was the Mortality that ensued in this Kings Reign.</p>

                     <hi>Rome</hi> is supposed to be built about the eight and twentieth year of his Reign, and in the year after <hi>Brutes</hi> Arrival 356, some say in the thirty second year of <hi>Rival;</hi> He Reigned 46 years, and bidding adieu to the World</p>

out of <hi>Amulius</hi> and his Family from the usurped Kingdom of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and to the beginning of this Kings Reign in <hi>Britain,</hi> there seems a just competent time allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Voyage.</p>
                  <p>They who have respect to the <hi>British</hi> Histories, let them consider that this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course between <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> here supposed, is no new thing, being practiced in the daies of <hi>Ebrancke,</hi> who sent his Daughters to <hi>Silvius, Alba,</hi> then King of the <hi>Latins;</hi> likewise let them take notice, that this way the <hi>British</hi> Kings Succeeding, are grafted into the Family of <hi>AEnaeas,</hi> by a Line not so questionable as <hi>Brutes,</hi> namely, the Kings of <hi>Alba,</hi> called all <hi>SILVII,</hi> and the undoubted Off-spring of that <hi>Silvius Posthumus,</hi> upon whom <hi>Brute</hi> cannot with reason be Fathered.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let them consider, that the Line of the <hi>British</hi> Kings, at <hi>Silvius,</hi> begins to be strangely confused, the Lineal descent being ended in himself, and a Collateral one begun; so that although <hi>Silvius</hi> be made the Brother of <hi>Gurgast,</hi> yet I take it to make much to my purpose, that he is not made his Son according to the way the <hi>British</hi> History is over fond of.</p>
                  <p>Let them consider likewise, what Wars and Tumults are reported, in the daies of <hi>Silvius</hi> and his Successour <hi>Jago,</hi> the constant Accidents attending new Invaders; and seeing, that <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> could venture to place and displace Kings at his pleasure, inverting, in many places, the long received Order of the <hi>British</hi> History, and yet deserve commendation for it, I hope I cannot be much blamed for setting down my Conjecture, which although it be new, yet it doth not derogate in the least from the Honour of the <hi>Britains,</hi> being derived from the same Head, although in a different Channel; And I doubt not, that any would willingly deny them either the Off-spring of <hi>AEnaeas,</hi> or the Reliques of <hi>Troy,</hi> if he could make out their Title to that Original, by any other means than <hi>Brute.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> SILVIUS the First King of <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> who descended from the Kings of ALBA, and not from BRUTE.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SILVIUS,</hi> the first King of <hi>Britain,</hi> is supposed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from the Kings of <hi>Alba,</hi> and to have forsaken his <note place="margin">SILVIUS, <hi>the first K. of</hi> BRITAIN, <hi>A. M. 3287. Olymp. 4.</hi>
                  </note> Country under one of those two great Revolutions of State, the former of which was caused by the Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Amulius</hi> upon his Brother <hi>Numitor,</hi> the latter by the vindication of <hi>Numitor's</hi> Right by his Nephews, <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, <hi>Silvius</hi> seems rather to proceed from <hi>Amulius</hi> than <hi>Numitor,</hi> upon the account that <hi>Numitor's</hi> Issue was destroyed by <hi>Amulius,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Ilia</hi> made a Vestal <hi>Nun,</hi> so that none of <hi>Numitor's</hi> Male-Issue surviving, this <hi>Silvius</hi> appears the Son of <hi>Amulius,</hi> who upon the deprivation of his Father might seek out new Fortunes.</p>
               <p>The Reasons that make this seem probable to me are these;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Intercourse of the <hi>British</hi> Histories mentioned between the Kings of <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> and that very Intercourse must needs be about this time by the very Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances produced by those Histories themselves; For by their own confession, it was in those daies when the <hi>Sabines</hi> denied their Daughters in Marriage to the House of <hi>AEnaeas,</hi> which happened not (according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Histories) till the daies of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:58825:92"/>
               <p n="2">2. There hath been such an Intercourse between both Nations, that they seem to allow it, who have derived <hi>Britain</hi> from a Country in <hi>Italy</hi> of the same Name, as in <hi>Polybius</hi> and other Authors is seen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The time of <hi>Silvius</hi> his Reign salleth about the <hi>Greeks</hi> first coming into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> namely, about the daies of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> at the beginning of the <hi>Historical</hi> Age, nigh the first <hi>Olympiad;</hi> Then it is that we find <hi>Silvius</hi> mentioned in the <hi>British</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, just upon the dissolution of the Line of the <hi>Alba</hi> Kings, called <hi>SILVII.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is probable the Family of <hi>AEnaeas</hi> might (by Ancient Tradition) be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered down to Govern this Island in Ancient times, which Tradition, by <hi>BRUTE,</hi> cannot possibly be made out, nor so likely by any King as this <hi>SILVIUS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. We find that the <hi>Transmigration</hi> of the Soul was taught by the <hi>Druids</hi> of this Island, insomuch that <hi>Lipsius</hi> saith, That he knoweth not whether they learnt it of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> or he of them.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Pythagoras</hi> lived (by the consent of most Writers) not long after those daies of <hi>Silvius,</hi> if not equal with him, for who (in things of so vast a distance) can cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Time exactly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There are many words in the <hi>British</hi> Language taken notice of, which, (in great reason) seem to be derived from the Kingdom of the <hi>Latins,</hi> and shew from thence their Original, which words were out of use before <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> time, and so could not be introduced by him.</p>
               <p>The Old <hi>Latins</hi> called Deformed persons <hi>Meriones,</hi> the <hi>Cambro-Britains</hi> at this day do call ugly and Rustick Women, <hi>Metrtones.</hi> The Old <hi>Latins</hi> call Deceit, <hi>Falla,</hi> the <hi>Cambro-Britains, Faell.</hi> The Old <hi>Latins</hi> called a Great eater, <hi>Glutton</hi> and <hi>Gluvia,</hi> the <hi>Cambro-Britains, Glwth.</hi> The Old <hi>Latins</hi> called a Dug, <hi>Ruma,</hi> the <hi>Cambro-Britains, Rhumen.</hi> The Old <hi>Latins</hi> called the Chief Magistrate of the <hi>Osci, Meddix,</hi> and with the <hi>Cambro-Britains, Meddu</hi> signifieth to be in Authority and Power. The Old <hi>Latins</hi> called a Fool, <hi>Dalivus,</hi> the <hi>Cambro-Britains</hi> say <hi>Delff,</hi> a stupid Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The Old <hi>Latins</hi> said <hi>Clueo, I hear,</hi> the <hi>Cambro-Britains</hi> call Hearing, <hi>Clyn,</hi> and <hi>to hear, Clywed,</hi> to which are added many Ancient Names of the Old <hi>Latins,</hi> which have some signification in the <hi>British. Clodius, Clod,</hi> Praise; <hi>Drusus, Drws,</hi> a Door; <hi>Sylla, Syllu,</hi> to See; <hi>Celius, Celu,</hi> to Hide; <hi>Cornelius, Cornel,</hi> a Corner; <hi>Marcus, March,</hi> a Horse; <hi>Silanus, Silyn,</hi> an Off-spring; <hi>Cinna, Cynne</hi> or <hi>Cynnew,</hi> to Burn. The Names of Women, <hi>Mammea, Man,</hi> Mother; <hi>Livia, Lliw,</hi> Colour; and many more, which are left to the <hi>Britains</hi> to find out, who best understand their own Language.</p>
               <p>The Introduction of all which words into <hi>Britain</hi> cannot so well be attributed to <hi>Brutus</hi> (had there ever been such a Person) as to this <hi>Silvius,</hi> upon the account that <hi>Brute</hi> was not so long in <hi>Italy</hi> to learn the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, neither can the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue be supposed to have been in those daies (as most Learned persons do think) any other, than a Dialect of the <hi>Greek,</hi> which mixing afterwards with the <hi>Sabins</hi> and <hi>Etruscans,</hi> became to be the Original of that Tongue, afterwards most in use in <hi>Italy,</hi> so that <hi>Brute</hi> being excluded, none can be found so likely as <hi>Silvius,</hi> to be the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of it into <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Seventhly</hi> and lastly, The <hi>Cassiterides</hi> we find are called <hi>Scilly</hi> Islands, whether from the first Arrival of this Prince, which may be supposed in those parts upon the account of Trade, or from the Rock <hi>Sylla,</hi> upon the Coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> is uncertain, but the former Opinion seems most likely, so that I shall conclude, seeing that the time (doth very well accord) of the Expulsion of <hi>Silvius Amulius,</hi> and the Landing of this <hi>Silvius</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> and seeing an Alliance between the two Kingdoms of <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> is absurdly imagined before this time, and with great Reason may be referred hither, for seeing <hi>Varro's</hi> Historical Age now beginneth, and some Records of the <hi>Greeks</hi> remain relating to these daies, I will venture to begin the Historical Age with <hi>Silvius,</hi> not condemning all the Traditions of the <hi>Britains</hi> about <hi>AEnaeas</hi> and <hi>Troy,</hi> nor yet justifying every thing in those Histories of the following Kings; But this I will say, That many things in them contained may be Truth, although Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulously written. For about this time, as I said before, the <hi>Grecians</hi> began to keep Records, and much about the same time began their Voyages into <hi>Britain,</hi> as may be seen in the fore-going Antiquities.</p>

               <p>The Line of <hi>SILVIUS</hi> from <hi>NOAH</hi> may be reckoned thus:

               <p>This King <hi>SILVIUS,</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> History, is also named <hi>SILIUS.</hi> Nothing is Recorded of his fifteen years Reign but Brawls and Tumults, and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> calls him also <hi>Sicilius,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Gurgust,</hi> when as others make him his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which difference demonstrates the Line of <hi>Brute</hi> but loosly fastned about this place.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>SICILIUS</hi> his Son then did succeed,</l>

                        <hi>Harding,</hi> the Old Poet.</note> In whose time each man did other oppress.</l>
                  <l>The Law, and Peace, was exil'd so indeed;</l>
                  <l>That Civil wars, and slaughter (of Men express)</l>
                  <l>Was in every part of the Land, without redress,</l>
                  <l>And Murtherers foul, through all his Land daily,</l>
                  <l>Without redress, or any other remedy.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Most agree that this King reigned nine and forty years, some say but two, a vast difference and not econcileable, unless the distinction of <hi>Entrance</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> be allowed; But of this I shall say no more, but proceed to his Cozin <hi>Jago.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>JAGO,</hi> Cozin to <hi>Silvius</hi> (although in all likelyhood not akin at all, this being a <hi>Phoenician</hi> name) began his Reign in the year of the World 3336, and died of a Lethargy, without Issue, after he had reigned twenty eight years, leaving nothing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable behind him but his <hi>Tyranny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>KINIMAGUS,</hi> or <hi>Kimmacus,</hi> according to most likelyhood Son of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> but others will needs have him Brother of <hi>Jago,</hi> succeeded <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3364. There is nothing Recorded of this Prince, but that he was buried at <hi>York</hi> after he had reigned four and fifty years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GORBODUG,</hi> the Son of <hi>Kinimacus,</hi> the fourth from <hi>Silvins, An. Mundi</hi> 3418, is stigmatized with the same reproach of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and was buried at <hi>Troy-novant</hi> after he had Ruled (rather to compleat the account of Histories, than in truth) sixty three years. He left behind him two Sons, <hi>Ferrex</hi> and <hi>Porrex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FERREX,</hi> and <hi>PORREX,</hi> began joyntly to reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3476. This is the third time that the Kingdom fell not entirely to the Elder Brother.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>As after the Laws of <hi>Troy,</hi> the Sovereignty,</l>
                  <l>
                     <note place="margin">Harding.</note> And all resort of Right, doth appertain</l>
                  <l>To the Eldest Brother; in Property,</l>
                  <l>The Eldest Sisters right, so by right should have been</l>
                  <l>Soveraign Lady, and over them all, Queen</l>
                  <l>By equitee of that ilk Law and Right,</l>
                  <l>In place where it is holden Law perfeight.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>These Brothers for five years in great Amity ruled the Island, until <hi>Porrex</hi> the younger, inflamed with the Ambition of being sole Governour, attempts privately upon the life of <hi>Ferrex;</hi> But it seems, <hi>Ferrex</hi> had notice given him of his Brothers design, thought it proved not so timely as to give opportunity to avoid the stroak by any other way than flight; <hi>Gallia</hi> was esteemed the nighest and securest retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where Arriving, he sollicits the Princes of that Realm, and especially <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardus,</hi> or <hi>Suardus,</hi> to assist him in vindicating his Right to the Crown.</p>
               <p>This just Request being obtained, he returns into <hi>Britain,</hi> and with a mighty Army gives his Brother battle; Fortune not favouring the just and equitableness of his cause, his Army was defeated, and in the Battle himself lost his life.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:58825:93"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Porrex</hi> enjoyed not long his unnatural Conquest, for his own Mother <hi>Idone,</hi> or <hi>Widen,</hi> looking upon him as the bloody murtherer of her Son <hi>Ferrex,</hi> by a deed no less Barbarous, prosecutes her Revenge, for finding <hi>Porrex</hi> asleep, privately murthered him; neither could Motherly pity asswage her Anger, until she had cut and mangled his Body in a thousand pieces; For this unnatural and much admired Cruelty, she was slain by the sury of the Multitude.</p>
               <p>This extinguisht the House of <hi>Gorboduc,</hi> and periodized the Line of <hi>AEnaeas,</hi> insomuch as the Kingdom fell into innumerable divisions, from thence into a Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy. One seized <hi>Loegria,</hi> another <hi>Cambria,</hi> a third <hi>Cornwal,</hi> a fourth <hi>Albania,</hi> and the fifth division is not specified distinctly by any Authors, but is supposed to be <hi>Northumberland</hi> or <hi>Kent,</hi> which in old Pedigrees their names are cited to be these,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>RUDAUCUS King of Wales.</l>
                  <l>CLOTENUS King of Cornwal.</l>
                  <l>PINNOR King of Loegria.</l>
                  <l>STATORIUS King of Scotland.</l>
                  <l>YEVAN King of Northumberland.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Histories make particular mention of <hi>Pinnor,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Pireman,</hi> King of <hi>Loegria,</hi> and of <hi>Rudacus</hi> King of <hi>Cambria, Staterus</hi> King of <hi>Albania, Cloten</hi> King of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> but are silent in the other Princes names.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Heptarchy</hi> is conjectured to have continued One and fifty years, until <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallo</hi> Son of <hi>Cloten</hi> King of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> whether by the clearest Right and Title, or the longest Sword, obtained the whole Kingdom, is uncertain.</p>
               <p>According to the foregoing Computation, we need not with <hi>Polidore Virgil,</hi> invert the Order of the <hi>British</hi> History in this place, but continue the succession of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy from this Period with <hi>Guintolin,</hi> and not <hi>Donvallo Molmutius;</hi> For allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Molmutius</hi> to follow immediately after the Heptarchy, his two Sons <hi>Belinus</hi> and <hi>Brennus</hi> will be found to be Kings of <hi>Britain</hi> about the time when <hi>Rome</hi> was sackt, and so may not be obliged to set those two Princes any farther backward, as <hi>Polidore</hi> hath done three hundred years, but rather a little more forward; For from the Entrance of <hi>Brute, Anno Mundi</hi> 2850, to <hi>Belinus</hi> and <hi>Brennus, Anno Mundi</hi> 3574, are 724 years, whereas <hi>Rome</hi> is supposed to be sackt in the seven hundred and tenth year after <hi>Brutes</hi> Arrival, as is gathered by <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> out of <hi>Eusebius.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P. Virgil <hi>ex</hi> Euseb.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This Controversie, with some others, relating to the same <hi>Belinus</hi> and <hi>Brennus,</hi> is particularly managed by Sr. <hi>John Price</hi> against <hi>Polidore Virgil,</hi> as also by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But seeing the true evidence of this matter is to be made out by Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <note place="margin">Sr. <hi>Joh. Prices</hi> Hist. of Brit.</note> which account in seven hundred years, according to diversity of Authors, differ half in half, it is the safer way, in my Judgment, to follow the usual method in the Succession of the <hi>British</hi> Kings, than by the dependance of the uncertainty of <hi>Chronology,</hi> in things of so vast a distance, to invert the whole Order of their Reigns, and so like Witches, who would conjure them out of the World, read them backwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOLMUTIUS,</hi> called <hi>Du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nvallo,</hi> Son of <hi>Cloten,</hi> King of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> either judging himself to have the better Right or longer Sword, invaded his Neighbour Princes.</p>
               <p>First he began with <hi>Pinnor</hi> King of <hi>Loegria,</hi> whom he overcame and slew, before he could joyn with his Confederates, <hi>Rudacus</hi> King of <hi>Cambria,</hi> and <hi>Staterius</hi> King of <hi>Albania;</hi> After this success he sets upon the fore-mentioned Princes with an Army of thirty thousand Men, but the Victory hanging too long for his eager expectation, he made use of a stratagem, for counterfeiting the Arms of his Enemies, he gave them a terrible overthrow in the Encounter.</p>

               <p>The King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> or <hi>Kent,</hi> is not mentioned in this Battle, wherefore he is supposed, beforehand, to have surrendred his Kingdom. By thismeans <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutius Dunvallo,</hi> called also <hi>Donebant,</hi> became the sole Monarch of this Island, <hi>Anne Mundi</hi> 3529.</p>
               <p>If he got the Crown by Oppression, he managed it with no less prudence and moderation, enacting several excellent Laws, translated out of the <hi>British</hi> Speech into the <hi>Latin,</hi> by <hi>Gildas,</hi> and afterwards out of the <hi>Latin</hi> into the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, by <hi>Alfred</hi> King of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>He is supposed to build <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> and two neighbouring Castles, <hi>Lacoc</hi> and <hi>Tetbury; Malmsbury</hi> was called by him <hi>Caer Bladon,</hi> but upon what account Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors make no mention.

               <p>He is reported the first Prince of <hi>Britain,</hi> that was enstalled with the Rites and Ceremonies of <hi>Coronation,</hi> wearing a Golden Crown, and other Kingly Ornaments at his solemn Inauguration, a Custome neglected by his Predecessors, as having more Right, and so needed less state and formality.</p>
               <p>Having Reigned forty years, and appointed his two Sons his Successors, He departed this life, and was buried in the Temple of <hi>Concord,</hi> in <hi>Troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novant.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>BELINUS</hi> and <hi>BRENNUS</hi> being left Co-heirs of the Kingdom by their Father, fell to the dividing of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belinus</hi> gave to his younger Brother <hi>Albania,</hi> reserving to himself all the sair Possessions on this side the <hi>Hamber;</hi> This division being so Ancient and equal yet contented not <hi>Brennus,</hi> whose Ambition aimed at higher matters, to the effecting of which, after seven years peacable Reign, he endeavoured to strengthen himself with powerful Allies, and to that purpose sails into <hi>Norway</hi> (after he had, according to some, secured his Interest in <hi>Armorica,</hi> called <hi>Britain,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Allobroges</hi>) here he marrieth the Daughter of the <hi>Norwegian</hi> King, <hi>Elsin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Belinus</hi> hearing of these Actions of his Brother, and doubting the Consequence, especially because he understood him to be a Feudatory Prince, and so bound to give an account before hand of his Actions, entred and seized all his Dominions, securing his Forts and Navies; <hi>Brennus</hi> advised of this prepares for his Return, and was attended with the Navy Royal of <hi>Norway,</hi> accompanied with a mighty Army.</p>
               <p>After a few daies sail, he was set upon by <hi>Guilthdacus</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who had been a long Suitor to the Daughter of <hi>Elsin</hi> King of <hi>Norway;</hi> In this Conflict the <hi>Norwegian</hi> Fleet was worsted, and the Ship wherein the new Bride was conveyed is taken, but <hi>Brennus</hi> escapes by flight.</p>
               <p>Afterwards it happened that a mighty Storm arising, <hi>Guilthdacus,</hi> by force of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was driven upon the Coast of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> where he was detained by <hi>Belinus.</hi> In some reasonable time after that, <hi>Brennus</hi> having recollected his scatter'd Navy, and new Rigg'd, and furnished his Ships with Men and Provisions, he sent to his Brother <hi>Belyn</hi> to restore him his Wife and Possessions, injuriously by him detained; this Request being denied notwithstanding the Justness, occasioned him to Land in <hi>Albania,</hi> and marching up into the Country, at a Wood named <hi>Calater</hi> he met and Encountered with his Brother, but was overcome to the utter ruine of all his Army, so that with twelve only of his Retinue he fled into <hi>Gallia</hi> (whether this was his first or second Voyage thither is uncertain) where he found kind entertainment from <hi>Seguinus,</hi> or <hi>Seginus,</hi> King of <hi>Armorica,</hi> or <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst he was securing his Interest in that Nation, <hi>Belinus</hi> his Brother calls a Councel of his Kingdom, where it was debated what Proceedings to use towards the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and finally concluded, that he should enjoy his Liberty upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Homage to the King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and paying a yearly Tribute to the value of a thousand pound, which being agreed to by that King, sor himself and Successors, he was honourably dismissed.</p>
               <p>After these happy Successes, <hi>Belyn</hi> set himself to the finishing of that great Work begun by his Father <hi>Dunwallo,</hi> the making and paving four great High-waies through his Kingdom of <hi>Loegria,</hi> now called <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is named <hi>Foss,</hi> and beginneth at the Corner of <hi>Totness</hi> in <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and passeth through <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> and so to <hi>Coventry, Leicester,</hi> and from thence (as <hi>Ranulph,</hi> a Monk of <hi>Chester</hi> recordeth) through the Wastes to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark,</hi> and ended at <hi>Lincoin.</hi> But what these <hi>Wastes</hi> should be, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> is at a <note place="margin">Ranulph, <hi>a Monk.</hi>

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:58825:95"/>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> Way is named <hi>Watling street,</hi> and runneth South-east into North-east, and crosseth the <hi>Foss.</hi> It beginneth at <hi>Dover,</hi> and passeth by the middle of <hi>Kent,</hi> over the <hi>Thames</hi> beside <hi>London,</hi> by West of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and so on by Sr. <hi>Albans,</hi> and by the West-side of <hi>Dunstable, Stratford, Toucester</hi> and <hi>Wedon,</hi> and by South <hi>Killingborn,</hi> or <hi>Killebourn,</hi> by <hi>Athriston</hi> to <hi>Gilbert's</hi> Hill, that now is named <hi>Wrekin,</hi> and so by <hi>Severn,</hi> passing beside <hi>Worcester,</hi> and thence to <hi>Stratton,</hi> and so to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Wales</hi> to a place called <hi>Cardigan</hi> on the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> Way is named <hi>Erming street.</hi> This goeth from West North west, unto East South-east, and beginneth at <hi>Menevia</hi> at St. <hi>Davids</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> and runneth on to <hi>Southampton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth, Hekencldis-street,</hi> or <hi>Kikeneldis-street,</hi> which goeth forth by <hi>Worcester, Wickham, Bermingham, Leichfield, Darby, Chester-field,</hi> and by <hi>York</hi> to <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time <hi>Brennus</hi> had got so sar into favour with <hi>Seginus</hi> the Duke of <hi>Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> that he married his Daughter, and by the consent of his Nobles, in case he failed of Issue-Male, the same Duke was admitted Heir of the Crown, and not long after by the death of the said Prince, he was accordingly received as their lawful Prince, all States of the Realm swearing Fealty to him.</p>
               <p>Being now in the possession of a Kingdom, <hi>Brennus</hi> raiseth a powerful Army, and Lands in <hi>Britain,</hi> intending to revenge the wrongs done him by his Brother <hi>Belyn;</hi> And now was it that both Armies were ready to give Battle, when their Mother <hi>Conwenna</hi> interposed as a Mediatress between them, and by her many tears and powerful perswasions brought them to a Friendly accord, so that embracing each other, they were heartily Reconciled, to the exceeding joy of all Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>After their Arrival at <hi>Troy-Novant,</hi> they consulted which way best to employ their Armies, where the motion was made by <hi>Brennus,</hi> and accepted by <hi>Belinus,</hi> to joyn Forces, and undertake the Conquest of all <hi>Gallia,</hi> which Enterprize was attended with a Fortune beyond expectation; For they did not only Conquer all <hi>Gallia</hi> but <hi>Italy,</hi> and great part of <hi>Germany</hi> also, and in the end sacked <hi>Rome</hi> it self, where (some say) <hi>Brennus</hi> lost his life; others, that he survived that great and general Overthrow.</p>
               <p>Some make <hi>Belinus</hi> a Partner with him in his Greatness, others say, he went not into <hi>Gallia</hi> with him, or if he did, that he soon returned, leaving the management of all those Forreign employments to the Conduct of his Brother <hi>Brennus,</hi> whom we will leave to the Histories of the <hi>Romans</hi> (as if so be this were the same <hi>Brennus</hi> that sackt <hi>Rome</hi>) to receive what Fate in most probability is assigned to him.</p>

                  <hi>BELYN,</hi> now absolute Monarch of <hi>Britain,</hi> sets himself to the beautifying of his Dominions. He built <hi>Caerleon</hi> upon <hi>Uske,</hi> called from thence <hi>Caer Uske,</hi> and <hi>Caer Huth,</hi> where he placed an Arch-Flamen; He also adorned <hi>Troy-novant,</hi> with a Gate, called to this day <hi>Belings-Gate,</hi> on the top of which he caused a Tower to be made, and at the Basis or Foundation thereof, an Harbour for Ships to Ride in.</p>
               <p>He is said to be the first Founder of the <hi>Tower of London;</hi> After he had Reigned two and twenty years he died, being the first of all the <hi>British</hi> Kings whose Corps was consumed in a Funeral-pile, and his Ashes carefully gathered in a Brazen, some say, a Golden Urne, and preserved on the highest Pinnacle of the Gate or Arch he had built, as some think, for that purpose.</p>

                  <hi>GURGUINT,</hi> Sir-named <hi>Brabtruc,</hi> according to others, <hi>Barbarous,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Red-beard;</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Chronicle calleth him <hi>Corinbratus,</hi> and was the Son of <hi>Belyn,</hi> and succeeded him <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 1596.</p>
               <p>In his daies the <hi>Danes</hi> refused the payment of their Tribute, whereupon he sailed into <hi>Denmark,</hi> and, by sorce of Arms, obliging them to renew their Treaty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Homage of their Kings and Chief Nobility, then Embarked again for <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his Return he met with a Fleet of thirty Sail about the Isle of <hi>Orkney,</hi> these he Encounter'd, and having taken their Captain <hi>Bartholoin,</hi> or <hi>Partholoin,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58825:95"/>
of him what he was, and the reasons of his Adventures into those Parts. <hi>Partholoin</hi> answers, <hi>That He and his Followers were named</hi> Balences, <hi>or</hi> Basclenses, <hi>and were Exiles of</hi> Spain, <hi>and banished their Country with their Wives and Children, and thereupon struck out to Sea to seek out an Habitation.</hi> It is said the King gave them <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being a place not then Peopled.</p>
               <p>After his Arrival into <hi>Britain,</hi> the King made it his business to establish and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Laws of his Ancestors, and in his Reign that Famous University of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> was Founded, by <hi>Cantaber,</hi> Brother of <hi>Bartholin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This King also built <hi>Caer-werith,</hi> or <hi>Lancaster, Caer-Peris,</hi> or <hi>Porchester,</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> the Seat of a Flamen, and <hi>Caer-Gaurvie,</hi> now <hi>Warwick,</hi> where he was buried after he had reigned nineteen years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GUINTELINUS,</hi> or <hi>Guintellus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gurguint,</hi> was Crowned King <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3615; He was a Prince learned, prudent, and of singular Justice and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that which conduceth more to the Glory of his Reign, was, that he was blest with a Lady with no less Endowments and Excellencies, her names was <hi>Martia;</hi> From this Lady, that Law called <hi>Mathehelage,</hi> or <hi>Marchenelaghe,</hi> had its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Name translated by King <hi>Alphred,</hi> out of the <hi>British</hi> into the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue. Mr. <hi>Hollinshead</hi> wonders and admires at Providence, that two such wise Princes should come at once to the management of the Kingdom, especially at a time when so many Civil Discords were reigning; But I find none of these Civil Discords reigning, either in his own, his Fathers, Grandfathers, or Great-Grandfathers daies. 'Tis true <hi>Belyn</hi> had War with his Brother, but in a few years it was wholly ended, to the great satisfaction of them both. Where then are these Civil Discords? Indeed <hi>Polidore Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> out of his great Providence placeth this King before his Great-Grandfather, which I suppose he did for the wonderful wisdom of this Prince and his Wife, whom he thought best able to end the Civil dissensions caused by the <hi>Pentarchy,</hi> and therefore where <hi>Polidore</hi> admires the wonderful Providence of God, we ought to take him as applauding his own Invention, for never before him was ever such an Invention made for the stating of the <hi>British</hi> Kings; But Mr. <hi>Hollinshead,</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth on the Received course of the Succession, ought not to complain of Civil Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in this Kings Reign, because they had been long since ended. And this I take notice of more especially, because I find the same Errour in other Authors, who have written after <hi>Polidore,</hi> which was grounded from the delight of their own Fancies, rather than to deliver the truth exactly down to the People.</p>
               <p>This King Reigned twenty six years and was Interr'd at <hi>Troy-Novant,</hi> now <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SICILIUS</hi> the second, and Son of <hi>Guintolin,</hi> being about seven years of Age, was received as King, under the Regency of his Mother <hi>Martia, Anno Mundi</hi> 3641, and it seemeth, that those Laws called <hi>Martiae</hi> were exacted by this Queen, during the Minority of her Son, rather than in the life of her Husband.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Count Palatine</hi> will have this King to have reigned fifteen years alone, but it is generally thought he Governed not above fifteen in all, seven under the Tuition of his Mother, and eight after his full Age, and having given the signs of a hopeful Prince, he was suddenly snatcht out of this World by Death, and then the Government fell to</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>KIMARUS,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sicilius,</hi> who began his Reign over <hi>Britain A. M.</hi> 3656, and being of a wild and ungoverned disposition, as given up to all manner of Lusts and Exorbitances, was kill'd in the Woods, in his pursuit after his game of Hunting, some say by an ambush of Men, others, by Wild Beasts. He reigned but three years, and was buried at <hi>Caer-leon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ELANIUS,</hi> or <hi>Danius</hi> his Brother, succeeded <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3659; this King was not inferiour to his Predecessor in wickedness of his life, in so much as some Chronicles make him one and the same Person, sor so exactly did these two Princes correspond in their Vices. He held the Scepter ten years, then</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MORINDUS,</hi> bastard Son of <hi>Elanius,</hi> by his Concubine <hi>Tonguestula,</hi> was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Crown <hi>A. M.</hi> 3669, a Man of great strength, neat proportion of Body and of beautiful Features. As to the quality of his mind he was liberal and bountiful, but withal exceeding passionate. In his daies the <hi>Moriani,</hi> or rather <hi>Morini,</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Gaul,</hi> Landing in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> with fire and sword wasted that Country, which <hi>Morindus</hi> hearing of, with all expedition gathered up his Forces, and with long and wearisom Marches, made up to them, and in one battle utterly defeated them.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:58825:96"/>
               <p>It is said (in this Encounter) <hi>Morindus</hi> shewed all the signs of personal Courage, Anger and Revenge, lifting him up beyond the common ability of Humane nature. The Captives that were taken felt the severity of his wrath, being every one of them (by several exquisite and new devised Tortures) sacrificed to his severe Resentments, so that in the punishment of these Miserable wretches, it is a question whether he shewed more his Skill or his Cruelty. Going along the Sea-coast for his Recreation, he espied a hideous Monster arising out of the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, which immediately seized and devoured many, who for their pleasures were walking upon the shoar; The King beholding the lamentable destruction of his Subjects, put Spurs to his Horse, and with great fury and haste assailed this Devourer; The Contest held a long time doubtful, but at last great was the joy and shoutings of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators to see this Monster fall, but in the end greater was their sorrow when they saw the King with his fall overwhelmed and destroyed.</p>
               <p>This happened in the ninth year of his Reign. He left five Sons behind him, <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomannus, Archigallo, Elidurus, Vigenius</hi> and <hi>Peridurus.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>He is said to build <hi>Grantham</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and some say <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Anciently called <hi>Granta, Caer-Grant,</hi> and <hi>Grant-chester,</hi> although others will have it built by <hi>Cantaber,</hi> and walled about by a Count named <hi>Grantinus,</hi> see <hi>Cambria Triumphans,</hi> page 68.

                  <hi>ARCHIGALLO,</hi> the second Son of <hi>Morindus,</hi> succeeded his Brother <hi>Gorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus, Anno Mundi</hi> 3688. He endeavoured to depress theNobility by depriving them of all Power and Command, to which purpose he contrived Plots, and then discovered them, having his Engins secretly employed, who at any time would accuse (whom they pleased) of Delinquency, or at least dissatisfaction to the present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; These pretended Crimes they redeemed with great Fines, and intollerable Compositions for their Estates. Many other things he committed, as the advancing of Unworthy persons to Dignities and Offices, and the spoiling and robbing of his Richest Subjects, for all which he was Deposed after one years Government. Upon this</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ELIDURE</hi> his Brother was (with the general consent and applause of the whole Realm) chosen King <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3689. He was called by his Subjects, <hi>Elidure the Meek.</hi>

               <p>Hunting one day in the Wood <hi>Calater,</hi> in the Thicket of the Wilderness he espied his Brother <hi>Archigallo,</hi> and being struck with pitty of his Misfortune, he secretly conveighed him home to his House at the City <hi>Aldud,</hi> or <hi>Acliud,</hi> where feigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sick, he assembled, by his Writ, all the Nobles of his Realm, and there, partly by Perswasions, and partly by Commands, he engaged them to receive again his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Archigallo</hi> for their lawful Soveraign, afterwards calling an Assembly of his Commons at <hi>York,</hi> he there publickly resigned his Crown, and taking it off his own Head, placed it on his Brother <hi>Archigallo's,</hi> after he had Reigned three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARCHIGALLO</hi> being restored to his Crown, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3692, by his wise and sober deportment, he redeemed the Affections of the Nobility, and the love of his People. He discards his former Favourites, and adheres to the sage and prudent Advice of the best of his Nobility, and Reigning to the general liking of all his Subjects for the space of ten years, he died and was buried at <hi>Caerbranck</hi> at <hi>York.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Elidurus,</hi> after the death of his Brother was lawful King of this Island, and so with much Honour and Reputation received the second time the Crown, <hi>An. Mundi</hi> 3702, but was soon deposed by the Ambition of his Brothers, <hi>Vigenius</hi> and <hi>Peridurus,</hi> after one years Government, when being seized by them, and his Person confined to the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> they divided the Kingdom. <hi>Peridurus</hi> received <hi>Albania,</hi> and <hi>Vige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Country on this side <hi>Humber.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vigenius</hi> died after he had reigned seven years, so that the whole Kingdom came to <hi>Peridurus,</hi> who managed it (as some write) with great Moderation and Justice; as others say, with Tyranny and Oppression, but he died not till after he had
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58825:96"/>
Governed nine years in all, and then was buried at <hi>Pykering,</hi> a Town he himself had built.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elidurus</hi> again resumed the Crown, being delivered out of Prison, where, some say, he was confined by his own Election, and not by the Injustice of his Brothers; This was in the year of the World 3712, and after he had Reigned four years, to the general applause of all men.</p>
               <p>He died and was buried at <hi>Caerlisle.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>EMERIANUS,</hi> another Son of <hi>Archigallo,</hi> was advanced to the Crown <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3740. He was of a quite contrary disposition to his Brother, so that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by Will and Pleasure, and not according to Law, he was laid aside after he had sat in the Throne seven years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>YDWALLO,</hi> the Son of <hi>Vigenius,</hi> followed <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3747. By the Example and Misfortune of his Predecessor, he avoided Tyranny, and held the Scepter twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>RINCO,</hi> the Son of <hi>Peridurus,</hi> an Heroick Prince, and a great Warriour, assumed the Royal Dignity <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3767, and reigned sixteen years.</p>

                  <hi>GERUNTIUS,</hi> the Son of <hi>Elidurus,</hi> followed him <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3783. He gave life to the Laws of his Predecessor, and Governed with Justice and Moderation for the space of twenty years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CATELLUS,</hi> his Son, reigned after him in the year of the World 3803; he was the great Patron of the Poor and Distressed, insomuch as he hanged all such as were their Oppressors. He reigned ten years and was buried at <hi>Winchester.</hi>

                  <hi>CHERIMUS,</hi> Sirnamed the Drunkard, succeeded <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3828, and swayed the Scepter one year. Then succeeded</p>

                  <hi>FULGENTIUS,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Cherimus, Anno Mundi</hi> 3829, and reigned also but one year, after him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ELDRED,</hi> the second Son of <hi>Cherimus,</hi> reigned another year more, <hi>Anno Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi> 3830.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANDROGEUS,</hi> the third Son of <hi>Cherimus,</hi> enjoyed the Government another year, being 3831.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>URIANUS,</hi> the Son of <hi>Androgeus,</hi> began his reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3831, and he lived three years, and in that time gave himself to all Riot and Intemperance.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>DETONUS, A.

               <p>
                  <hi>BLEDGABREDUS</hi> succeeded, <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3861; He so far exceeded all men (saith the <hi>Count Palatine</hi>) in the Art of <hi>Singing,</hi> that he seemed to be the God of <hi>Musick,</hi> and besides his skill in Vocal, saith <hi>Galfridus,</hi> he was expert in all Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental harmony. He reigned ten years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ARCHIMALUS</hi> succeeded, he was the Brother of <hi>Bledgabredus,</hi> and Ruled two years.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ELDOLUS</hi> began his Government <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3873, and Reigned four years. In his daies many Prodigies in the Heavens (as flakes of Fire breaking through the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, loud Noises) appeared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>RODIANUS,</hi> or <hi>Redian,</hi> succeeded, and reigned two years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>REDARGIUS, Count Palat.</hi> calls <hi>Roderecius,</hi> he reigned three years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SAMULIUS</hi> was King two years, <hi>Penisillus</hi> three, <hi>Fabian</hi> saith, <hi>Samulius Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillus</hi> was the same Person, and reigned five years.</p>

                  <hi>PYRRHUS, Pyrrus,</hi> or <hi>Phyrrus,</hi> according to <hi>Fabian,</hi> was King two years, and <hi>CAPORIUS</hi> two years, after him</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>DINELLUS,</hi> the Son of <hi>Caporius, Fabian</hi> calls <hi>Glyguell Dinell,</hi> who began his Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3891. <hi>Com. Pal.</hi> commends him for many Princely Vertues, he reigned four years, and then died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HELI,</hi> his Successor, reigned not a year, so that we see the beginning of King <hi>LUDS</hi> Reign (who succeeded <hi>Heli</hi>) falls in the year of the World 3895, twenty years before <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> Arrival into this Island, who is supposed to have made it Tributary in the ninth year of <hi>Cassibelan</hi> the Successor of <hi>Lud,</hi> so that taking in the Eleven years of King <hi>Lud,</hi> and the Ninth of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> and we shall find the time to fall exactly.</p>
               <p>I know there is great difference in Authors, not only concerning the Names of these Princes but the Numbers of them, and the times of their Reigns, and thereby great confusion is made in the <hi>British</hi> History, but more especially from <hi>Elidure</hi> to <hi>Lud;</hi> But this Calculation I have faithfully gathered, by comparing the Authors of most Credit, and so have set down their Names as they are most generally Received; And seeing there is so little time allowed, from <hi>Elidure</hi> to <hi>Lud,</hi> for such a number of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being two or three and thirty, and but 186 years allotted for their Reigns, we cannot give <hi>Hely</hi> forty years, according to <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> but are forced to comply with others, who abridge him seven Months. Likewise <hi>Coel</hi> the First, by the <hi>Count Palatine,</hi> hath twenty years assigned him, whereas others allow him but ten.</p>
               <p>But to give my Opinion concerning this matter, I think that the making of so many Kings, from <hi>Elidure</hi> to <hi>Lud,</hi> to succeed one another, cannot agree either with Truth or Reason, for as also the latter Princes of this Catalogue, for above twenty years together, have not (excepting three or four of them) above one, two, or three years at most assigned them for their Reigns, so the Compilers of this History have been too profuse in the time they gave for the first Kings Reigns, and this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we consider <hi>Elidure</hi> died an Old man, in the year of the World (according to the best of their Computations) 3716. Yet we hear of a Son of his named <hi>Gurguntius,</hi> beginning his reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3783, that is sixty seven years after his Fathers death, and continuing his Reign twenty years, so that he lived in all after his Fathers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease eighty seven years; now allowing his Father to have begat him but twenty years before his death, which is but reasonable, considering his years, and we shall find <hi>Gurguntius</hi> to be 107 years Old, a prodigious Age, so <hi>Rimo</hi> lived seventy one years after the death of his Father <hi>Peridurus,</hi> so strangly prodigal were the Composers of this Genealogy to the former Princes, and so exceeding niggardly to the latter.</p>
               <p>It is more rational therefore to believe these Kings, not to have all of them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one another, but many of them to have been Rulers contemporary, of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Provinces of the Island, as the Government thereof was found to be, even twenty years after, at the Invasion of it by <hi>Julius Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>HELY</hi> built him a Palace, and resided most especially in that part of the Kingdom, called after his name <hi>Ely;</hi> but <hi>Bede</hi> derives the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> from <hi>Eels, Polidore l'irgil</hi> from the Greek <hi>Helos,</hi> signifying a <hi>Fennish</hi> or <hi>Morish</hi> Ground. <note place="margin">Beda.

               <p>
                  <hi>LUD,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Hely,</hi> began his Reign <hi>Anno Mundi</hi> 3895; He was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with all the excellent qualities belonging to a Prince, and is set down as an excellent Pattern of a wise and prudent Governour.</p>
               <p>Amongst the most remarkable Monuments of his Reign, was his Repairing or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58825:97"/>
building the Walls of <hi>Troy-novant,</hi> and on the West-side thereof erecting a most sumptuous and beautiful Gate, called at this day <hi>Lud-gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verstegan</hi> will by no means suffer that this Gate took its denomination from King <note place="margin">Verstegans <hi>Antiq.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Lud,</hi> because of the last termination of it, <hi>Gate,</hi> shews the Name to be of <hi>Saxon,</hi> and not <hi>British,</hi> Original; but <hi>Verstegan</hi> might have considered, that the <hi>Saxons,</hi> although they expressed the Names of many <hi>British</hi> Places by words of their own Language signifying the same thing, yet what could they substitute in the room of a proper Name, which remains alwaies the same in all Languages; Besides, he forgot clearly that there are many Places in <hi>England</hi> that remain mixed compounds of both the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongues. As for Example, <hi>Durham, Dunholne, Dorchester,</hi> and a thousand more I could name had I time, besides many Usages and Customes in <hi>England,</hi> which participate of both Languages alike. To instance, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds of <hi>Iavel,</hi> a <hi>British</hi> word, signifying a <hi>Tenure</hi> among the <hi>Welch,</hi> we find <hi>Gavel-kind, Sand-Gavel, Gavel Oat, Swine-Gavel,</hi> and many others; Why therefore may not <hi>Ludgate</hi> be <hi>Luds-Gate,</hi> although it hath both Languages mixt in it? Let us hear therefore <hi>Verstegan's</hi> ingenious Derivation; <hi>Ludgate</hi> (saith he) <hi>is as much as to say,</hi> Leodgate, <hi>or the</hi> Peoples-Gate, <hi>Leod signifying</hi> People.</p>
               <p>Here Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> asks him but a reasonable question; <hi>What, did the People</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Sheringham, <hi>de Orig. Angl.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>pass only through this Gate, and the</hi> Bards <hi>and</hi> Druids <hi>through the other only?</hi> And I may demand of him also, upon what grounds he supposeth the Concourse of <hi>People</hi> to have been greater through this Gate than any other.</p>
               <p>Indeed, since the Suburbs have been built and increased, above the greatness of the City, and since his MAJESTY and the late Kings of <hi>England,</hi> for many successions have been pleased to live in the Western parts of them, the Trade by necessity hath been drawn into these quarters, and so <hi>Ludgate</hi> hath been made the greatest Thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, but before the Suburbs were built, or before they were brought into Credit by his MAJESTIES Royal Person and Court, or when the Kings of <hi>England</hi> lived in the City it self, How came <hi>Ludgate</hi> to be the Gate of the <hi>People</hi> more than of the rest?</p>
               <p>Neither is <hi>Lelands</hi> Opinion any thing more to be embraced, who calleth it <hi>Flud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Leland.</note> from the little Rivolet running beneath it. It is a thousand pities (for the sake of this invention) that the Gate was not built upon the Rivulet, but now, as the case standeth, this most miserable Derivation is not to be helped out, but by a faith that is able to remove Mountains.</p>
               <p>Let therefore King <hi>Lud</hi> enjoy the Honour of that Structure, whose very mute Statue (as Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> saith) seems to call out against those who would deprive him of it.</p>
               <p>But besides these two Magnificent Works, the <hi>Wall</hi> and the <hi>Gate,</hi> this Prince is said to have taken such exceeding delight in this City, that he built himself a Palace not far from <hi>Ludgate,</hi> supposed by some, to have been in the place where the Bishop of <hi>Londons</hi> Palace stood, Others think, at <hi>Bernards</hi> Castle. he is thought to have built a Temple also not far from his Court, where St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cathedral afterwards stood, and by these great Works, and his continual residence in that City, the name of <hi>Troy-novant</hi> was changed into <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Lundain,</hi> that is, the residency of King <hi>Lud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>British</hi> Histories write, that the changing the name from <hi>Troy-novant</hi> into <hi>Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi> was the cause of great dissension between King <hi>Lud,</hi> and a bold Commander of those times, <hi>Nennius,</hi> who eagerly opposed this Innovation, whereby the Memory of <hi>Troy,</hi> which so long bad been preserved, would be utterly abolished; But this story is very much suspected of late to have been altogether Fabulous, and there are other Derivations given of the Name of that most Famous City.</p>

                  <hi>Cambden,</hi> who in the place of it puts down two Conjectures. The <hi>first</hi> is, That seeing the <hi>Britains</hi> called any place fenced with Trees, a <hi>Town,</hi> or <hi>City,</hi> which they expressed by the word <hi>Lihwn,</hi> that this City by way of Excellence might be named the <hi>Lihwn,</hi> and afterwards by corruption <hi>London.</hi> But the <hi>second</hi> is more probable, That it was called <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Lihong,</hi> signifying in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, a <hi>Ship,</hi> and <hi>Dinas</hi> in the same Language, a <hi>City,</hi> so that it is as much as <hi>the City of Ships;</hi> And to confirm this Opinion, he proves that it was called Anciently <hi>Longidinium,</hi> and by an Old British <hi>Bard, Lihong-Porth,</hi> that is, a <hi>Harbour of Ships.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:58825:98"/>
               <p>In my thoughts, this seems to be the truest Etymologie of that most honourable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which in all Ages hath been a place of great Traffick and Commerce with the whole World, and by the convenience of its Scituation upon so Navigable a River, can receive Ships of great Burthen, and in great Multitudes, so that the Masts of them appear to be what the <hi>Britains</hi> called <hi>Llhwun,</hi> namely, <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Forrests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As concerning the Name of <hi>TROY-Novant,</hi> by which this City is supposed to <note place="margin">The true deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Troy-novant.</hi>
                  </note> have formerly been called (because I am now taking my leave of the <hi>British</hi> History, and am come to the time of the <hi>Romans</hi>) I will freely put down my Conjecture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nant,</hi> in the <hi>British</hi> Tongue, or <hi>Novant</hi> (for they are both one as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> shews) signifies a <hi>Valley,</hi> and <hi>Cre, Cri,</hi> or <hi>Cra,</hi> a <hi>City,</hi> and both taken from the <note place="margin">Cambdeu.</note> 
                  <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> as I have shewn by several Places in <hi>Cornwal; Crinovant</hi> therefore, is as much as the <hi>City of the Vallies,</hi> for the People who were under the subjection of this City, lived Low, upon the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and the whole Region, in a manner, lay in a Valley, so that they may be supposed to have been called (as other places have been upon the same account) <hi>Noantes, Novantes,</hi> or <hi>Nantuates,</hi> and this City <hi>Crinovant,</hi> or the City of the <hi>Novantes,</hi> the similitude of which Name (as I have shewn in another place) gave occasion to those who began the <hi>Trojan</hi> Original, to call it <hi>Troy-novant,</hi> or the <hi>New-Troy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>LUD,</hi> after he had Reigned eleven years, and was Interr'd in his Temple near <hi>Ludgate,</hi> left behind him two Sons, <hi>Androgeus</hi> and <hi>Theomantius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Com. Pal.</hi> saith, that this <hi>Lud</hi> was Sir-named <hi>Immanuentius,</hi> and was slain by his <note place="margin">Count. Palat.</note> Brother <hi>Cassibelan</hi> at <hi>Troy-novant,</hi> and that his eldest Son <hi>Androgeus</hi> was Sir-named <hi>Mandubratius,</hi> and was the same Prince of the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> whom we find in <hi>Caesar's Commentaries,</hi> to have sled into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and to have put himself under the protection of <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Mandubratius,</hi> I shall have occasion to speak in the History of the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Island, whom we shall find Invading it in the next Kings Reign, called <hi>cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belanus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And seeing now we are come to the Times of the <hi>Roman</hi> Histories, the Authority of which is unquestionable, I shall faithfully Collect the Government of <hi>Britain</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Emperours, from the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers themselves (yet, not altogether so, as to neglect absolutely the <hi>British</hi> Histories) in the Lives of their Kings, and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of their Government.</p>
               <p>This I do, because that the Histories of the <hi>Romans,</hi> concerning this Island, as their Government in it, is often broke off and interrupted, and those Breaches are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the continuance of the <hi>British</hi> Succession, but I shall place the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story in the first place, as infinitely surpassing the <hi>British</hi> in its Authority, and all along, the <hi>British</hi> History shall be set under it, as attending only, and subservient to it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>JULIUS CAESAR,</hi> having subdued most part of <note place="margin">Anne ante <hi>Christum,</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Gallia,</hi> quieted the <hi>Germans,</hi> and stopped their Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions into his Province by Locking up the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Scheld,</hi> resolves for an expedition into <hi>Britain;</hi> His pretences were, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had under-hand sent supplies to the Cities of <hi>Armorica,</hi> who the year before had Revolted from his Obedience, and had joyned with the rest of <hi>Gallia</hi> in a general and dangerous Rebellion; Not only so, but that they had received into their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection his Enemies, the <hi>Bellovaci,</hi> who had fled to them for aid and succour.</p>
               <p>These seemed sufficient Causes to justifie an Invasion, especially to a mind wholly possest, as <hi>Caesars</hi> was, with the desire of Glory, and unlimited Conquests; so, that notwithstanding many Cities of the <hi>Britains</hi> (having notice of this design, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the consequence of his Ambition, and usual success) sent Embassadors to him, with a promise of Hostages and Obedience to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, yet he altered not his Resolutions, but after Audience given, sent them back with fair promises and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to continue stedfast in the same mind, and with them <hi>Comius</hi> his Creature and Confident, whom he had obliged with no less Bribe than the Kingdom of <hi>Arras,</hi> giving him private Instructions to gain a <hi>Roman</hi> Party in the Island, and secretly to manage his Interest with the States of <hi>Britain;</hi> And what gave most Authority to his Embassy, to signifie to them his Intentions to come speedily in Person to them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the time of the year defer his design, it seeming to be too high advanced for any new undertakings, the Summer being almost spent, and his wearied Legions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected rather their Winter Quarters, than to be transported into a Foreign War.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:58825:101"/>
               <p>Certainly, <hi>Caesar</hi> had more than ordinary Motives to this sudden expedition, and <note place="margin">

By his future Actions, we may guess that his main design (in Invading <hi>BRITAIN</hi>) was to inure his Souldiers, and to accustome them to the most barbarous Enemies, that they might not be terrified at his most dangerous Enterprizes, but depend solely and entirely upon his Fortune and Conduct.</p>
               <p>And indeed, during all the Civil-Wars, which no doubt by this time he had fore cast in his head, we find these Legions his main prop and support, they blindly following him in his most difficult undertakings. Neither could the love of the Common-wealth, or the Authority of <hi>Pompey,</hi> ever shake them in their Alliance, and although they were harassed about from Country to Country, yet the change of Soil, nor Enemy, could ever break them asunder, or shatter them.</p>
               <p>In his Wars in <hi>Africa,</hi> against <hi>Juba</hi> and his Confederates, with what assurance did <note place="margin">Caesar Com. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>In order to this Design, he endeavours by diligent Enquiry to learn out the Nature <note place="margin">Caesar Com. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</note> and Scituation of this Island, the Places of most easie Access, what Ports and Havens were commodious for his great Shipping, what, and how great, Nations inhabited the Island, their customes in War, and their several Usages, all which, he saies, was unknown to the <hi>Gauls.</hi> For, except some few Merchants and Traders, none scarce ever went thither, and they too only to the Sea-coasts that were next unto <hi>Gaul,</hi> so that not being able to sift out any thing srom the Merchants themselves, whom, for that purpose, he had called together from all parts (and who, possibly, studiously declined to give him any Information) he sends <hi>Caius Volusenus</hi> in a Long Gally, with Orders to make discovery of this Island, and that done, to return as soon as possible he could.</p>
               <p>In this Relation of <hi>Caesar,</hi> touching the Ignorance of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, in all the fore-mentioned Circumstances relating to <hi>Britain,</hi> many have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the diligence, or at least the memory of <hi>Caesar;</hi> For how is it possible they could be so ignorant of the Asfairs of <hi>Britain,</hi> seeing they sent their Children thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as he himself reports) to be instructed in the Learning and Discipline of the <hi>Druids,</hi> the Common Priests of both Nations, and seeing they that were sent for that purpose, often tarried in <hi>Britain</hi> twenty years fully, to know the Mysteries of that Religion, and in all that time, could they get nothing of the Customes and Manners of the People, the Greatness of the Nation, their Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Caesar</hi> reports in another place, that they of <hi>Rhemes</hi> informed him, That <note place="margin">

How therefore came this Island to be so much forgotten on the Continent, seeing one of their Princes had so lately the Dominion of it? Could he be chosen King of a Country, that neither he nor any of his Subjects had ever seen, or with which there had never been any Commerce at all?</p>
               <p>Moreover, in the Wars of <hi>Gallia</hi> he writes, That the <hi>Britains</hi> assisted the <hi>Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> with continual supplies, and that they received the <hi>Bellovaci</hi> into their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Cou'd these endearments happen between Nations, that are here supposed to have so little knowledge one of another?</p>
               <p>To all which Circumstances, if we shall add, How that the Sea-Coast of <hi>Britain,</hi> next to <hi>Gallia,</hi> was Peopled (by his own report) from <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Belgium,</hi> and that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58825:101"/>
many of those Provinces in <hi>Britain</hi> received their names from those People, we shall have little reason to doubt, but that in this Relation <hi>Caesar</hi> had more respect to his own Honour than to Truth, it seeming far more glorious to invade a Nation, of which he had but slender knowledge, and found the success not answerable to his expectations, than to seem to be baffled in a design, the Consequences whereof by due Informations he had weighed and considered. Now this partiality of his in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording his own Affairs, is the greatest blemish with which his Commentaries have been especially marked, and in the particular account of his <hi>British</hi> Victories, in this <note place="margin">Suetonius <hi>de vild</hi> Caesaris.</note> very point, he is much to be suspected and blamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CAESAR</hi> having sent <hi>C. Volusenus</hi> to spie out the Coasts, in the mean time drew his Forces into the Country of the <hi>Morini,</hi> about <hi>Bulloign,</hi> from whence was the shortest cut into <hi>Britain.</hi> Here he commands a general Rendezvous of all his Naval Forces, summoning from all parts the Shipping which the Summer before he had made for the <hi>Armorican</hi> War.</p>
               <p>Hither, after five daies sail, <hi>C. Volusenus</hi> returned to him with those small Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries he had made of the Island, not daring to Land for fear of the <hi>Britains.</hi> But what little Notices he had gotten from aboard his Ship he communicates to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who, after he had taken Hostages of the <hi>Morini,</hi> for their good behaviour in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, left <hi>Sulpitius Rufus</hi> with sufficient Forces to make good the Port, and secure his Return, in case his Affairs in <hi>Britain</hi> succeeded not to his wishes, or the <hi>Gauls,</hi> a fickle and unsteady Nation, upon the least disaster, might change their Faith; with eighty Ships of burthen, beside what Gallies had been distributed to his Chief Officers, about the third Watch of night, with a prosperous Gale sets off for the <hi>British</hi> shoar.</p>
               <p>In this Expedition he carried two Legions, which are supposed to amount of <hi>Romans</hi> and their Allies, to five and twenty thousand Foot, and four thousand five hundred Horse. The Foot were transported in the eighty Vessels, the Horse had eighteen assigned them, which, by reason of contrary Winds, were kept in Port a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight mile from the General Rendezvous. Thither <hi>Caesar</hi> commands the Cavalry to march, and with all speed to embark and follow him, but his Orders being not so soon executed, the next day, between ten and eleven of the Clock in the Fore noon, <hi>Caesar</hi> with his first Ships only came upon the Island, where he sees the Hills covered over with <hi>Britains,</hi> who were drawn up in Martial array to oppose his Landing. The nature of the place was such, that by the position of the narrow Cliffs that ran out into the Sea, and hung steep over it, the <hi>Britains</hi> had the advantage of flinging their Darts and Javelins upon the shoar beneath, so that this place was found too warm for Landing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> therefore, till three of the Clock in the After-noon, lay at Anchor, waiting for the coming up of his whole Fleet, and in the mean time called a Council of War of his Chief Officers, where he imparts to them the Discoveries <hi>C. Volusenus</hi> had made to him, giving them Orders how to behave themselves upon all occasions, chiefly warning them, that the discipline of War in general, but especially the floating kind of flight they were to expect (at their Landing) required, that they should be quick and nimble in their motions, ready to relieve each other, and to shift and change places as they should receive Orders, all which being said, he dismisses them; so with a favourable Wind and Tide weighs Anchor, and sailing along the Coast, about eight Mile distant he arrived at a plain and open shoar, commonly thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Deal</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> all this while observed his motions, and sending their Horse and Chariots before, their Infantry following, they stood not there to be mowed at, but with undaunted Courage furiously drave into the Waters, and fought the <hi>Romans</hi> under their very Ships, not suffering any to descend from their Vessels without the loss of their Lives.</p>
               <p>Such was the Resolution of them upon this occasion, that <hi>Caesar</hi> himself confesseth it a very smart Welcome. And although he would find out matter to excuse it, namely, <hi>That he could not bring his great Ships to work, that his Souldiers were on an unknown Coast, their hands full, their heavy bodies laden with Armour, that at the same time they were to jump from their Ships, stand among the Waves and engage the Enemy,</hi> and on the other side, <hi>that the</hi> Britains <hi>were on the dry ground, or else in very
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58825:102"/>
shallow Water, that they were light Armed, and quick Motioned, that they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the shoars, and their Horses accustomed to that kind of Duty;</hi> yet all this seemeth to be confessing rather than excusing a Defeat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> being to encounter with all these Difficulties, but especially with the undaunted Courage of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and being gauled with this unusual manner of Fighting, stood as men absolutely astonished, not knowing which way to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, until <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing them beginning flatly to yield to the impression of the Enemy, draws off his Long-boats and Gallies from his Ships of Burthen, and orders them to be placed against the open flank of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The very sight of this kind of Shipping amazed the <hi>Britains,</hi> the swiftness of their motion, and the number and ratling of the Oars; but, as on the other side they were exceeding surprizing to the <hi>Britains,</hi> so they struck no less Courage and Resolution into the daunted <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the first impressions being over, notwithstanding the force and greatness of their Gallies, with which, as being strongly workt by the multitude of Oars, the <hi>Britains</hi> were almost overwhelmed; yet left they not off still manfully to defend their Country, and expose their Chariots and naked Bodies to the Ships and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> finding, that by plain Force he was not able to attain the Landing, orders his Engines and Slings to be set up in all his Gallies, and that they should be plaid against the open side of the Enemy. And now, whole showers of Stones and Darts were discharged upon the naked <hi>Britains,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Ships something cleared of their close Engagers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> notwithstanding all these dangers, did not quit their ground, but with the loss of their lives, and although the thick shot falling round about the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Fleet, made them stand at a Bay, yet durst not their Enemies venture to quit their Vessels, fearing (as is reported) the depth of the Sea, but more probably the re-advancement of the Enemy as soon as their Engines should leave working.</p>
               <p>In this general Consternation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> an Ensign-bearer of the tenth Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, having first invoked the Gods, that what he intended might succeed to the good of his Legion, breaks out into these words, <hi>Fellow Souldiers, desert if you please your Ensign, and betray it to the Enemy, I for my part will perform my Duty to the Common-wealth, and my General;</hi> having thus said, with a loud voice, he jumps into the Sea, and, advancing the Eagle, he marcheth upon the Enemy; The Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to recollect their Spirits, and exhorting one another not to suffer the disgrace of loosing their Standard, with one consent followed their resolute Leader. Others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by their Example, do the like, and now, in several Bodies, they advance to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Here began a terrible fight on both sides, wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> received great damages, partly for want of sure footing, and partly, because in eagerness to rescue their Ensign, they observed no Order, every one out of his Ship advancing to that standard that was next to him.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Britains</hi> managed their Advantages with great prudence and Resolution: Where they saw the Enemy boggled either in the Depths or the Sands, they presently assaulted them, cuting them off in all Parties, and wheresoever they perceived any few making up to their Standards, driving furiously between, they intercepted their passage, and with ease dispatcht them. Others there were who attempted the main Body which was gathering about the Standard, and with their Darts very much anoyed them, which <hi>Caesar</hi> perceiving, he commanded all his Boats and Shallops to be filled with Souldiers, and where he saw any distressed he received them into his protection.</p>
               <p>By this means the Foot were all dis-embarkt, and having got into some Order, they made up to the Shoar, where, after a sharp dispute, the wearied <hi>Britains</hi> were put to flight, or rather retired, having observed, by the disburthening of all the Ships, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had no Horse to follow them, which indeed proved true, by reason that through negligence they did not, or by contrary Winds could not arrive so spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as they were ordered. This proved a great vexation to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who never used to get Victories by halves, and this is the first time we ever find him complaining against his Fortune.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Britains</hi> (for what cause is uncertain) but probably from Divisions in themselves, and a <hi>Roman</hi> Party crept in amongst them, send Embassadours to <hi>Caesar</hi> to Treat of Peace, promising to give what Hostages he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and to submit to his disposal.</p>

The mean while, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being dis-banded and sent home, the adjoyning Princes met together, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves and their States to <hi>Caesar,</hi> at his Camp, which is supposed to have been at <hi>Barham-Down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Peace thus Concluded, an Accident happened that put the <hi>Britains</hi> upon new Counsels. The eighteen Ships which transported the Horse, being loosed from the Harbour with a small Gale, in four daies sail came in sight of the Island, and might be descried from the Camp, when of a sudden a Tempest arising, dispersed them, some being cast back to the Port from whence they came, others driven West-ward of the Island. But finding no safety in those parts, nor being able to ride at Anchor in such high Seas, were forced at night to make for the Continent, and (as <hi>Orosius</hi> saith) <note place="margin">Orosius.</note> most of them perished.</p>
                  <p>The same night it happened, the Moon being Full, at which time the Floods are highest, that unawares to the <hi>Romans</hi> the Spring-tide filled and covered those Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which had been haled on shoar, and which were intended to serve for the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of the Army.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the Ships of Burthen that lay off at Anchor, were sorely shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Tempest, the <hi>Romans</hi> all the while looking on, not being able to apply any Remedy. Thus many of their Ships were utterly broken in pieces, others having lost all their Tackling were rendred unserviceable.</p>
                  <p>This gave matter of great affliction to the Army, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, who having not provided sufficient stores for his Souldiers, was necessitated to Winter in <hi>Gallia,</hi> and now saw himself sadly deprived of the means of conveying them thither, having no other Ships for that service, and besides, wanted materials for the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his broken and shattered Hulks.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> considering all these Circumstances, especially their Enemies want of Horse, and imagining the Foot to be fewer indeed, than they were, from the narrow compass of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp (which was less than usual, because <hi>Caesar</hi> by that means was minded to ease the Duty of his wearied Souldiers, and the Legions besides had been transported without their Carriages) resolves to renew the War, and so hindring the <hi>Romans</hi> of Provisions, to protract the business unto Winter.</p>
                  <p>Having entred into this Consultation, they who left Hostages, or out of curiosity had long resided amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> secretly, one by one, withdrew from the Camp, and by degrees, removed their Families and Cattle higher into the Continent, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging one another, once for all, to redeem the Liberty of their Country, not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning but if they could intercept the Return of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and destroy them, none never after would venture to Invade their Nation.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:58825:103"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar,</hi> though as yet he knew not of their designs, yet suspecting that the loss received in his Navy might give Courage to the Enemy, and occasion new Councels, perceiving withal, that the Hostages were privately retired, others which were to be sent in cunningly, delayed, resolves to prepare for the worst, and to that end laies in what provisions of Corn he could gather, and with the scattered remnants of those Ships which were utterly broken, patches up the remainder of his Fleet, and what with Materials fetched from the Continent, and the indefatigable dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Men, in a few daies all but twelve Ships were made fit for sayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the seventh Legion being gone out (according to their custome) to Forrage, there being no open breach made, and many of the <hi>Britains</hi> still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining about the Country, and going and coming freely into the <hi>Romans</hi> Quarters, news was brought unto <hi>Caesar</hi> from the Sentinels, keeping Guard at the Camp-gate, that they descried a greater Dust than ordinary, arising upon that quarter of the Country to which the Legion had taken its March.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> suspecting, what indeed happened, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had taken new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, commands the Cohorts of his Guards to follow him thither, ordering two others to succeed in their places, and the rest speedily to Arm and come after.</p>
                  <p>When he had passed some distance from the Camp, he perceived his Legion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born by the Enemy, and not able to sustain their violent Charges, being already hudled up, and on all sides sorely gauled by Darts and Javelins. For the <hi>Britains</hi> finding, that where the <hi>Romans</hi> the day before had been Reaping, they had left part of the Crop, and judging the next day they would return to the same place, secretly in the Woods lodged an Ambuseado of Men, who (as soon as the <hi>Romans</hi> had laid by their Arms, and were dispersed about their work) suddenly brake in upon them, and cutting off some, routing the rest, at last encompast them about with their Horse and Chariots.</p>
                  <p>The manner of the <hi>Britains</hi> fighting, upon this, and such like occasions, was in this wise.</p>
                  <p>First, They ride with their Charriots through all the parts of the Battle, and fling Darts, and with the terrible noise of their Horses, and ratling of the Charriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheels, they often break the ranks of the Enemy. When they have wound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the Troops of Horse, they alight from their Charriots and fight on foot. The Charrioteers in the mean time retire a little from the Battle, and place themselves in such Order, that in case their Party should be over-powr'd with the Multitude of Enemies, they might have a safe Retreat, so that at once they perform the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Horse, and steadiness of Foot. By daily exercise they are so expert at it, that down the steepest Hill they will hold their Horses to a full Career, stop of a sudden, turn short and wind them about; now running along upon the Beam, then standing upright upon the Yoak, and from thence nimbly recover their Boxes.</p>
                  <p>This sort of Fight is described by <hi>Caesar</hi> in this place, to excuse the general rout of his Legion, although they could not but be acquainted with the nature of the <hi>British</hi> Charriots, even at their first Landing, and it was but high time that he came to their relief, for the Legion was sorely oppressed by the Enemy, and in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
                  <p>At his appearance the <hi>Britains</hi> retired, having done sufficient execution for that day, and <hi>Caesar</hi> was so sensible of his loss, and the general consternation of his Army, that he durst not venture, at that time, to think of Revenging it, so that abstaining from Battle, he only kept his ground for a while, and then with his main Force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired within his Trenches, carrying with him all the Forrage he had taken.</p>
                  <p>For many daies after the Weather continued so foul, that the <hi>Romans</hi> kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves encamped, and the <hi>Britains</hi> attempted nothing upon them, but employed the time in dispatching of Curryers to all parts, to signifie to what small numbers the Enemy was reduced, and the great hopes of Booty, and the freeing their Country for ever from the like Invaders, if they could manfully beat the <hi>Romans</hi> from their Camp, and so make them a severe Example.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:58825:103"/>
                  <p>This change of Councel, from protracting the War to a speedy ending of it, was not so successfully executed as rashly undertaken by the <hi>Britains,</hi> for although, from all quarters there flocked infinite numbers both of Horse and Foot, yet were they too light and unarmed to engage with the heavy Legions, whose strength consisted most in being united and compacted together, whereas the advantage of the <hi>Britains</hi> was in quick Onsets, and sudden Skirmishes, and in being assailed rather than as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailing. However, they gathered together about the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, which <hi>Caesar</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, although he had but three hundred Horse, which <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras</hi> had transported with him, and knew well that the <hi>Britains,</hi> though worsted, might (as before) escape the pursuit, yet resolves to give them Battle, and so drew out for that purpose before his Camp.</p>
                  <p>After a small and trivial dispute, the <hi>Britains</hi> not able to endure the force of the Legions, flie in disorder, and were pursued, but with greater destruction of Towns and Villages than of their Persons, <hi>Caesar</hi> burning every thing that lay in his way, and not returning to his Camp without Blazing tokens of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> after this Defeat, resolve to make Conditions, and to that end send Embassadours to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who no doubt rejoyced at his good Fortune, that, having made no progress at all into the Island, nor ever been in capacity of gaining a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Victory, for want of Horses, on the contrary, having received very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable losses, both in his Fleet and Legions, and now reduced to the very point of forsaking the Island, or else perishing for want of Provisions, the Winter season drawing on a pace, and <hi>September</hi> somewhat advanced, he could now Retreat not only with safety, but some shew of Honour, having this to say, <hi>That he was attended at his Departure, with the States of</hi> Britain, <hi>and all the signs of Submission, although there wanted the substance and reality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, if we consider the consequences of this Treaty, we shall find that these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors were sent rather to Complement him at his Departure, than to make any real Proposals, for the Hostages of their Submission were not to be delivered till his arrival on the Continent. And it is observable, that for so great a breach of Faith, nothing else was enjoyned but a double Number, a Custome <hi>Caesar</hi> never used, in his Treating with barbarous Nations (as he called them) having in the late <hi>Armorican</hi> Revolt put all to the Sword, that lay security for the Good Behaviour of their respective Cities.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>Britains</hi> never intended any such numbers of Hostages, so <hi>Caesar</hi> in vain expected them, two only Cities, and they without doubt of a <hi>Roman</hi> Faction, sending them, the rest totally neglected it.</p>
                  <p>That his Atchievments in this Island were not so great as he makes it in his first Expedition, is the mind of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> a Grave and substantial Author, who saith, that he only discovered, but not delivered the Island up to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> is <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> peremptory, that he was beaten out of it.</p>

                     <hi>CAESAR,</hi> after his first Expedition, with his shattered Fleet about midnight makes for the Continent, being blown off the Island with a fair and prosperous Gale, after some stay in <hi>Gallia</hi> he takes his Journy to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the fame of his Actions, sent by his own Letters, prevented his Arrival, so that for his <hi>British</hi> Conquest, or Discovery, twenty dales of Supplication is decreed by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Souldier having engaged too far amongst the Enemy, and beset round, first with his Spear, and afterwards with his Sword, with incredible Constancy defended himself against a whole Multitude, but at length, being wearied and sorely woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, after great execution, having lost his Helmet and Target, with two Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, he swam unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and humbly begg'd pardon for his rash Adventure against Discipline. This modesty of his in asking Forgiveness, where others would have been craving a Reward, worthily preferred him to be a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion.</p>
                  <p>This is that <hi>Scaeva,</hi> who afterwards shewed he had not forgotten to do the like upon other occasions, for indeed, eversince he esteemed himself an equal match for a whole Army, which he made good in the Battle near <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> where single, against the whole Forces of <hi>Pompey,</hi> he maintained the Fight so long, until <hi>Caesar</hi> Rallied.

                  <head>THE British History, RELATING TO THE FIRST INVASION BY CAESAR.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CASSIBELAN</hi> (according to the <hi>British</hi> Histories) was King of this Island, or rather Protectour, chosen by the States, during the Minority of his two Nephews, <hi>Androgeus</hi> and <hi>Theoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anno ante <hi>Christum</hi> 54.</note> and in the ninth year of his Regency the First Invasion of <hi>Caesar</hi> is placed.</p>
                  <p>A Man of greater Valour and Conduct, but of no less Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Cruelty, and certainly, his Vices may be reckoned greater than his Vertues, for by the former he was the occasion of enslaving his Country, and by the latter was not able to defend it. He slew his Brother, King <hi>Lud,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Immanuentius,</hi> and distributing to his Nephews, the Sons of King <hi>Lud,</hi> two small Principalities to be held of him; to <hi>Androgeus, London</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Com. Pal:</note> to <hi>Theomanntius, Cornwal;</hi> he usurped the Kingdom to himself.</p>
                  <p>Not content with this, as thinking himself little secure, during the life of his lawful Soveraign, <hi>Androgeus,</hi> he molested him with continual Jealousies, and at last put such Indignities upon him, that he flies unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and there resigns his Crown unto him, and his Person to the protection of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This <hi>Androgeus</hi> was Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Mandubratius,</hi> and is the Person whom <hi>Caesar</hi> makes mention of in his second Expedition.</p>
                  <p>These Actions of <hi>Cassibelan</hi> were the causes of continual Wars and Dissensions among the <hi>Britains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Vertues of <hi>Cassibelanus,</hi> his Valour and Conduct (which we shall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hear from <hi>Caesars</hi> own Relating, in his next Invasion, for in his first no mention is made of him) take this from the <hi>British</hi> Histories.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras</hi> had delivered to him the Message of <hi>Caesar,</hi> in which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and a certain Tribute was required, he made Answer in these words.</p>
                  <p>Cassibelan's <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Ambition of the <hi>Romans</hi> was insatiable, who would not suffer <hi>Britain</hi> (a NEW WORLD, placed by nature in the Ocean, and beyond the bounds of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) to lie unmolested. <hi>Tribute</hi> was the mark of <hi>Slavery,</hi> but the high Nobility of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and their allyance to the <hi>Romans</hi> in Blood made them disdain a Subjection to them. If you take our <hi>Friendship</hi> we are ready to grant it, but if you would deprive us of our <hi>Liberty,</hi> know this, That if the Gods themselves should endeavour it, we could not but Resist.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:58825:105"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Comius</hi> still persevering, for his Insolent Demands was cast into Irons; In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of this Resolution he manfully opposed <hi>Caesar</hi> at his Landing, not suffering him, as he intended, to come up the River <hi>Thames,</hi> but drives him lower on the Island, and after great slaughter of his <hi>Romans,</hi> having invited him to come on shoar, in a pitcht Battle (being assisted by <hi>Ederus</hi> King of <hi>Albania,</hi> now <hi>Scotland, Guitethus</hi> King of <hi>Venedocia,</hi> now <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and <hi>Brituel</hi> King of <hi>Demetia,</hi> or <hi>South-Wales</hi>) he gave him a great Overthrow.</p>
                  <p>After this Victory, having encouraged his Souldiers, in token of his Thankfulness, he sacrifices to his Gods.</p>
                  <p>In this Battle <hi>Belinus</hi> was his General, and <hi>Nenius</hi> his Brother performed great Acts, for in a single combat with <hi>Caesar,</hi> it so fell out, that he got his Sword, and, by a furious blow made at him, stuck it fast in his Shield. And although he received his deaths wound with the stroak, and the disarming of <hi>Caesar</hi> proved fatal to him, yet afterwards, with his own hands, he slew <hi>Labienus,</hi> one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> discomfited with the bad success of his Affairs, bends all his thoughts in order to a speedy retreat from the Island, and having patched up his Fleet, sufficient to transport the remainder of his Army, which by his losses was reduced to a small number, leaving all his Baggage behind, in the Night secretly embarks, and with a still Wind, as it were, he steals from the Island.</p>

To that purpose he gives them seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Models, after what fashion he would have them made.</p>
                  <p>First, They were to be lower built than ordinary, for the advantage of easier fraughtage, and better haling ashoar, and because he observed, that by the often changes of Tides, the <hi>British</hi> Seas did not run so high as the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place, They were to be broader, thereby to be of greater Burthen, and to be more able to transport a considerable number of Horse, which <hi>Caesar</hi> was resolved, in his next years Expedition should not be wanting.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, He leaves Commands to make them fit for Rowing, for which purpose their Low-building was very advantagious; And as for Materials to strengthen and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisie them, he provided them out of <hi>Spain.</hi>

                     <hi>Caesar</hi> having commended his Souldiers for their diligence, and his Officers for <note place="margin">Athenaeus.</note> their care and trust, Commands them, by a day, to be ready at the Port <hi>Iccius,</hi> now <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> where they all met accordingly, except forty, which by contrary Winds and ill Weather, were beaten back into the Port of the <hi>Meldi,</hi> from whence they had set out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> in the rest, about Sun-set, embarks with five Legions of Foot, amounting, according to the computation of some, to 620000 <hi>Romans</hi> and their Allies, and two thousand Horse, leaving behind him three Legions of Foot, and two thousand Horse, to make good the Port against his Return.</p>
                  <p>Having weighed Anchor, he stands for <hi>Britain</hi> with a slack South west Wind (but at Mid-night is becalmed) so, that not able to hold on his course, he is driven at random by the Current, and at Day-break descries the Island to bear left of him; turning therefore about with the Tide, which now changed, with all his Fleet, he began to make for that place which the year before he had found so convenient for Landing. The Souldiers with all alacrity tugged at the Oars, and although the Gallies were heavy laden, and drew much water, yet by their indefatigable labour they kept course with Ships under sail.</p>
                  <p>At Noon <hi>Caesar</hi> arrives with all his Navy on the Coast, and finds no Enemy to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Landing, for the <hi>Britains,</hi> terrified with the sight of so vast a Fleet, which seemed to cover the Seas, had forsaken the defence of their Shoars, and withdrawn into the Higher Countries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> forthwith landing his Men, chooseth a convenient place to Encamp, and having learnt of some Fugitives the place to which the <hi>Britains</hi> had retired, leaving his Ships at Anchor upon a plain and open shoar, with ten Cohorts, and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horse, under the Command of <hi>Q. Atrius,</hi> to guard them; about the third Watch of the same night, with his main Body he advances into the Country to find out the Enemy. After twelve miles March he descries them drawn up on the banks of a River, commonly thought the <hi>Stowr</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> with their Horse and Chariots had possest themselves of the Upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, and began now to oppose the March of the <hi>Romans</hi> with smart charges, but being driven from their ground by the Enemies Cavalry, they retired into the Woods, to a Fortification made strong both by Art and Nature, and cast up, as is thought, after the <hi>British</hi> manner, during some Civil War among themselves. The Passages on all sides were blocked up with huge Trees, which were felled and laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thwart one another.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> in dispersed Parties, fought within their Trenches, and suffered not the <hi>Romans</hi> to enter their Works, but the Souldiers of the seventh Legion having raised a Mount, and marching on close and knit together, under the coverts of their Sheilds, which lay like a Roof upon them, without much loss of blood took the place, and so drave the <hi>Britains</hi> from their Holds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> forbad any pursuit to be made, as wanting the knowledge of the places, and judging it more convenient, great part of the day being spent, to employ the remainder in sortifying another Camp, and refreshing his Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning he sent out early three Bodies of Horse and Foot, in Parties, to seek out the Enemy and pursue them. They had not gone so far, but the last of them were in sight, when in post-haste News is brought from <hi>Q. Atrius,</hi> that the Fleet that night, by a sudden Tempest arising, had suffered a grievous Wrack, that many of them lay split upon the shoar, that, through the violence of the Weather, the Anchors and Cables being broken, the industry of the Sea-men could not hinder but that many of them fell foul on one another, and were dasht in pieces.</p>
                  <p>At the news of this Disaster, <hi>Caesar</hi> commands the Forces that were upon their March to hault, and give over the design for the present in following the Enemy. In all haste he returns to the Ships, and there with his own eyes is witness of the sad Ruines of his Navy.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:58825:106"/>
                  <p>About sorty Ships were utterly lost, others, although put upon great difficulty, yet seemed not past hopes of recovery. To that end therefore he drew out of his Legions such Shipwrights as he had with him, and sends over into the Continent for others, withal writing to <hi>Labienus</hi> (with those Legions he had) to fall a building as fast as he could, and in the mean time sets himself to the Repairing of his shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Vessels. And, although it seemed a difficult task to be undertaken, yet he thought most convenient to draw his Ships into the Camp, and encompass them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same Trenches.</p>
                  <p>In these Affairs he spends ten daies, giving no respit to his Souldiers, either day or night, until he had drawn them all within the Works, and strongly secured them with Ditches and Rampiers.</p>
                  <p>Having thus made every thing sure, and leaving the same Guards upon them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he returns to the place from whence he had driven the <hi>Britains,</hi> where he finds far greater numbers re-assembled.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> in a General Councel of all the States, invested <hi>Cassibelan</hi> with the full power and management of the whole War; His Territory was bounded on the South by the <hi>Thames,</hi> which divided it from the Provinces of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> and it extended eighty Miles from the Sea. Before the Arrival of <hi>Caesar</hi> he was in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Wars with the Neighbouring Cities, but in the common danger of Forraign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, they unanimously chose him (for his right experience in Martial Affairs) to be their Leader.</p>
                  <p>Having gathered great Forces together, the first thing he undertook was to oppose the licentious Marches of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, and (if possible) to cut them off. To this end, with his Horse and Charriots, he gives them a sharp Charge, but finding himself over-match'd, he retreats to the Woods and Hills, giving liberty to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to pursue, who too eagerly following in the Chase, were many of them cut off by the <hi>Britains,</hi> who sometimes rallied, and sometimes came out in fresh Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
                  <p>After this, the <hi>Britains</hi> for some time did not appear, but lay secretly hid in the edges of the Woods, insomuch that the <hi>Romans</hi> not suspecting any Enemy, laid down their Arms, and betook themselves to the entrenching and fortifying their Camp.</p>
                  <p>Whilst they were in this General security, every man employed in his particular work, the <hi>Britains</hi> of a sudden brake out of their Coverts, and furiously assaulted an inconsiderable Body that kept Guard before the Trenches. Here was some Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution made, and when <hi>Caesar</hi> took the Alarum, he sent two of the principal and choicest Cohorts, drawn out of two Legions, to rescue them, but they being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Novelty and fierceness of the Fight, stood like Men in a Maze, having not the power to joyn Parties, insomuch that the <hi>Britains</hi> perceiving a Gap betwixt them, brake through, and so returned in safety to their main Body. In this daies Engagement <hi>Q. Laberius Durus,</hi> a Tribune, was slain on the <hi>Roman</hi> side.</p>
                  <p>In this sort of Skirmishing lay the especial advantage of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> himself confesseth (who in this Engagement stood as Spectatour only) that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> way, both of Arming and Fighting, was not so well fitted to this kind of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for the heavy Armour of the Legionaries, suffered them not to be quick in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the sudden flights of their Enemies; and it was a breach of Discipline to stir from their Ensigns. As for the Horse, they never engaged without manifest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, for the <hi>Britains</hi> out of design would often give back, and when they had drawn them off some distance from the Legons, would turn upon them, and, jumping from their Charriots, assault them on foot; so that it was equally hazardous to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, whether they gave back or advanced, besides, the <hi>Britains</hi> never fought thick, but scattered and in great distances, having set stations allotted, to which, upon occasion, they retired, and from whence releif was sent of fresh Parties, to bring off the wearied.</p>
                  <p>These Advantages at first were wisely made use of by <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> and it argues his great experience in War, for by this means the heavy Legions were wearied and soyled, their Spirits spent upon an unstable and dodging Enemy; Their Courage turned into Vexation to be mastered by those, whom they were sure they could
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58825:106"/>
Overcome in the grapling. And had <hi>Cassibelan</hi> stood steady to his Resolutions, and not suffered the greatness of his Spirit to consult more with his Honour than Interest, the <hi>Romans</hi> must of necessity have been obliged either to quit the Country, or by flinging off their Armour, to conform to the same manner of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Next day the <hi>Britains</hi> kept the Hills, some distance from the Camp, and all the Morning shewed themselves in small Parties, now profering Battle, now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring, then in light Skirmishes engaging, then presently again Retreating, not thinking it convenient to engage too deeply with the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va'ry.</p>
                  <p>At Noon <hi>Caesar</hi> sent out three Legions, and all his Horse, under pretence of Forrage, but withal, commands that the Foot should not go far from their Ensigns, and that the Horse should keep up close with them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eritains,</hi> who expected not such order in Forragers, as their Custome was, with great fury flew upon them, but were mightily deceived in their Expectations; for the <hi>Romans</hi> stood ready to receive them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains,</hi> perceiving their mistake, suddenly recoyled, but it proved too late, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry seconded by their Foot, who kept up with them, so closely pursued, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had not leisure to Rally, to stand, or come down from their Chariots, but were in great confusion, many of them slain, and the rest ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally routed.</p>
                  <p>After this Overthrow, <hi>Cassibelan</hi> entred upon New Counsels, and resolved in a manner to change the whole nature of the War; He perceived there was nothing to be attempted upon the main Body of the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherefore he signified his Resolutions, never after to put his Affairs into the hazard of a pitcht Battle, and disbanded many Auxiliary Forces that from all parts had been sent unto him; with the choicest of his Men, and four thousand Wagons, he set himself to attend <hi>Caesar</hi> in his March, judging these a sufficient Number to hinder the licentious Incursions of the Enemy, and by the advantage he had in the knowledge of the Country, he knew he was secure from being forced to flight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> understanding his design, drew his Army upon the Fronteirs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which was bounded by the <hi>Thames,</hi> a River fordable only at one place, and that with great difficulty, about <hi>Coway,</hi> near <hi>Oatlands,</hi> as is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                  <p>Arriving hither, he perceived the Enemy in great numbers drawn up on the other side to oppose his Passage, if he should attempt it, the Bank being all set with Piles of Wood sharpned at the end, after the manner of Pallisado's, and the Ford (as he learnt from the Captives and Runagates) knocked full of sharp Stakes, lying hid under Water.</p>
                  <p>This excellent design of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> being Treacherously discovered, had not the hoped-for success. For the <hi>Romans</hi> with greater care and circumspection en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the River, the Horse first, and afterwards the Foot, wading up to the Neck in Water; The <hi>Britains,</hi> who expected them to fall into Disorder and Confusion, and were ready to make use of the Advantage, perceiving them to avoid the Stakes, and to pass them without any annoyance, were sorely discouraged at the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of their Design; And seeing the Enemy came up with great heat and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, having bestowed a few Darts upon them, they forsook the Banks and retired.</p>
                  <p>I call this a <hi>Retiring</hi> rather than a <hi>Flight,</hi> because it was against the designed purpose of <hi>Cassibelan</hi> to enter into any close Engagement with them, which he must necessarily have done, had he continued too long in opposing their Passage, the Legions coming up apace and seconding their Cavalry. He therefore, in time, rids himself out of the way, and bestows his Forces into Woods and secret Coverts, lining with his Horse and Charriots, the Roads through which he expected <hi>Caesar</hi> would March, driving all the Inhabitants, and their Cattle into places of Security within the Woods.</p>
                  <p>By this means the <hi>Romans</hi> were extreamly streightned for want of Provisions, and when their Horse went out at any time to bring in any prey or booty, and were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58825:107"/>
about to fetch in Cattle, which were left here and there on purpose to tempt and invite them, the <hi>Britains</hi> through secret and By-paths sallyed out upon them with their Charriots, and having made great slaughter, again through hidden Waies, and only known to themselves, retired to their main Body; so that it came to pass, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse, not daring any longer to make any Excursions, or to stir out of the protection of the Foot, were rendred unserviceable, and the whole Army keeping together for their security, could have nothing provided for them, unless they all joyned entirely in the seeking it.</p>
                  <p>By this means the <hi>Britains</hi> prevented any broad destruction of their Towns and Villages, and nothing was exposed to plunder or burning, but what lay just within the March of the whole Army. And if at any time for Sustenance they were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to divide, yet were the Cavalry obliged to contain themselves to the dull and slow motion of the Legionaries, and by plain force alwaies, but never by slight, could wrest any thing from the <hi>Britains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amidst all these difficulties, <hi>Caesar</hi> (according to his usual Fortune) when his Assairs had the worst aspect, received welcome News of a Dissension among the <hi>Britains,</hi> and joyful tidings of a supply for his half-starved Army. The <hi>Trino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantes</hi> (as it usually happens, when the Ruine of a Country proceeds from it self) one of the chief of the <hi>British</hi> States maintained a Faction against <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> which no doubt was heightned by a <hi>Roman</hi> Interest. For they grew so high in these Greivances, that they sent Embassadors unto <hi>Caesar</hi> to be releived in them, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves under his protection, and promising Subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power.</p>
                  <p>The cause of this Revolt, was, that <hi>Cassibelan</hi> had slain <hi>Immannentius,</hi> whom they pretended was their Lawful Soveraign, and forced his Son <hi>Mandubratius</hi> (whom <hi>Orosius</hi> calls <hi>Androgorius; Beda, Androgius)</hi> to secure his life by flight into <hi>Gallia.</hi> They desired therefore, that <hi>Mandubratius</hi> might be rescued from the Injustice of <note place="margin">Orofius. Beda:</note> 
                     <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> and sent to them, to take possession of his Right, and enjoy the Crown and Dignity of his Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mandubratius</hi> was then with <hi>Caesar,</hi> and, without question, was his great Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in giving light to him in many things that conduced to the Ruine of his Country. For after his flight into <hi>Gallia,</hi> he applied himself unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and was ever since his Attendant in all his Enterprizes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> having much obliged him, by undertaking his Protection, and revenging, as he thought, the Injuries of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> sends home to the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first demanded forty Hostages of them, and Provisions for his whole Army.</p>
                  <p>These Conditions being punctually performed on their parts, <hi>Mandubratius</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt returns home, with great Praises and loud Acclamations, of the goodness and generosity of the Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>No wonder therefore, especially led by the Example of so powerful a State, that the <hi>Cenimagni,</hi> supposed to be the <hi>Icini,</hi> and <hi>Regni,</hi> the former of which were the <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> Inhabitants of <hi>Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgshire</hi> and <hi>Huntingtonshire;</hi> the latter of <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi> and the Sea-coasts of <hi>Hampshire.</hi> As likewise the <hi>Ancalites,</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing that part now called the Hundred of <hi>Henley</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire;</hi> the <hi>Bibroci,</hi> the Hundred of <hi>Bray</hi> in <hi>Barkshire;</hi> the <hi>Cassi,</hi> the Hundred of <hi>Caishow</hi> in <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> by their Embassadors sent their several Resignation of their States unto <hi>Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This dangerous Revolt, of such a considerable part of the Nation, put life into the designs of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who, but a little before, by the weary proceeding of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> began to lose all his hopes of a speedy ending of the War, and would have been very willing, with any tolerable Conditions, to have rid himself of so troublesome and vexatious an Enemy. But now having made so great a Party of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and being sufficiently accommodated with Provisions, he resolved to take his March directly to <hi>Verulam</hi> (not far from the now <hi>St. Albans,</hi> supposed to be the Chief Seat of <hi>Cassibelan)</hi> being instructed by his new Allies, that it was a place of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, strongly sortified with Woods and Marshes, and full of Men and Cattle.</p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:58825:107"/>
                  <p>Following these Guides, he arrives at the place with his Legions, and found it (as all the <hi>British</hi> Towns were) encompast with a Ditch and Mud-wall, and all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues</hi> blockt up with great Trees lying over thwart them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> gives Order for a storm to be made at two places at once, which accordingly was executed, and with such Valour and Execution, that after a small dispute on both sides, thought it safest to quit the place, and to flie out at a Postern Gate, leaving the plunder of the Town, and the hindermost of his Men to the mercy of the Enemy, than by the forsaking his design to hazard all in too great an Engagement.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Cassibelan</hi> having lost the principal Seat, and greatest Magazine of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being withal continually Allarum'd with the noise of the Revolts of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States, began to betake himself to his last Refuge, the assistance of such Friends that still faithfully adhered to him, during the worst of his Fortunes. The <hi>Kentish</hi> Men subject to four Princes, <hi>Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus,</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonex,</hi> still kept to the Union, and forsook not their plighted Faith to <hi>Cassibelan.</hi> To these therefore he sends, that with what Forces they could gather together, they should make some sudden Attempt upon the Camp, wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> had lodged their Ships, hoping by this means to drive <hi>Caesar</hi> to the defence of his Navy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kentish</hi> Princes accordingly raised the Country, and with greater haste than good speed, brings their Raw and unskill'd Souldiers before the <hi>Roman</hi> Trenches, for not being able to endure one Sally, with great slaughter and confusion they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally routed, and <hi>Cingetorix</hi> one of their Princes taken Prisoner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cassibelan</hi> immediately waited the success of this Enterprize, and taking it into his consideration, Reserves as his last Card, being now informed of their Defeat, the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his Subjects, and more especially the Treason and Treachery of his Revolted Cities, and resolves at last to make Conditions himself (after having performed what Man could do) for the preservation of his Country.</p>
                  <p>By the Mediation of <hi>Comius</hi> of <hi>Arras</hi> he sends his Embassadors to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who wittingly accepted of them, for that the Summer was to <hi>Caesar</hi> high spent, and his Affairs in <hi>Gallia</hi> called for his speedy Return. The Enemy he now dealt with was grown cautious and wary, and likely to spinout the War to a greater length than his occasions would permit him to attend; Having therefore enjoyned him not to molest <hi>Mandubratius,</hi> and the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> and setled the Tribute which the <hi>Britains</hi> should Annually pay to the States of <hi>Rome,</hi> he commands Hostages only, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he draws his Army to the Sea, where having viewed the remainder of his Ships, which had been repaired since the last Storm, and finding them too few, after their Losses, to transport at once his Army, Captives, and Baggages, he resolves to make two Embarkments of them.</p>
                  <p>But having long expected the return of his sixty Sail, which had carried the first Party over, and were kept back by contrary Winds, misdoubting the Season of the year, <hi>September</hi> being begun, and possibly the return of the <hi>Britains</hi> after the division of his Forces, he places his Men thick into those few Vessels he had with him, and weighing Anchor, at the beginning of the second Watch, with a favourable Wind sets Sail, and next Morning early arrived at the Continent.</p>
                  <p>This is the Account of the Second Expedition of <hi>Caesar,</hi> taken out of his own <hi>Commentaries,</hi> though other eminent Authors relate, <hi>That in his</hi> British <hi>proceedings, he speaks too advantagiously of himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the rest, <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes of <hi>Caratacus,</hi> that encouraging the <hi>Britains</hi> he often <note place="margin">Tacitus. Sueronius. Orosius. Dion. Cass. Quintillian. Eutropius.</note> invoked the Names of his Ancestors, who drave <hi>Caesar,</hi> the Dictator, out of the Isle, by whose Valour they were freed from the Axes and Tributes of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and preserved the Bodies of their Wives and Children, undefiled. And <hi>Dion.</hi> affirms, That once in the Second Expedition all his Foot were routed; <hi>Orosius,</hi> That another time all his Horse; and it is manifest, that for many years after <hi>Britain</hi> was Governed by its own Kings, and its own Laws.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, at his Arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> attended with the long Procession of the <hi>British</hi> Captives, whose odd Attire, and strange Behaviour, drew the eyes of all the Beholders, and seemed the Witness of his glorious Enterprize, he ascends the Temple of <hi>Venus Genetrix,</hi> the Patroness of his Family, and there solemnly offers a Corslet of <hi>British</hi> Pearls.</p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:58825:108"/>
                  <p>Some of the meaner Captives he employed for services in the Theater, to attend the Tapestry Hangings, wherein he had caused to be curiously woven the figures of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and his Victories over them. Of these <hi>Virgil</hi> writes thus,

                     </note> his excellent and Industrious Contrivance, quick Dispatch, Courage in his Dangers, and Laborious in all his Affairs; Of so little Pomp, that at his first coming into this Isle, he is credibly reported to have had but three Domestick Servants in his Retinue. The whole course of his Life, even in his lowest Fortunes, had still something of Greatness in it.</p>
                  <p>At seventeen years of Age he was made <hi>Flamen Dialis,</hi> seven years after Questor of <hi>Spain,</hi> where, at the Streights, beholding the Statue of <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> he inwardly groaned to think, that at that Age wherein <hi>Alexander</hi> had Conquered the World, himself had done no memorable Action. Thereupon he laies down his Questorship and repairs to <hi>Rome,</hi> watching every occasion to grow Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, entring into many Factions, and some not without suspicion of Conspiracy, yet were all his Actions ever taken in a favourable construction, the States finding it more convenient to flatter him into a kind of Obedience, than to make too severe an Inquisition into his Affairs.</p>
                  <p>In a publick Funeral Oration in Praise of his Aunt <hi>Julia,</hi> he derived himself, on <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Caesars</hi> Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, declared by himself.</note> the Mothers side, from <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> an Ancient King of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, on his Fathers side, from the Gods. He was after this made <hi>AEdilis,</hi> then <hi>Pontisex Maximus,</hi> which Honour he carried against two Competitors of the greatest Age and Authority. Being Consul, he obtained <hi>Gallia</hi> for his Province, which he held ten years, part of the time being spent in the Invasion of <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilst he was busie in the Conquest of this ISLAND, he received News of the <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> decease of his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> whose death drew with her a trayn of Publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Her loss he passed over with the same Constancy of mind he used in the rest of his Affairs, and it is possible that his Ambition overcame his Sorrow, for her Life and Interest, with <hi>Pompey,</hi> seemed the only debar to his future Advancement; As, not long after he entred into the Civil War, the Commonwealth being grown so Heady, that it seemed impossible to be Governed but by a single Person.</p>
                  <p>During all the Civil War, those Forces he had employed in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gallia</hi> were alwaies his Unbroken strengths; The hardships of these Countries, joyned with <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline, and the confidence in their Leader, had so Spirited them, that as <hi>Scaeva,</hi> single, durst twice undertake a whole Army: so these few Legions seemed a match for the whole World.</p>

                  <p>After great Contendings with is Countrymen for the Supream Power, and much effusion of Blood, having at last arrived to the end of his Labours, the top and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pinnacle of Honour, whilst he thought his Enemies either all destroyed, or by his Clemency not only in sparing but advancing them, sufficiently obliged in the midst of the Publick Assembly of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, where he had often received the Thanks and Acknowledgments of the House for his great Services, after fifty several Battles fought with success, five Triumphs, and four Consulships, laden with Honour, he was basely murthered by a Conspiracy of Senators, and so fell at the feet of his Son in Law <hi>Pompey's</hi> Image, whom not long before he had Conquered. And, what made most to the remarkableness of his Misfortune, he was slain by those to whom he had shewn the greatest Kindness, and that with many wounds, the deepest whereof was given by his near Relation <hi>Brutus,</hi> to whom once he had designed a great share in his Estate, and that <hi>Brutus</hi> the Son of <hi>Servilia,</hi> supposed his Base Child.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>CASSIBELAN</hi> (preparing against <hi>Caesars</hi> second Invasion) <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno ants</hi> Christush, 53;</note> stuck the <hi>Thames,</hi> in one place, full of Iron and Lead stakes, on purpose to hinder his sayling to the <hi>Trinboantes,</hi> in which design he so well prospered, that <hi>Caesar</hi> lost many of his Ships, and was afterwards beaten in a pitcht Battle.</p>
                  <p>For joy of this second Victory, <hi>Cassibelan</hi> made a great Feast at <hi>London,</hi> and there sacrificed to his Gods, in which Solemnity <hi>Hirilda, Cassibelans</hi> Nephew, and <hi>Ewelin,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Androgeus,</hi> falling at variance, <hi>Hirilda</hi> was slain, whereupon <hi>Cassibelan</hi> summons <hi>Ewelin</hi> to appear before him, to answer for the death of his Nephew, but being encouraged by <hi>Androgeus,</hi> refused to obey the Summons; Upon this, <hi>Cassibelan</hi> begins to make War upon <hi>Androgeus,</hi> who finding himself not able to deal with him, fled unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> into <hi>Gallia,</hi> and invited him to return into <hi>Britain</hi> (for <hi>Caesar</hi> upon his ill success, had left the Island) <hi>Caesar</hi> took Hostages of him, and among the rest <hi>Scaeva, Androgeus</hi> his Son, and so returns, where encountring at his Landing with <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> he was worsted, until <hi>Androgeus</hi> coming upon the back of the <hi>Britains,</hi> totally overthrew them.</p>
                  <p>Neither had the <hi>Romans</hi> any success against the <hi>Britains,</hi> but what they obtained by the means of <hi>Androgeus,</hi> whom (I said before) is called by <hi>Caesar, Mandubratius,</hi> and the aforesaid Reason is given by the <hi>British</hi> Histories of his flight unto <hi>Gallia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Count Palatine</hi> writes, that when <hi>Caesar</hi> was led by <hi>Androgeus,</hi> he found the <hi>Britains</hi> drawn up at the <hi>Stowr</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> he drave them from the opposite Bank with an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant <note place="margin">Com.

                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:58825:109"/>
                  <p>Likewise, that the Breast-plate stuck with Pearls, which <hi>Caesar</hi> dedicated to <hi>Venus Genetrix,</hi> was presented him by <hi>Cassibelan</hi> at his departure from the Island, and that <hi>Caesar,</hi> in return of so seasonable a Gift (for he had no time to gather any himself) recompenced him with no less honourable Munificence.</p>
                  <p>After the final departure of <hi>Caesar, Androgeus Mandubratius</hi> was not restored to the Kingdom of the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> but whether through the Ill will of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> or the general Hatred the People had to him, for the enslaving of his Country, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, so that leaving <hi>Britain,</hi> he again be took himself unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and attended him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was entertained as King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and saluted Friend to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. At last, he was slain in the Battle of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> against <hi>Pompey.</hi>

                     <hi>Cassibelan</hi> (after the Departure of the <hi>Romans</hi>) reigned ten years, which time he employed in Revenging himself upon the Cities that had Revolted from him during the Wars with <hi>Caesar.</hi>

                  <head>THE Inter - Regnum OF THE ROMANS.</head>
                  <p>DURING the last ten years of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> and till the time of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> were free from the yoak of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and were ruled by their own Kings, and governed by their own Laws, so that, for a while, we must take our fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of the <hi>Roman</hi> History, collecting it only as we find it scattered, here and there, and follow the Succession of the <hi>British.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THEOMANTIUS,</hi> or <hi>Tenantius,</hi> Nephew of <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> succeeded his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle in the Kingdom, having before enjoyed the Principality of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> far remote <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anno ante</hi> Christ. 45.</note> from the Troubles of the times, and by that means not engaged, by assisting his Brother, to take to a <hi>Roman</hi> Interest, or by ayding <hi>Cassibelan</hi> to justifie his Violences, by which indifferent Carriage, by the general Applause of the People, he assumed the Crown, <hi>Anno ante Christum</hi> XLV.</p>
                  <p>In this Kings Reign, <hi>Octavius</hi> (the Grand-child of <hi>Julia, Caesars</hi> Sister) obtained the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> but before he had fully possest himself of it, and was yet strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus, Theomantius</hi> sends his Son <hi>Kymbelin</hi> to him, to attend upon him in his Wars, hoping thereby to ingratiate himself with <hi>Augustus,</hi> and obtain a relaxation of the Tributes; And indeed <hi>Cunobelin</hi> so behaved himself, that he grew into especial favour with the Emperour, and accompanied him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was saluted by the name of <hi>FRIEND,</hi> of the Commonwealth, and bred up in all the splendour and magnificence of the Court.</p>
                  <p>During his residence there, <hi>Tenantius</hi> paid in Tribute, which the <hi>British</hi> Histories set upon the score of this great Favourite of <hi>Augustus,</hi> but the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors seem generally to imply, That the Troubles of the Empire, and the bandings of Great men after the death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> were the causes of the Quiet of the <hi>Britains,</hi> during these Civil Dissensions.</p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:58825:109"/>
                  <p>This carries most probability with it, for we find <hi>Augustus</hi> no sooner setled in the <hi>Roman</hi> State, but he began to cast his thoughts towards <hi>Britain;</hi> And, although <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> draws the neglect of this Island in <hi>Augustus,</hi> to a wholsome State-Maxime, of not making the Empire too unweildy; and <hi>Strabo</hi> would have us think, that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <note place="margin">Tacitus, Strabo.</note> slighted it, as a place of no importance, <note place="margin">Dion.

The year following, some differences arising about performance of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, he was again hindered by disturbances in <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Biscans,</hi> and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Gallicia</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> having Revolted.</p>
                  <p>This last designed Invasion, was in the two and twentieth year of the Reign of <hi>Tenantius,</hi> who in the thirtieth year died, and was buried at <hi>London.</hi>

                     <hi>KYMBELIN,</hi> or <hi>KUNOBELIN,</hi> succeeded him in the Third year before CHRIST; And if he was not Educated at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the kind Correspondence <note place="margin">Anno 3. ante <hi>Dom.</hi>

They sent some Presents to <hi>Augustus,</hi> and others to the <hi>Roman</hi> Gods, to be offered (with their Submission) in the Capitol, with such like obsequious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses.

                  <p>But although they shifted off the Tribute, yet they yielded to Taxes and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, which were of more dangerous consequences to them. For by that means they admitted the <hi>Romans</hi> into the Trading part of the Nation, and although their Commodities, vented on the Continent, were inconsiderable, such as <hi>Ivory-Bones, Iron-Chains,</hi> and such like Trinckets of <hi>Amber</hi> and <hi>Glass,</hi> yet by this means the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Collectors were of necessity to be Admitted, and their Enemies got more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight into them by this Amicable Correspondence, than ever <hi>Caesar</hi> could do in both his Expeditions. Nay, by this means the Islanders came to be debauched, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Trifles as many silly Luxuries of the Continent, insomuch that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they became so tame, that one Band of Souldiers, with a small Troop of Horse (as <hi>Strabo</hi> witnesseth) was able to hold them under in Obedience; Nay, so highly obliging were they to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who lived also <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> in this Kings Reign, that when some of <hi>Germanicus</hi> Army crossing some part of the Seas, were cast upon their Shoar, they entertained them Courteously, and sent them back to their General.</p>
                  <p>Nay, so comfortable to the <hi>Romans</hi> was this <hi>Kymbelin</hi> himself, that he caused Coyns to be stamped after the Custome of that State, whereas before, the payments of the <hi>Britains</hi> were made with Rings of <hi>Iron,</hi> and Plates of <hi>Brass,</hi> sized at a certain weight. His Image was made exactly after the manner of the Emperours, and on the Reverse was CAM, signifying <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> or <hi>Maldon</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> his Royal Seat, and it is more than to be suspected, that Tribute likewise was paid, for in a

                  <p>Some there are that affirm <hi>Cunobeline</hi> to have been at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to reside in the Emperours Court, when the News of our Saviours Birth was brought to <hi>Augustus,</hi> but the time agreeth not; For by the latest Account, he is made King of this Island three years before our <hi>SAVIOUR,</hi> and by some twenty three, but the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation seemeth the truest. For we find no other King between him and <hi>Guide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who Reigned in the daies of <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> and was the Son of this <hi>Cunobeline;</hi> For how is it likely, that <hi>Cunobeline</hi> should be King of this Island in the beginning of <hi>Augustus's</hi> Reign, and yet have a Son that Reigned above fifty years after in <hi>Claudius</hi> his daies, for the space of twenty eight years, and after him a younger Son <hi>Arvira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> that Reigned twenty eight years more, so that it seemeth this King Ruled in the latter daies of <hi>Augustus,</hi> and twenty of the twenty three years of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> if not all of them, and some part of <hi>Caligula's</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TIBERIUS</hi> was a dissolute Prince, given to Sloth and Luxury, he thought it sufficient if he could maintain the Bounds of the Empire as <hi>Augustus</hi> left it, producing for his Excuse, a Schedule written with <hi>Augustus</hi> his own hand, wherein was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the whole Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, how many Cities and Allies were in Arms, the list of their Navies, Kingdoms and Provinces, to which was annexed the Convenience of the present Limits of the Empire, the necessity to bound it on the East by <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tigris,</hi> two considerable Rivers, on the North, by the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Danube,</hi> on the West, by the Ocean, so that <hi>Britain</hi> was excluded.</p>
                  <p>This Maxime, so convenient in it self, and so much conducing to the Ease of this Emperour, was the Excuse that no Attempts was made upon this Island, during the three and twenty years of his Reign; And <hi>Tacitus,</hi> where he reckons up what Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> were maintained, and through what Countries distributed, never maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Forces in <hi>Britain</hi> in these Times.

                  <p>It is certain, he had once an intention to Invade <hi>Britain,</hi> but by his shittle Head, <note place="margin">Anno Dom. 43</note> sudden repentance, and mighty designs against <hi>Germany,</hi> all came to nothing.

Having in <hi>Belgium</hi> taken into protection <hi>Adminius</hi> the Son of <hi>Cunobelyn,</hi> banisht by his Father, he sent boasting and magnificent Letters to <hi>Rome,</hi> as if the whole Isle had been brought under his Subjection, giving especial charge and command to the Post, that at their Arrival at <hi>Rome</hi> they should drive their Charriots directly into the Market-place, and the <hi>Curia,</hi> and in no wise deliver his Messives to the Consuls, but in the Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> and in a full Assembly of the Senate.</p>
                  <p>After this, he brought all his Army to the <hi>Belgick</hi> Shoar, where he received the News, <hi>That the</hi> Britains <hi>had levied the strength of their Nation, and stood ready to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his Landing, if he should make any attempt upon them.</hi> This affrighted not <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulae,</hi>

Having therefore first commanded his Men to take a full view of the <hi>British</hi> Forces, as if they had all such Prospective Glasses (as <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> fancies) <hi>Caesar</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed the Country with, from the same Coasts; and having encouraged them not to <note place="margin">Roger Bacon,</note> be daunted at their Numbers, with Manhood not to be equalled, he rowed a stones cast or two from the Shoar, and there gave a notable defiance to them. Then, as if expecting to be assaulted, he commanded all the Engines of Battery to be set up, the Trumpets to sound a Charge, and the men to fall on, but no Enemy appearing, as if upbraiding the Cowardize of the <hi>Britains</hi> in great Triumph, he orders his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to fill their Helmets and Laps with Cockles, Muscles and other Shells, calling them the spoils of the Ocean, and due to the Capitol and Palace, and as a Trophy of his great Victory he erected a mighty high Tower, out of which as from a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rohs</hi> lights might every night blaze to direct Marriners in their Courses, the Ruines of which <hi>Pharoh's</hi> are sometimes seen at Low-water on the Shoar of <hi>Holland,</hi> and called by the people, there inhabiting, to this day <hi>Briten-huts.</hi> Having performed this mighty Exploit, he pronounced a Donative of an hundred Denaries to every Souldier, and, as if he had exceeded all Examples of <hi>Liberality,</hi> he bids them depart joyful with Plenty.</p>
                  <p>Had he stopped here, and not proceeded any further in this vanity, one might have thought he had been ashamed of so frivolous an Attempt, but so fond was he of his Conceit, that he carried of the Shells to <hi>Rome,</hi> requires a Triumph and divine Honours for this foolish Enterprize. Finding the State averse, he was once in the mind to have murthered them all, as envious of his Glory.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> DRUSUS CLAUDIUS CAESAR's Invasion of <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> out of the <hi>ROMAN</hi> Histories.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Britains,</hi> ever since the daies of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed their <hi>Laws, Customes,</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> they lived <note place="margin">Anne Dom. 44.</note> entirely within themselves, and although they paid Tolls and Impositions, yet it was not out of an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Submission to the Continent, but from the necessity of Trading with it. Being free from Forreign Disturbances, which vented the Ill humors of the State, they brake out into Inward Factions, those secret Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which eat out the heart of a Nation, and undermine the strength of it, whilst to Lookers on it appears the freshest.</p>
               <p>The different Parties, which scarcely in <hi>Caesars</hi> time united against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, now the <hi>Roman</hi> Rods, for three Emperours, that were taken off their backs, were laid on again with greater Violence; And whilst every petty state, upon little Interest, grew peevish one with another, and pusht on for Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, they wer swooped away by the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle, who at several Morsels easily mastered that Prey, which in a lump would have overgorged it.</p>
               <p>Affairs grew to that height, that by unnatural Ambition the Son rebelled against the Father, and many adhering to that, and other Factions, being overtaken or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in their designs, out of secret Guilt, and fear of deserved Punishment, fled their Country, forsook their Allegiance to their natural Soveraign, and betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the protection of <hi>Rome;</hi> And like Vipers, having eaten their way out of the bowels of their Common Mother, they took especial care that the wounds they had made should not be healed, nor the Breaches closed. This they did by laying open the weakness of their Country, and the easiness of a <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest. They had a Party in the Island that wanted only opportunity of Rising, and at the appearance of any to Head them would rise up in a moment.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:58825:112"/>
               <p>These Practices were so openly carried in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>British</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates hearing thereof, sent their Complaints, and required that these Fugitives might be delivered, and sent back to receive their due punishments. What Answer <note place="margin">Suetonius;</note> was returned is not known, but certain it is that no satisfaction was given in that point; For continually others, upon the same account, flocked to <hi>Rome,</hi> and were kindly entertained by the Emperour, insomuch that that City (as at its first Founding) was continually made the <hi>Asylum,</hi> or Sanctuary for all such as were disaffected to the present Government of their Country, or any Villanies that had incurred the penalty of the Laws.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adminius,</hi> in the time of <hi>Caligula,</hi> led the dance, and now <hi>Bericus</hi> (what he was further is not known) was grown into such favour with <hi>Claudius,</hi> that the <hi>Britains</hi> could no longer dissemble it, but in a general Commotion and Uproar rose against the <hi>Romans,</hi> who for Trading resided in the Island.</p>
               <p>This News was brought to <hi>Claudius,</hi> who, by the instigation of <hi>Bericus,</hi> resolves to <note place="margin">Dion. Cass.</note> revenge it, and by force of Arms reduce the whole Island to the <hi>Roman</hi> Subjection. To this end, he sends Orders to <hi>Aulus Plautius</hi> (at that time <hi>Praetor)</hi> to transport the Army, then lying in <hi>Gallia,</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> and withal commanding him, that upon any great emergencies of Affairs, he should not fail to give him intelligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plautius,</hi> in prosecution of his Orders, calls his Army together, but having laid open the Design, they all fell into Mutiny, complaining that they were to be led into a NEW WORLD, and to make War out of the compass of the Earth.</p>
               <p>In this matter they trifled out the time, until <hi>Claudius</hi> sent his Freed-man <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissus</hi> to appease the Souldiers, and to hasten their Embarking; But such was their Indignation, at the sight of him who had formerly been a Slave, that when he ascended the Tribunal to make an Oration to them, they generally cried out, 10 <hi>Saturnalia!</hi> an Exclamation used in those Feasts where in the Servant takes place of the Master, but immediately touched with the sence and shame of their Backwardness, unanimously followed their General.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plautius</hi> divides his Army into three Bodies, and Embarks them in as many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Squadrons, thinking thereby to secure his Landing, which might be obstructed if they should all make for the same Port. Having put to Sea, they were driven back by cross Winds and foul Weather, which so much disheartned the Souldiers, that had not a bright Meteor, shooting from the East to the West, seeming to direct their course to the Island, put new life into them, they had certainly drawn back, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted totally from the Enterprize.</p>
               <p>This happy Omen, as sent by the Gods, and presaging some good success, so raised their Spirits, that they resolved again to try the Sea, which fell out so well, that in a short time they were cast upon the Island, and found no opposition at their Landing, for the <hi>Britains,</hi> who before had Intelligence that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was in a Mutiny, resolved against the Expedition, and were negligent in preparing for them.</p>
               <p>And now finding them safe Arrived on the shoar, and in Weather when they least expected it, bereaved of all other Counsels, they betook themselves to the Woods and Marshes, hoping this way to weary out the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by a dodging War so to linger out the time, as the Courage of their Enemies being spent, and their Edge aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they might be forced to return without any great Exploit performed.</p>
               <p>This Policy <hi>Cassibelan,</hi> with success, maintained in his Wars against <hi>Caesar,</hi> and had it been prosecuted now with the same Constancy, no doubt but that it would have had the same effect; For we find that <hi>Plautius,</hi> with heavy Marches and troublesome Journies, had more labour and trouble to find them out, than found, to Conquer them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>British</hi> Armies, as well as their Counsels, were divided, both led on by two young Sons of <hi>Cunobeline</hi> deceased, <hi>Caratacus</hi> and <hi>Togodumnus,</hi> who (upon what designs is not known) keeping their Forces separate, and being too hot and heady for the thoughts of Delay, and rashly engaging one after the other, were both over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and put to flight, first <hi>Caratacus,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Togodumnus.</hi> No wonder therefore, if some of the <hi>British</hi> States relying not much on their Conduct, desired to make their Peace with the Conquerour; For after this Defeat, the <hi>Boduni,</hi> or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buni,</hi> seated about <hi>Oxfordshire</hi> and <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> and subject formerly to the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:58825:112"/>
                  <hi>Catuellani,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Buckinghamsbire, Hertford</hi> and <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> submitted themselves, and received a Garrison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plautius,</hi> after this Success, Marched on to a certain River, where he found the <hi>Britains</hi> on the farther side encamped, lying secure and careless, because they thought the <hi>Romans,</hi> without a Bridge, could not possibly get over. These <hi>Romans</hi> having <hi>Germans</hi> mixt with them, who in Armour were accustomed to swim, with ease, against the strongest Currents, were commanded to take the River, and unawares to assail the Enemy, but especially their Horse; For the <hi>Germans</hi> having got footing on the other side, fell unexpectedly on the <hi>British</hi> Camp, and, as they were ordered, spent all their Darts and Javelins upon the Horse, whereby they were so gauled, that the <hi>Britains</hi> not able to sit them, were forced to alight, and those which drew the Charriots, falling dead in their Geers and Harness, were not only made useless, but cumbersome.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> being now many of them on foot, and their Charriots unserviceable, <hi>Plautius</hi> sends <hi>Vespatian</hi> (who afterwards was Emperour) with <hi>Sabinus</hi> his Brother to second the Attempt; These coming on a sudden upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> and assaulting them unawares did much Execution, but the <hi>Britains,</hi> with the rest of their Forces, for that time retired. The next day re-uniting, they gave Battle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and with such Courage and Resolution, that for a long while the Victory hung doubtful, until <hi>Cajus Cidius Geta</hi> charged furiously upon them, and engaging almost beyond recovery, turned the scale on the <hi>Roman</hi> side, for which great piece of Service (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no Consul) he obtained afterwards at <hi>Rome</hi> Triumphal Honours.</p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>Britains</hi> retired to the mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> where being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Shallows and Sand-banks, they easily past it, but the <hi>Romans</hi> unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly following them, were in great hazard to be lost upon those dangerous Flats, but the <hi>Germans,</hi> some by swimming, others by help of a Bridge that was higher, having got over, so encompast the <hi>Britains,</hi> that they made great slaughter of them, but afterwards, in the heat of Pursuit, following too eagerly, in blind Bogs and Marshes they lost many of their Companions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plautius</hi> thought it not safe to proceed any further, having considered into what Traps the <hi>Britains</hi> had drawn him, and fearing that through the ignorance of the Country he might be led into greater dangers. With all, he perceived that the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Enemy, by so many Defeats, was rather inflamed than quelled, and that the death of their Prince <hi>Togodumnus</hi> (who, in one of the former Encounters had been slain) had so enraged them, that laying aside all thoughts of yeilding, they were bent upon nothing but Revenge; Besides, he had lost many of his Souldiers, the Countries he held, were his rather by Courtesie than Compulsion, and he well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the faith of Revolters, that upon the least turn of Fortune, they were ready to wheel about and fall into their ancient Allegiance.</p>
               <p>According to his Orders therefore, he sent unto <hi>Claudius,</hi> signifying in what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture his Affairs stood, the danger of proceeding any further with those few Forces he had, and the hopefulness of the design of Conquest, if assisted with greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. In the mean time, he employed himself in securing what he had got, and in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Garrisons In the most necessary Passes, so that with the residue of his Men he Encamped at the Mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi> to make good the Landing of new Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Claudius</hi> receiving this Intelligence, being now the third time Consul, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of a Triumph, chose <hi>Britain</hi> for his Province. <note place="margin">CLAUDIUS, in Person.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In his setting out from <hi>Ostia,</hi> he had like (by foul Weather) to have been drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon the Islands <hi>Stachades,</hi> then on the Coasts of <hi>Liguria,</hi> where being at last set on shoar, by Land he went to <hi>Marseilles,</hi> then to <hi>Callice,</hi> with such vast Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, as argued the difficulty of the Enterprize he was undertaking; For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, and the Auxiliaries of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> he carried with him many Armed <hi>Elephants</hi> to terrifie the <hi>Britains,</hi> and to amaze that Courage, which to that time no Force could daunt.</p>
               <p>With this Equipage he embarks, and having in a short time crossed the Channel, he joyns directly with <hi>Plautius,</hi> who lay waiting for him at the <hi>Thames</hi> Mouth. Then taking into his hands the entire Command of the whole Army, he passes the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to find out the Enemy, where he discovers them drawn up ready to give him
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58825:113"/>
Battle; For the <hi>Britains</hi> were impatient of Delaies, and had embraced those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels which had more heat and spirit, than true Conduct, and setled Resolution.</p>
               <p>Never had the Conduct of Old <hi>Cassibelan</hi> been more necessary than at this time; The <hi>Roman</hi> Army was great and unweildy, requiring vast Provisions, and lugging much Baggage after them, their Courage in a little time would have been wearied, and their Spirits spent, and their <hi>Elephants</hi> once constrained to follow through Bogs and Marshes, would have been foundered and rendred unserviceable. And the first heat of the Army in receiving their Emperour being over, no doubt but the Souldiery would have flagged in time, and mouldered away. But to engage with them just upon their receiving fresh Supplies, when they were newly animated with the presence of their Emperour, and the impressions of Joy not quite over, argues the young and raw Counsels the <hi>Britains</hi> then were under.</p>
               <p>And as this Fight was rashly undertaken, so were the consequences fatal, for the loss of <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> or <hi>Malden</hi> (the Royal Seat of <hi>Cunobelin</hi>) followed it, with the Surrender of many other Places of Importance, whose Inhabitants were dealt with according to their greater or lesser Obstinacy in yielding, some being received into Mercy, and others quite driven out of their Dwellings.</p>
               <p>For these successes <hi>Claudius</hi> was oftentimes, by his Army, saluted with the Name of <hi>IMPERATOR,</hi> a Title never given to any in the same War but once, but now often reiterated with the universal Acclamations of all, but whether out of flattery to his Person, or that some extraordinary circumstances in the Wars with the <hi>Britains</hi> above other Nations, deserved it, is uncertain. Afterwards he disarmed the <hi>Britains,</hi> and thought that sufficient for his security, without proceeding to the confiscation of the Goods of the Nobility and Gentry, for which Clemency of his they erected Temples and Altars to him, and, with Sacrifice, worshipt him as a God.</p>
               <p>Having thus gained sufficient Honour, he prepares for his Return to <hi>Rome,</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him <hi>Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Silanus</hi> (who had married his Daughters) to carry the Tidings of his Victories, leaving behind him also <hi>Plautius,</hi> to finish what he had so well begun, and to subdue the remainder of the Island. All this was accomplisht within sixteen daies, for no longer was he in <hi>Britain,</hi> and with so little noise and trouble, that it gave occasion to <hi>Suetonius,</hi> not long after, to write, <hi>That he subdued the Country without any Battle fought, or the least Blood shed.</hi> At his Return to <hi>Rome,</hi> whence he had been absent in all but six Months, he received a most Magnificent Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and, as if his Atcheivments had exceeded all Example, the Senate decreed yearly Games to his Honour, and set up stately Arches, not only in <hi>Rome</hi> but at <hi>Bulloigne</hi> also, the place from whence he set out. In this Expedition, they gave more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to him and his Son the Sir-name of <hi>BRITANNICUS,</hi> a Title no less glorious to them than that of <hi>Germanicus Africanus,</hi> or <hi>Asiaticus,</hi> to others, and conferred on <note place="margin">A remarkable Instance to the Honour of <hi>BRITAIN.</hi>
                  </note> them with far greater circumstances of Acknowledgment from the State. And this may be said to the Honour of our Nation, that even in the height of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it was esteemed so considerable a part of the World, that it was held not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to any of the forementioned Provinces, and cost as many Legions in preserving it, as all <hi>Asia,</hi> and was never forsaken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but in their last extremity.</p>
               <p>At the Triumph of <hi>Claudius,</hi> to make it more splendid, the Governours of Provinces were summoned to appear, and, as in a publick Jubile, all Banished persons, for what Crimes soever, were for that time admitted into <hi>Rome.</hi> Upon the Loover of the Palace a Naval Coronet was fixed, as if at that time <hi>BRITAIN</hi> had been the Mistress of the Sea, and that the Ensign of its new Subjection. Provinces presented their Crowns of <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> Gold; <hi>Gallia Comata,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> one of nine pound, <hi>Spain</hi> one of seven pound weight. He ascended the Capitol by the stairs on his knees, supported on each sides by his Sons in law, <hi>Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Silanus.</hi> He entred in Triumph the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea in a stately Vessel, more like a Palace than a Ship. To his Wife <hi>Messalina,</hi> by the Senate, was allowed the Highest place to sit in, and in his Triumph, she followed his Charriot in her <hi>Caroch</hi> or Hanging-Coach, after them followed <hi>Valerius, Asiaticus Julius Silanus, Sidius Geta,</hi> and others, on whom, in respect of this Conquest, he had heaped Triumphal Ornaments, the rest followed on foot, and in their Robes. After this he exhibited Triumphal Sports and Games, having assumed for that end the Consular Office and Authority, and besides the Solemnities in the Theatres, he instituted Horse Races for Prizes, between every Course, which were ten in all. Bears were killed, Champions fought, and the choicest Youths out of <hi>Asia</hi> danced the Warlike-dance in Armour.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:58825:113"/>
               <p>In the Field of <hi>Mars</hi> he exhibited a War-like shew, wherein he represented the storming and sacking of a Town, and the Surrender of the <hi>British</hi> Princes, himself presiding in the Robes of a General.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Licinius Crassus Frug.</hi> he gave the Honour to follow him in his Triumph, mounted upon a Trapped Courser, with a rich Caparison, and arraied in a Robe of <hi>Date-tree</hi> work; Upon <hi>Posidius</hi> the Eunuch, he bestowed a Spear-staff without a Head; Upon <hi>C.

No mention is made of this King in the <hi>Roman</hi> Histories of these Times, which maketh the Reign of this Prince too much suspected, considering that in these daies many memorable things were done and Recorded by the <hi>Romans</hi> concerning this Island, and more Inferiour Persons taken notice of, and so it seemeth more strange, that a Soveraign Prince, of so active a Spirit as <hi>Arviragus</hi> is made, and so Victorious against the <hi>Romans,</hi> should be totally neglected by their Historians, so that I am afraid, as well his Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with <hi>Hamo,</hi> as his Marriage with <hi>Genuissa,</hi> a supposed Daughter of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as likewise his Treaty with the Emperour, his Homage to him, the naming of <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,</hi> or <hi>Glovernia, Claudiocestria,</hi> in honour of his Nuptials with <hi>Claudius</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as likewise his Exploits against <hi>Vespatian</hi> at <hi>Richborough,</hi> will be all accounted of the same stamp, and for that reason I will omit them; And I will only make mention,

that about the sixth year of his Reign, <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> sent by <hi>Philip</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, preached, as is generally supposed, the Gospel of Christ in this Island, having a place assigned him about <hi>Glastenbury</hi> by this King, whom afterwards he converted to the Christian Faith, if <hi>Harding</hi> writes true,</p>

on the Morrow to many Eyewitnesses. Afterwards the same Bishop, the number of the Saints of that Church increasing (the Lord revealing it to him) added to that Church on the Easternpart, a Chancel, which he consecrated in Honour of the Blessed Virgin, the Altar of which, for a Memorial of the same to future Ages, be adorned with a <hi>Saphire</hi> of unknown value, and least the place and plat-form of that Church, through such Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations might be forgotten, there is erected a Column or Pillar, in a Line drawn through the Eastern Corners of that Church, towards the South, dividing the aforesaid Chancel from the same; and the length of it was, from that Line towards the West three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score feet, its breadth twenty six feet, the distance of the Centre of that Column from the middle Point, between the afore said Corners, forty eight feet.</p>

                     <p>THe Character upon this Plate is not so Ancient, as not above 300 years old, if so much, and though there might be in other places (which is difficult to prove) Churches built so early, yet that they were encompassed according to the Modern Custome, with Church yards, will hardly be granted. There were many Churches in the Cities of <hi>Britain</hi> soon after the first Times of Christianity, but never any Church-yards till the time of <hi>Cutbert,</hi> the tenth Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> from St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who in the year of our Lord 798, procured the priviledge of having Church-yards in Cities from the <hi>Pope;</hi> Whoever of the Ancient and Primitive Christians, made mention of burying any body in Churches, or in those Times, of the dedication of Churches to Saints, or that the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was called upon, and worshipped by her Contemporaries? And this is to be observed, that there is no mention made concerning Dedication, before the time of the building of that Church, which is reported to have been in the year from the Passion 31, nor in the time of <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> or about five hundred years afterwards, until St. <hi>David,</hi> who was made Archbishop of <hi>Menew, Anno Dom.</hi> 519. and held that Seat 65 years, for he is reported to have lived 145 years that first discovered it.</p>

                  <head>THE CONTINUATION OF THE Roman History, UNDER CLAUDIUS BY HIS LIEUTENANTS.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AULUS PLAUTIUS</hi> left by <hi>Claudius</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> after the Emperours departure, gave himself to the diligent prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the War, and so behaved himself in quieting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling Countries, and gaining new Conquests, even to the West of the Island, that <hi>Claudius</hi> decreed he should have a petty Triumph, and at his Entrance into <hi>Rome,</hi> himself went to meet him, giving him the Right-hand both in his going and coming.</p>
                  <p>Neither were the Actions of <hi>Vespatian</hi> (afterwards Emperour) less remarkable in this War, for partly under the Conduct of <hi>Claudius</hi> himself, and partly of <hi>Plautius,</hi> he fought thirty Battles with the <hi>Britains,</hi> two most powerful Nations, and above <note place="margin">Suetonius;</note> twenty Towns, together with the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> he brought to his Subjection, for which Worthy Deeds he received Triumphal Ornaments, and a little while after, two Sacerdotal Dignities, and a Consulship.</p>
                  <p>His Son <hi>TITUS</hi> served under him in quality of a <hi>Tribune,</hi> and was much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for his Valour and Diligence. He had the good Fortune to rescue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive his Father, and his Modest Behaviour was as signal as his Courage, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by many Inscriptions upon his Images, dispersed through the Provinces of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Britain.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Camb. Brit.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>OSTORIUS SCAPULA</hi> succeeded <hi>Plautius,</hi> in the quality of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretor,</hi> a Man no less experienced in Martial Affairs. At his first entrance into <note place="margin">Tacitus, di vit. Agri.</note> Command, he was welcomed with many Commotions and Troubles, for that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which was not yet subdued, broke in upon their Neighbours who had entred into League, or made any Submission to the <hi>Romans,</hi> wasting their Fields, and with so much the more vigour, for that they thought this new General (not yet acquainted with his business, nor having experience of his Army) would not be able to Revenge it, especially considering that the Winter season was drawing on, and the time unsit for Action.</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:58825:116"/>
                  <p>But <hi>Ostorius</hi> knowing that the first Success makes the greatest impressions of Fear, or Confidence, resolves to put a stop to their Inroads betimes, before they proceeded too far, and to that intent he snatched with him some of his lightest Cohorts, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly set upon them, killing many, and following them that sted so clofely, that he gave them not time to Rally, and lest for the future he might be continually plagued with a dangerous and unfaithful Peace, which would be alwaies beating up his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and give neither to himself, nor his Souldiers, any rest, he disarms all whom he suspected might Revolt, and set Garrisons on the two Rivers <hi>Sabrina</hi> and <hi>Antona,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to tie up the Incursions of the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>By this means he reduced the most Southerly parts of the Island into the nature of a Province, and to secure his Conquests the better, he gives several Cities to <hi>Cogidunus,</hi> to be held of the <hi>Romans</hi> under the Title of a King, by which Bribe he engaged him deeply to his Party, it being an ancient practice of that State to flatter Princes for their advantage, and by a specious shew of Honour and Respect, to make them Instruments of their own Ambition, and Vassals to their will, a haughty Pride observable in Commonwealths. First they drew them up with the Plumes of <hi>Majesty,</hi> and seemed to adore them, and afterwards, their turns once served, with as great Contempt and Ingratitude they trampled upon them. And this I take notice of here, because <hi>Tacitus</hi> seems to glory in it, and it way possibly be the Humors of others as well as the State of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iceni,</hi> or the People of <hi>Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgshire</hi> and <hi>Huntingtonshire,</hi> a potent Nation, and not yet wasted by War, because they had voluntarily entred into Alliance with the <hi>Romans,</hi> finding (that upon the least suspicion) they might be disarmed as well as their Neighbours, and perceiving that they should be enclosed in the <hi>Roman</hi> Line, which was stretched as far as the <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Avon,</hi> or, as some think, the <hi>Trent</hi> Northward, could not brook these proceedings of <hi>Ostorius,</hi> so took Arms, and by their Example encouraged many of their Neighbours to do the like. This done, they encampt in a place chosen for that purpose, casting up a Rampier of Earth, and leaving the Entrance narrow, for fear the Enemies Horse might break in upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ostorius,</hi> although he had not his Legions with him, but only his Auxiliary Forces, yet resolved, if he could, to break down this Fence, which he perceived was but rudely thrown up, and setting all his Cohorts to work, the Horse also allighting to that Service, he giving the signal, at once they rent down the Works, and fell upon the Enemy, and levelled their narrow Trenches.</p>
                  <p>Here the <hi>Britains</hi> were sorely streightned, but knowing, that if they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the reward of their Revolt would be slavery, and that if they had a mind to escape, their own Fortifications were against them; They did whatever men in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and despair could do, bravely revenging themselves upon the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>In this Battle <hi>M. Ostorius</hi> the Son of the Lieutenant gained the Honour of having saved a Citizen. But at length being overcome, other States, by their sad Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were confirmed in their Obedience to the <hi>Romans,</hi> having hitherto waited the success of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> standing in a doubtful posture, between War and Peace.</p>
                  <p>After this success, <hi>Ostorius</hi> marches into the Country of the <hi>Cangi,</hi> supposed to <note place="margin">Cambd. <hi>Brit.</hi>
                     </note> be a small Territory in <hi>Somersetshire</hi> (for I cannot imagine them to be the Inhabitants betwixt the <hi>Iceni</hi> and the <hi>Humber,</hi> because they lay not in the way to the <hi>Irish</hi> Seas, as by the following Progress we may imagine the <hi>Cangi</hi> did) where he plundered and laid waste their Fields, they not daring to give him Battle; And, if at any time they ventured out of their secret Coverts, to fall in the Reer, and endeavoured to cut off his Marches, they alwaies met with sharp entertainment. At last he came to the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, where News was brought him that the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> supposed the Inhabitants of <hi>Yorkshire, Lancashire,</hi> the <hi>Bishoprick</hi> of <hi>Durham, Westmoreland</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> were up in Arms.</p>
                  <p>Upon this he resolves to return, being fully purposed not to attempt any new Design till he had fully quieted these Commotions behind him, which he found no great difficulty in performing; For they, after a few losses, and a general Pardon to all that should lay down their Weapons, readily submitted and embraced it. But the Nation of the <hi>Silures,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> were not so easie to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for neither by fair words and allurements, nor by threats and Menaces, could
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:58825:116"/>
they be brought to a Compliance, but needs they would have a War, and seemed not to be bridled or kept under without Garrisons of Legionary Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>To effect this, <hi>Ostorius</hi> sends to the Colony at <hi>Camolodunum,</hi> confisting of <hi>Veterane</hi> Souldiers, these he placed in his new Conquest adjoyning, that they might be an obstacle to new Revolts, and a means to train the People into a Conformity to the <hi>Roman</hi> Customes and Laws.</p>
                  <p>This done, he went against the <hi>Silures,</hi> who, besides their natural and inborn Fierceness, were much exalted with the opinion they had of the Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Caratacus,</hi> a Prince, who by many doubtful, and some fortunate Attempts, had raised himself to a greater Reputation in Arms, than any of the <hi>British</hi> Generals; He finding himself over-matched in Strength made use of Policy, he knew that his advantage lay in choice of Ground, and in places that were fittest for Ambush. To that end he makes the seat of the War in the Country of the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> or <hi>North-Wales,</hi> a Region full of Narrow passes, Rocky and Mountainous, and easie teneable by a few.</p>
                  <p>Having drawn into his Society all that were Ill affected to the <hi>Roman</hi> Allyance, he resolves here to try it out to the utmost. <hi>Ostorius</hi> followed him, and finds him drawn up, and resolutely prepared for Battle.</p>
                  <p>The place he had chosen was strangly fortified both by Art and Nature, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses to it were full of difficulties to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of no less security to the <hi>Britains,</hi> either in Advancing or Retreating. It was scituated between craggy and broken Mountains, and when any Gaps or Passages lay open, he stopt them up with huge Stones ramb'd in between, and that ground which lay level he fortified with a Ditch and Rampire.</p>
                  <p>There was but one side left that the <hi>Romans</hi> could attack him at, where there ran a River not to be foarded, without some confusion and disorder on the Enemies Party. Against this place he set the choicest of his Souldiers to assault them at their passage, drawing a Line behind them of slight work, to break the impression of the Enemy, if they should be forced to Retreat.</p>
                  <p>The place where <hi>Garatacus</hi> drew up his Army, is supposed, by Mr. <hi>Gambden,</hi> to be a Hill on the West of <hi>Shropshire</hi> called Caet Caradoc, at this day scituated among many doubtful Foards, and the Ruines of the Rampire as yet remain.</p>
                  <p>Things thus ordered, the Leaders of the several <hi>British</hi> Nations went about the Army encouraging the Souldiers, and exhorting them not to be daunted with vain Fears, praising such as they saw cheerful and eager for Battle, and raising the Spirits of others where they perceived them drooping, with comfortable expressions, and such like allurements of War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caratacus</hi> especially bestirs himself, and with quick motion stirring from place to place, <hi>This,</hi> he cried out, <hi>was the Day,</hi> and <hi>This the Field which would be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their Liberty, or the beginning of perpetual Slavery.</hi> And here he invokes the Names of his glorious Ancestours, who had driven out <hi>Caesar</hi> the Dictatour, and by whose Valour they had hitherto been freed from the <hi>Roman</hi> Bondage and Tribute, and their Wives and Children preserved from dishonour.</p>
                  <p>After these and such like speeches, the Army testified their Joy by loud shouts and acclamations, and every one, according to his Country superstition, bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by Oath, <hi>That neither Darts nor Wounds should make them yield.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This couragious and chearful Alacrity startled the <hi>Roman</hi> General, withal he descried the River before him, and the Rampier made upon it, both of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to be passed. The steep Hills full of Armed men, and hanging over their heads, gave a dismal prospect, and a terrible scene of War; But the Common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were eager for Battle, and required the Signal, crying out, <hi>That to Valorous men nothing was impregnable,</hi> and this their Impatience was encreased by the <hi>Prefects</hi> and <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who gave out the same words.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Ostorius,</hi> having first variously sought out which Fords were passable, which not, whilst there he had continued, he led them on, and with no difficulty wades through the River. When they were come up to the Rampire, and within ken of the <hi>British</hi> Darts and Javelins, they were sorely gauled by them, and because the <hi>Britains</hi> had the advantage of the Higher ground, and the <hi>Romans</hi> were to fling their heavy Piles up hill, their losses were far the greater.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:58825:117"/>
                  <p>And during this distant Fight, such was the great slaughter on the <hi>Roman</hi> side, that not able longer to endure it, the Legions took to their Antient discipline of making of a <hi>Testudo,</hi> which was done by their coming to their close Order, locking their Targets one within another, over their heads, the manner of which is described in the following Figure.
<figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in speaking more particularly of this <hi>TESTUDO,</hi> we shall describe it according to the Directions of <hi>Livy, Tacitus, Dio Cassius,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the</hi> Amphitheatre <hi>(a Place people accustomarily resorted to see any strange thing Acted) was brought a considerable number of Men, who after some motion and seemly March, suddenly cast themselves into a square Troop, and locking their Targets close together, over their Heads, the first Rank of men stood upright, the next bowing their Bodies a little downward, the third and fourth imitated it by degrees, in manner of a Descent, insomuch that the last Rank of men kneeled upon the ground, so that their Targets on the outside seemed bending like the Tiles on a House.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Upon this Roof or</hi> Testudo <hi>(being applied to the Wall of a Fort or Castle) Men ran Armed to fight those that stood ready to defend themselves, and in case their Scaling-Ladders (wanting length) proved unserviceable, then they erected one</hi> Testudo <hi>upon another,</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> justifies, when he saith, <hi>That in case of necessity, the</hi> Roman <hi>Souldiers climbed up a Wall,</hi> super iteratam Testudinem, <hi>building one</hi> Testudo <hi>upon another, and these were contrived with such speed and Art, that they could as soon be built as demolished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It farther appears, that the <hi>Romans</hi> used a <hi>single Testudo</hi> to break through and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the Ranks of Horse-men on a sudden, although fixt in a good order for Battle. But for Mirth and Divertisement they usually made one <hi>Testudo</hi> upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on which they Vaulted and shew'd Tricks, not only to evidence the nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Bodies, but the strength and good use of so ingenious an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Name, <hi>TESTUDO,</hi> was given to those Shields so united, not only for their strength, but because on the outside it seemed like the backs of some <hi>Shells</hi> or <hi>Tortoises;</hi> and thus much may suffice to shew the use and reason of the Name <hi>TESTUDO,</hi> which is represented in the precedent Figure.</p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:58825:117"/>
                  <p>Thus under the shelter of their Shields, which were as a Roof over them, they advanced to the slight Works the <hi>Britains</hi> had cast up, and with no great trouble did cast them down, and so went to grapling.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> not able to endure the close fight of the Legions, strive to disengage themselves, and to get up to the top of the Mountain, hoping from those steep Precipes to regain their advantage of flinging their Darts. But such was the eagerness of the <hi>Romans</hi> that they followed them at their heels, the light Armed first, and after them the heavy Legions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> who had gotten up, bestowed their Darts plentifully, but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the <hi>Romans</hi> went on, and breaking into the Ranks, some they flung down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, others they kill'd and wounded, as having neither Helmet or Breast-plate to defend them. And now the <hi>Britains</hi> knew not which way to turn themselves: if they engaged the light Armed and Auxiliary Forces of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they were beaten down with the broad Swords and massie Pikes of the Legionaries, if on the other side they set upon the Legionaries, the light Spears and pointed Swords of the Auxiliaries were as equally fatal to them, so that not able to hold up any longer, they flung down their Arms, a few only escaping.</p>
                  <p>This Victory was rendred famous by two Noble Captives here taken, the Wife and Daughter of <hi>Caratacus,</hi> and it had been well if that Princes Misfortunes had here ended, for his two Brothers (after his Overthrow) revolted to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and he himself (as adversity is seldom safe) having escaped the pursuit, and fled to the Protection of <hi>Cartismandua,</hi> Queen of the <note n="*" place="margin">Yorkshire, Lancashire, <hi>Bishoprick of</hi> Durham, Westmorland Cumberland.

                  <p>His name at <hi>Rome</hi> was no less celebrated, the Emperour thinking he did Honour to himself in praising the worth of a Person, and advancing the Credit of a Nation, over both which before he had Triumphed.</p>
                  <p>Being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> the People were called together as to a publick and solemn Spectacle. The Emperours Guards were drawn out, and stood to their Arms before <note place="margin">The manner of <hi>Caratacus</hi> Reception at <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>The Prayers and Submissions of others, through Fear, were base and degenerate, but <hi>Caratacus,</hi> Great, even in the midst of his Misfortunes, with a steady and erected Countenance, and a look that yet retained its Majesty, stands before the Tribunal of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and speaks to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If my Moderation in Prosperity had been as great as the quality of my Birth and Fortune, I might have come to this City rather as a Friend than a Captive. Neither</hi>

If of necessity you must Command all things, it follows all must Obey. If I had sooner been betrayed to you, my Misfortune had made less noise in the World, and your Conquests had not been so Renowned. After my death I should have soon been forgotten, but if you let me live, you make me a lasting Monument of your Clemency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Claudius,</hi> being taken with his Behaviour, pardons him, his Wife and Brothers, and commands their Irons to be knockt off; After which they did their Reverence to the Empress <hi>Agrippina,</hi> who sitting by in State, expected it, giving her the same Thanks and Praises they had done to the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>After this, the Lords of the Senate assembled, where many and magnificent things were discoursed concerning the Captivity of <hi>Caratacus.</hi> And it was generally
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:58825:118"/>
agreed that this Action was not less Honourable to <hi>Ostorius,</hi> than the taking of King <hi>Siphax</hi> by <hi>P. Scipio,</hi> or the <hi>Macedonian</hi> King <hi>Perses,</hi> by <hi>Lucius Paulus,</hi> or any others who had led Princes in Triumph, and therefore for his eminent Service to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, they decreed him Triumphal Ornaments.</p>
                  <p>But the like Fortune did not attend <hi>Ostorius</hi> in his succeeding Actions, for whether the <hi>Romans</hi> were grown careless and negligent, being rid of so considerable an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as <hi>Caratacus,</hi> or whether the <hi>Britains,</hi> in compassion of the Misfortunes of so great a Prince, were more eagerly bent upon Revenge, whilest the Camp-Master and some Legionary Cohorts were left to fortifie some certain places in the Country of the <hi>Silures,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> encompast them about, and if succour had not speedily arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the neighbouring Towns and Garrisons, there had not a man of them esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; Nevertheless, the Camp-Master, with eight Centurions and many of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest Souldiers, were slain.</p>
                  <p>Upon the neck of this, followed another loss on the <hi>Roman</hi> side, for a Party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent out to Forrage, were suddenly set upon, beaten and dispersed, together with some Troops of Horse, who came too late to relieve them. <hi>Ostorius</hi> sends some of his Foot, lightly Armed, to succour both Parties, and to try to make them Rally, but they served but to increase the Flight, until the Legions coming up undertook the Battle, and by main strength first poised it, and afterwards turned the Scale.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> got off with little or no loss (the day being almost spent) and never after appeared in great Parties, but out of Woods, Boggs and Marshes, made frequent Sallies in small Bodies, as Conduct or Chance led them, upon Necessity or Valour, Anger or Prey, sometimes commanding others although without Command. And this way of Skirmishing, though taken up by the <hi>Britains,</hi> out of Necessity rather than Choice, yet had it greater success and proved more fatal to the Enemy than their great Bodies. This the <hi>Silures</hi> well perceived, and wisely managed the advantage, and above all the <hi>British</hi> Nations, they entertained a mortal Hatred against the <hi>Romans,</hi> and watched all opportunities to do them mischief. They had heard that the General should give out, <hi>That he would root out the very Name of them.</hi> A saying that they could never forget, and although often courted to a Compliance, they ever afterwards looked upon the <hi>Romans</hi> not only as their Enemies, but the haters of their Nation.</p>
                  <p>This exasperating of a People, of it self not very tractable, proved of ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to the <hi>Romans;</hi> For they seeking out all means to vent their spight, at last met with a comfortable occasion, two Cohorts, led on by the Avarice of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, were gone out to pillage and plunder the Country, and it seems, following their business with more greediness than heed, were insensibly drawn too far from their Head Quarters. Upon their returns loaden with Spoil, they were intercepted, many of them slain and wounded, and the rest all taken Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Silures</hi> made good use of this good success, and in scornful manner sent about the Captives to the Neighbouring States, as Presents, at once revenging themselves on the <hi>Romans,</hi> and encouraging others to assist them in their Revolt, by making them partake of the guilt; And that these Captives might be more acceptable, they sent along with them much spoil, by all which Arts they procured many to declare for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ostorius</hi> now tired out with so vexatious an Enemy, and sensible how he lost daily <note place="margin">Ostorius <hi>dead.</hi>
                     </note> in his Reputation, died for very anguish and grief, the <hi>Britains</hi> triumphing, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no particular Fight, yet the adverse War had taken off so considerable a Commander.</p>

                     <p>ABOUT this time died <hi>CLAUDIUS,</hi> the first Emperour that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued this Island, and reduced it into the nature of a Province, much <note place="margin">Suet. <hi>vits</hi> Claud.</note> celebrated for his <hi>British</hi> Conquests, the only honour of his Reign, but far happier in the choice of worthy Commanders than his own Conduct.</p>
                     <p>The calamity of <hi>Britain</hi> was so much the more to be lamented, in that it stooped to a Prince of very small Endowments, and yet worshipped him as a God, whom Historians can scarce allow to be a Man. For, as he was desirous of Glory, which in him could rather be called <hi>Instinct</hi> than <hi>Vertue:</hi> so was he withal so dull and stupid, that in his Child-hood he was the grief of all his Parents, and, in his riper years, the Laughing-stock of <hi>Galigula,</hi> and the sport of the whole Court. After his Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which was attended with odd circumstances of folly, although Majesty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his face, yet through all, even then, were his defects visible. They adored him most whose approaches were at greater distance, and though he awed the World, yet was he made a Property to his Wives and Domesticks.

                     <p>In the time of this Emperour there served in <hi>Britain</hi> three Legions, <hi>viz.</hi> the second Legion, <hi>Augusta;</hi> the ninth Legion, <hi>Hispaniensis;</hi> and the fourteenth, named <hi>Gemina Martia Victrix.</hi>

                        <hi>Didius</hi> was well stricken in years, and therefore better fitted for the present Affairs, which required rather a Cautious than an Active Commander, and so we find him, for having in some measure put a stop to the Incursions of the <hi>Silures,</hi> and cooped them up within their bounds, he set himself altogether to secure what his Predecessors, <hi>Plautius</hi> and <hi>Ostorius,</hi> had gained.

                        <hi>Britains,</hi> which continued for many years, for it seemeth by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who relateth it entirely, in two distinct places, that it began under this <hi>Didius,</hi> and lasted to the daies of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and was the occasion of much vexation to the <hi>Romans,</hi> during their Civil Wars with <hi>Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius.</hi> The occasion and progress of it I will set down together (although it was the business of many years following) with the same Reasons for so doing, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> gives, for fear, least if told in parcels, it would not be so well fitted for memory.</p>

But nothing could engage the heart of treacherous <hi>Cartismandua,</hi> but she who had betrayed her Country, proved false to her Lord and Husband, forsaking him, and descending to the embraces of of <hi>Vellocatus</hi> his Groom, whom afterwards she made Partner of her Bed and Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Venutius</hi> deeply touched with this open Injury, raised Forces against her, and her Paramour, and first the War continued between them only; the <hi>Good will</hi> of the Country being on <hi>Venutius</hi> his side, and on hers, <hi>Lust, treachery</hi> and <hi>deceit.</hi> This one would have thought was a very unequal match, and yet it held up long on both sides, for <hi>Cartismandua,</hi> by usual arts and practices, had trained and got into her possession the Brother and near Relations of <hi>Venutius,</hi> which for some time strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her Party, having so many of the Royal Family at her disposal. But the People fearing the cruelty of her nature, that in time she might do Violence to them, and jealous to be brought under the uncomely subjection of a Woman, the Male Issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extinct, unanimously declared in favour of <hi>Venutius,</hi> and for the liberty of his Brother and Relations. And now there seemed nothing could hinder the punishment of her Adulteries, but the Interposition of the <hi>Romans;</hi> And <hi>Venutius</hi> perceiving them to draw together, and knowing well the Obligations that Queen had done them, in betraying <hi>Caratacus,</hi> and adorning the Triumph of <hi>Claudius,</hi> kept a jealous eye over them, and found that they held secret Intelligence with her, and seemed to defer the owning of her Cause, only, till greater strength should arrive.</p>
                     <p>This he resolves to prevent in time, and therefore, with what Forces he had, he set furiously on those Cohorts who were already assembled, and at the first charge made great slaughter of them, and so presently, with some losses, retired. There was a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion coming to joyn with them under the Conduct of <hi>Caesius Nasica,</hi> for <hi>Didius</hi> was old and did all by Deputies. <hi>Venutius</hi> advised of this, resolves to be before hand with him, meets them in their Journey, sets upon them, and with the like success retreated.</p>

                        <hi>Cartismandua</hi> now reduced to the greatest extremities, thought of nothing but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing her Person by escape, to that end she sent to the <hi>Romans</hi> for a Guard, which being granted to her, through many Skirmishes, and great difficulties, got up to her, and with much adoe rescued her, but the Kingdom was left to <hi>Venutius,</hi> and the War to the <hi>Romans</hi> to manage.</p>

                        <hi>Cartismandua</hi> (as appeareth by <hi>Tacitus</hi>) sheltered her self for a long time under the <note place="margin">Tacit. <hi>ibid.</hi>

Such little favour found she with those persons, whom she thought she had so infinitely engaged, so that we may leave her like a Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet following of the Camp, hated by the <hi>Britains,</hi> and without question, derided and despised by the generous <hi>Romans.</hi> And no doubt, she proved the burthen and clog of their Affairs, for in their difficulties, during the Civil Wars of <hi>Rome</hi> under the three succeeding Emperours, she was the hated cause that drew the Arms of <hi>Venutius</hi> upon them.</p>

                        <hi>VERANIUS,</hi> a Propetor, succeeded <hi>Didius,</hi> a rigid and strict Commander, nd perhaps the loose discipline of the <hi>Romans</hi> under his Aged Predecessor, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him more than ordinary Severity. He found at his arrival things in no good posture, great slaughter had been made of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which he endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on the <hi>Silures,</hi> but having made a few inroads into their Country, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by death from proceeding any further, leaving this behind him either out of flattery to his Master <hi>Nero,</hi> or insight into the Country, that in two years, had he lived, he would have conquered it all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PAULINUS SUETONIUS</hi> next obtained the Province, who was esteemed a Souldier inferiour to none of his time, for two years together he reigned prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, subduing many Nations, and fortifying what he had got with new Garrisons. Encouraged with this success, and having no small thoughts within him (for he was emulous of the glory of <hi>Corbalo,</hi> a Souldier of great reputation in that Age) he began to think of new Islands to Conquer. <hi>Mona,</hi> or <hi>Anglesey,</hi> at that time, was very populous from the concourse of people that fled thither for security, and a place of no small annoyance to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for it administred great assistance to the <hi>Britains</hi> upon all their occasions, in their Revolts.</p>
                     <p>To Invade this, he first built flat-bottomed Boats to carry over his Foot, the Horse followed either upon the flats and shallows, or else, where it was deeper, swam it.</p>
                     <p>Upon the Shoar slood ready to receive them a strange medly of an Army, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of <hi>Men, Women</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> the Men were well Armed and stood thick, the Women and Priests ran up and down after the manner of Furies, the former with their Hair ruffled about their ears, and in black Garments, and the <hi>Druids</hi> carried Torches before them, and with their hands lifted up to heavan, poured forth direful Execrations.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> astonisht at the novelty of the sight, stood still, as Stocks, not being able to stir a foot, though receiving many wounds. At last a wakened and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their General, and animating one another not to fear a rout of Mad-women and Lunaticks, they bore on the Standards, trampled down all before them, and ran Men and Torches on a heap together; Then he placed Garrisons on the Conquered, cutting down the Groves consecrated to their bloody Superstition, for they held it lawful to sacrifice Captives, and to consult their Gods by prying into the Entrails of men.</p>
                     <p>But whilst he was busie in this Island, his absenoe gave occasion to a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the <hi>Britains,</hi> many sore grievances were complained of, among which these were reckoned as the chief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prasutagus,</hi> King of the <hi>lceni,</hi> having for many years hoorded up great store of Wealth, to secure it to his two Daughters, at his death made <hi>Caesar</hi> Co-heir with <note place="margin">Tacitus, <hi>Ann. lib. 14.</hi>
                        </note> them, not doubting but by that signal Testimony of his good will to the Emperour, he should preserve his Family from Oppression, and his Daughters from dishonour. It fell out quite contrary, for under pretence of taking possession of the Emperours share, his Kingdom was laid waste and robbed by the Centurions, and his House ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sackt throughout by the ravenous Collectors, who behaved themselves with all the licentiousness of Conquerors, his Wife <hi>Boadicia</hi> they whipt, her two Daughters ravished, &amp;c. as if the whole Kingdom, by Testament, had been left to them. The Chiefest of the <hi>lceni</hi> were dispossest of their ancient Inheritances, and the Royal Family turned out and used as Slaves.</p>
                     <p>As these unsufferable Insolencies were the cause of the Revolt of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> so the <hi>Trinobantes</hi> wanted not matter of complaint, especially against the <hi>Veterans,</hi> whom they hated with a mortal hatred; For they being made a new Colony at <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> now <hi>Malden</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> they violently thrust out the Inhabitants from their Houses, seized their Lands and Estates, insulting over them as Captives and Slaves, anddo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering like Lords in their lawful Possessions. The other Souldiers likewise complied with the <hi>Veterans</hi> and encouraged them in their Licentious proceedings, being of the fame Gang, and out of hopes hereafter to enjoy the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Temple</hi> dedicated to <hi>Claudius</hi> was cause also of great heart-burnings, they lookt upon it as the monument and badge of their eternal Servitude, and the Priests

therein officiating under the pretence of Religious offerings and dues, grievously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted <note place="margin">Dion. Cass.</note> from the People, and <hi>Catus Decianus</hi> the Procurator or Receiver of Tribute, renewed the consiscation of their Goods, and though they pleaded the remitment thereof by <hi>Claudius,</hi> and a Temple for that purpose erected to his Clemency, yet with great Injustice he over-ruled them; And, which was a more general Oppression, <hi>Seneca,</hi> whom one would think a Saint in his Writings, having drawn in the <hi>Britains,</hi> to take of him vast sums of mony, to the value of 1000000 <hi>l.</hi> sterling upon promise of easie Loan, and to take their own time for the payment, on a sudden called it all in at once, and that with great violence and extortion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> therefore meeting together discoursed their Grievances after this manner;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Patience availed them nothing, but that by their sufferance they got the opinion</hi>

                        <hi>of easie fools, and their burthens accordingly were daily increased. Formerly they had but one King or Peer to Lord it over them, now there were two thrust upon them; The Lieutenant to suck their blood, and the Procurator or Collector to drain their Estates. That the variance of these Rulers, or their agreement, was equally pernicious to them, the one tormenting them with his Armies, the other with Wrongs and Extortions: all things were liable without exception either to their Avarice or Lust, and he was esteemed the bravest Souldier who could rob and plunder most. Nay, they were come to that tame sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as to suffer their Houses to be broken open and ransackt by the most cowardly and pitiful Rascals, and their Children to be taken from them, and listed by their Adversaries, as if they were fitted to die any death but what should be for their own Country. What a small number would remain in the</hi> Roman <hi>Army, should they have left out the</hi> Britains <hi>from their Masters, the</hi> Germans <hi>had shaken off the yoak, although defended by a River only, not the Ocean, and why might not they do the like, considering their Cause was far the Nobler, the delivery of their Country, their Wives and Parents, and on the other side, nothing could be pretended but Lust and Ambition. Had they but imitated the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their Ancestors, they might have chased these Intruders from the Island, as their Fore-fathers had done</hi> Caesar, <hi>and could they but have endured the brunt of one or two Battles, no doubt but the Courage of the miserable and despairing would be found greater than the Confidence of the proud. That the Gods themselves now shewed their pitty to the</hi> Britains, <hi>and held the</hi> Roman <hi>captain and his Armies safe employed in another Island, and gave them one opportunity more, which was the greatest favour, to consult and deliberate of their Condition together, which occasion, if they did not make use of, it would be found more dangerous to have discoursed the calamities of their Affairs, than to strive to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With these and the like Speeches they encouraged each other, and first the <hi>Iceni</hi> took Arms to reveng the wrongs done to their Queen, and the dishonour of his Daughters, next the <hi>Trinobantes</hi> declared, and after them all who had any sence of Liberty, and were not born to be Slaves. And it seemed no hard matter to the <hi>Britains</hi> to raze and destroy the whole Colony of <hi>Malden,</hi> being fortified neither with Trench nor Rampier, and, by the careless security of the <hi>Roman</hi> Officers, made for pleasure rather than defence.</p>
                     <p>This general and dangerous Insurrection was headed by the insensed <hi>Boadicia,</hi> and the fatal consequences of it were ushered in with no less wonderful signs and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. Among the rest, the Statue of Victory at <hi>Malden</hi> fell down of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, with its back turned as if it would pass to the Enemy, and Women in a holy rage and extasie, Prophetically sung, <hi>That destruction was a coming,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal noises were heard in the Councel-House, and howlings and screechings in the Theater, strange Spectres walked in the neighbouring <hi>Frith,</hi> the Oceans lookt of a <note place="margin">Camb. <hi>Brit. The Frith of</hi> Famesa; Tacitus <hi>calls it</hi> Tamesa.</note> Bloody-hew, and, at low Tide, the shapes of dead Bodies lay imprinted on the Sands, all which Prodigies raised hopeful expectations in the <hi>Britains,</hi> but in the <hi>Veterane</hi> Souldiers, terrour and despair. For by this time <hi>Boadicia</hi> (leading after her infinite multitudes) had destroyed some scattered Garrisons of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was now prepared to attack them at their chief Quarters, at <hi>Malden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Colony understanding of her approach, sent to <hi>Catus Decianus,</hi> to send them speedy supply (for <hi>Suetonius</hi> had but lately heard of their Revolt, and could not come up time enough for their relief) but he spared them but two hundred men, and those ill Armed, for the Hatred the <hi>Province</hi> bore him, for his Exactions, made him
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58825:120"/>
look to his own security. Neither were there wanting in the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrison, them, who secretly and under-hand, favoured the Revolters; These advised the Souldiers, that they were too few to maintain any Out-works, and, that fortifying and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching the Town would but divide and scatter the Forces, that in all probability the Enemy durst not attack them, or if they did, that the present Bulwarks were sufficient, and, in case they failed, the Temple was a place of great strength, and teneable by a few.</p>
                     <p>Thus, by intermixing with all their Councels, they betrayed them into security, and so lull'd them asleep, that as if it had been high Peace, they thought not of any thing necessary for a Siege, no not so much as to send away those that bore not Arms, who would but be so many Mouths to devour their Provisions.</p>
                     <p>In this disorder they were beleagured round with the <hi>British</hi> Army, the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works held not out the first Storm, but left the City naked and open to be sackt, and burnt by the inraged Enemy. The Souldiers crowded themselves into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and there stood hudled together under the defence of the Walls, but in two daies were taken, the sumptuous building made a heap of Rubbish, and all destroyed. The <hi>Britains</hi> managing this Victory in the most cruel-manner, put the <hi>Romans</hi> to all the exquisite torments that Anger, Revenge or Malice, could invent.</p>
                     <p>In the current of their success, and while the heat lasted, they met with <hi>Petilius Crealis,</hi> the Lieutenant of the ninth Legion, marching to the succour of the Garrison, who set upon him, routed his Legion, kill'd all the Foot, and forced him, with the residue of his Horse, to take sanctuary in his Trenches; And now <hi>Catus Decianus,</hi> finding himself the cause of all this, and sensible of the Hatred of the <hi>Provinces,</hi> and the guilt of his Extortion, like a tall man betook himself to his Heels, and so fled over into <hi>Gallia.</hi> But <hi>Suetonius,</hi> with a wonderful constancy and resolution marches clearly through the Enemies quarters to <hi>London,</hi> a Town, though not in name, yet in effect, a Colony full of <hi>Roman</hi> Inhabitants and Traders, and of great renown for its plenty of all necessary Provisions.</p>
                     <p>Having fitted himself here for a while, he considered whether he should make this the seat of his War, but finding the numbers of his Souldiers not much increased, and taking example by the Rashness of <hi>Petilius,</hi> which was sufficiently punished, he resolved to March out, and, by the loss of one Town hoped to save the rest; Neither could he be diverted from his Resolution, either by the cries or tears of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, but taking all with him who were willing to make part of his Army, he left the rest, whose Age, Sex, or love to the place, would not suffer to follow, who were all, afterwards, miserably slain by the Enemy, and their City sackt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
                     <p>The same slaughter attended the Inhabitants of <hi>Verulam,</hi> for the <hi>Britains</hi> slighting the Forts and Garrisons of Souldiers, flew only at prey and booty, and attackt those places which were weakest defended, thus they grew daily lazier in their business, rejoycing more in taking Plunder than strong Holds.</p>
                     <p>All this while the losses of the <hi>Romans</hi> were great, seventy thousand of them and their Allies are reckoned by <hi>Tacitus</hi> to be slain, and <hi>Suetonius</hi> numbreth them among the greatest Plagues and Misfortunes attending the evil Government of <hi>Nero,</hi> for <note place="margin">Suetonius <hi>de vita</hi> Neronis.</note> what in other Wars, is usually in this way utterly excluded, no change of Prisoners allowed, no Ransomes or giving of Quarter, the slaughter was the same in cool Blood as in hot, and with Gibbet, Fire and Cross, the <hi>Britains</hi> proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them rather as Malefactours than Enemies, the Women, as well Matrons as Virgins, they stripped stark naked, hung them up, and cutting off their Breasts, <note place="margin">Dion. Cassies.</note> sowed them to their mouths, that in the Agony of death they might seem to devour their own flesh, the <hi>Britains</hi> all the while feasting and making merry in the Temple of <hi>Andate,</hi> their Goddess of Victory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suetonius</hi> by this time had got together about 10000 Men, well appointed, made up of the fourteenth Legion, the chief of the Twentieth, and some of the Auxiliary Forces from the neighbour Garrisons. With these he resolves no longer to delay, but to give speedy Battle to the <hi>Britains,</hi> this he signified to his Chief Commanders, and withal gives them the Reasons enforcing him to so sudden an Engagement; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions were grown short, the Souldiers eager to revenge the sad Calamities of their Friends, and Allies, that were fresh in their memories; and although but a few in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:58825:121"/>
comparison of their Enemies, yet were they steady and resolved. On the other hand, the <hi>Britains</hi> although swarming in numbers, wanting Order and Discipline, were grown heady, rash, and inconsiderate, and puffed up with their late suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, were over confident and forward, measuring falsly the reasons of their Victories, by their Numbers rather than Courage; That now therefore was the time, whilest they were glutted in Blood, in the midst of their Guilt and vain Confidence, and under the Conduct of a Woman, to set upon them, and in one manful Attempt, to regain what in several parcels they had lost.</p>
                     <p>This Counsel was followed by all, but <hi>Poenius Posthumus,</hi> an Ancient Souldier, and now Camp-Master. It seemed to him to have more in it of heat than true conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and proceeding from a rash Bravery rather than <hi>Roman</hi> Conduct. He knew <hi>Suetonius</hi> to be of a haughty and proud Courage, and feared, that to vindicate his Honour and Reputation he would hazard and endanger all, and be carried beyond the bounds of a sober and just Resolution. He advised him therefore not to think as yet of regaining his losses, but saving his stake, to fortifie and encamp warily, and to expect new supplies, he shewed that this was alwaies the method of the <hi>Roman</hi> discipline, and that it was never more necessary than in this conjuncture of Affairs, that the <hi>Britains</hi> newly flusht with Victories, were grown resolute and undaunted, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, with their Losses, fearful and dead-hearted, that it was convenient to give them time to recover their spirits, that their Enemies no doubt by delay would grow cooler, and their great Numbers would scatter and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse.</p>
                     <p>And it was concluded, that it was absolutely necessary to wait for a more hopeful opportunity of Revenge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suetonius</hi> notwithstanding, persisting in his resolution, and although <hi>Posthumus</hi> utterly refused to joyn with him, and, contrary to his positive Command, withdrew his Legions and encamped, yet with the rest of his Forces he went out to seek the Enemy, and chose a convenient place to embattle his Army.</p>
                     <p>It was an open Plain, with a narrow passage into it, so that he could not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winged by the Enemy, on his back was a Wood, whose passages being blockt up with huge Trees laid across, secured him in the Rear, so that the Enemy could not attack him but on the Front, the wings of his Army lay to the open Country, where he was certain no Ambush could be laid. His Legionaries made up the body of his Army, and stood thick and well compacted, they were lined on all sides with light armed Souldiers, and the Horse was placed in the Wings.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> were drawn up before the mouth of the narrow passage that led into the Plain, in such multitudes, and nevertheless were extended all abroad in Troops and Companies, and with Exaltations and Noises, as if they were going to a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph rather than a Battle, nay, so confident were they of Victory, that they brought their Wives and Children to be Spectators of that daies work, who sat in Charriots upon the skirts of the Plain to behold the sport, and to glut their eyes, as they made sure account of the slaughter of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eoadicia</hi> her self carrying her Daughters in a Charriot before her, as she came to every Nation, declared, <hi>That it was usual for the</hi> Britains, <hi>in times past, to make War under the Conduct of a Woman, but for her part, she desired them not for the present to look upon her Dignities, but their Common liberty, that though she was their Queen, and might justly call upon them to revenge the loss of her Crown and Estate, yet she could wave those smaller Considerations, and lay before them, as matter of just Resentment, those horrid Indignities she had received, the Violence to her Person, and the Rapes of her Daughters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She told them, <hi>That the Insolence of the</hi> Romans, <hi>and their Lust, was grown to that height, that neither the reverence of Age, or the innocency of Virginity, could preserve them from dishonour. The Gods would be present and assist them in their just Revenge, and, that one Legion which adventured to fight was cut off, the rest that remained, either hid themselves in the Camp, or were thinking already of an escape. That they would not be able to endure the Shouts of so many thousand, much less their force and impression, and if they, with her, considered their advantage of Numbers, and their Cause, they should strive to overcome, or die; This (she a Woman) was fixt upon, the Men, if they pleased, might live and be Slaves.</hi>

                     <p>Neither was <hi>Suetonius</hi> in so great an extremity, silent, and, although he relied much upon the Courage of his Souldiers, yet he thought it not unnecessary in a business wherein would be decided the whole Controversie of <hi>Britain,</hi> to descend even to Prayers and Entreaties; He desired them therefore, <hi>to despise the vain and empty Noises of the Enemy,</hi> and to consider, <hi>that in their Camp were more Women to be seen than Men, that weak and unarmed they would soon yield, when they came to Contest with</hi> Roman <hi>Valour, which had often overcome them. That in great Armies, and where there are many Legions, the stress of the Battle alwaies lay upon a few, and that it would be to their greater Honour, if with a small Power they should win the fame of a whole Army;</hi> withal, he ordered them <hi>that they should keep close, and first, with their heavy Darts, gall the</hi> Britains, <hi>afterwards press upon them, with their Swords and Pikes in their Shields, and follow the slaughter in a Body well wedged together. That they should not scatter and disperse for Plunder, but that after the Victory every thing would be their own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Souldiers received these Exhortations of their General with such alacrity, that the Legionaries began already to try their Arms, and sit themselves for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and they shewed such great handiness in it, having been experienced thereto in many Battles, that <hi>Suetonius</hi> perceiving their Joy and Readiness, was even certain of the event, and so gave the signal for the Onset.</p>
                     <p>And first of all, the Legion which for some time had kept its ground, and been defended by the narrowness of the place, as a sure Fortification, at last, watching its opportunity, when the <hi>Britains</hi> had spent their Darts at random, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to a nearer engagement, they prest in upon them in a close Body, after the nature of a <hi>Wedge,</hi> and so worked themselves into the Enemies Battle, that they soon broke and dispersed it.</p>
                     <p>And now the same resolution was found in the <hi>Auxiliary</hi> Forces, and the Horse, with their long Spears flung down all that came near them, and brake in pieces some Parties who stood yet united.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Britains</hi> began to betake themselves to flight, but were hindred by the multitude of their own Charriots, which had blockt up the passage for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, so that they yielded their necks to the slaughter, which was so great, that it is reported, fourscore thousand died upon that small spot of ground.</p>
                     <p>Neither did the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Rage spare any, for even the Women and Cattle served to make up the heap of dead Carkasses; And all this was performed on the <hi>Roman</hi> side with the loss only of four hundred, and as many more wounded.</p>

                           <hi>BOADICIA,</hi> described in Person by the <hi>Greeks.</hi>

                        <hi>sternvisage, but withal modest and chearful, a rough and hoarse voice, her Hair of a bright Yellow, hanging in Tresses to her very skirts, about her Neck she had a Chain of Gold, and was apparelled in a loose Garment of changable Colours, wearing a Kirtle there under very thick plated, in her hand she carried a Spear, she was highly devoted to</hi> ANDATE, <hi>the Goddess of Victory, and seemed much to triumph in her self, for in her address to that Female Deity, she used these expressions;</hi> I being a Woman, adore thee O <hi>ANDATE</hi> a Woman.</p>
                     <p>The same <hi>Historian</hi> likewise delivers the manner of the Fight otherwise, and that the Victory was not obtained with so little difficulty, but that the <hi>Britains</hi> would have renewed the Battle had not the death of their Queen discouraged them, but I rather follow the report of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who wrote next to these times, and who may be <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> supposed to have truer intelligence, in that some Circumstances of her life, relating to the <hi>British</hi> Affairs, engaged him to more particular Enquiries after them.</p>
                     <p>The death of <hi>Boadicia</hi> was attended on the <hi>Roman</hi> side with that of <hi>Paenius Posthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> Camp-Master of the second Legion, who having expected to have heard of the ruine of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> and the defeat of his two Legions, being informed on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of their great success, fell upon his Sword, and so, by a <hi>Roman</hi> death, in some measure attoned for the breach of <hi>Roman</hi> discipline, in not obeying his general Pardon, and by this means he escaped the punishment that might have followed, and delivered himself from the Clamours of his Legion, whom by his cautious Counsels he had defrauded of part of his glory.</p>
                     <p>Thus was the Island by one Battle restored again to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which, by the <note place="margin">Tacitus, <hi>vit.</hi> Agric.</note> absence of <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Anglesey,</hi> had been well nigh lost, but neither yet could the <hi>Britains</hi> think of totally submitting, but many of them who were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally involved in the guilt of this Revolt, and who feared the vindicative nature of the <hi>Roman</hi> General, which begun already to appear, stood out in a posture of defence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Suetonius,</hi> to make an end of this War, kept the Field, and by removing his Tents as he saw occasion, continually awed the <hi>Britains.</hi> And now <hi>Nero</hi> sent unto him new Supplies out of <hi>Germany,</hi> two thousand Legionary Souldiers and Auxiliary Cohorts, and one thousand Horse, by whose coming they of the ninth Legion had their Companies made up and compleated with heavy Armed Souldiers. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts and other Troops were lodged in new Winter Quarters, and those Nations who continued in open Hostility, or in doubtful Allegiance, were prosecuted with Fire and Sword.</p>
                     <p>But nothing so much afflicted the <hi>Britains</hi> as Famine, having generally neglected the tilling of the Ground, and employed all hands in carrying on the War, hoping, by the Defeat of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to have served themselves of their Provisions. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless many Warlike Nations could not be brought to any Compliance, but were encouraged to stand out, for that they had heard of great Clashings between <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> and the new Procurator, <hi>Julius Classicianus,</hi> who was sent to succeed <hi>Catus</hi> in that employment.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Classicianus</hi> had entertained some grudges against the General, and preferred his private Resentments before the Publick good. He gave out, <hi>That a New Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was to be expected, who should be void of Rancour, and not hurried on with the pride and insolence of a Conquerour, one that should with more Clemency, and less Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, consult the condition of the Conquered.</hi> And it is certain, that <hi>Suetonius</hi> (though other waies a Worthy person) carried himself too Imperiously over the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> and revenging the Injuries which he thought done to himself, by their Revolt, oftentimes went beyond the bounds of Justice or Moderation. He writ Letters also to <hi>Rome,</hi> in which he signified, <hi>That no end of the War was to be expected, unless</hi> Suetonius <hi>was removed,</hi> and ascribed all the Losses received to his ill Conduct, and his good success, not his well management, but the Fortune of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:58825:123"/>
                     <p>To compose these Differences between the Lieutenant and Procurator, and to view the State of <hi>Britain, Nero</hi> sent <hi>Polycletus</hi> his Free-man, hoping by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not only to put an end to the Dissension, but to compose the minds of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who yet continued in their Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Polycletus</hi> with a mighty Host past through <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gallia,</hi> a heavy burthen to both Nations, and at his arrival at <hi>Britain</hi> was received with different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, for the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was awed with his presence, but to the <hi>Britains</hi> he was matter of laughter and scorn, for they had not so far lost the sence of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> that they were ignorant of the power of a <hi>Freed Man,</hi> and wondered that so great a Captain and Army that had ended such a considerable a War, should be at the beck and disposal of a Slave.</p>
                     <p>For the present, all things were represented to the Emperour in favour of <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who went on still in prosecuting his Affairs, but having lost upon the shoar some Gallies, with the Slaves that rowed them, as if the War continued still, he was commanded to deliver up the Army to <hi>Petronius Turpilianus,</hi> who was newly out of his Consulship.</p>
                     <p>This Lieutenant was more exorable than <hi>Suetonius,</hi> being a stranger to the faults <note place="margin">Ann. Dom. 60.</note> of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and easier of pardon, as never provoked by the <hi>Britains,</hi> or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly incensed by a Revolt. He gave himself wholly to the quieting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, not attempting any new Conquests, imposing the specious name of <hi>PEACE,</hi> from which proceeded <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>TREBELLIUS MAXIMUS</hi> succeeded him, not inferiour in the laziness of his Temper, a Man utterly unexperienced in Martial Affairs, and who was fit only to be employed by such a Masters as <hi>Nero.</hi> Nevertheless he continued the Government to the daies of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and held the Province in Obedience by a kind of Complaisant behaviour.</p>
                     <p>By his remiss Carriage he suffered his Army to grow idle and loose, by which means, he enslaved <hi>Britain</hi> more by the <hi>Roman</hi> Vices, than all his Predecessors had done by their Arms; but I shall leave some of his character to the daies of <hi>Otho,</hi> and proceed to that of <hi>Nero.</hi>

                     <head>THE LIFE OF NERO.</head>
                     <p>IN the daies of this Governour died <hi>NERO,</hi> a Prince whose <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> might equally be esteemed great, had not the former seemed to proceed <note place="margin">An. Dom. 70.</note> from Constraint, the latter from the Inclination of his Nature; for five years he continued an excellent Prince, but the remainder of his daies was spent in all <hi>Riot</hi> and <hi>Debaucheries,</hi> and they who give a particular Catalogue of his Vices, seem rather to reckon up the depravities of Human Nature, than the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of one Man; There is little in his Life that relates to <hi>Britain,</hi> but what doth is full of Cruelty, and Extortion.</p>
                     <p>He slew <hi>Aulus Plantus,</hi> the first Lieutenant under his Father <hi>Claudius,</hi> by whose Valour <hi>Britain</hi> was subdued to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ordered his Execution to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed so suddenly, that he had not time to take leave of his Children, or to give them his last Blessing and Farewel. There was but one hour between his Sentence and his Death, when immediately hurried out of the <hi>Esquiline</hi> Gate into a place set apart for such bloody offices, he was slain by the hand of <hi>Tacius</hi> the Tribune, and died so full of Constancy, that he upbraided not the Executioner with the ignominy of his Guilt, or the Emperour with the remembrance of his Services. The Cause of his Death was never known, but the after-Actions of this Emperour made it appear, that nothing but the exceeding Merit of <hi>Plautius</hi> was the cause of his destruction, and his Victories in <hi>Britain</hi> His death at <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus died the first Lieutenant of <hi>Britain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With the same Cruelty <hi>Nero</hi> proceeded against <hi>Marcus Ostorius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Publicus</hi> the second Lieutenant. The Father had the happiness to end his Victories and his daies at once, but his Son, who under his Father had performed great things in <hi>Britain,</hi> and had obtained a civical Coronet in the Fight against the <hi>Iceni,</hi> going to <hi>Rome</hi> was suspected by <hi>Nero,</hi> who by his Tyranny was now grown fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and exceeding suspicious of all Vertuous men, having of late discovered a dangerous Conspiracy. He therefore suborns one <hi>Antistius Socianus</hi> to accuse <hi>Osto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> That he consulted with <hi>Parmanes</hi> an Astrologer, and enquired after the life of the Emperour, and that he was ill affected to the present Government; For these feigned Crimes, though absent at his Country-house, he is convicted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and a Centurion sent to dispatch him.</p>
                     <p>The Centurion found him walking in his Grounds, where having shut up all pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of escape, he delivered unto him his Message. <hi>Ostorius</hi> moved with Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that his Services should receive so ill a reward, and disdaining to die by the hands of so mean an Executioner, fell upon his own Sword.</p>
                     <p>These Cruelties of <hi>Nero,</hi> although inferiour to his many Parricides, I have more particularly taken notice of, in that they relate to Persons eminently concerned in the enslaving of this Island, whose fate, though undeservedly given by him who was obliged for such Services, yet may seem to be justly called for by the blood and sufferings of Innocent <hi>Britains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great destruction of the <hi>Romans</hi> and their Colonies in <hi>Britain,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Boadicia,</hi> is ascribed (by <hi>Suetonius</hi>) as the certain consequence of the <note place="margin">Suet. <hi>vit.</hi> Ner.</note> ill Government of this Prince, and his Vices. But <hi>Nero</hi> made better use of it, he had been often foretold, <hi>That the time would come when he should be deserted and forsaken, and forced to take up with the Government of the East, or the Kingdom of</hi> Jerusalem. Yet with these hopes, <hi>That he should be afterwards restored to the Empire, when</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>was well near lost together with</hi> Armenia, he saw himself in a very fair way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fulfilling of the Prophesie.</p>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:58825:124"/>
                     <p>But these Provinces being again recovered, he thought the danger was past, and so comforted himself up with the thoughts, That <hi>the desertion spoken of Wars, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Revolts,</hi> and <hi>that his restoring to the Empire,</hi> was the regaining of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                     <p>Confirmed in this opinion was he by one who bade him have a care of the <hi>Seventy third year,</hi> which he falsly interpreted to the daies of his own life, and not to <hi>Galba,</hi> who deposed him.</p>
                     <p>Pufft up theresore with assurances of Long life and Dominion, that little Religion he had he utterly cast off, and the <hi>Syrian</hi> Goddess, to whom he had been especially devoted (many of whose Altars are found in <hi>Britain,</hi> and who was a peculiar Deity of this Island and <hi>Gallia,</hi> as hath been formerly shewn) he so much slighted, that in contempt of her he made her a Pissing-Block, and took to a little Baby, whom he gave out, discovered all Conspiracies against him. But at last he was deposed by <hi>Galba,</hi> and after he had reigned about thirteen years and a half, he slew himself in the prime of his Age, and with him ended the Line of the <hi>Caesars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>NERO</hi> sent the twentieth Legion, which although called back, and again sent by <hi>Vitellius,</hi> after the Civil Wars between him and <hi>Otho,</hi> yet was it recalled again by <hi>Vespatian</hi> against <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and after the settlement of the Empire under <hi>Vespatian,</hi> in all probability sent into this Island again, for <hi>Josephus</hi> writes, that in his daies four Legions were in <hi>Britain. Britain</hi> (saith he) <hi>is encompassed about with</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Josephus.</note> 
                        <hi>the Ocean, and almost as big as our World, the</hi> Romans <hi>there inhabiting have brought it under their Dominion, and four Legions do keep in subjection an Island Peopled with so great a multitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To preserve all their Provinces the <hi>Romans</hi> had but twenty nine Legions, out of which <hi>Britain</hi> had four, by which we may see what a great proportion this Island bore to the whole World, and how considerable a part thereof it was esteemed in those daies.</p>

                     <p>He held the Empire but seven Months, and then was slain by <hi>Otho's</hi> Conspiracies.

                     <p>And now the <hi>Britains</hi> began to suck in the pleasures of <hi>Vice,</hi> and to entertain the Luxuries of <hi>Rome,</hi> so that <hi>Trebellius</hi> gave himself to Ease, finding no great cause to molest the <hi>Britains,</hi> who were so ready to comply with him in a lazy Cessation. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, who had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies kept in exercise, or busied in some Expedition or other, now being left to an Idle life (as it alwaies happens) fell to Civil Dissensions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trebellius</hi> by them was grown hated and despised, as it seems, for his niggardly and covetous Temper, and this aversion they had entertained against their General was heightened by <hi>Roscius Gaelius,</hi> Legate of the twentieth Legion, an ancient Enemy of his, insomuch that oftentimes by flight, and hiding himself, he escaped the fury of his Army, afterwards, debasing himself in a low and creeping manner, he held a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Authority, as if he and his Army had agreed that they should enjoy the Licentiousness of their living, and he his safety.

                        <hi>Bolanus,</hi> during these Commotions, was not able to preserve Discipline, much less to attempt any thing upon the <hi>Britains.</hi> The Divisions continued the same in the Army as in the time of <hi>Trebellius,</hi> only this difference, that <hi>Bolanus</hi> was innocent and not hated for any Vices, and carried himself so equally, that though he had not the Authority of a General, yet he ruled by the Affections of the Souldiery.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>Vitellius</hi> fearing the Power of <hi>Vespatian,</hi> whose Forces began daily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, wrote unto <hi>Bolanus</hi> for Aids, but he was not able to send him any, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Britains</hi> were not sufficiently quieted, but taking the advantage of these Diffensions among the <hi>Romans,</hi> raised continually new Commotions, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Souldiers of the fourth Legion, incensed against <hi>Vitellius,</hi> were sent for over by Letters from <hi>Mutianus,</hi> in favour of <hi>Vespatian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this condition was <hi>Britain,</hi> during the Government of <hi>Bolanus,</hi> when <hi>Vitellius</hi> was deposed, about the tenth Month of his reign. He was a great Glutton, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately given to the satisfying of his Appetite, that it was the great employment of his Captains from all Provinces, to provide him the most delicate Fares; he is reported at one Supper to have been served with two thousand dishes of the choicest <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> Fish, seven thousand of Fowl, and in the short time of his Reign, <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith, he had wasted nine hundred millions of <hi>Sestercies,</hi> which amounteth to about seven mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions sterling. He was by nature bloody, insolent and haughty, during his Prosperity, and as base and dejected in Adversity. He had not courage after his Defeat to die like a <hi>Roman,</hi> much less an Emperour, but lived to the reproaches of an Ignominious death. With his hands bound behind him, and a Rope about his neck, he was led through the Market place, the People all along reviling him unto the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, where, by piece-meals he was tore asunder, his miserable death moving Compassion only in some, and such who had been the greatest haters of his life and memory.</p>

                     <p>IN all the Civil War between <hi>VITELLIUS</hi> and <hi>VESPATIAN,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ann. Dom. 72.</note> no Quarrels or Mutinies arose in the <hi>British</hi> Army. And in the Wars of <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> although through the negligence of <hi>Trebellius,</hi> and Faction of <hi>Caelius,</hi> some differences happeend, yet came it never to Blood shed, and generally no Legions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themselves more harmless: possibly because they were so far off and separated by the Ocean, or for that they had learnt, by continual Service and Warfaring, to hate all Hostility.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Vespatian</hi> declared for the Empire, his great favour and reputation in Arms easily won the Island to him. He had served from a youth in the <hi>British</hi> Wars, and being Lieutenant of the second Legion, under <hi>Claudius,</hi> had fought many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and won many Towns from the <hi>Britains,</hi> so that the fourteenth Legion, called the <hi>Subduer of Britain,</hi> went actually into his Service, and although in the other Legions there were some Centurions and Souldiers who had been advanced by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,,</hi> and were loath to change the Prince they had proved, yet were they also at last brought to his Party, for when <hi>Mutianus</hi> (<hi>Vespatian</hi> then governing the City of <hi>Rome</hi>) had made <hi>Agricola</hi> (a man of great Integrity, and faithful to their Party) Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the twentieth Legion in <hi>Britain,</hi> this Legion was slowest in swearing Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to <hi>Vespatian,</hi> through the sedition of their former Legate, by which means it was grown stubborn, and hard to be ruled even by the Consular Lieutenants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen into his Command to succeed, and Revenge. He shewed an example of most rare Moderation, in choosing to be thought rather to have found them, than to have made them, dutiful Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>And, although <hi>Vectius Bolanus,</hi> Lieutenant General of <hi>Britain,</hi> for the time being, governed in a more remiss and mild manner than was expedient for so Fierce a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, yet <hi>Agricola</hi> being placed under him, wisely conformed himself to that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, having learnt to discern what was convenient, as well as knowing what should be done, by which means he tempered the heat of his Spirit, which otherwise might have grown too violent upon him.</p>
                     <p>But when <hi>Vespatian</hi> had absolutely in his possession the Government of the World, and with it <hi>Britain</hi> also, Now it is we hear of great Captains, brave Souldiers, and <note place="margin">Tacit vit. Agr.</note> the hopes of the Enemy but small, for speedily <hi>Petilius Crealis</hi> being sent in the room of <hi>Bolanus,</hi> struck a Terrour into them.</p>
                     <p>He Invaded the State of the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> a Nation esteemed most populous of all the Province, fighting many Battles with them, and some not without great Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; For <hi>Venutius,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> who, as he heard before, was incensed with the <hi>Romans,</hi> for their protection of <hi>Cartismandua,</hi> watching his opportunity of Revenge, when the Civil Wars brake out, made use of that advantage, and fell upon them. Sometimes the Victory was on one side, sometimes on the other, but he held them tack to the last, remaining to the end unvanquisht. Neither could <hi>Crealis</hi> touch some parts of his Dominion, and although he had a few little Victories, yet he had alwaies enough of War.</p>
                     <p>To him succeeded <hi>Julius Frontinus,</hi> who following so great a man as <hi>Crealis,</hi> had enough to do to keep up his Reputation. But the Fame of his Predecessor could not cloud the worth of his Actions, by sorce of Arms he subdued the stout and War-like Nation of the <hi>Silures,</hi> which was more honourable to him in that he had to struggle with the difficulty of Ground, as well as the Courage of the Enemy.</p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:58825:126"/>
                     <p>In this condition were Affairs in <hi>Britain,</hi> at the Arrival of <hi>Julius Agricola,</hi> sent hither in the last year of <hi>Vespatian.</hi> He was trained up from his youth in the <hi>British</hi> Wars, and with his Victories extended the <hi>Roman</hi> Pale, beyond all his Predecessors. His coming was in the midst of Summer, when the Souldiers, as if that years work had been over, began to be negligent and remiss, and the <hi>Britains</hi> on the other hand, too watchful for Advantages.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Ordovices</hi> already, to welcome the new General, had lately cut in pieces a squadron of Horse quartered in their Country, few escaping, and they who were eager for War, approved the Example, and looked upon it as a leading Card, whilest others thought it safer to expect and try first the temper of the new Lieutenant. Then <hi>Agricola,</hi> although the Summer was spent, the Souldiers dispersed in their quarters, and all presumed upon ease and rest for that year, though he knew there would be much difficulty in drawing them out to a Winters Expedition, and his Officers disswading him from it, yet notwithstanding he resolves to meet the danger, and gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether some of the chief Legionary Souldiers, and with a small handful of Auxiliaries marching to seek out the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> he found them drawn up in a place of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, resolving not to quit their Ground, which perceiving, he advanced to the head of his Army, and himself led them on; The Souldiers perceiving their General in equal danger, followed, and by degrees ascended to the Enemy, where they made such slaughter, that almost the whole Nation of the <hi>Ordovtces</hi> perished at once.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agricola</hi> followed this success vigorously, and suffered not the fame of this Action to cool by after remissness, well knowing, that his first Atchievments would be the measure of all his future Successes. He resolves therefore to subdue the Isle of <hi>Mona,</hi> from the possession whereof <hi>Paulinus</hi> was recalled by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the <hi>Britains.</hi> Wanting Ships, which upon so sudden a Resolution could not be got ready, he used Policy in transporting his Men, and he commanded them to lay down their Luggage, and the chief of the Auxiliaries, who were acquainted with the Passage, and whose Country use had taught them at once to swim, govern their Horses, and fight. He ordered them to take the water, and assault the Enemy, the <hi>Britains,</hi> who never dreamt of so near a danger, but expected Fleets and Shipping to attack them, perceiving the <hi>Romans</hi> got over, cried out for <hi>Peace,</hi> and delivered up the Island, esteeming nothing impossible to be done by them who could fight in the midst of the Waters.</p>
                     <p>This sudden success got great Fame to <hi>Agricola,</hi> especially in that he employed the time of his Entrance in Labour and War, which by other Governours was spent of course, in Complements and Congratulations for their Arrivals. Neither was he pufft up with vain Conceits, by the happiness of the Success, he called it not a <hi>Victory,</hi> or <hi>Expedition,</hi> but was content only to say, <hi>That he had reduced those to their obedience who before had been Conquered;</hi> Neither did he bedeck with Lawrels his Letters of Advicement to <hi>Rome,</hi> which moderation of his in dissembling his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories encreased his Honour, all people admiring upon what hopes of future Atchievments he could be silent of such great things he had already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                     <p>Having thus tried the strength of the <hi>Britains,</hi> the next thing he gave himself to, was to understand the minds and inclinations of the People, and like a prudent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, experienced in such Affairs, he had learnt, <hi>That Force and Arms were unable to keep a Nation in obedience, unless Injustice and Oppression were removed.</hi> Whereupon, to make sure of <hi>Peace,</hi> he resolved to take away the Causes of <hi>War,</hi> and because the Branches would continually grow unless the Root was cut up, and nothing was so powerful as Example, he began the Reformation in his own Family, reducing it to a convenient Number, and good Orders, and bridling the Licentious behaviour of his Domesticks, a work of as much difficulty, and no less honour, than the subduing of a Province.</p>
                     <p>He suffered the management of no Publick Affairs to pass through the hands of his Attendants, or Servitours, nor gave any Commands for favour or affection; No Souldier was advanced by bribing his Officer, nor could any by under-hand means, beg an Employment. He was accounted fittest for Trust, who behaved himself as
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:58825:126"/>
the best Souldier, and although he was not able to execute all things himself, yet was nothing done without his privity and consent. Small faults he would either wink at, or pardon, great ones he corrected with severity, yet oftner pleased with the repentance of the Criminal, than his punishment, advancing such as he thought would be careful not to offend; by which means he was provoked by the fewer Offences.</p>
                     <p>He truly stated the proportion of Corn, and Tribute to be paid, by which proceeding he cut off the Exactions of his Officers, and their unnecessary Fees, and other Grievances, that were more burthensome than the Tribute it self. For the poor People were forced to attend at the publick Granaries, which, in mockery, were fast locked against them, and when opened, the Publicans obliged them to take greater quantities of Corn than their need required, and at a racking price, which they were often constrained to sell again at a low rate, to make mony for other Necessaries, or the payment of their Tribute.</p>
                     <p>They proclaimed the <hi>Mercates</hi> at their distances from the People, and lying through bad Roads, which Inconvenience could not be bought off without a round sum, which if not presently paid, the Carts and Waggons of the Inhabitants were prest to remove the Grain, which before lay convenient to be delivered out, to the great oppression of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and the lucre of the <hi>Roman</hi> Officers.</p>
                     <p>By redressing of these Grievances, in his first year, he brought <hi>Peace</hi> into some credit and reputation, which before, by the negligence or connivance of men in Command, had as ill a name as <hi>War.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About this time died <hi>VESPATIAN,</hi> whose Actions in <hi>Britain</hi> were as great as those in his Empire; he was made Legate of a Legion by <hi>Claudius,</hi> and in this <note place="margin">Ann. Dom. 80.</note> Island fought thirty times with the Enemy, conquered two potent Nations, and above twenty strong Towns.</p>
                     <p>He was a moderate Prince, if not given too inordinately to the love of Riches, and in a Triumph which was given him by the Senate, he professed himself rather wearied with the Pomp, and long Solemnity, than touched with the Honour of it.</p>
                     <p>Being about to give up the Ghost, he said in a jesting manner to the Standers by, <hi>I think I am making a God,</hi> by which saying he secretly reproved them, who would be esteemed Gods, after they had given the surest Testimonies of their being Men.</p>

                     <p>Having thus pretty well amazed them, he began with kind and gentle Behaviour to shew them the allurements of Peace, by which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, many Cities that before stood upon Terms of equality, now laid down their Anger, gave Hostages, and received Garrisons, which were all placed with such care and fore-sight, and in such places of advantage, that never any of them were attempted, whereas before no new fortified place in all <hi>Britain</hi> escaped unattacked.</p>
                     <p>The following Winter was spent in wholesome and profitable Devices, for to the end that the <hi>Britains</hi> who lived rude and scattered, and so apter for War, might be brought to the sence of Pleasures, and to live in ease and quiet, and in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes and Customes of a Civil life, he privately encouraged, and in publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the building of Houses, Temples, and places of general Resort, commending the readiness of some, and quickning the slowness of others, making that which was Necessity to become Emulation.</p>
                     <p>And now the Noble-mens Sons he caused to be instructed in the liberal Sciences, and by commending the Wits of <hi>Britain</hi> before the Students of <hi>Gallia,</hi> he brought them, who hated the <hi>Roman</hi> Language, to be in love with the <hi>Latin</hi> Eloquence. Now came the <hi>Roman</hi> garb to be in fashion, and the <hi>Gown</hi> no stranger among them, and by degrees the materials of Vice and Voluptuous life, proud <hi>Portico's, Bathes,</hi> and the elegance of <hi>Banquetting</hi> was by the ignorant called <hi>Civility,</hi> when indeed it was but a badge of their Slavery and Bondage.</p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:58825:128"/>
                     <p>In the third years Expedition he discovered new Nations, wasting the Country <note place="margin">Anna Dom. 81.</note> as far as the <hi>Frith</hi> to <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Tweed,</hi> as some think.</note> 
                        <hi>Taus,</hi> and by the terrour of his Marches heawed the Enemy, that they durst never interrupt his building of Forts, and laying yoaks upon their Necks, even then when they might have taken the advantage (as once it fell out) of his Forces, scattered and detained by Tempest.</p>
                     <p>In the building of these Garrisons, the skilful took notice, that never any Captain with greater Judgment and fore-sight, chose out his places to fortifie. No Sconce or Fortress of his raising was ever taken by force, or surrender, or quitted by flight, but of these he made continual eruptions into the Country, laying in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for a whole year, that if at any time his Men were besieged, they might pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wait the convenience of Relief. By this means his Souldiers lived fearless in Winter, every Garrison being a guard to its Neighbour, and the hopes of the Enemy were frustrated, who alwaies reckoning in the Winter season, to make up the loss received in Summer, found, that both times were equally disadvantagious to them.</p>
                     <p>In all these Actions <hi>Agricola</hi> never ascribed ambitiously to himself what was well done by others. If an Officer or Souldier deserved Commendation, he would be sure to be the first that gave it, and that without any reservations to himself. If towards some he was Passionate, to others he was as Affable, and kind to the good, but to lewd and bad Persons sowr and uneasie. His Choler was vented in his words, and none ever needed ever to fear his secret Thoughts, or close Reservments, for he chose rather to offend any man than hate him.</p>
                     <p>And now died <hi>TITUS,</hi> who for these great Atchievments of <hi>Agricola</hi> was fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times saluted <hi>Imperator.</hi> The Honour he got by the Actions of so great a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he rewarded with triumphal Ornaments, a good Prince, who died to the great grief of the whole World, not without suspicion of Poyson from his Brother and Successor <hi>Domitian;</hi> And this is sufficiently to be said in his Character, that for his goodness he was generally called the <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>delight of Mankind.</hi>

                     <p>In the fifth year of his Expedition, as soon as ever the Seas were open, he took Shipping, and passed to Nations till then unknown, supposed to be the North parts <note place="margin">Ann. Dom. 83.</note> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the <hi>Orcades,</hi> and other Islands adjacent.</p>
                     <p>These in many prosperous Battles he subdued, and in those Parts which lay next unto them, he placed Garrisons and Souldiers, not out of fear to hold, but hopes of gaining further. <hi>Ireland</hi> he understood lay between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and very opportunely for the <hi>Gallick,</hi> and although not so great as <hi>Britain,</hi> yet under the same Climate, the Nature and Customes of the People not much different, but the Ports and Harbours better known, as lying opener to the World, and more frequented by Traders.</p>
                     <p>This Island, if he could bring to Obedience, he thought would be of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Common-wealth, and by joyning Commerce, would unite and link together the strongest Members of the Empire; But as it stood separate from the rest it was of dangerous consequence, and might be prejudicial to the <hi>Britains</hi> if once the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms were removed, and the name of <hi>Liberty</hi> lost among them. He used often to say, <hi>That with one Legion, and some Auxiliary Forces, it might be obtained,</hi> and that he had such a purpose is manifest, for that he entertained a Prince of that Nation from his Country, by Civil Commotions, and under the colour of <hi>Courtesie</hi> and <hi>Kindness</hi> kept him with him for a fit occasion.</p>
                     <p>But the next year he was called away by nearer Concerns, he feared a general Rising of the Nations beyond <hi>Bodotria,</hi> understanding that the <hi>Britains</hi> had Way-laid <note place="margin">An. Dom. 84.</note> all the passages by Land, to amaze and divert them he commanded his Fleet to coast it along the Shoars, and himself with eaven marches kept close to it; This policy of <hi>Agricola's</hi> succeeded well, and the shew of his Navy was as helpful to him as its force, for the <hi>Britains</hi> at once beholding the Fleet and Army were utterly disheartned, and, as afterwards was learnt from Fugitives, complained, that the Sea as well as the Land conspired to their ruine, and, that now the Ocean it self, their last refuge was taken from them.</p>
                     <p>But on the other hand, the <hi>Romans</hi> were mutually encouraged at the sight of each other, and the Marriners and Souldiers often meeting in the same Camp, with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary vaunts extolled their own Atchievments, the Land-men bragging of the Woods and Mountains they had passed, and the Enemies they had overcome, the Sea-men on the other side not a little magnifying their dangers in Storms and Tempest, and the glory in having subdued the Ocean.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Calidonians</hi> were now generally in Arms, and the noise of it was as great as the preparations. It was spread abroad, that of their own accords, without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they had begun the War and attacked many Castles, which opinion of being
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58825:129"/>
The Challengers struck great Terrour into the <hi>Romans.</hi> There were them who under the name of <hi>Cautious Counsel</hi> endeavoured to conceal their Fears, and advised, that it was safest to withdraw beyond <hi>Bodotria,</hi> and more honourable to retreat from the Country than be driven out of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agricola</hi> took other Resolutions, understanding that the Enemy was advancing in three Bodies, and lest he might be over-powr'd in Numbers, and over-match'd in the knowledge of Places, he likewise marched in three Divisions; The Enemy learning his changed Counsels, joyning Forces in the night time, set upon the ninth Legion in their Camp, and killing their Sentinels, brake in upon the rest, who were surprized between sleep and fear. And now some Execution was begun, when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola</hi> having by Scouts learnt out the March of the Enemy, he followed them at their heels, and commanded the swiftest of his Horse, and his lightest Foot to play on their backs, and the whole Army anon to second them with a shout.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> hearing the Enemy in the Rear were disheartned, especially when the day appearing discovered their glittering Ensigns, and the <hi>Romans</hi> took courage and began to fight, now, not as men doubtful of Victory, but ambitious of Honour. Now might be seen the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, of their own accord breaking into the Camp, and others fighting to get out, both Parties contending which should have the most Glory, the one in bringing assistance, the other in not seeming to have wanted it.</p>
                     <p>In this Fight the <hi>Britains</hi> were vanquished, and had they not betook themselves to their old Refuge, the <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Boggs,</hi> that day had made a total end of the War.</p>
                     <p>After this success the Souldiers were full of life and spirit, nothing now seemed hard unto them, they generally cried all out to be led into <hi>Caledonia,</hi> and to the utmost bounds of <hi>British</hi> Earth; Nay, they who before were for wary and saving Counsel, now lookt as big, and talked as boasting as any. Such is the hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of War, all challenging a part in what succeeds, but the miscarriages were laid upon one.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> acknowledged themselves beaten not by the Courage of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but the cunning and Conduct of the General, and therefore they had no less thoughts of themselves than before, but made new Levies in order to prosecute the War, and before hand carried their Wives and Children into places of security, and sent about through the Cities to enter into a Union, which was afterwards rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied with solemn Rights and Sacrifices.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time a Cohort of <hi>Usipians,</hi> raised in <hi>Germany,</hi> and sent into <hi>Britain,</hi> having slain a Centurion, and other Souldiers, that were appointed to exercise them in their Arms, took to Sea in three <hi>Pinnaces,</hi> and having killed some of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners whom they suspected, the rest they constrained to do their Office.</p>
                     <p>Thus having escaped, and none knowing what was become of them, having no Pilate, they were carried at random, as the Tide and Wind drave them, to and fro the Island, using Piracy where they landed. But at length, as they were reduced to extremity, they drew Lots to eat one another, and through wonderful difficulties, having been driven round the North of the Island, they were taken first by the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Freisians,</hi> and then sold into <hi>Britain,</hi> where they were discovered.</p>
                     <p>These were the first which discovered to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>BRITAIN</hi> was an Island.</p>
                     <p>The beginning of the next Summer, <hi>Agricola</hi> having sent out his Fleet to scour <note place="margin">Anne Dom. 85.</note> along the Coast, and strike Terrour into the Enemy, himself with a flying Army, consisting chiefly of <hi>Britains,</hi> whose Courage and Faith he had long experienced, came as far as the Mountain <hi>Grampius,</hi> upon which the Enemy was embattled; For the <hi>Britains</hi> not daunted with the ill success of the last Fight, and looking for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Revenge or Slavery, were got thirty thousand together, and more daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to come up. The Aged themselves would not be exempted from this daies service, but as they had been Famous in their time, so every one carried before him some Badge or Trophy of his youthful Archievments. Amongst the rest, <hi>Galgacus,</hi> chief in Authority and Birth, when the Army cried out for the signal of Battle to be vgien, is said to have spoken to this purpose.</p>

                                 <p>
                                    <hi>AS</hi> often as I consider the cause of the War, and our present necessity, I am strongly perswaded that this day, and this chearful Consent of yours, will give beginning and life to the Liberty of all <hi>Britain.</hi> We have every one been made sensible of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, no part of the Earth hath protected us from Injury, nay the Sea it self is not secure whilest the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet there so dreadfully appears to us. <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Battle,</hi> which to the Valiant are Honourable, prove now the safest refuge of Cowards.</p>
                                 <p>Hitherto, in all the Battles fought against the <hi>Romans,</hi> with various success, we have alwaies been esteemed hitherto as a forlorne Hope, and upon occasions a powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, because we the noblest of the Island, and seated in the most bidden retirements of it, have never so much as seen the Shoars of a truckling Nation, or polluted our Eyes with any contagion of Slavery. Placed in the extreams of the Earth, and Liberty, we have lived in the inmost Chambers of Honour, beyond which there is no more Earth, and besides which there is no Freedom.</p>
                                 <p>Now the end of <hi>Britain</hi> is discovered, and things known carry less shew and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, there are no Nations behind to amuse the Enemy, <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Waves</hi> are on that side, and on this, <hi>Romans,</hi> whose Pride in vain Ye may seek to satisfie with Service and Submisdemeancur, Robbers of the World, that having now left no Land to plunder, ransack the Sea it self.</p>
                                 <p>If the Enemy be rich, they are greedy of his Wealth, if poor, they covet Glory, whom not the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West</hi> could ever satisfie; The only Men in the World, that with equal appetite seek out the Rich, and the Needy. To rob, kill, and plunder, they call <hi>Empire, </hi>and when they have brought desolation to a Country, they call it <hi>Peace.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Nature,</hi> by nearest ties, has linkt our Children and Relations to us, yet these are taken away, and pressed into other Service. Our Wives and Sisters, if they escape violent Force, yet suffer dishonour when they come as Guests, or Friends. Our Goods and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes they exhaust in Tributes, our Corn must supply their Granaries, and they wear out our Bodies in cleansing of <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Boggs, </hi>amidst a thousand Stripes and Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Slaves, </hi>which are born to Bondage, are sold once for all, and afterwards kept at their Masters charges, but <hi>Britain</hi> daily buyes its Bondage, and daily maintaineth it. And as in a private Family the last Comer is the sport and scorn of his fellow Servants: so we who shall newly come to slavery, shall be laughed at by the old Drudges of the World. It is not to be doubted but our destruction is sought for, we have no Fields to Till, no Mines to dig in, nor no Havens to be cleansed, to what purpose therefore should they reserve us a Line.</p>
                                 <p>The Courage and fierceness of the Subject pleaseth not the jealous Soveraign, and our Distance and Secrecy the more safety it yieldeth to us, the more to them it is suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, so that laying aside all hopes of Pardon, at last take courage, as well they who have any respect to their safety, as such whose Honour is nearest to them.

                                       <hi>Trinobantes</hi> rather,</note> Brigantes, under the Conduct of a Woman, fired a whole Colony, and forced the Castles, and had not the happiness of the success led them into a Sloth and Security, they might totally have shaken off the yoak from their gauled Necks.</p>
                                 <p>We, as yet, in our full strength, and never tamed by any, born, and not redeemed into Liberty, must urge for an Encounter, if ever we will shew what manner of Men <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> hath reserved in store. Do you think the <hi>Romans </hi>are as valiant in War, as they are wanton in Peace? They are grown great by our Divisions, and vainly ascribe to the glory of their own Arms, what proceeds from their Enemies Dissensions. Composed they are of different Nations, which Union, as Success only holds together, so Adversity will quickly dissolve, unless ye suppose the <hi>Gauls </hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> (and which is a shame to be spoken) the <hi>Britains, </hi>who at the present serve to uphold Forraign Usurpation, can possibly have any faith or affection for them, who have been longer their Enemies than Masters. No, it is <hi>Terrour</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> those weak procurers of Affection, that keep them as yet in
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:58825:130"/>
Obedience, which if once removed, you will find that whom they feared they will hate. All the Incitements to Victory are on our side, the <hi>Romans</hi> have no Wives to encourage them to fight, no Parent to upbraid them, if they flie. Most have either no Country at all, or some other a few fearful Persons, trembling and gazing at the strangness of the Haven it self, the Sea, and Woods.</p>
                                 <p>The Gods have delivered them, as it were, mewed up and fettered into our hands, let not the vain shew and glittering of Gold and Silver dazle you, a thing which neither defends in it self, or annoyeth.</p>
                                 <p>In their very Battle, we shall find of our side, the <hi>Britains</hi> will own their Friends, the <hi>Gauls</hi> will remember their former Liberty, and the <hi>Germans</hi> will generally forsake them, as not long since did the <hi>Usipians.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>We have nothing afterwards to fear, the Castles are empty, the Colonies are made up of nothing but Aged and Impotent persons. Between unjust Governours and stubborn Subjects, the free Cities are generally discontented and factious.</p>
                                 <p>Here is a General, here an Army, these be the Tributes, there be the Mines, with the train of Slaveries, that unseparably attend upon bondage, all which must for ever be undergone, or in this one Battle revenged. Wherefore going to Battle, bear in your minds the freedom of your Ancestors, and the danger of your Posterity.</p>

                                    <hi>AGRICOLA,</hi> his SPEECH to his Army before Battle.</head>
                                 <p>THIS is the Eighth year, <hi>Fellow Souldiers,</hi> wherein your faithful Service and diligence, under the vertue and Fortune of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <hi>Britain</hi> in so many Expeditions, so many Battles, either by Courage against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or Patience and Labours. We have ran through the greatest Difficulties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered even Nature it self, neither had you reason to be weary of your General, or I of my Souldiers, insomuch as we have exceeded the Limits, I, of my Predecessors, and You, of former Armies.</p>
                                 <p>The utmost bounds of <hi>BRITAIN</hi> we now hold, not by Fame and Report, but with our Arms and Pavilions, and we have the honour both to Discover and to Subdue.</p>
                                 <p>In your wearisome Marches, when the passing of <hi>Boggs, Rivers,</hi> and <hi>Mountains,</hi> has tyred you, how often have I heard the valiant Souldier say, <hi>When shall we meet the Enemy? When shall we fight? </hi>Behold they shew themselves from their secret lurking places; now you have your desires, now is there room for your Valour to be shewn, every thing is as you could wish, if you Conquer, but if you lose the day, all is against you. For, as to have gone so much ground, escaped the <hi>Woods,</hi> passed the <hi>Friths,</hi> were things, in Our coming, great and honourable: so, if we fly before the Enemy, the very same will be our hindrance and destruction. For neither have we the same knowledge of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as they, or if we had, yet want we Provisions, but Hands we have and Weapons, and in them all things.</p>
                                 <p>For my part, I have been long since resolved, that to Retreat is neither safe for Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier nor General, and that a commendable death is to be preferred before the reproaches of an Ignominious life, and that Safety and Honour are now inseparably conjoyned, and let the worst happen, yet how glorious will it be to die in the uttermost end of the World, and Nature.</p>
                                 <p>If new Nations and unknown Enemies were before us, I should exhort you by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of other Armies, but now I shall only lay before you your own victorious Exploits. Ask your own Eyes, are not these the very same who last year stole upon the Camp by night,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:58825:130"/>
whom with shouts only you overcame. These of all the <hi>Britains</hi> have been the nimblest in running away, and therefore are the last remaining. Just as in Woods and Forrests the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Beasts must be chased away by main force, whilest the timerous and fearful are driven on by the noise only of the Hunter: so the hardy part of the <hi>British</hi> Nation is already dispatcht, the rest is but a herd of Rascally Cattle, whom that at last you have found pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not from their Resisting, but being discovered, no further can they run, but stand now like Stocks, fixed to the ground they treadon, and afford to you an occasion of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and memorable Victory.</p>
                                 <p>Make an end now of your Warfare, and to fifty years Labours add a great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Day, by this means you will approve to your Country, that it could never be justly laid to your charge that you protracted the War, in not pulling up the last Root of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>

                     <p>Whilest <hi>Agricola</hi> was yet speaking, the eagerness of the Souldiers evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, but the end of his Oration was received with loud and joyful Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, every one stood to his Arms, and shewed his alacrity by impatience to follow on.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agricola</hi> ordered the Battle after this manner; His Body was made up of eight thousand Auxiliary foot, three thousand Horse were placed in the Wings, the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">The Order of the Battles on both sides.</note> were set in the Reer, before the Camp; To the greater glory of the Victory, if it could be won without loss of <hi>Roman</hi> Blood, otherwise for assistance and succour, if the Auxiliaries should be repelled.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>British</hi> Army, for shew and terrour, was drawn up upon a Rising ground, the first <hi>Battalion</hi> stood on the Plain, the next higher behind, as the Hill ascended, the middle of the Plain was filled with the clattering noises of Charriots and Horse-men, ranging up and down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agricola</hi> perceiving the Enemy exceeded him in number, and fearing that at once they might attack him in the Front and Flanks, displayed his Army in length, and although by that means his Fore-battle was something of the thinnest, and many counselled to take in the Legions, yet he stood firm to his Resolution, and allight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Horse, placed himself before the Standards.</p>
                     <p>The Fight began at distance, with missive Weapons, wherein the <hi>Britains</hi> shewed wondrous skill and dexterity, with short Swords or broad Targets they either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the Darts, or shoke them off, and in return liberally bestowed whole show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agricola</hi> perceiving the disadvantage exhorted three <hi>Batavian</hi> Cohorts, and two of the <hi>Tungrians,</hi> that they would bring the Battle to dint of Sword, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroaks, which they easily performed, being fitted thereto by long exercise.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> on the other side having little Targets, and huge unweildy Swords without points, were not so well prepared for the thrust and close, and could not endure this sort of grapling, so that when the <hi>Batavians</hi> came to exchange blows with them, and to make at their Faces with their pointed Targets, and pointed Tucks, they easily bore them down, and in prosecuting their Victory advanced to the side of the Hill. The rest of the Cohorts mixing emulation with force, and striking at all that were near them, run on in the same course of Victory, leaving for haste many behind them half-dead, and some untoucht; In the mean while the Horse-men fled, and the Charriots brake into the Foot, but they who had lately terrified others, were now distressed themselves, being toiled with the thick Ranks of the Enemy, or bogled in the uneavenness of the ground.</p>
                     <p>Neither was the form of this Fight like a loose skirmishing of Horse-men, but each maintaining his ground, endeavoured by the weight of their Beasts to bear down the Enemy. Now might be seen Charriots without Guiders, and the affrighted Horses running too and fro, and over-bearing all that met them, or thwarted their way.</p>
                     <p>When those <hi>Britains</hi> who had not yet engaged, but kept the tops of the Hills, as despising the fewness of the Enemy, began to draw down by degrees, and by taking a compass, to fall upon the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Reer, <hi>Agricola</hi> having suspected their intention, with four Squadron of Horse, which he had reserved for such a purpose, opposed their descent, and drave them back with as great violence as they had come on, pursuing them to their main Body.</p>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:58825:131"/>
                     <p>And now the Counsel of the <hi>Britains</hi> was turned upon their own heads, for <hi>Agricola</hi> commanded some Troops to be taken from the Front of the Battle, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to second the Horse, and fall upon the back of the Enemy; Then might have been seen, in the open fields, a great and dismal spectacle, pursuing, wounding, taking, killing those that were taken, when others were offered. Now whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of the <hi>Britains,</hi> according to their several dispositions, some though Armed, and in more number, yet turned their backs to the sewer, others unarmed ran des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately upon the Weapons of the Enemy. Every where lay scattered Arms, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and mangled Limbs, the ground was covered with Blood, and many wallowed in their own Gore, yet, left not off to give some proofs of their last Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
                     <p>And now a Party of the <hi>Britains</hi> had secretly possest themselves of some passages in the Woods, through which, as the <hi>Romans</hi> advanced, and with more heat than dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion pursued the Chase, set upon them, and unawares dispatched many, which had not <hi>Agricola</hi> perceived, and timely prevented, the <hi>Romans</hi> through their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence in the midst of Victory, had received a notable Overthrow; For he sent some of his best and readiest Cohorts to scour the Woods, and guard the Passages, and some Troops of Horse were ordered to ride up and down, and observe the Coasts, and others, where the entrances of the Forrests were thicker, to allight from their Horses, and stand to their Posts, which the <hi>Britains</hi> observing, and finding now that the <hi>Romans</hi> followed the Pursuit close and regularly, they all fled not as before, in whole Troops and Companies, but scattered and dispersed, every one, for his own security, taking into By-paths, and, out of fear, avoiding Friends as well as Enemies, until Night and fulness of Blood put an end to their Chase.</p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>Britains</hi> ten thousand were slain, of the <hi>Romans</hi> three hundred and forty, amongst which <hi>Aulus Atticus,</hi> Commander in chief of a Cohort, through Youthful heat, and the fierceness of his Horse, was carried on into the midst of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>The night was spent with joy by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who were full of Victory and Spoil, but the poor <hi>Britains</hi> wandring up and down, and Men and Women howling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lugg'd on the wounded, and cried help to those that were not hurt. Some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their Houses, others of their own accord, out of despite, fire their own Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses themselves, choosing out Holes to lurk in, which they as soon left, to find out others.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they communicated Counsels together, and then they had some glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of hope, other whiles nothing but despair seizes them, and then they raged at the sight of their dearest Pledges; And it is certain, that many with a cruel Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion laid violent hands on their Wives and Children, to secure them from the greater violence of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The day appearing gave an opener Testimony and prospect of the Victory; every where desolation and silence, the Hills forsaken, the Cottages smoaking afar off, the Scouts sent abroad brought word that nothing appeared, no foot-steps of a general Flight could be discovered, nor any <hi>Britains</hi> drawn in Companies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon <hi>Agricola,</hi> because the Summer was spent, and no fit Season to divide his Forces, brings them entire into the Borders of the <hi>Horesti,</hi> supposed the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Eske-Dale</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where receiving Hostages, he commanded the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of his Fleet to sail round <hi>Britain,</hi> sending him Forces for that purpose, but the Terrour of the Navy was gone before himself with slow and easie Marches, to the end he might awe the new Conquered Nations with the delaies of his passage, and so by degrees placed his Men in their Winter quarters.</p>
                     <p>The Navy with prosperous Winds, and good success, safely arrived at the Port <hi>Trutulensis,</hi> supposed <hi>Richborough,</hi> near <hi>Sandwich,</hi> from whence it departed, and coast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the nearest side of <hi>Britain</hi> returned thither again. And now most probably, if not in the fifth year of <hi>Agricola,</hi> as hath been mentioned, the <hi>Romans,</hi> might subdue the Isles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> which others, with less reason following <hi>Orosius,</hi> ascribe unto <hi>Claudius.</hi> And this discovery of <hi>Britain</hi> (by the <hi>Romans)</hi> to be an Island, was in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Anno post</hi> Christum 86.</note> the eighty sixth year after Christ, and the fourth of <hi>Domitians</hi> Reign.</p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:58825:131"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agricola,</hi> without any amplifying Terms, signified the state of Affairs in <hi>Britain,</hi> by Letters, to <hi>Domitian,</hi> who (after his usual Custome) received them with a joyful Countenance, yet within was he sad at heart. And certainly the Courage of this Prince cannot be better described, than in his carriage to this worthy General; For being inwardly pricked to think, that by his own counterfeit Triumph over the <hi>Germans</hi> (to fill out which, for want of true Captives, he was forced to buy such as by their Hair and Attire might Personate them) he would now become the scorn and derision of the World, when they should hear of the great and true Victories of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola,</hi> so many thousand slain, and the Fame of such Atchievments spread quite abroad; and fearing withal, that the name of a Private man might be advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of the Prince: he secretly designed his ruine, thinking in vain that he had suppressed the study of <hi>Oratory,</hi> and other worthy politick Arts, thereby to keep down other mens Reputations, if he should suffer himself to be surpassed in Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary glory, which he esteemed the peculiar Honour of an Emperour, and the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies thereof not so easily to be dissembled.</p>
                     <p>Daily tormented with the said Cares, and musing much in his Closet alone, which was a sign of some Cruelty intended, he thought it best for the present to hide his Resentments until the heat of <hi>Agricola's</hi> Glory, and the love of the Army towards him, was somewhat abated. He continued him therefore in his Command, and with all shew of Acknowledgment for so great Services, commands that in Senate Triumphal Ornaments be decreed to him with the honour of a Statue, and what else was necessary of making up of a just Triumph, adding himself words highly advantagious in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him.</p>
                     <p>But he wanted not long an opportunity of removing him, a thing he so much desired, for the Province of <hi>Syria</hi> being void by the death of <hi>Atilius Rufus,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sular Lieutenant, and reserved for men of great Quality, he caused to be given out, was designed for <hi>Agricola,</hi> and so naming a Successour for <hi>Britain,</hi> called him home, but fearing (it seems) not to be obeyed, unless with the new Governour the Commission for <hi>Syria</hi> was also dispatcht, he employs one of his secret and trusty Servants to carry it, but with this Command, not to deliver it unto <hi>Agricola</hi> if he had already resigned his Province, which (as was thought) was accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the Servant meeting him at Sea, never so much as saluted him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Emperour with the Patent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agricola</hi> arriving at <hi>Rome,</hi> received secret Instructions to make his Entry in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, which he did accordingly, and by night came into the City, and by night into the Palace, where he was received by <hi>Domitian</hi> with a short Complement, and then placed amongst the rest of the Waiters.</p>
                     <p>But such was the Behaviour of this great General, that although <hi>Domitian</hi> sought all occasion to destroy him, yet found he none, his Carriage was so affable and free from pride, his Garb so modest, and his Retinue so small, that his greatest Enemies saw no side lie open to assault him. And, although he was often accused by some, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Country retirement, yet so frivolous were the Crimes charged upon him, that <hi>Domitian</hi> was constrained (though otherwise inclined) to acquit him; Nay, he avoided for a while those worst sort of Adversaries, namely, such as daily praised his Vertues, and extolled his Glory, a piece of Malice most of all dangerous, if instill'd into the ears of a Vicious and Self-condemning Prince.</p>
                     <p>He resigned his Command, as Mr. <hi>Hollinshead</hi> writes, to <hi>Cn. Trebellius,</hi> but I find no reason for his Opinion. We read of <hi>Salustius Lucullus,</hi> Legate of <hi>Britain</hi> in the <note place="margin">Hol. <hi>Hist. of</hi> Brit.</note> daies of this Emperour, but no more can be found of any others, and of him only, than that he was slain by <hi>Domitian</hi> for giving his own Name to a sort of Spears which he invented. So small an affectation of Honour could not be forgiven to <hi>Salustius Lucullus,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Suet. <hi>vit.</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian.,</note> under a jealous Sovereign, which <hi>Lucius Lucullus</hi> enjoyed in safer times, who called a sort of black Marble, in which he delighted, by the name of <hi>Lucullean</hi> Marble, and yet went quietly to his Grave.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agricola</hi> delivered his Province to his Successour safe and quiet, but it seems it continued not in a peaceable condition long after his Removal, for, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by a Preface in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> to a Book of his Histories, it was either through the Envy of <hi>Domitian,</hi> or the Ill Conduct of his Captains, lost again from the <hi>Romans,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Tacitus:</note> and <hi>Juvenal</hi> the Poet writes of <hi>Arviragus</hi> (in these daies, and not before) King of <note place="margin">Juvenal.</note>

                        <hi>Britain,</hi> who so well behaved himself against them, that he was not only grown Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous at <hi>Rome,</hi> but accounted matter of great Triumph, if he could be taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or overcome.</p>
                     <p>And now, besides the loss of <hi>Britain,</hi> upon the neck of one another followed the Revolts of <hi>Maesia, Dacia, Germany</hi> and <hi>Pannonia,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> on all sides, were through the neglect or rashness of their Generals, grievously distrest, insomuch that <hi>Agricola,</hi> by the common voice of the Multitude, was demanded for Leader, and, by the wisest, looked upon as the fittest person to put a stop to these growing Calamities, but what was intended for his honour proved his destruction, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he refused the Employment, as knowing not safe to take it, and albeit at present <hi>Domitian</hi> seemed graciously to admit his Exercise, yet was he not long after poysoned by him, as a Person of too dangerous a Vertue, and too much beloved, to be suffered to live.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Agricola,</hi> poysoned by <hi>Domitian,</hi> in reward of his good Service and Vertues.</note> Thus died this famous <hi>Agricola,</hi> who carried the <hi>Roman</hi> Standards to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most bounds of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Isles of <hi>Orkney,</hi> subduing more Nations than all his Predecessours before had done, and <hi>Ireland</hi> he had certainly attempted, had not the Jealousies of <hi>Domitian</hi> too soon recalled him.</p>
                     <p>But what he performed in War, was not comparable to his actions in Peace, his reforming the Abuses and Exactions of his Officers, by which he reduced the <hi>Britains</hi> not only to the use of Civil life, but the love of it. He trained the Nobility up in Liberal Arts and Sciences, by sending them into <hi>Gaul,</hi> where they might learn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> insomuch as <hi>Juvenal,</hi> in these times, writes,
<q>Gallia <hi>causidicos docuit facunda</hi> Britannos. <note place="margin">Juvenal.</note>
                        </q>
Moreover he furnished them with goodly Houses, and stately Buildings, proud Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico's, and sumptuous Baths; he taught them the neat use of Diet and Apparel, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that they were not Inferiour to any other Province; He changed their cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome Charriots into the Coaches and delicate Litters of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Travel, he was the beginner of those Roads, and Causies, which were afterwards more universally paved by the <hi>Romans</hi> through the Island.</p>
                     <p>Thus about the Year of Grace 86, all on the south part of <hi>Glota,</hi> and <hi>Bodotria,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ann.

                     <p>And in this the Priviledge of <hi>Britain</hi> was somewhat advanced above that of other Nations, besides, that they had Kings of their own, even in the <hi>Roman</hi> Pale, which carried in it a shew of Liberty, though but for a time, and was indeed, nothing but the usual method of that Common-wealth, to make Princes Instruments of their deeper Slavery; so that what Kings of <hi>Britain,</hi> for the future we shall find under the Emperours, they were either Tributaries to the <hi>Romans,</hi> if they lived in the Southern parts, such as <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Coelius,</hi> or else they resided beyond <hi>Glota</hi> and <hi>Bodotria,</hi> those Northern Regions, the absolute Conquest whereof <hi>Agricola</hi> had not time to accomplish.</p>
                     <p>In the daies of this <hi>Domitian</hi> lived at <hi>Rome Claudia Rufina,</hi> the Daughter of a <hi>Britain,</hi> and Wife of <hi>Pudence</hi> a Senatour, famous in the Verses of <hi>Martial</hi> for her Beauty, Wit, and Learning.</p>

                     <p>But more famous was she for her profession in Christianity, in the writings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> being the very same Woman (as <hi>John Bale</hi> and <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant <note place="margin">Joh.

                     <p>And now we come to the death of <hi>Domitian,</hi> there being nothing more upon Record memorable in his Reign that relates to our <hi>British</hi> Affairs. He was slain in a Conspiracy, wherein his Wife was partaker, the chief in the Action was <hi>Stephen</hi> a Procurator, and Steward to <hi>Domicilla</hi> the Empress, who feigning himself Lame of one Arm, and carrying it in a Scarf, secretly withal bore a Dagger therein, and approaching to the Emperour, under pretence of delivering him a Scrowl of the Names of divers Conspirators, struck him with a Poniard into the Belly. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> although sorely wounded, yet was not wanting to himself upon so sudden an occasion, for strugling with this Assassinate, he had certainly wrested the Dagger from him, had not the rest of the Confederates broke in, and with seven Wounds put an end to his life.</p>
                     <p>It was upon the eighteenth day of <hi>September</hi> (the name of which Month he had changed into that of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> a Title vainly assumed to himself) in the fifteenth year of his Reign, and of his life 45, in the year of Grace 98. <note place="margin">An.

                     </p>
                     <p>The chief Vertues of this Prince (for his Vices were innumerable) were, that he favoured Learning, and was the Patron of greatest Bounty, and easiest Access of any in his time. He was desirous of a lasting Name, but took the wrong way in attaining it; for being pleased with the Flatteries of some Writers, who would make him an excellent Prince, he neglected to be so, and alwaies sought after the shadow of Vertue rather than the substance of it.</p>
                     <p>But these Parasites who were kept warm by his Bounty, whilest living, basely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted him at his death, and followed his Memory with all the Scorns and Reproaches of the succeeding Age. None thought of his Apotheosis, or Deification, after his Departure, insomuch that it may be counted a Prophetick Spirit in him as well as Pride, <hi>That in his life time he commanded himself to be called God and Lord.</hi>

                     <p>At the solemn Sessions and Assizes, the <hi>Praetor</hi> sitting alost upon an high Tribunal, proudly executed his Jurisdiction, shewing Terrible amidst his Guards and Lictors, where <hi>Rods</hi> and <hi>Axes,</hi> upon slight occasions, were often presented to the backs and necks of the Common People; Through the often changing of Governours, there ensued great Confusion, one destroying what another had established, and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour often, of course, abolishing the Acts and Constitutions of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour.</p>
                     <p>Neither was this sufficient, they kept on foot continually Discords and Dissensions, favouring some above the rest, that they might make them Instruments of their own Slavery. As many of these Abuses had been sormerly rectified, under the last Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>Agricola,</hi> so again were they redressed by this Worthy Emperour, whose care, in other matters, is left upon Record, namely, his carrying of Roads and broad-Causies through the whole Island, begun by <hi>Agricola,</hi> a work of prodigious greatness, and infinite Charge, what with the drayning of <hi>Fens</hi> and <hi>Marishes,</hi> through which they were continued, and what with casting up of Banks through the low Vallies, besides, they were paved with Stone, and of that breadth that Wagons might go a breast in them, supposed forty foot. They are described particularly by <hi>Galen.</hi>

                        <hi>cast up such pieces of them as were moist and miery, by stocking up and clearing such as were rough and overgrown with</hi> Bushes <hi>and</hi> Bryars, <hi>by making Bridges over</hi> Rivers, <hi>and fordable where the way seemed longer than needed, by cutting out a shorter course; If any where, through some steep Hill, the passage was hard and uneasie, by turning it aside through more level Places, if it ran through Forrests, Wastes, and Deserts, by drawing it from thence, through places inhabited, and generally by smoothing all uneaven and rugged Grounds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The tract of these Ways remain even to this day, and though they cannot be traced in a continued Line, by reason in many places the Country people digging <hi>Gravel</hi> out of them, they are broken off, yet through Pastures and By-grounds they may be discovered, where the Banks are so high, that evidently they shew what formerly they have been.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Four great Roads leading through the Island, I have spoken in the Reign of <hi>Molmutius,</hi> who, in the <hi>British</hi> History, is made the builder of them, namely, <hi>Watling-street,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Werlam-street,</hi> for that it went through <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulamium,</hi> and is elsewhere named by the People dwelling on it, <hi>high dike, high-ridge, Forty foot Way,</hi> and <hi>Ridge-way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>second, Ikemild-street,</hi> because, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> saith, it went through the Country of the <hi>Iceni.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>third, The Foss,</hi> for that as men think it was fenced on both sides with a Ditch.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>fourth, Ermin-street,</hi> from the <hi>German</hi> name of <hi>Mercury,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> thinks, or rather from the <hi>Greek</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>These Roads, as likewise other Magnificent structures in <hi>Britain,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> (as his custome is) attributes wholly to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and is of opinion, that there were more than four in this Island.</p>
                     <p>As concerning their Number, I believe it may be uncertainly guessed, although in the Laws of St. <hi>Edward</hi> there is mention made, <hi>De pace quatuor Cheminorum,</hi> viz. <hi>Viarum,</hi> concerning <hi>the Peace of the four Road-waies.</hi> But I see not why they should be absolutely ascribed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> my Reasons are these, gathered out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words of <hi>Galen.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Because <hi>Trajan</hi> is said to repair the <hi>Waies,</hi> not build them, which cannot be meant of those <hi>Waies Agricola</hi> begun in the daies of <hi>Domitian,</hi> which were the first we hear of of the <hi>Romans</hi> building, which is so little time since, that it would be hard to imagine they should be so soon decayed, especially where <hi>Galen</hi> saith, <hi>They were overgrown with Thorns and Thistles.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. The Conveniencies of the <hi>Roads</hi> could not be so suddenly altered from <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola's</hi> time, as that <hi>Trajan</hi> should need, as he did, to turn them from Forrests and Waste places, and bring them through Towns and Cities, as likewise to cut them shorter in several places. Certainly <hi>Agricola</hi> could not but consider the damage of carrying Publick Waies through <hi>Forrests</hi> and <hi>Deserts,</hi> and therefore these words, thus rectified by <hi>Trajan,</hi> seem to be the ancient Roads of the <hi>Britains,</hi> whose chief
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:58825:134"/>
abode was in Woods and Forrests, and therefore made their waies through those places in which they chiefly resided.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, indeed, there are many parts and pieces of great Waies now discovered in this Island, which for many Reasons cannot well be imagined convenient, for any Nation not in the same circumstances, as the Ancient <hi>Britains</hi> then lived in. And whether <hi>Molmutius,</hi> or some other before or after him, did cause these <hi>Waies</hi> to be built, it mattereth not, but it certainly appeareth that some of them were the works of the <hi>Britains,</hi> long before the entrance of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Common People (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> alleadgeth) do plainly say these works were done by Giants, whom in the North parts they call <hi>Eatons</hi> (as he supposeth) for <hi>Heathens,</hi> which is not improbable, but see immediately how he frames these Giants to the meridian of his own Antiquities, for where he would make these to be meant of the <hi>Romans,</hi> how standeth it with Reason? Is not this to bring down the Fabulous Age below the times of their <hi>Caesars,</hi> when these works were performed? Must <hi>Britain</hi> of all other Nations in the World, be so unfortunate as to be dreaming of Giants and Monsters in those daies, when the Race of them for so many hundreds of years had been utterly extinguisht, and the eyes of the World clearly opened, as to those points?</p>
                     <p>There are to be seen in <hi>Spain</hi> the Causies called <hi>Salamantica</hi> and <hi>Argentea,</hi> the works of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Viae militares</hi> paved by the same Nation, and in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Way <hi>Appia, Pompeia, Valeria,</hi> and others, and yet when those Kingdoms were overthrown by barbarous Nations, <hi>Spain</hi> by the <hi>Saracens, Gallia</hi> by the <hi>Franks, Italy</hi> by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> yet never were those Nations so Barbarous, as to take the old <hi>Romans</hi> for Giants, or to think those Works any other than the useful Atchievments of a great and powerful People; Why then should <hi>Britain</hi> be looked upon as more Ignorant and Barbarous, if there were not something of greater Antiquity in these <hi>Waies,</hi> than in those of other Nations? Certainly, the <hi>Britains,</hi> as much as any People, had experience, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were but Men, as they made it appear in many great Victories against them; And could the memory of a Nation so often baffled by them, haunt their Posterity in after-Ages to that degree, as to raise up the Idea's of such huge Giants and Goblins? in my Judgment it seemeth impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
                     <p>Besides, these <hi>Roads</hi> were not repaired and paved by the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, but by the great labour and toil of the <hi>Britains</hi> themselves, whom the <hi>Romans</hi> forced to work as Slaves, and stood over them with Whips and Rods, as severe Task-Masters, <note place="margin">Tacitusi</note> for which usage, in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> they complain, <hi>That the</hi> Romans <hi>wore out and consumed their Bodies and Hands, in clearing of Woods, and paving of Fens, with a thousand stripes and reproachful Indignities.</hi> How is it likely therefore, had there been no other <hi>Roads</hi> of greater Antiquity than these, that the <hi>Britains</hi> should ever take them for the Works of Giants, in which was preserved the hateful memory of their own <hi>Slavery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the <hi>Romans,</hi> it seemeth rather that they repaired the Ancient <hi>Waies</hi> of the <hi>Britains,</hi> paved them with Stone, and where they lay not convenient for their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, they changed their course, and brought them to serve for their own Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience rather than the <hi>Britains.</hi> And this appeareth out of <hi>Tacitus</hi> (where he saith) <hi>That whilest</hi> Agricola <hi>governed Britain, several Waies were injoyned, and for distant places (by the</hi> Surveyors <hi>Orders) that the Country should carry from the nearest standing Camps, or Wintering places, to those that were far off, and out of the way,</hi> that is, <hi>lying out of the Roads already made.</hi> And what was thus begun by <hi>Agricola</hi> was continued by <hi>Trajan,</hi> who is said to Repair and Pave the Waies, not those of <hi>Agricola's</hi> making, for they were already Paved, and could not (as hath been said) be so soon decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the <hi>British</hi> Roads, which by long continuance of War in many places were worn out, and in others, overgrown with <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Thistles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the daies of <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius</hi> (as is sound in Ancient Records) there were made other certain beaten <hi>High-waies</hi> from Sea to Sea, no wonder therefore if these additions of new <hi>Waies</hi> made by the <hi>Romans,</hi> together with the Repairing of the Old ones, bath given them (às it often happens in such cases) the glory of the whole work, and <hi>Beda,</hi> as a testimony that the <hi>Romans</hi> lived South of <hi>Severus</hi> his <note place="margin">Beda.</note>

Wall, in that part of <hi>Britain</hi> now called <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> brings in, among other things, the <hi>Street-waies</hi> as a testimony thereof.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> called these Causies, or Street-waies, <hi>Vias Consulares, Regias, Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torias, Militares, Publicas, Cursus Publicos, &amp; Actus;</hi> so <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris, Aggeres, &amp; tellures inaggeratas. Beda,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Am. Marcel. Beda.</note> later Writers, <hi>Stratas,</hi> that is, <hi>Streets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Along these waies were placed at first Young men, as <hi>Posts,</hi> within small distances one from another, afterwards swift Waggons to carry Intelligence; Upon these Waies were seated Cities and Hamlets, which had in them Inns furnisht with all necessary provisions for Travels, as also <hi>Mutations,</hi> for so they called in that Age the places where Wayfaring Persons and Strangers, as they Journied, changed their <hi>Post Horses, Draught Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Wagons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Along the sides of these Waies, at every Miles end were erected, by the Emperours, certain Pillars or Columns, with the name of the particular Prince that set them up, engraven upon them, and numerable Characters cut in them, to signifie how many Miles from place to place.</p>
                     <p>These excellent advantages for Travellers, as they are to be solely attributed to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and much in particular to this worthy Emperour <hi>Trajan:</hi> so were they the cause that many Ancient places of the <hi>Britains</hi> came to decay. For the <hi>Romans</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther building altogether upon these Roads, or else bringing the Old Roads to serve most opportunely for their Garrisons, which at first were built in strong Passes, more for convenience of Fortification than Travel; It came to pass that the others grew out of use, and unfrequented, and so the Cities standing upon them necessarily decayed, and therefore those places mentioned in the Itinerary of <hi>Antoninus</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Gambden</hi> observeth) must be sought out about these Road-waies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose Garrisons and standing-Camps, were oftentimes the Seminaries and seed-Plots of great Cities and populous Towns.</p>
                     <p>These are the only Actions of <hi>Trajan,</hi> left upon Record, relating to <hi>Britain.</hi> He departed this life in the year of Grace 118, after he had reigned nineteen years, six months, and fifteen daies, in the year of his Age, 64. So much was he beloved, that his Effigies after his death was born in Triumph, in a glorious and pompous manner, and his Ashes sent to <hi>Rome</hi> (for he died at <hi>Seleucia,</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> the Less) and were inclosed within the Crown of a goodly Pillar, of one hundred and forty foot in height.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>AELIUS HADRIANUS,</hi> succeeded his Uncle <hi>Trajan</hi> in the Empire, he was of the City <hi>Italica,</hi> near unto <hi>Sivill,</hi> his Father <note place="margin">An. Dem. 118.</note> Noble, and his Mother descended of an Honourable Family in <hi>Cales,</hi> equal to his Race were the high endowments of his mind.</p>
                     <p>He dissented from <hi>Trajan</hi> in his policy of bounding the Empire, and held to <hi>Augustus</hi> his Rule in placing the Limits thereof, not so wide, but surer, insomuch that he excluded on the East all <hi>India, Armenia, Media, Persia, Assyria,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> the Acquests of <hi>Trajan,</hi> but excepted from the removal, as to Rule <hi>Britain</hi> only, which province by no means he would part with, although he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what streightned it, as shall be shewn immediately.</p>
                     <p>Under him <hi>Julius Severus</hi> (saith <hi>Dion Cassius</hi>) governed the Island, an excellent Souldier, and upon that account called away to suppress the <hi>Jews,</hi> then in Tumult. After his departure the <hi>Britains</hi> could scarce be held in Allegiance, which caused <hi>Hadrian</hi> to make a Journey hither in Person, in the sixth year of his Empire, being thrice Consul, where he reformed many things, and seemed, by force of Arms, to have reduced the <hi>Britains</hi> to Obedience; for, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> observeth upon a piece of Mony of his Coyning, there is the stamp of an Emperour, with three Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <note place="margin">Cambden</note>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:58825:135"/>
whom he judgeth to represent the three Legions, of which the <hi>Roman</hi> Army then consisted, and under them this Inscription, EXER. BRITANNICUS, and another of the same Prince with this Motto, RESTITUTOR BRITANNI, <hi>The Restorer of the Britains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the greatest Work done by him in this Island, was, the building of a Wall fourscore miles in length, cross the Island, from <hi>Solway-Frith,</hi> upon the <hi>Irish</hi> Seas, to <note place="margin">Spartianus <hi>in vit.</hi> Hadriani,</note> the mouth of <hi>Tine</hi> by <hi>New-caestle,</hi> on the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, laying the toundation thereof with huge Piles, or Stakes, driven in deep, and fastned together in manner of a strong Rampire or Mound. This he did to keep out the <hi>Caledonians</hi> from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing the <hi>Roman</hi> Province, who could never (it seems) be contained within those Fortifications, raised by <hi>Agricola</hi> between <hi>Glota</hi> and <hi>Bodotria,</hi> the <hi>Friths</hi> of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> and <hi>Dun-britton.</hi> Thus he gave more room to the Northern and barbarous <hi>Britains</hi> to inhabit, and quitting those barren and cold Soils, inclosed only the most delicate part of the Island, by which means the Bounds of the Empire, as well in <hi>Britain,</hi> as the East, were reduced to a more convenient compass.</p>

                  <head>THE CONTINUATION OF THE British History, From the Daies of VESPATIAN, To the fourteenth Year of HADRIAN.</head>
                  <p>ABOUT the fourteenth year of <hi>HADRIAN,</hi> according to the best Computations, died <hi>MARIUS,</hi> who, in the <hi>British</hi> History, ruled King of <hi>Britain,</hi> in some part of it, from the daies of <hi>Vespatian,</hi> in the year of our Lord 80, to this present Emperour. <note place="margin">Ann. Dom. 80.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Reign is filled up with his Atchievments against the <hi>Picts,</hi> who are called in the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Tongue, <hi>Phightiaid, a Warlike and fierce Nation,</hi> and to make up their terrible Character, they were <hi>Scythians</hi> by descent, and near Kinsmen at least to the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and (as some think) the Off-spring of the Nation of the <hi>Agathyrses,</hi> a Race of painted <hi>Cannibals,</hi> setting forth from their Native Country, or, as some write, from <hi>Sweden,</hi> or <hi>Norway.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With these most excellent endowments, as Pirates and Rovers, they arrived on the Coast of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they met with their Brethren the <hi>Scots,</hi> who then inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited that Island, who easily understood their Language, as being themselves of <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> extraction.</p>
                  <p>Having scarce landed their Forces, they required Places to inhabit, but the <hi>Scots</hi> who well understood the stomach of their Country-men, and had but just now given over themselves to eat one another, so diverted and shifted themoff, with telling them the pleasures of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the plenty thereof; I wonder they should omit their <hi>Painting</hi> also; The <hi>Picts,</hi> hoysting up Sail, made for this blessed Island, little dreaming of the warm entertainment they were to receive, for the <hi>Scots</hi> had laid the sairest side outwards, and concealed the Courage and Numbers of the <hi>Britains.</hi> When they had arrived upon the North of this Island, finding there but few Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, they began to waste wide, and forrage all those Tracts which Nature it self had sufficiently laid desolate.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Marius</hi> informed of the insolent Behaviour of these Strangers, levies For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and with speedy Marches hastned into the North, and there gave them Battle. The success was so great on the <hi>Britains</hi> side, that the <hi>Picts</hi> were totally discomfited, many slain, among whom was their Leader <hi>Rodorick,</hi> and the rest all taken Prisoners, to whom King <hi>Marius</hi> gave license to inhabit the Northern part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> called <hi>Cattness,</hi> a cold and Mountainous Country.</p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:58825:136"/>
                  <p>They had not long lived there, but they began to think of warm Bed-fellows, and to that purpose sent unto the <hi>Britains</hi> for Wives, but their Suit being there enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with scorn, they applied themselves to the <hi>Scots,</hi> who granted them their Daughters upon this condition, That if the Male Issue of the King should fail, then the next Heir on the Womans side should succeed in the Kingdom, which Ordinance ever after was observed among them, and this was the cause of the great Union of both these Nations.</p>
                  <p>This Victory of King <hi>Marius,</hi> against the <hi>Picts,</hi> was obtained at <hi>Stanes-moor</hi> in <hi>Westmoreland,</hi> and from his name was the Country called <hi>Westmaria;</hi> But that which seemeth to give some credit to this Relation, was, this Inscription found in <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Carlile,</hi> MARII VICTORIAE, of which the Reverend Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> writes thus; <hi>Although the</hi> British <hi>History in many things is found faulty, yet the testimony of the Inscription of</hi> Marius <hi>his Victory is not altogether to be slighted.</hi> For before <hi>Jeoffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Translation, an Author much Graver, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> writeth of it in this manner; <hi>In the City</hi> Luguballia, <hi>commonly called</hi> Carlile, <hi>there is seen a Dining</hi>

                     <hi>Room built of Stone, and arched with Vaults, which neither the force of Weather, nor Fire on purpose set to it, could scatter or destroy. And on the Fore-front of it was this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, MARII VICTORIAE,</hi> that is, <hi>To the Victory of</hi> Marius.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> who draws all Antiquities to the <hi>Romans,</hi> saith, That another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mention of this Stone (who that other is he tells us not) saith, <hi>It was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,</hi> Marii Victoriae, <hi>but</hi> Marti Victori, <hi>and this,</hi> he saith, <hi>may better content some, and seemeth to come nearer to Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however it may please some, vet it is absolutely against the meaning of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who immediately adds; <hi>What this Inscription should mean, I know not, unless part of the</hi> Cimbri <hi>should inhabit these Places, after they were driven out of</hi> Italy <hi>by</hi> Marius <hi>the Consul, of whom</hi> Ranulphus <hi>maketh mention in his Polycro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is <hi>Malmsbury's</hi> guess, as being certain it was <hi>Marii Victoriae,</hi> not <hi>Marti Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctori,</hi> and having never seen the <hi>British</hi> History, he gave it to that Consul rather than no body, little thinking how improbable it was, that a Nation driven from its Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, should raise Trophies to their Conquerour.</p>
                  <p>But if it must be <hi>Marii Victoriae,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> hath a <hi>Roman</hi> of that name to fix it upon, namely, <hi>MARIUS,</hi> who was proclaimed Emperour against <hi>Gallienus,</hi> a Man of wonderful strength, insomuch that it was written of him, <hi>That he had no Veins in his Fingers, but all Sinews,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> (but who they are he again nameth not) and attributes this Inscription to him, and so let it be, for what Victory could ever slip from the hands of so nervous a Person?</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Marius</hi> died in the year of Grace 132, and was Interr'd at <hi>Carlile,</hi> he left the <note place="margin">An. Dom. 132.</note> Kingdom to his Son <hi>Coyll.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>COYLL</hi> in his youth had been educated at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he employed his time in learning the Sciences, and the discipline of War. He loved the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was by them highly esteemed and honoured, so that paying his Tribute, and receiving their Protection, he filled out a long, just and peaceable Reign, governing <hi>Britain</hi> 54 years, to the fifth year of <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperour, when we shall hear of his Son <hi>LUCIUS,</hi> the first Christian Prince of the <hi>British</hi> Line, till whose daies the <hi>British</hi> Histories are silent, there being nothing else memorable in the life of this <hi>Coyll,</hi> save that some ascribe to him the building of <hi>Colchester</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> which work others give to a later <hi>Coyll,</hi> which reigned next after <hi>Asclepeodotuis</hi>

                     <hi>HADRIAN</hi> having called away <hi>Julius Severus,</hi> as likewise <hi>Priscus Licinius,</hi> both Governours in <hi>Britain,</hi> to subdue the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were then in Rebellion; it will not be amiss to fill out the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this Emperours Reign with a short account of his Atchievments against that Nation, seeing they were performed by Men, whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in War was gained in our <hi>British</hi> Island.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> a stubborn People, and sick of the <hi>Roman</hi> yoak, as who daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a glorious <hi>Messiah,</hi> and were impatient of his coming, at last, of themselves, took Arms, in the Eighteenth year of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and began a dangerous Rebellion; But <hi>Hadrian</hi> raising great Forces, and electing his choicest Generals to Command them, soon put a stop to their Fury, who, in the heat of the Revolt, spared neither <hi>Roman</hi> nor <hi>Christian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to revenge their Insolence, besides an infinite number of them slain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, their City, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was razed to the ground, themselves utterly banisht, and made unlawful for them to look towards that City, or their Native Soyl.</p>
                  <p>Besides, where <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had stood, although not upon the same Foundations, he built a new City, calling it after his own name, <hi>AELIA,</hi> upon the Gate whereof that leadeth to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that the <hi>Jews,</hi> even in disguise, might be kept as much as might be from visiting it, he caused a <hi>Swine</hi> to be engraven, a Beast which he had learnt, by their Law, was accounted the most unclean, and of all others most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
                  <p>He was favourable to the <hi>Christians,</hi> forbidding, by Publick Edict, the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against them, moved (as some think) thereto by <hi>Quatratus,</hi> a Disciple of the Apostles, and <hi>Aristides,</hi> a Philosopher of <hi>Athens,</hi> who wrote an Apology for them.</p>
                  <p>He died in the year of our Lord one hundred thirty nine, and of his Age sixty two, in his life time he had designed <hi>Caesar, Lucius AElius,</hi> a man exceedingly dear to him, but he dying, <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> received the Empire.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>ANTONINUS</hi> (for his Princely Vertues) Sirnamed <hi>PIUS,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ann.

                     <p>At his first entrance into the Empire, by an Ordinance of his, as many as were of the <hi>Roman</hi> World were made Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which Edict the Southern <hi>Britains,</hi> within <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians</hi> Wall, as well as other Provinces, enjoyed that high Dignity and Priviledge, but the Northern Inhabitants, not content with their Liberty, and the Bounds as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed them, brake into the <hi>Roman</hi> Pale, and began to waste wide, but by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Lollius Urbicus,</hi> then Lieutenant, they were not only driven back, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a narrower compass, namely, the Friths of <hi>Edinborough</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> where <hi>Lollius</hi> repaired the Ancient Fortification, first begun by <hi>Agricola.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That this Wall built by <hi>Lollius</hi> was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> learnedly proves, and not where <hi>Hadrian</hi> built his, to wit, between <hi>Carlile</hi> and <hi>New-castle. He,</hi> saith <hi>Capitolinus</hi> (cited by Mr. <hi>Cambden) vanquisht the</hi> Britains, <hi>and having driven out the</hi> Barbarians, <hi>made another Wall of Turffs beyond that of</hi> Hadrians, which makes me wonder at <hi>Speed,</hi> who proves the same Author to say that it was <hi>Hadrian's</hi> Wall: The same Errours he commits in writing, That for these Atchievments <hi>Lollius</hi> obtained the name of <hi>Britannicus,</hi> when indeed it was <hi>Antoninus</hi> himself, to whom <hi>Fronto,</hi> as the Panegyrical Oratour saith, ascribed the Honour of this War, and hath testified, that He, <hi>Although sitting still at home, in the Palace of</hi> Rome, <hi>had given charge and Commission to another General for the War, yet like the Pilot of a Gally, sitting at the Stern, and guiding the Helm, deserved the Honour of the whole Voyage and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the time of this Emperour, the <hi>Brigantes</hi> also, a Nation of all others most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of Forreign Servitude, brake in upon <hi>Genounia,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> guesses to be <hi>Ginnethia,</hi> or <hi>North-Wales,</hi> within the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but were soon driven back, and fined with the loss of one part of their Territory.</p>
                     <p>This is all upon Record, touching <hi>Britain,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> saving <note place="margin">Digest. <hi>lib.</hi> 36.</note> that <hi>Sejus Saturrinus</hi> (as is collected from the <hi>Digests</hi>) had charge here of the <hi>Roman</hi> Navy.</p>
                     <p>He Reigned twenty three years, or, as others say, twenty two years, seven months, and twenty six daies, and died of a Feavour at <hi>Lorium</hi> the seventh day of <hi>March,</hi> in the year of his life 75, and of Christ 162.

                        <hi>MArcus Aurelius, Antoninus, Verus, Philosophus,</hi> for by so many names he was called, was the Son of <hi>Elius Verus,</hi> who died <hi>Praetor,</hi>

                     <p>It is observable, that this <hi>Verus</hi> was born the same day as <hi>Nero,</hi> and indeed he imitated him in all the Vices and Cruelties of his nature, so that whilest these two <note place="margin">Capitolinur.</note> Princes sate together upon the Throne, then might Mankind be judge and spectatour, at the same time, of a <hi>Just and equal Government,</hi> and a <hi>Proud and insolent Tyranny. Aurelius</hi> was nothing but <hi>Glemency, moderation</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> on the other hand <hi>Verus</hi> gave himself to <hi>Pride, carelessness, haughtiness</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> and as the Vertues of the one secured him from the attempts and mixtures of the others Vices, so were the Exorbitances of this <hi>Verus</hi> nothing allayed by the sweetness of <hi>Aurelius</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, so that what is a rare Example, and perhaps not to be equalled in all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and future Ages, from the same height of Power, at the same time, streamed forth the most different Extreams of unlimited Greatness; But <hi>Goodness</hi> was the longest survivor, for <hi>Verus</hi> dying of an <hi>Apoplexy</hi> after nine years Reign, <hi>Aarelius</hi> was left in possession of the whole Empire.</p>
                     <p>And, now the <hi>Britains</hi> impatient alwaies of Forreign Subjection, raised new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, for the appeasing whereof <hi>Galphurnius Agricola</hi> was sent Lieutenant. The Sirname of <hi>Agricola,</hi> no doubt, was terrible to the <hi>Britains,</hi> who could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the great Overthrows they had received formerly under a General of that name, and indeed the Commotions lasted not long after his Arrival, but seemed to be ended with fortunate success, for which there was raised an Altar, in gratitude to the <hi>Syrian</hi> Goddess, a peculiar Deity of this Island, as appeareth by this Inscription found in a Stone taken out of the <hi>Picts</hi> Walls:</p>

                        <head>In the Year 169 from the Passion of Christ, Lord <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> Pope, wrote thus to <hi>LVCIVS</hi> King of <hi>Britain,</hi> in answer to the Petition of the King, and the Nobility of the Kingdom of <hi>Britain.</hi>

You are Gods sole Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in your own Kingdom, according to that of the Prophet,</hi> The Earth is the Lords, and the fulness thereof, and all the Inhabitants that dwell therein. <hi>And again,</hi> Psalm <hi>the 44th. verse the 7th.</hi> Thou lovest Righteousness, and hatest Wickedness, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, thy good God, hath anointed thee with the oyl of Gladness above thy Fellows. <hi>And again, in the same Prophet,</hi> God is thy Righteousness; <hi>Not the Righteousness and Justice of</hi> Caesar. <hi>All Christian People, especially those of your own Kingdom, which live under your protection and peace, ought to be accounted and looks upon as your own Children, according to that of the Gospel,</hi> As the Hen gathereth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Chickens under her wings: <hi>The People of</hi> Britain <hi>are your People, which if at any time divided, you ought with your utmost care to reduce them to Concord, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their Peace and Unity, furthermore, to cherish, maintain, defend and govern them, and in fine, protect them from injurious and malicious Persons, and take their part against their Enemies. Wo to that Kingdom, that hath a Child to their King, and whose Princes eat in a morning. I do not call him a Childish King in respect of Minority, but in regard of his Foolishness, wickedness and madness, according to that of the Kingly Prophet,</hi> Bloody and deceitful Men shall not live out half their daies. <hi>By</hi> eating <hi>I mean,</hi> Greediness, <hi>by greediness,</hi> Luxury, <hi>by luxury, all</hi> filthy, eyil, <hi>and</hi> unseemly things, <hi>according to that of King</hi> Solomon, Wisdom shall not descend into a wicked Soul, neither shall it remain in a Body subject to sin. <hi>The name of</hi> Governour <hi>is not derived from his Government, but from well Governing. You shall be a King so long as you Rule well, which unless you do, the name of</hi> KING <hi>shall fail, and remain no longer in you, which, God forbid.

                     <head>Observations upon this EPISTLE of Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> to King <hi>Lucius.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis Epistle, however magnified, and look upon by some Authors as a worthy piece of Antiquity, yet there are several Reasons that induce us to believe that this is not the true and genuine Epistle of <hi>Eleutherius.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>And the <hi>first</hi> is, the Date it bears, which in the Text is dated 169, in the Margin 156, yet neither agree with the time of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his Popedom, if we will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the most approved Authors. For although <hi>Bede</hi> saies, he was made Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> in the year of our Lord 167, yet <hi>Eusebius,</hi> in his Chronicle, places the beginning of his Popedom in the sixteenth year of the Emperour <hi>Antoninus,</hi> that is, in the year of our Lord 179; But in his History, and indeed, truer to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year of <hi>Antonium,</hi> which is of our Lord 180. <hi>Baronius</hi> is of the same Opinion also, and confirms it by the Letters of the Martyrs at <hi>Lyons,</hi> which were presented to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> himself.</item>
                           <item>2. Besides, if this Epistle be true, it makes King <hi>Lucius</hi> to take a very preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous course in sending so far as <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> for the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, when he might sooner, and with less trouble, have procured them at home from the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, for, from the time of the Emperour <hi>Claudius</hi> (who subdued most part of <hi>Britain)</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws were in force here, nay, very well known to the further parts of <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> And <hi>Tacitus</hi> saies, he had erected here <hi>Roman</hi> Courts and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, which was about an hundred years before <hi>Lucius</hi> came to the Government. But we shall pursue this discourse no further, it being plain and obvious to any that are but meanly acquainted with those Histories.</item>
                           <item>3. This Epistle makes no mention, of any Power or Authority the <hi>Romans</hi> had in these parts, but makes <hi>Lucius</hi> an absolute Monarch, as in nothing subject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour: <hi>You are Gods Vicegerent in your own Kingdom,</hi> not <hi>Claudius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars,</hi> or any other Emperour; Contrary to the Customes of those times. Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> King <hi>Herod</hi> was under <hi>Pilate,</hi> and King <hi>Agrippa</hi> under <hi>Faelix</hi> and <hi>Festus,</hi> and so it was likewise usual in other Provinces; but without doubt, <hi>Lucius</hi> was a <hi>British</hi> King, as he is rightly so stiled in the Life of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> but it was but of some part of it, not of the whole Island, or that part which separated from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by a Wall, which was under the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet it is not to be doubted but that in some part of it he had a Power under the <hi>Romans,</hi> neither is it any hard matter to describe the Places of his Government, for he being the Son and Successour of King <hi>Coile,</hi> and <hi>Coile</hi> the Son of <hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> of <hi>Arviragus,</hi> which some report to be <hi>Togenus,</hi> others, the same with <hi>Tacitus</hi> his <hi>Prasutagus</hi> King of the <hi>Iceni;</hi> The <hi>Iceni</hi> inhabited that part of <hi>Britain</hi> which the East <hi>Angles</hi> did under the <hi>Saxons,</hi> it comprehended <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk,</hi> and at some time <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Their Royal City was <hi>Venta</hi> of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> now called <hi>Castor</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> near to the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> but this place is too far distant from <hi>Glastonia,</hi> a little Village of the <hi>Belgae</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> which <hi>Arviragus</hi> (as they say) gave to <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and his Companions that came with him. But this seems to intimate, that <hi>Arvira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> was rather King of the <hi>Belga</hi> and <hi>Dobuni,</hi> that is, of the West <hi>Saxons</hi> than of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> and that which promotes this Opinion, is, his being most usually in those parts, and his entertainment in <hi>Claudiocestria,</hi> if we will credit <hi>Gaufridus,</hi> but that which takes away the doubt (unless we will suspect the Author himself) is the testimony of <hi>Hector Boethius Scotus,</hi> who shews, that <hi>Arviragus</hi> was, by Birth, an <hi>Icene,</hi> and was substituted (by <hi>Claudius Caesar)</hi> King of <hi>Britain:</hi> furthermore, the <hi>Iceni</hi> first received the Christian Faith in <hi>Britain.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. This word <hi>Manutenere</hi> (which we translate <hi>Maintain)</hi> was not in use in <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> his time, but smells rather of the <hi>Norman Latin,</hi> from which it crept into our Country Laws.</item>
                           <item>5. Those places which are quoted out of the Holy Scripture, are taken out of the Translation of St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who lived two hundred years after <hi>Eleutherius.</hi>

                           <pb n="264" facs="tcp:58825:140"/>
                           <item>6. This Epistle never came out in the World till almost a thousand years after the death of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> but out of what Monks Cell it came is uncertain, but that which ought to be most observed, is, that it is no where to be found in <hi>Gaufridus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numuthentis,</hi> contemporary with <hi>Hovedenus,</hi> who was always diligent in the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>British</hi> Antiquities.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>This Answer of the Pope, by Letter, to <hi>Lucius,</hi> was sent by <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Dami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> Men of sound doctrine and holy life, by whose hands, the King, with all his Nobles, received Baptisme, and shortly after, by their industry, and the earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and endeavours of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> the Doctrine was so far propagated, that the Temples and Altars of the Heathen Gods were in most places flung down and demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, the Christian worship set up in their places, and the Church established un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Form and Government.</p>
                     <p>In the Seats of twenty eight <hi>Flamens,</hi> and three <hi>Arch Flamens,</hi> which presided <note place="margin">The first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
                        </note> over the whole Nation, being all of them either converted, or expulied, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted twenty eight <hi>Bishops,</hi> and three <hi>Arch-bishops,</hi> whose Chairs, for the greater convenience of Government, were continued in the same places the <hi>Archi-Flamens</hi> resided in.</p>
                     <p>The first and Metropolitan Seat was at <hi>London,</hi> and the Cathedral St. <hi>Peters,</hi> in the memory of that Saint, from whose Successour, <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> they had received the Faith. The second was at <hi>York.</hi> The third at <hi>Carlile;</hi> but of the particular extent of these places, I shall treat more fully anon.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But before we proceed any further, it will be necessary to say, who, and what these <hi>Flamens</hi> were, and of their being changed into <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Arch-bishops.</hi>

                     <head>What these <hi>Flamens</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamens</hi> were, and their being changed into <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Arch-bishops.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Wish we had seen the Book of <hi>Gildas,</hi> for it can hardly be found in ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that there was ever any distribution of <hi>Flamens,</hi> and <hi>Arch flamens,</hi> into their particular Provinces, or that the words <hi>Arch-flamens,</hi> and <hi>Arch-bishops,</hi> were in use in the time of <hi>Lucius,</hi> or that Metropolitical Jurisdiction, and the Ceremony of the <hi>Pall,</hi> had any being in those daies. For <hi>Flamens</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> were no other than their <hi>Priests,</hi> so called from a Thred or String (as <hi>Varro</hi> saith) with which they bound their Head, as <hi>Flamines,</hi> some <hi>Pileamines,</hi> from a Cap they wore, and from Sacrificing, commonly called <hi>Priests,</hi> and every one of these lookt after the proper Offices and Duties of their particular Gods, at first there were but three only, that of <hi>Jupiter, Flamen Dialis;</hi> of <hi>Mars, Flamen Martialis;</hi> of <hi>Romulus, Flamen Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinalis,</hi> but afterwards every God had his <hi>Flamen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither had any of these ever any Sacerdotal Power and Jurisdiction over any particular Province, or that officiated alone in one Parish only, for there being in the time of <hi>Numa</hi> thirty Parishes in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards thirty six; over every Parish, or such division, was set two <hi>Flamens,</hi> neither were they subject to any superiour <hi>Flamen,</hi> who was dignified and distinguisht by the Title of <hi>Arch-flamen.</hi> I acknowledge, that some were called the greater <hi>Flamens,</hi> others the lesser, but this was not from their Power, but the Antiquity of their Order, for the first three were instituted by <hi>Numa</hi> and the Nobility, the rest by the Commonalty.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>GAlfridus Arturius</hi> saith, That the <hi>Blessed Teachers</hi> (after they had almost rooted <note place="margin">Gal-Arturius.</note> out Paganisme from the <hi>British</hi> Nation, purging the Temples which were founded in honour of many of their Gods) consecrated them to one God, and delivered them to Religious men to be lookt after; There were then constituted twenty eight <hi>Flamens,</hi> and three <hi>Arch flamens,</hi> as we have said before, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Custome of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> burnt Incense to their Gods, and offered up Sacrifices unto them, delivering therefore these (by vertue of the Apostolick Doctrine) from their Idolatry, they consecrated <hi>Bishops</hi> in the place of <hi>Flamens,</hi> and <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> instead of <hi>Arch-flamens.</hi> The principal Seats of the <hi>Arch-flamens</hi> were in our most eminent Cities, <hi>viz. London, York,</hi> and <hi>Caer-leon</hi> upon the River <hi>Uske</hi> in <hi>Glamorganshire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Superstition therefore being driven out of the aforesaid places, three <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> were forthwith made, in other places they ordained <hi>Bishops,</hi> and over several Parishes assigned to every one his Power and Office. To the Province of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of <hi>York,</hi> fell <hi>Deira</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> which are divided from <hi>Leogria</hi> by the River <hi>Humber.</hi> To the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> submitted <hi>Loegria</hi> and <hi>Cornubia,</hi> which Provinces <hi>Severn</hi> separates from <hi>Wales,</hi> which was subject to the <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> See at <hi>Caerleon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Affairs being thus ordered, the aforesaid <hi>Holy Teachers</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and desired that all things they had done might be confirmed by the Pope, they were therefore honoured by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with the <hi>Pall,</hi> and all other Ceremonies usual in their kind, they returned again into <hi>Britain,</hi> being accompanied by divers Religious persons, by whose Doctrine and Preaching the <hi>British</hi> Nation was very much confirmed, establisht and strengthned in the Faith of Christ. Their Acts are to be found in the Books of <hi>Gildas,</hi> the Historiographer, so that now we shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to that of <hi>Vodinus,</hi> or <hi>Theonus,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> calls him.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Vodinus,</hi> or <hi>Theonus,</hi> for his constancy in the Christian Faith, was Martyred by the <hi>Saxons</hi> at their first arrival in <hi>Britain.</hi> After <hi>Fugacius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> had <note place="margin">Vodinus <hi>Mart.</hi>
                        </note> setled every thing in order, and establisht the Religion of Christ, the holy Rites and Ceremonies thereof, the Government and Discipline of the Church, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and having obtained their Constitutions, to be confirmed and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> still sitting in that Chair, they came again into <hi>Britain,</hi> by whose incessant Preaching and Sanctity of life, the <hi>Britains</hi> suckt in that Religion, the seeds whereof remained even unto the daies of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> who, after <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> raised the greatest Persecution the Church ever underwent.</p>
                     <p>And this is the first establishment of Christian Religion by publick Authority, which, for the Honour of our Nation, is very early, an hundred eighty and one years after the death of CHRIST, and the reason why it got footing so soon in <note place="margin">Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion establisht in <hi>Britain 181</hi> years after the death of our Saviour Christ.</note> 
                        <hi>Britain,</hi> above other Nations (among many Causes) this especially is given by Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, namely, The Learning, Piety, and Devotion of the <hi>Druids,</hi> who were so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this Island, as that they Decided and Judged not only in Spiritual, but Civil Affairs, and were resorted unto like Oracles for their profound Judgment and skill in Questions of the highest concern; And many of their Tenents, of which the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> was chief, were great inlets to that Religion, which, besides the great Vertue and Holiness it carried with it, it taught Rewards of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and Punishments of <hi>Vice,</hi> upon surer grounds than the Heathens had ever built for their Imaginary vertue, namely, evident <hi>Miracles,</hi> and certain <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> that there was an Almighty Power that strictly examined the Actions of every Man.</p>
                     <p>I know that many Objections are made to destroy the Authority of this History, which, well examined, will not prove to have so great force as at first sight they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to carry.</p>

                     <p>First, it is said, <hi>That it is very improbable there should at this time be any King of</hi> Britain, <hi>considering, that this Island for many years since remained a</hi> Roman <hi>Province?</hi> To which is Answered, That it was the Custome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in their Provinces, to continue Princes in their Governments, and to make them Instruments of their Bondage, giving them the shew of Power, though they were in effect but <hi>Vassals,</hi> and what hindereth, but <hi>Lucius</hi> might hold his Kingdom in fee of them.</p>
                     <p>Besides, in the daies of this Emperour, as is gathered from Authentick Histories, the <hi>Britains</hi> refused to obey <hi>Commodus,</hi> and it is certain, that they held and possest freely all those parts of the Island that lay beyond the Wall, which was built be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Tinmouth</hi> and <hi>Solway-Frith,</hi> and that those Northern <hi>Britains</hi> had Princes of their own; but especially, Let us consider, how that <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> not many years before, having ended War, permitted Kingdoms to be ruled by their own <hi>Kings,</hi> and Provinces by their own <hi>Comites.</hi>

                     <p>Second time Consul with <hi>Vespronius,</hi> which was the year that <hi>M. Aurelius</hi> died in, and in this agreeth both forreign and domestick Writers: as for others who refer it to an hundred seventy nine years after Christs Passion, it is manifest that it is the fault of Transcribers, who should have writ, an hundred seventy nine years after his Birth. The <hi>British</hi> Histories make it five years after, but, in this, it is not much to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                     <p>This <note n="†" place="margin">
                           <hi>Princeps magna gloriae:</hi> Ninnius.</note> 
                        <hi>LUCIUS,</hi> Sirnamed by <hi>Ninnius, Leuer-Maur,</hi> by a Table remaining in the Church of St. <hi>Peters</hi> in Cornhill, is supposed to be the Founder of that Church, and the Church it self thought to have been the Cathedral of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan See of <hi>London.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are who ascribe the Foundation of St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> to him, but in all probability the Places may be confounded; and some write that he built a Church at <hi>Dover,</hi> and endowed it with the Toll of that Haven.</p>
                     <p>Not content in having performed so many excellent Works, he is said at length, to have resigned his Kingdom, and Travelled into <hi>Germany,</hi> out of desire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Christian Faith, to have converted <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and afterwards going into <hi>Rhetia,</hi> there to have lived in a Cell, under a Rock, which was afterwards called the <hi>Rock of Lucius,</hi> then to have proceeded into that Country wherein the City <hi>Curia</hi> stood, where, living in a Cave, and preaching to the Infidels, he was at last betrayed and brought before the Governour, who put him to death in a Tower called <hi>Marula.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Body was brought into <hi>Britain,</hi> and buried in <hi>Glocester,</hi> so that it will not be improper to relate, what <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> saith in confirmation of this matter:</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Anno Gratiae</hi> CCI, <hi>Inclytus</hi> Britannorum <hi>Rex</hi> LUCIUS, <hi>in bonis actibus assumptus,</hi> Claudiocestriae <hi>ab hâc vitâ migravit ad CHRISTUM, &amp; in Ecclesiâ primae sedis Honoriftcè sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>He Reigned twelve years, and dying without Issue, left the Kingdom divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many of the Royal Blood, who all, setting up their Titles, miserably involved the whole Nation in Civil Wars and Combustions.</p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:58825:141"/>
                     <p>Upon this, the <hi>Picts</hi> took advantage of the Publick Distractions, and brake into the Southern parts, flinging down the Wall that was built as a Rampier to defend the Frontiers, and for a long time finding no resistance, wasted the Country far and wide, so that, if it be true what is reported of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> That out of zeal for Religion, He went into <hi>Bavaria</hi> to preach the Gospel, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Kingdom to be managed by the chiefest of his Nobility, without decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Successour, how much better had it been, if he had employed his time and labours in his own Dominions, which surely in so short a time could not be so entirely instructed in the Faith of Christ, but that there was room left for the employing of so great a Talent given him, for the use and comfort properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing first to his own Country. Neither could a Prophet want Honour in his own Country, who had Royal Authority to back his Priestly Function.</p>
                     <p>However therefore, the story of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> or <hi>Lever-Maur,</hi> as to the main of it may betrue, namely, That there was such a Person that Ruled in this Island, and embraced the Christian Religion, yet that he should have so great Authority, as absolutely to establish it, casting down the <hi>Flames</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamens,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose Province it was, and to set up in their room <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Arch-bishops,</hi> seemeth not only improbable but impossible also. If he was a King beyond <hi>Hadrians</hi> Wall, what had he to do with <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Carlile?</hi> and, if on this side, he was but a Tributary and Vassal to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and so could not so easily abolish their Worship, as indeed it manifestly appears out of Inscriptions of the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Island, who, after his time, continued their Altars to the Heathen Deities.</p>
                     <p>But, that he should forsake his Kingdom, and out of an over-fond opinion of <hi>Chastity,</hi> neglect the duty of a Prince, in not providing a Successour to his Crown, that he should leave his Kingdom at sixes and sevens, that he should think himself more useful in a Cell than a Throne, for the propagating Religion in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country, and not in his own, and imagine, that absconding in Holes and Deserts, would shew a greater light to the World than being placed upon a Hill, manifestly shews, from what Forge those Inventions proceeded, and that they were the idle Talks of our crafty Ancestors, whose business it was to gain Honour to their own Constitutions, by perswading the World, that no Obligations, Civil or Moral, although of the highest nature and concern, but must be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd, in order to his attaining perfection, which they placed in that lofty Poverty of a Monastick life.</p>
                     <p>And thus much is sufficient to be said of King <hi>Lucius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Troubles that arose after his decease, continued (as <hi>Fabian</hi> thinketh) fifteen <note place="margin">Fabianus.

                     <q>
                        <hi>Quo defuncto</hi> (speaking a little before of the death of King LUCIUS, he proceeds to say) <hi>dissidium inter</hi> Britones <hi>surrexit, quià absque Haerede decessit,</hi> &amp; Romana <hi>Potestas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firma est.

                     <p>Some make his Decease in the daies of the Emperour <hi>Hadrian,</hi> whom the <hi>English</hi> Chronicles follow; others continue his Reign but to the daies of <hi>Aurelius,</hi> and <hi>Verus,</hi> Emperours.</p>
                     <p>The first cannot be true, by reason it agreeth not with the time of <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius,</hi> who, according to the most diligent Chronographers, began to govern the See of <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 169, which is thirty years after the death of <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and sate in the Chair fifteen years, namely, to the year of our Lord one hundred eighty four.</p>

                     <p>The latter is equally false, considering that the Letter from <hi>Eleutherius</hi> to King <hi>Lucius,</hi> the Date whereof Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> followeth in contradiction to <hi>Bede,</hi> was sent when <hi>Lucius Aurelius Commodus</hi> was second time Consul with <hi>Vespronius,</hi> which was in the year one hundred seventy nine, or one hundred and eighty <hi>Anno currente,</hi> and ten years after the death of <hi>Verus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

                        <hi>Basing stokius</hi> makes <hi>LUCIUS</hi> to begin his Reign in the year of our Lord one hundred eighty three, in the second year of <hi>Commodus;</hi> the Conversion of this Prince (according to that Account) must be in the first year of his Reign, and the last of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> his Popedom, circumstances very improbable, for supposing that this Godly Prince should begin his Reign with the establishment of Christian Religion, yet what becomes of <hi>Fugacius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> returns to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> after they had been a year in <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Ratifications of their proceedings the year after obtained at <hi>Rome,</hi> if in the last year of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> the Kingdom was first Converted, as manifestly appears if this Calculation were true.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>British</hi> Histories generally make <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, to succeed <hi>Lucius</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Britain,</hi> and after him many other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, so that for the future we shall see the same Persons, though with different circumstances, in the Records of both Nations, made Actours in the soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p>Many have found fault with the <hi>British</hi> History upon this account, but whether it was, that the Royal Blood of the Native <hi>Britains</hi> was utterly extinct, or that the Compiler of these Stories was weary of inventing Names, sure I am, that the following Emperours had no more right to the Island than the preceding; And there is no where found that, <hi>Severus,</hi> either by Marriage, Adoption, or Donation, received the Kingdom, so that for many years we may bid farewel to the <hi>British</hi> History, and seeing they make the same Persons Monarchs of this Island, as the <hi>Romans</hi> do, I cannot be blamed, if, in setting down the Actions of Forreign Princes, I give precedence to the <hi>Roman</hi> Records, and it is a sufficient warrant, why, hitherto, I have made the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours Kings of this Island, but to return to <hi>Commodus.</hi>

                  <head>THE CONTINUATION OF THE Roman History, Under the EMPEROUR COMMODUS, As it relateth to This ISLAND.</head>
                  <p>WE read, that under this Emperour <hi>Britain</hi> was full of Wars and <note place="margin">An. Dom. 183.</note> seditious Troubles, for the Nations Northward, breaking down the Wall which was raised to keep them out, wasted the <hi>Roman</hi> Pale, and cut in pieces and destroyed the <hi>Romans</hi> that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, both Captain and Souldier.</p>
                  <p>To repress these Tumults, and reduce the Province, <hi>Commodus,</hi> in all haste, sends <hi>Ulpius Marcellus,</hi> a prime Commander of those times, who with so much Conduct and Fortune drives them back, and repays their Insolence, that in a short time it appears he had done too much, for he not only gained the envy of <hi>Commodus,</hi> but by his worthy Actions forfeits his Commission, and was recalled.</p>
                  <p>The Vigilance of this Captain is thus described; Although by nature he was not given to sleep, yet that he might improve that Faculty, he used Art also by inuring himself to fasting and abstinence, for the bread of his Table was brought from <note place="margin">Xiphilinus <hi>out of</hi> Dio. Cass.</note> 
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> lest being new it might too much swell him, when on the other hand the staleness of it, coming so far, would be sure to tempt him no farther than to what was convenient and necessary. And being desirous that all about him might be as watchful, every Evening he wrought twelve Tables, which were usually made of the <note n="*" place="margin">Tilia, <hi>and in Gr. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Linden-tree</hi> wood, and gives order to one of his Servants, that, hour by hour, he should give out one of them to the Souldiers till they were all delivered, that they might not think it grievous to keep watchful, whilest they saw their General himself so vigilant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Britain</hi> being brought to Obedience by so worthy a Commander, after he was Recalled, began to fall into more dangerous Commotions, which proceeded not from the <hi>Britains,</hi> but the Dissensions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, for the Reins of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline being let loose, all licentious Wantonness brake in. First, they began to be stubborn and unruly, next, openly, they refused the Command and Government of <hi>Commodus.</hi> And, although he was stiled <hi>Britannicus</hi> by his Flatterers, yet the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Britain</hi> attempted to set up another Emperour.</p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:58825:143"/>
                  <p>They complained of <hi>Evil Counsellors,</hi> the chief whereof was <hi>Perennis,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours principal Favourite, him they accused, that in the <hi>British</hi> War he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved Senators from Command, and placed over the Souldiers Men only of the Equestral Degree; that he had conspired against the life of the Emperour, for which they declared him Traytour, and an Enemy to the Army, and so fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, in the name of the rest, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> carrying their Grievances on the point of their Swords, and were so terrible to <hi>Commodus,</hi> that to satisfie them he was <note place="margin">AElius Lamp. <hi>in vit.</hi> Comm.</note> constrained to give up <hi>Perennis</hi> and his Son to their fury, who, after many Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Whipping, &amp;c. publickly beheaded Them.</p>
                  <p>After the death of this great Favourite and his Son, <hi>Commodus</hi> disowns all their proceedings, as done without his Approbation, by which means he appeases the Souldiers, but immediately upon their removal, grew worse and worse, doing far greater Injuries (by his new Minion <hi>Cleander</hi>) than he had done by his Favourite <hi>Perennis,</hi> so that the Souldiers in <hi>Britain</hi> continued still in their Resolutions of choosing a new Emperour, which made <hi>Commodus</hi> send his Letters unto <hi>Helvius Pertinax</hi> (who was then in <hi>Liguria,</hi> and was afterwards Emperour) to hasten into <note place="margin">Hel.

                     <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At his Arrival he found all things in disorder, the Souldiers upon a new Election, and himself (none having yet resolved upon the Person) in a fair way to be chosen, but presently after the good-will of the Army withdrew from him, for they were <note place="margin">Jul.

Him (after many worthy Exploits in <hi>Britain) Commodus</hi> created <hi>Caesar,</hi> giving him power (in a Letter he wrote to him) to assume the Scarlet Robe, and to wear it even in his presence, saving without golden Fringes.</p>
                  <p>This he did partly to strengthen himself by the Adoption of so worthy a Man, and partly to gain the strength of the <hi>British</hi> Army, for about this time <hi>Avidius Cassius</hi> began to usurp the Empire, and <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> was making of a Party.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Albinus,</hi> upon the receipt of this Letter, understanding the drift of <hi>Commodus,</hi> refuses the Honour, yet afterwards, hearing of his death (which, by some mistake, was reported about) he ascended the Tribunal, and before the <hi>British</hi> Army made this Oration.</p>

                  <p>The Emperour having designed certain Persons for death, amongst whom <hi>Martia</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

To prevent their own danger, they resolved suddenly to dispatch him; first by Poyson, but fearing that would not do so suddenly, with stabbs and strangling they made him away, when he had reigned thirteen years, eight months, and fifteen daies.</p>
                  <p>A Statue of his was lately dug up in <hi>England,</hi> amongst other <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities, <note place="margin">Camb. <hi>Brit.</hi>

                  <q>CAESARI AUGUSTO MARCI AURELII FILIO SENIS JOVIS AMPLISSIMI.</q>
                  <p>To such a height of Pride was he arrived, that he wrote to the Senate Letters bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Title:</p>
                  <q>Imperator, Caesar, Lucius, AElius, Aurelius, Commodus, Augustus, Pius, Foelix, Sarmaticus, Germanicus, Maximus, <hi>Britannicus,</hi> Pacator Orbis terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, Invictus, Romanus, Hercules, Pontifex Maximus, Tribunitiae Pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statis XVIII, Imperator VIII, Consul VII, Pater Patriae, Consulibus, Praetoribus, Tribunis Plebis Senatuique Commodiano felici, Salutem.</q>
                  <p>But although he called the Senate by his own name, yet how much they were his, we may understand by their often repeated Acclamations of Joy at the news of his death, which will not be much unpleasant, or impertinent, to set down out of <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius,</hi> seeing that herein will be shewed much of the Customes of those Times, <note place="margin">Lampridius <hi>vit.</hi> Commod.</note> wherein, under other Emperours, and upon other occasions, the like were used; They were performed in the Temple of <hi>Concord,</hi> in a solemn and serious manner, the whole Assembly of the Senate assisting.</p>
                  <p>And, seeing the frequent Repetitions contained in them, are set down after an ample and large manner by Historians, otherwise professing brevity in their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in other cases no waies guilty of tautology, it is reasonably to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that the words of the whole office might be penn'd before hand, and one going before and pronouncing them distinctly, the Senate to every Clause made a formal and loud Responsal; For otherwise, had not there been this order and method ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, but at the same time some were Execrating the past Emperour, others
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:58825:144"/>
Blessing the present, such a medly as this would have proved a Rout rather than a serious Exercise, and had never been so particularly recorded by Historians of their own, as a thing much unbecoming the Gravity of so wise an Assembly.</p>

                     <p>After his admission to the Empire, the Senate made Addresses to him that he would admit of <hi>Albinus</hi> to be his Associate in the Empire. This <hi>Albinus</hi> (as hath been shewn before) had infinitely obliged the States when he was Lieutenant in <hi>Britain,</hi> by making an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Jul.

                     <p>But <hi>Pertinax,</hi> who in his youth had learned, that two of a Trade could never agree, and who inwardly knew the disposition of <hi>Albinus,</hi> that he who was so hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and servile to the Senate, when a Private man, would be but a proud and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome Companion in the Throne, utterly rejected the motion; But that he might <note place="margin">Clo.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Albinus</hi> thus removed, <hi>Pertinax</hi> kept a watchful eye over him, and sought all means to bring him into disgrace and hatred with the Souldiers, to which end he publisht a Letter of <hi>Commodus</hi> written to his Praefects, wherein the Ambitious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Albinus</hi> seemed to be set forth.

                        <hi>SEVERUS,</hi> by the death of <hi>Julianus,</hi> having possession of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Ann. Dom. 194.</note> 
                        <hi>Senate,</hi> the principal strength of the Empire, began now to turn his thoughts toward the subduing of <hi>Pescennius Niger,</hi> who all this while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himself with the name of an Emperour, and carefully spent his time at <hi>Antioch,</hi> in the sports and jollities of his Inauguration, but before he could safely undertake his Expedition, two obstacles were to be removed. First the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Bands, and then <hi>Albinus</hi> who had the possession of the Army in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> a Party no less stubborn and dangerous; To remove the first, he commanded them to appear unarmed before him, when upbraiding them with their Treachery to <hi>Pertinax,</hi> he casheir'd and banisht them an hundred miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby, he not only brake the knot of these <hi>Janisaries,</hi> but infinitely obliged the People.</p>
                     <p>This great work being performed, the next difficulty is <hi>Albinus,</hi> but he was not so easily to be removed, wherefore he craftily ordains him his <hi>Caesar</hi> and Successour, and to create in him a firmer belief of his sincerity, he wrote Letters to him, wherein he declared, how himself being an Old man and Gouty, his Sons but Children, the Common-wealth stood in need of such a one as he, of so full Age and so great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                     <p>These Jacoals took with <hi>Albinus,</hi> so that <hi>Severus</hi> being now eased of the fear of the <hi>British</hi> Army, marched into <hi>Syria,</hi> in a pitcht Battle overcame <hi>Niger,</hi> and slew him. He took the City <note n="†" place="margin">Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</note> 
                        <hi>Bizantium,</hi> subdued the <hi>Adiabenes</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> and being full of Honour and Victory, returned to <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:58825:146"/>
                     <p>All this while <hi>Albinus,</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> was dreaming of his Succession, but <hi>Severus</hi> being impatient of an arrival in Power, and now desirous of establishing his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Empire, began to think of making him away; To that purpose he sent Murtherers, underhand to dispatch him, who being discovered by <hi>Albinus,</hi> too late began to take upon him the Empire, which during the absence of <hi>Severus, Britain</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Herodian.</note> being so nigh to <hi>Rome,</hi> he might easily have seized.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Severus</hi> finding his Practices discovered, disowned them, and sent <hi>Heraclitus</hi> to take possession of <hi>Britain. Albinus</hi> refused to Resign, declares for the Empire, erects his own Statues, and stamped his picture on his Coyns, and, to justifie himself, with <note place="margin">Onuphrius.</note> the choice of all <hi>Britain</hi> entred <hi>France,</hi> and, near unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> took the Field against <hi>Severus.</hi> He, on the contrary, declared <hi>Albinus</hi> Traytour, and enemy to the States, and assembling all his Forces, meets him on the said place, and gives him Battle.</p>
                     <p>The Army of <hi>Albinus</hi> (as saith <hi>Herodian</hi>) by the Judgment of such of those times who reported more for truth than favours sake, far exceeded in Courage that of <note place="margin">Herodian.</note> 
                        <hi>Severus,</hi> and was equal to the best of his <hi>Illyrian</hi> Souldiers, the Prime men of the other Party.</p>
                     <p>At the first Onset the dispute was hot between them, and the Victory for a long time inclined to neither side, till the <hi>Albinians,</hi> fighting most valiantly, repulsed the others, and <hi>Severus</hi> himself flying from the Battle, flung off his Purple Robe, and falling from his Horse, hid himself.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>British</hi> Forces, thinking the Victory had been their own, began carelessly to pursue, displaying their Ranks in thinner arraies, and without Order, fell on the backs of their Enemies; when <hi>Laetus,</hi> one of <hi>Severus</hi> his Captains (who all this while stood aloof, expecting the issue of the Fight) came upon them with his fresh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foiled Troops, with a purpose and resolution now to take the Empire upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (for he heard that <hi>Severus</hi> was slain) and charging fiercely upon them, who little expected a new Enemy, he totally routed and put them to flight. <hi>Severus</hi> perceiving the Battle returned, reassumes his Purple Robe, recovers his Horse, and rallying those that were scattered, came in, at the end of the day, pursuing what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and having slain <hi>Albinus,</hi> with a number of others, obtained a most fortunate Victory.</p>
                     <p>And now, having alone the Sovereignty of the whole World, and finding by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that <hi>Britain</hi> was a Province too great and powerful to be trusted in the hands <note place="margin">An. Dom. 198.</note> of one Man, he divided it into two Governments, committing the North part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to <hi>Virius Lupus,</hi> as Propraetor and Lieutenant (whom <hi>Ulpian</hi> the Civil Lawyer <note place="margin">Digest. lib. 28. tit. 6.</note> nameth <hi>President</hi>) and to <hi>Heraclytus</hi> the South.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Virius Lupus,</hi> who had the Government of the North, had to do with two sorts of People, the <hi>Meatae</hi> and <hi>Caledonians,</hi> the former whereof lived upon the Wall that divided the South of the Island from the North, the <hi>Caledonians</hi> inhabited higher, both of them a sierce and barbarous Nation.</p>
                     <p>To suppress these he raised many Castles, and entred at last into League with the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> upon promise that they would be assistant to him in keeping under the <hi>Meatae,</hi> but the <hi>Caledonians</hi> not performing the Articles, and <hi>Lupus,</hi> upon hopes of their Aid, adventuring too far, was constrained in the end to redeem his own Peace, and a few Prisoners, with a great sum of Mony. And being not able, after many Losses and Calamities sustained, to repress the sudden inroads and assaults of the Enemy, he wrote unto <hi>Severus,</hi> in plain terms, the state of Affairs, and that the Island wanted his presence.</p>
                     <p>The memory of this <hi>Virius Lupus,</hi> among other great works done by him here in <hi>Britain,</hi> is preserved in an Altar dug up, dedicated to the Goddess <hi>FORTUNE,</hi> upon the occasion of his repairing a Bath, or Hot-house, at a Town called the <hi>Lavatrae,</hi> now <hi>Bows</hi> upon <hi>Stanmoor,</hi> in <hi>Richmondshire.</hi>

                     <p>These difficulties in Person <hi>Severus</hi> underwent, and desisted not, although through <note place="margin">Spartianus.</note> weakness carried in a Litter, till he had marched through with his Army, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Northern point of the Isle.

                        <p>FIrst, that WALL which runneth through the high part of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> from the Bay of <hi>Itun,</hi> otherwise <hi>Solway-Frith</hi> on the <hi>Irish</hi> Seas, to <hi>Tinmouth</hi> near <hi>New-castle,</hi> and commonly called the <hi>Picts</hi> Wall, is, by the <hi>Britains,</hi> called, <hi>Gual-Sever, Gal-Sever,</hi> and, by the <hi>Scots, Mur Sever,</hi> all which denominations do manifestly carry in them the very Name of this Emperour <hi>SEVERUS,</hi> and is a strong Argument, that here was the place that he built the Wall we are now treating of. For between <hi>Dunbritton</hi> and <hi>Edinborough-Friths,</hi> although there be many Ruines of continued Fortifications, yet they are not so visible as these, nor do they ever seem to have been of that strength, and solid make, as this of <hi>Severus</hi> is reported in all Authors. Certainly, they have not in them any Name (as ever I could hear of) whereby <hi>Severus</hi> may so plainly be gathered to be their Builder.</p>
                        <p>But, besides the Name and Contexture of this Wall (which shall be proved, was of more solid and durable substance than the other, between <hi>Edinborough</hi> and <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britton-Frith</hi>) there are other Arguments to prove it was the same with <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, the number of Miles, which <hi>Spartianus</hi> hath truly reckoned to be eighty. <note place="margin">Spart.</note> Now between <hi>Edinborough</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton</hi> there is not half that distance, but if they shall object and say, How that <hi>Eutropius</hi> hath reckoned the Length but thirty five Miles, and <hi>Victor</hi> thirty two, yet never the more doth this agree with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <note place="margin">Eutrop. Victor.</note> between the <hi>Friths</hi> of <hi>Edinborough</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton.</hi> Let them consider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the mistake might arise from hence:</p>
                        <p>Suppose the true number of Miles, which are eighty two, be written thus (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custome of the <hi>Romans</hi>) LXXXII, how easie is it to be supposed that the L being blotted, or worn out, it might be read, according to <hi>Victor,</hi> XXXII, and <hi>Eutropius</hi> XXXV, the last [1] having something remaining, though defaced; And that which fully perswadeth me, that such an Errour hath been committed by the Transcribers in this case, is, that other Authors read it one hundred thirty two Miles, the first numeral, L, being confused, they took it for a C, so instead of reading LXXXII, <hi>viz.</hi> Eighty two miles, they read thus CXXXII, <hi>viz.</hi> One hundred thirty two miles; And this seemeth not only easie, but also necessary to be supposed, how else can the contradictions of eighty, thirty two, and one hundred thirty two, be otherwise reconciled.</p>
                        <p>The next Argument, is, the Authority cited by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> for this opinion, to which he annexeth his own.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Hector Boetius; Severus</hi> (saith hé) <hi>commanded</hi> Hadrian's <hi>Wall to be repaired with Bulwarks of</hi> Stone, <hi>and Turrets placed at such convenient distance, as that the sound</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Hect. Boet.</note> 
                           <hi>of a Trumpet, though against the Wind, might be heard one against another.</hi> And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, our Chronicles report, <hi>That the Wall begun by</hi> Hadrian, <hi>was finisht by Severus;</hi> Also <hi>Hierom Surita,</hi> a most Learned <hi>Spaniard,</hi> writes, <hi>That the Fence of</hi> Hadrian <hi>was extended farther by</hi> Septimius Severus; <hi>Guidus Pautirolus</hi> affirmeth. <note place="margin">Hier. Surita. Guid. Pauc.</note> 
                           <hi>That</hi> Severus <hi>did but re-edifie and repair the Wall of</hi> Hadrian, <hi>being fallen down.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the Authority of <hi>Bede</hi> puts the Question beyond dispute, where he writes of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a little before their quitting the Island, his words are these, <note place="margin">Bede.</note> 
                           <hi>Moreover the</hi> Romans, <hi>because they thought this also might serve their Allyes in some stead, whom they were forced to leave, placed a Wall of strong</hi> Stone <hi>from Sea to Sea, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly between the Cities which had been built there for fear of the Enemy, where</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>also in times past had made a Rampire.</hi> Where is that Wall of Stone, but between <hi>Solway-Frith</hi> and <hi>Tinmouth?</hi> and, where else could <hi>Severus</hi> his Wall be?</p>
                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:58825:148"/>
                        <p>The Inhabitants upon this Wall (to make a small digression) talk much of a Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen <note place="margin">Cambd. <hi>Brit.</hi>
                           </note> Trunck (whereof they found Pieces now and then) artificially set in the Wall, ran between every Tower and Fortress, and served to convey Intelligence, the Noise being carried through the hollow Pipe from Tower to Tower, according as they found themselves in different places assaulted. The like miraculous device of the Towers in <hi>Bizantium, Xiphiline</hi> relates out of <hi>Dion,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Severus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But since the Wall now lieth along, and no Pipe remaineth there, many Tenants <note place="margin">Xiphiline <hi>ex</hi> Dion.</note> hold Farms thereabouts of the King in <hi>Cornage,</hi> that is, that they should give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to the Neighbours, of the Enemies approaching, by winding of a Horn, which some think had the first original from an Ancient Custome of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> will needs have this Wall built by <hi>Severus</hi> of Stone and Mortar, although <note place="margin">Speed <hi>Chron.</hi>

                           <hi>Bede</hi> proveth to the contrary. He groundeth his opinion upon an Inscription found in the Ruines of one of his Works near unto the River <hi>Ure</hi> in the County of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>

                        <p>Whilest these things were doing, and the Peace lasted, it happened that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>Julia</hi> (discoursing with the Wife of <hi>Argento,</hi> a <hi>Caledonian</hi>) cast out a Scoff against the loosness of the <hi>British</hi> Women, who promiscuously consorted with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Men, whom the <hi>British</hi> Lady thus confidently answered; <hi>Much honester do we</hi> Britains <hi>fulfil the work of Nature than you</hi> Romans; <hi>we with the Gallantest men accustome openly, you with the Basest in Corners.</hi>

                        <pb n="281" facs="tcp:58825:148"/>
                        <p>And now it was, about the year of Grace 211, that <hi>Severus</hi> took upon him the Name of <hi>BRITANNICUS MAXIMUS,</hi> causing that Inscription to be <note place="margin">An. Dom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Spartianus</hi> saith, that he assumed these Titles not so much for his other Atchievments in <hi>Britain,</hi> as the <note place="margin">Spartianus.</note> Wall he had built, which great work being now accomplished, and himself returned Victor into the Province, having, as he thought, establisht a lasting Peace, began to ponder in his mind, according to the Superstitions of those times, what Omen would next occur to him.</p>
                        <p>It happened that an <hi>AEthiopian</hi> (that followed the Camp) of a great repute for his scurrile Wit, among the Souldiers, and whose Jests were much celebrated by them, ran to him with a Crown of <hi>Cypress,</hi> whom the Emperour, in great rage, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be taken away, touched with such dismal presages as his black Visage, and <hi>Cypress</hi> Crown, yet the Fellow undaunted, and still pursuing his fawning Jest, cried out; <hi>Thou hast been All, and hast conquered All, Now thou art a Conquerour, be a God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Afterwards going to <hi>York,</hi> and desirous to perform Divine Service, by the errour of a Country Priest he was carried into the Temple of <hi>Bellona,</hi> where the Sacrifices proved black and sooty, which he refusing to offer, and hastning home, by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Sacrificers the Beasts got loose, and followed the Emperour even unto his Palace.</p>
                        <p>These Prodigies were looked on as the presages of his death, which, in a while after ensued, for he had not long been in the Province, but the Northern Nations taking advantage of his absence and sickness, and the negligent proceedings of his Son <hi>Antonine,</hi> who had the Command of his Army, brake the Peace, and rose up in Arms to defend their Liberties, which so incensed the testy Old man, wearied out with Labours and Infirmity, that he sent his Son against him, strictly commanding him to spare neither Age nor Sex, using to that purpose these Verses taken out of <hi>Homer,</hi>

                        <p>By reason, to some, <hi>The way of Deifying their Emperours</hi> may be unknown, I have thought it convenient to give a summary account of it here, but first by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> were in general a sort of rude and ignorant People, made up of the <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Liv.</hi> Dicad. 1. lib. 1.</note> conflux of the worst of the Neighbour People of that State, who either out of Guilt, having committed some notorious Crimes in their own Cities, that deserved death by their Laws, or Discontent, for want of preferment or promotion among <note place="margin">Flor. Val. Max.</note> their own People, fled (out of Revenge) to that <hi>Asylum,</hi> or place of Resuge, which <hi>Romulus</hi> had set up for the same purpose, to draw People to his new-built City; so that they had no Gods in common, but every one had his peculiar Deity (if such People had any) as he received, and learnt in his own Country, insomuch that the Worship of the City was various and uncertain, which, with those Gods <hi>AEnaeas</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Varro</hi> de Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remontis.</note> brought from <hi>Troy,</hi> made up a promiscuous sort of Idolatry, but of these <hi>Romans</hi> we shall speak more fully in the Chapter relating to their <hi>Antiquities.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus it continued all <hi>Romulus</hi> his Reign, the People being rather given to War than any Civil exercise of Religion, all of them enquiring into the success of their Battles, by various and different Auguries, which every man had properly to himself.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Numa</hi> succeeding <hi>Romulus,</hi> and being a superstitious Prince, much addicted to the Ceremonies of Religion, perceived it necessary for the supporting of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to introduce some sort of Uniformity in Religion. Now this he could not do, without pretending to some extraordinary Divine Revelations, every man judging that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>God</hi> to be the best, in which he was born, and to which he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally most devoted, to accomplish his private ends and desire. <hi>Numa</hi> feigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to have an intimate Communication and interest with the Goddess <hi>EGERIA,</hi> and, by the wonderful sanctity of his life, fully perswades and possesses the People with the truth of his divine Intercourse with her, insomuch that he establisht a set Form of Worship, which he had learnt from the <hi>Etruscans,</hi> a People infinitely given to Rites and Ceremonies, which took their name from <hi>Care,</hi> a City of <hi>Etruria.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After these proceedings, he accomplishes the certain number and order of the Gods, built Temples, offered and instituted particular sacrifices to them, taught them the Lines of Heaven and Earth, how to exercise their Augury, and having establisht all things in a firm and steady method, dies, who, by the prosperity and felicity of his Reign, fixes the People in an absolute belief of the Truth of those things he had before (through his great pains and industry) taught them.</p>
                        <p>Upon the division of these <hi>Romans,</hi> they had a respect to the distinct and different dignities of Gods, by Title and Place, the better to advance the perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their own promotions, and so claimed a right to particular Gods, that others might not own. From this they successfully preserved the memory thereof by Images, like the Parents and Sons, as the most Honourable memorial of their descent from such Mighty and Noble Progenitors. For those that were the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Images to themselves, without being promoted to it by Merit, were esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Upstarts, and all such as had no Images were accounted Ignobly born.</p>
                        <p>Thus we see, how by this strait of difficulty they despaired, and some quite pin'd away for want of Honour, amongst whom it often happens, whose pride and ambition will not admit of content, to be born from the loyns of Men, but of Gods. None therefore could obtain the priviledge of being Dignified after this manner, but such as were promoted by the Senate to ride publickly in the Curule Chair, which was the primary Dignity appertaining to such lofty Promotions.</p>
                        <p>By this 'tis evident, that the Right of Nobility went by favour of the Senate, as well as Merit, from whence we may gather, how early, and from what Root, the honour of Antiquity took its first Rice and Original, which must be occasioned out of the sence of Gratitude, for some worthy Exploit done to the credit of the State, or particular respect to such Persons, and the benefit of Successours, whose zeal to Religion, and the eminency of whose Spirit, had so fortunately raised them above the ordinary level of Mankind.</p>
                        <p>For this very cause <hi>Janus, Saturn,</hi> and others (who, by their several Projects, Inventions, and Labours, had contributed to the improving and augmenting the Comforts of this Life, in their perpetual Remembrance after they departed hence)
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:58825:149"/>
were translated under the sublime notion and title of GODS, having no other way in those daies, of gratifying the Deserts of the deceased, or supporting of the honour of their otherwise fading Memories, than by <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But many, in successive Ages (although they had not so good a Title) took upon them the same pretences, for as their Merits were less, so their Pride and Ambition was greater, Flattery making (doubtless) amends in a considerable manner, for the former.</p>
                        <p>This made <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who was rather destructive and injurious, than beneficial to Mankind (taking the measure of his Worth from the vain applause of his Followers, and the esteem of his own Actions, from their greatness, not good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) write to the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> that they would admit him into the Society of their Gods. What entertainment his Follies found, may be seen from the scoff of <hi>Anaxarchus Eudamonicus,</hi> who did (<gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>Yet notwithstanding this, many Cities, for fear of Injury, or hope of Gain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that he should be Deified.</p>
                        <p>Now one would have thought, that the Follies of this <hi>Macedon,</hi> and the reception they had, might have been a sufficient cause for <hi>Augustus</hi> to have advised him to the contrary, especially that memorable sentence of <hi>Calisthenes,</hi> might have forewarned <note place="margin">Note.

                     <head>The Manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> Deifying their Princes, was performed after this method.</head>
                     <p>AFter the decease of a Prince, his Body was first nobly and honourably In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd, <note place="margin">Herodotus <hi>vit.</hi> Severi.</note> after the manner of other Men, but suitable, and as most becoming his Princely birth and quality. And before an Emperour was Deified, a general La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and Mourning was held through the whole City, yet intermixt with some Feast and Entertainment, but performed in a solemn manner.</p>
                     <p>After the performance of wonted Ceremonies, a stately Image of Wax, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Face of the deceased, but pale and wan of Countenance, as representing a sick and dying Man, was laid upon a most sumptuous Bed of <hi>Ivory,</hi> exalted on high, openly, before the Palace Gate, covered with a Pall of Gold.</p>
                     <p>The most part of the day, about this Bed of State, sate in Mourning on the Right hand, the whole <note n="†" place="margin">The Senate mourning in Black.</note> Senate, on the Left, Ladies, who were esteemed for the sake of their Progenitors, or Noble Husbands, Honourable, and these were drest up in white close Garments (wearing no Jewels about them, although the usual Ornaments and splendour to that Sex) for in that Habit they represent Mourners.</p>
                     <p>For the space of seven daies this Solemnity continued, during which time the Waxen Image was daily attended by Physitians, as their Patient, feeling his Pulse, examining and consulting his present distemper, after so doing, they pronounced That he was To declining in health, as uncurable.</p>
                     <p>At the expiration of the seventh Night, when it seemed meet to them to think he was departed, this Image, with the Bed of State, was taken up, by the choicest Youth of the Nobility and Gentry of each Order, carrying it through the <hi>Via Sacra,</hi> into <note place="margin">Via Sacra.</note> the <hi>Old*<note n="†" place="margin">FORUM.</note> Market;</hi> and first for <hi>Via Sacra.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>VIA SACRA,</hi> was, the Great way that led to the <hi>Roman Market,</hi> so called from the Sacrifices which were offered up at the concluding of the League, between <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> King of the <hi>Sabines.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>In some parts of it, it may be taken for a place of Negotiation or Merchandize, so that some <note n="f" place="margin">viz. FORUM, Eoarium, Piscarium, Olitorium.</note> Adjective must be joyned to it, more fully to express its several uses, <hi>viz.</hi> a place for sale of <hi>Flesh, Fish</hi> and <hi>Herbs,</hi> but this cannot be that, surely, as is meant of the Old Market, but I will not deny but that it may be some of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skirts of it.</p>
                     <p>Some take the word <hi>FORUM,</hi> to be a place where a Magistrate of a Province calls his People together, to give Sentence (according to the Law) in punishing an Offendour, and to decide differences in point of Right and Inheritance, and in which also were Speeches made unto the People.</p>
                     <p>Relating to these matters originally there were only three; <hi>Romanum Forum, Julium,</hi> and <hi>Augustum;</hi> from this foundation the <hi>Roman</hi> Senatours constituted no less than six; <hi>Forum Julianum,</hi> as <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> was the Founder, <hi>Forum Augusti,</hi> from <hi>Octavius Augustus, Forum Domitiani,</hi> from <hi>Domitian</hi> the Emperour, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by <hi>Nerva,</hi> by reason of the sudden death of <hi>Domitian,</hi> who left it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finished.</p>
                     <p>Others will have it <hi>Forum transitorium,</hi> as there was a Publick passage through it; leading to three several Market places.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lipsius,</hi> in his third Book, and seventh Chapter, treating of the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness, <note place="margin">Lipsius, <hi>lib. 3. cap. 7.</hi>
                        </note> calls it <hi>Palladium Forum, Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the middle thereof was built a stately Temple to the Honour of</hi> Minerva.</p>
                     <p>Another was founded by the Emperout <hi>Trajan,</hi> called <hi>Trajani Forum,</hi> in which was built a sumptuous Pillar, in height an hundred and forty Cubits, expressing the noble Exploits done by him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Salustii Forum,</hi> was a Noble place bought by <hi>Salust,</hi> with several delicate and delightful Gardens adjoyning, which since bares the name of <hi>Horti Salustini.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last (which indeed was first built) was called <hi>Forum Vetus,</hi> and this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all the rest, and contained the Oratours Pulpit, called <hi>Rostra, &amp;c.</hi> unto this <hi>Forum</hi> many distinct places belonged, convenient for their uses, and sutable in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, so that it must reasonably be concluded, that this being the place Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently called <hi>Forum Vetus,</hi> and <hi>Forum Vetus</hi> being the place they past through, where Magistrates delivered up their Power, must be the place meant for the entertaining of so great a Solemnity.</p>
                     <p>In this place was built a Wooden Tribunal of the colour of Stone, on which was erected an Edifice, sustained on every side with certain Pillars, variously adorned and set out with <hi>Ivory</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> thither was brought another Bed like the former (graced with the Heads of several Creatures, both of Sea and Land) covered over with Purple Cloth, embroydered with Gold, where was laid the Waxen Image of the Prince, brought from the Palace in his Triumphal Ornaments, from which (as if the Emperour slept) a handsom Boy, with a Fann made of <hi>Peacock</hi> Feathers, winged away the Flies.</p>
                     <p>On each side of this Market-place Scaffolds were erected, where, on one side was planted a Chorus of Noble mens Sons, another of Ladies on the other, singing Songs in honour of the Deceased, which being ended, the Funeral solemnity marched out of the City, towards the <hi>Campus Martius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> by reason it lay near the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> was otherwise called <hi>Tiberinus,</hi> and was given to the <hi>Roman</hi> People by a Vestal Virgin, named <hi>Caja Tarratia.</hi> This was accounted a Holy place, insomuch that the Corn which <note n="*" place="margin">Tarq. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb. <hi>deposed.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> sowed there, after he seized the Ground from the People, was violently pluckt up by the Roots, by an order of the Senate, and thrown into <hi>Tiber,</hi> thinking it unfit to make any such use of so Sacred a place, given them.</p>
                     <p>Besides the pleasantness of this Field, according to its own nature, it was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many Curiosities (sent from the Capitol) and several Images of many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Men.</p>
                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:58825:150"/>
                     <p>Here Horse Races, Foot Races, Fencing, casting the Bowl, the Dart, the Sledge, Wrestling, bending the Bow, Slinging, Vaulting, &amp;c. was exercised, and all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before (forsooth) growing of Corn, by reason of the Holiness of the place, and upon these occasions it was dedicated to <hi>Mars,</hi> therefore called <hi>Campus Martius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men of the highest Repute were here burnt, meaning their Effigies, for we have already shewn, that before the Deifying of an Emperour by buining his Waxen Image, his real Body was Honourably buried after the manner of other men.</p>
                     <p>Here were Kings and Magistrates at first created, and to the place called <hi>Ovilia,</hi> or <hi>Septa,</hi> erected in this Field, the People assembled to present their Suffrages, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Election of new Magistrates.</p>
                     <p>Before the Princes Image, that was intended for this <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in State the several Images of Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who had been any waies famous, from the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> to the time of this Consecration, next followed repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, in <hi>Brass,</hi> of the Provinces of the Empire, known and distinguisht by Habits and Ornaments peculiar to each Nation, then came several sorts and Orders of Citizens, as Lictors, Scribes, and Criers, next marched Horse-men and Foot-men in Armour, War-Horses led, and all those things which were presented by the Nobility, Gentry and Commonalty, for the increasing the greatness and splendour of this Funeral solemnity.</p>
                     <p>Lastly appeared a Golden Altar, enriched with Jewels and <hi>Ivory,</hi> and after all those things were past that made up the Magnificence of this Shew, the succeeding Emperour ascended the Oratory or Pulpit, where, in an elegant Speech, he set forth the Praises of the late Emperour.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of his Oration, the Senatours that stood close to the Oratory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make several Exclamations (the method of which I have shewn in another place) some, immoderate and excessive in his Commendations, others, in bemoaning the loss they sustained by the fate of his decease, and did it much more violently when the Speech was finisht.</p>
                     <p>But when this Bed of State was to be removed from the place wherein it stood, the whole Senate lamented and wept; These Ceremonies being concluded, the Bed was removed from the Tribunal, not only by the Priest and Magistrates, for the present year, but by the help of those that were designed for the succeeding also, and delivered to certain Knights to be carried forward.</p>
                     <p>Part of the Senate went before it, by dismal tunes set to the Pipe, and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Groans, they exprest rarely their counterfeit Sorrows.</p>
                     <p>Last of all followed the Emperours, and after they had left the City, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacht that place of the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> where the Field is at the widest, was erected a Pile or Turret, quadrangular and equilateral, in the form of a Tabernacle, consisting of great Timber only. Its inside was well stored with all kind of dry and combustible matter, the outside was beautified and set forth with Ivory-Images curiously wrought, and hung with stately Hangings interwoven with Gold.</p>
                     <p>On this was raised another Turret, or story, with Doors and Casements open, differing in bigness not in glory from the former, next a third, and a fourth, the higher Lost being alwaies less in compass that than beneath, and so by degrees till you come to the highest, which is least of all.</p>
                     <p>Upon the top of this was placed the guilded Charriot of the Emperour, in which he took most delight when he was alive.</p>
                     <p>The form of this Tabernacle can be compared to nothing so well as those Watch-Towers, which by their Nocturnal Lights, guide and direct Ships into safe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                     <p>The Bed being laid into the second Tabernacle, they brought Persumes, <hi>Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Spices, all kind of sweet Fruits, fragrant Herbs, odoriferous Juyces, and distillations of Trees, in such vast quantities, that one would have thought the East <hi>Indies</hi> had been invited to the Consecration.</p>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:58825:151"/>
                     <p>There was no Nation, City, or Persons of worth and quality, that did not emulously strive to out-vie each other in the greatness of their Presents, giving the last signal Tokens to the World of their respectful Acknowledgments to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Prince.</p>
                     <p>When the Room was filled with these Spices, and all other things requisite to the celebrating of the Consecration, the succeeding Emperour, and the Kindred of the dead Emperour, took their leave and last farewel by saluting his Statue, which being ended, the Prince ascends the Tribunal, the Senatours are placed on Scaffolds, provided on purpose for them, where they might best see the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies performed, in honour of their Prince, the Magistrates and others sitting in their order, according to their Qualities and Office.</p>
                     <p>Then the Knights of <hi>Rome</hi> ride forwards and backwards about the Building, imitating the <hi>Pyrrichian</hi> Dance, according to rule and measure, the Foot Souldiers ran Races about it, and lastly, several Charriots were driven swift round it, managed by Persons of Honour, lively representing to the Spectatours, in Vizards, the Effigies of their Illustrious Emperours, and bravest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                     <p>These Formalities performed, he that was to succeed in the Empire, took a Torch, and fired the Tabernacle, next the Consuls, after them other Magistrates, according to their Degree and Order.</p>
                     <p>All places being filled with Spices, and other combustible matter, the whole Fabrick flamed on a sudden.</p>
                     <p>From the highest Tabernacle an Eagle was let flie, which was pretended to attend to carry the Emperours Soul up to Heaven, and from that time forward was he reckoned among the Gods.</p>
                     <p>This Consecration at last was allowed (by the baseness and flattery of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) to the Emperours Wives, Sisters, and Daughters, in as ample a manner as to the Emperours themselves.</p>
                     <p>The names of those that were Deified were afterwards changed, as <hi>Io,</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Isis; Melicerta, Portumnus;</hi> and <hi>AEneas,</hi> after his Apotheosis, by the ancient <hi>Latins</hi> was called <hi>Jovem indigitem,</hi> as <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> in his first <hi>Decad.</hi> and first Book witnesseth; And <hi>Romulus</hi> (as is well known) was afterwards called <hi>Quirinus,</hi> and from this Custome likewise came it, that Princes were called <hi>DEOS, &amp; DIVOS,</hi> and their Letters and Rescripts, <hi>ORACLES,</hi> and thus I conclude the manner of the <hi>Romans</hi> Deifying their Emperours, according to the best information of their own Authors.</p>

                  <p>THE Northern Nations, with whom <hi>Severus</hi> had to deal, who are called by the <hi>Romans, Caledonii</hi> and <hi>Meatae,</hi> by the <hi>British</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories are named <hi>Picts,</hi> and their Country <hi>Deira</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> their Leader, <hi>Fulgentius</hi> the Brother of <hi>Martia,</hi> the first Wife of <hi>Severus,</hi> and Mother of <hi>Bassianus Antoninus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>FULGENTIUS,</hi> doubtful of his strength any longer to resist, makes a Voyage into <hi>Scythia</hi> (for yet the <hi>British</hi> Histories leave not off their far-fetches) where, gathering together a Body of the choicest Youth, called <hi>PICTS,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into <hi>Britain,</hi> and at his Arrival, many forsook <hi>Severus,</hi> and joyned themselves with him.</p>
                  <p>Flusht with this success, he besiegeth the Emperour in <hi>York,</hi> who keeping close for a while till his Men were in readiness, at last breaks out, and forceth him to a Battle, the event whereof, was, that both <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> received their mortal wounds therein. The <hi>Picts</hi> retired to their Fast-holds, and <hi>Severus</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> where he soon after died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> in writing of this story (as in many other places he is guilty of the same Errour) by ill timing of Actions, and confounding the Names of Persons, hath made it so intricate, that it is impossible to find out what he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for he makes <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> the Emperour, the same as <hi>Junius Severus,</hi> who was sent, by <hi>Commodus,</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> to succeed <hi>Albinus,</hi> as manifestly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, where he saith, <hi>That</hi> Severus <hi>a Senatour, after the death of</hi> Lucius, <hi>was sent into</hi> Britain, <hi>by the Senate, with two Legions, to compose there the differences arising, and restore the Kingdom to the</hi> Romans, <hi>which, by Dissentions, was much drawn from them.</hi> This must needs be meant of <hi>Junius Severus,</hi> for <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> was not Senatour but Emperour, when he entred <hi>Britain,</hi> and it was many years after the death of <hi>Lucius,</hi> and yet presently after, relating the same mans Actions, he adds, <hi>That he made a Wall between</hi> Deira <hi>and</hi> Albania, which can be meant of none but <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour.</p>

                  <p>I wonder that the <hi>British</hi> History, in making <hi>Severus</hi> a King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour of <hi>Lucius,</hi> does not give some Reason for it. If he had the Kingdom in Right of his first Wife <hi>Martia,</hi> Sister to <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> how comes it to pass that <hi>Fulgentius</hi> is not reckoned a <hi>British</hi> Prince, and a Rightful Inheritour of the Crown, which, if he had been created, it follows, dying in the Battle fought against <hi>Severus,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would devolve on <hi>Severus</hi> by the Womans side, according to the Old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact the <hi>British</hi> Histories makes mention of, between these Northern <hi>Picts</hi> and their Brethren, the <hi>Scots</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when they gave them Wives; <hi>That in case the Male Issue failed, the Heir of the Woman should inherit in the Kingdom of the</hi> Picts. So that <hi>Severus,</hi> holding by Right of his Wife, his Son <hi>Bassianus</hi> was lawful Inheritour, and the <hi>British</hi> Succession should have run thus, <hi>Lucius, Fulgentius, Severus,</hi> in Right of <hi>Martia, Bassianus, &amp;c.</hi> but of this more than enough.</p>

                  <head>THE British History.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Count Palatine</hi> maketh <hi>Bassianus</hi> King of <hi>Britain</hi> in Right of his Mother <hi>Martia,</hi> who, by the <hi>British</hi> Histories is said to be a Native of this Island, but <hi>Sabellicus</hi> taketh her to have been an <hi>African</hi> by Birth, but allowing her a <hi>Britain,</hi> how cometh it to pass that <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius,</hi> her Brother, is not accounted a King of this Island? For she could have no right to the Kingdom till his death, so that, if <hi>Fulgentius</hi> be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, his Sister <hi>Martia</hi> could create no Title either to <hi>Severus</hi> her Husband, or our present <hi>Bassianus,</hi> her Son.</p>
                  <p>He likewise saith, That <hi>Bassinus</hi> sent into <hi>Britain, Virius Lupus,</hi> to quell the <hi>Picts,</hi> who had entred the Island under <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> but what Authority he hath for it, I know not; The <hi>Roman</hi> Authors say, he was sent by <hi>Severus,</hi> and the <hi>British</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">Aurel. Victor. Sabellicus. Bede. Eutropius.</note> are silent of him, as to the daies of this Emperour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Moumouth</hi> with the like absurdity makes <hi>Carausius</hi> to be chosen King of <hi>Britain</hi> in the year 218, which is the last of this Emperours Reign, whereas his appearance in <hi>Britain</hi> was not till the year 284, as by true History is collected; Nevertheless the <hi>British</hi> Writers generally tell the story thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carausius</hi> being chosen King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and made Commander of the <hi>Picts,</hi> who, after the death of <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> wanted a Leader, presently makes Head against <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">An. Dom. <hi>284.</hi>
                     </note> and giveth him Battle; <hi>Bassianus</hi> had many <hi>Picts</hi> in his Army, but <hi>Carausius,</hi> a Man of a subtile Wit, by fair Promises had so won their affections that in the Fight they betrayed him, so that deserted by so great a part of his Forces, the rest were totally routed, and himself slain. <hi>Carausius,</hi> to gratifie the <hi>Picts,</hi> gave them the Countries in the South parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which joyns to <hi>England</hi> on the East Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as <hi>Mers, Louthean,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Bassianus,</hi> by the report of the <hi>British</hi> Writers, died in <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:58825:153"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CARAGALLA</hi> slain, <hi>MACRINUS,</hi> the contriver of his <note place="margin">An. Dom. 218.</note> death, was chosen, by the Army, Emperour, in whose daies, as likewise many of his Successours, we find no mention made in this our Island; whether it were, that the Empire declining apace, or, that good Authors grew scarce, or were lost, or, which is more probable, the former Princes being advanced by the heady Affection of the Souldiers, and as soon cast down again, had no time to atchieve great Matters so far off.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that for some years we are left in the dark, having a few fragments only lying scattered, here and there, which give just light enough to shew that <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> still continued a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, and had its <hi>Proproetors</hi> and <hi>Presidents.</hi> The <hi>British</hi> Histories themselves, as if they were only ill Comments on the <hi>Roman</hi> Records, and wanted breath where the other ceased, do now fall in pieces, leaving wide gaps, and <hi>Inter-regnums,</hi> for many years together, so that if we would, we could not piece up these Times with their Rags and Fables. And, were it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent to leave so great a breach in the midst of this History, many of the following Emperours might be spared. And indeed, I might easily have been induced to have omitted them, had not these Reasons moved me to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> By vertue of their being Emperours they were undoubted possessours of this Island, and so have a right to have their Names, at least Recorded, though some of them through their short continuance in Power, had no time to exercise it so far off; And this is all I intend to do, for I mean not to write of their Actions in <hi>Rome, Syria</hi> or <hi>Africa,</hi> or to make a History of the World (save only what I shall speak of their Original and Antiquity) when I intend only one of <hi>Britain.</hi> Nothing shall be Recorded but what hath some relation to our Island, and where no Circumstances tend to it, it shall be sufficient the Emperour is named, and the time of his Reign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Motive which swayeth me to proceed in the aforesaid method, is, the weight of Presidents that have written after this manner, and yet it is not absolutely necessary I should name them. Nay the <hi>British</hi> Histories themselves have all along, hitherto, made the presence of a King in <hi>Britain,</hi> and his being born here, a necessary qualification to his being King. Now we must take up with Kings in Right, and admit of <hi>Heliogabulus, Gordianus, Maximine, &amp;c.</hi> who never saw this Island to be their natural or rightful Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>And what can be said more for these Emperours which cannot be alleadged, for all the rest; for allowing <hi>Martia</hi> to have created a Title to <hi>Severus</hi> and his Sons, must <hi>Heliogabulus,</hi> the Bastard of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> be hookt in upon the same score, and must <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> be created another of his Bastards, or else have no Right to the Kingdom? most excellent! But, by what Right is his Murtherer <hi>Maximine</hi> admitted King? <hi>Because,</hi> saith <hi>Basingstoke, BELIN, a</hi> British <hi>God undertook the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Count Palat.</note> 
                     <hi>Revenge.</hi> Was ever Title so plainly demonstrated? Then follows <hi>Gordian,</hi> who is lawful King of <hi>Britain,</hi> because he was Father of <hi>Claudius,</hi> from whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Constantine,</hi> who had Right by his Wife <hi>Helena;</hi> so that we see the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son gives Title to the Grand-father, a Tenure able to puzzle the ablest Lawyers we have now in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:58825:153"/>
                  <p>If this were sufficient to make a lawful King of <hi>Eritain,</hi> we need not fear, even in their sence, to hook-in the most obstinate and perversest Emperour imaginable, so that the maintainers of that History, have no reason to find fault with the Method designed.</p>
                  <p>And as for those who are only for the <hi>Romans,</hi> I hope they will not account it impertinent, and besides the purpose, to give a short account, if it were no more, of the Emperours of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     <p>When he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he introduced that barbarous Custome (in the honour of this God) of sacrificing of Infants, and Children, looking into their Intrails to foretel future Events, a Custome for which the <hi>Britains</hi> in former time were so much accused, and, which I mention, to shew, That the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Worship, by such horrid Sacrifices, was yet continued in the World, and, in all probability, might be the Original of the same Custome in <hi>Britain,</hi> brought hither when the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were most conversant in the Island, as I have shewn in the Antiquities of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>He was the most vicious Prince of all, that either went before him, or came after him, and in his daies were acted over the Vices of the whole Empire for many Ages.</p>

                     <p>We find that the Senate, met together in the Temple of <hi>Concord,</hi> and used many of those Acclamations to him and the Gods, which I have taken notice of in the Life of <hi>Commodus,</hi> and are too tedious here to be repeated.</p>

                     <p>From the circumstances of this story is collected, that the <hi>British</hi> God <hi>BELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS</hi> was the same with <hi>APOLLO,</hi> or the <hi>SUN,</hi> and was the <hi>Bel</hi> or <hi>Baal</hi> of the <hi>Phanicians,</hi> from whence the latter part of <hi>Eligabal,</hi> the Emperours name is derived.</p>

                        <hi>PHILIP,</hi> by treachery and disloyalty to his Soveraign, having ascended the Throne, proved a better Prince than Subject. By <note place="margin">An.

But such was the earnest desire, even in those Primitive times, of gaining mighty <hi>Prelates</hi> to the Church, that the comfortable part of the Gospel, <hi>Forgiveness of Sins,</hi> was used as a Bait only to draw them in, being drest up in fashion and formality, light and trivial Ceremonies, which had a shew of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, whilest the weightier parts of the Law, without which the other availeth nothing, were either neglected or dissembled.</p>
                     <p>Against this <hi>Philip,</hi> first <hi>Marinus</hi> set himself up Emperour, but he failing, <hi>Decius</hi> was advanced by the Souldiers, whom, whilest <hi>Philip</hi> sought to reduce, was himself slain by his own Army, and his Head cut off by the Teeth.

                     <head>THE British Writers CONCERNING CLAUDIUS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CLAUDIUS,</hi> by our Writers, is allowed a lawful King of this Island, for from the daies of <hi>Gordian,</hi> which are twenty four years, our home-spun Histories make an <hi>Inter-regnum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>GORDIAN</hi> was allowed King as being the Father of this <hi>Claudius,</hi> for (as I said before) by the Law of the <hi>British</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, the Right of Inheritance ascends, and even Grandfathers hold their Kingdoms by the title of their Grand-children. Let us see therefore, by what Right <hi>Claudius</hi> is accounted King; We have heard before, that one of his Titles to the Crown, was, that from his Line descended <hi>Constantius,</hi> who held it in right of his Wife <hi>Helena,</hi> a <hi>British</hi> Woman, and so sent the Title up to his Ancestour, the present <hi>Claudius.</hi> The Genealogy runs thus; <hi>Claudius</hi> had two Brothers, <hi>Quinctilius</hi> and <hi>Crispus. Claudius</hi> and <hi>Quinctilius</hi> dying without Issue, <hi>Crispus</hi> had a Daughter named <hi>Claudia,</hi> who marrying <hi>Eutropius</hi> was the Mother of <hi>Constantius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now I shall shew his other Title by which he claims, gathered out of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Histories. <hi>Pollio,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Writer, in the Life of <hi>Claudius</hi> hath these words: <hi>He seemeth to draw his Original from</hi> Dalmatia, <hi>although others say he was a</hi> Dardanian <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pollio.</hi> Not. 22. adl. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>by Birth, descended of the</hi> Trojans <hi>in</hi> Ilium, <hi>and of the Blood of</hi> Dardanus <hi>himself;</hi> thus far <hi>Pollio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And can we think that the <hi>British</hi> Writers will slip so fair an occasion of making another <hi>Trojan</hi> Prince in this Island? No certainly; hear therefore I pray <hi>Basing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoke: There is a wonderful and secret power of Nature</hi> (saith he) <hi>whereby the</hi> Trojan <hi>Original of the</hi> Britains, <hi>despised by so many, and slighted by</hi> Julius Caesar, <hi>is still brought to the Empire, as is manifest in</hi> Severus <hi>his marriage with</hi> Martia, <hi>and</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius <hi>taking</hi> Helena <hi>to Wife, which</hi> Constantius <hi>descended of</hi> Claudius, <hi>who was of</hi> Trojan <hi>Race.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we see the Kingdom of <hi>Brute,</hi> by the wonderful working of Nature, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again to the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and that it may not be done without an Oracle, take this story out of <hi>Pollio,</hi> which for the worthiness of it, I set down among the <hi>British</hi> Histories.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Claudius</hi> being well setled in the Empire, required of the Gods how long he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Britain,</hi> bred up a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and his Mother a <hi>Gaulish</hi> Woman, together with <hi>Proculus,</hi> usurped the Empire, claiming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self all <hi>Britain, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Gallia-Bracchata.</hi> Through many Military employments, from a low beginning, by degrees, he ascended to high Command.</p>
                     <p>He was an exceeding great Drinker, insomuch that <hi>Aurelian</hi> would often say of him, <hi>That he was born, Non ut vivat, sed ut bibat, not to live, but bib.</hi> But the same Vmperour found means to employ him, and held him up in some quality, as a very considerable and useful person, for when the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> those drinking Nations, sent their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, Who was so fit to undertake them as <hi>Bonosus?</hi> For besides that he had vast stowage for his Liquor, and so well hoopt, as <hi>Vopiscus</hi> saith, the Wine lost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in running through him. He had another most excellent qualification, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Vopiscus vit.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, an <hi>Observing Drinker,</hi> holding his Reason sound and secure, though besieged round with Glasses, so that seeming to be disquieted, when (indeed) he was not, he proved the more dangerous, by how much the less he was suspected in effect. He was used as a <hi>Spy</hi> by <hi>Aurelian,</hi> by whose procurement also he married a <hi>Gothish</hi> Lady of Royal Blood, that by so near allyance with that Nation, he might be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to sift out Intelligence.</p>
                     <p>Being for these great endowments advanced to Command over the <hi>German</hi> Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the <hi>Rhine,</hi> through Treachery (as was thought) he willingly suffered them to be burnt, or, if through his Negligence they miscarried, not daring to stand his Trial, but relying on his power with the Western Army, he joyned himself with <hi>Proculus,</hi> and seizing the Provinces of <hi>Spain, Britain</hi> and part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> bore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self up a while for Emperour; The <hi>Germans,</hi> at the news of <hi>Probus's</hi> advancing against him (looking it seems on <hi>Bonosus</hi> as a better Companion than a Prince) deserted him, who after a long and bloody Fight at <hi>Cullen,</hi> being at last vanquisht, hanged himself, and so gave occasion of a ready Jest, <hi>Here hangs a Tankard, not a Man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, another Commotion arose in <hi>Britain,</hi> through the practices of one whom <hi>Probus</hi> himself, by the entreaty of <hi>Victorinus</hi> a <hi>Moore,</hi> had placed here in office <note place="margin">Camb. <hi>Brit.</hi>
                        </note> and trust, his name is not recorded, but he is supposed to be that <hi>Cornelius Lelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> whose Coyns are found in this Island, and no where else.</p>
                     <p>These Tumults were suddenly appeased, for <hi>Victorinus</hi> being upbraided by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> for commending a man to him so treacherous and disloyal, obtained leave for <hi>Britain,</hi> where, at his Arrival, feigning he had escaped from the Emperour, he was kindly received, and not long after, procured means by night to dispatch the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, by which the Province was quieted, and the <hi>Moore</hi> returned to <hi>Probus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the same Action given testimony of a severe Loyalty, and a persidious Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                     <p>About this time, <hi>Probus</hi> (having subdued the <hi>Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> in a great Battle) sent many of them into <hi>Britain,</hi> where they afterwards did great service to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as often as any new Commotions or Insurrections happened in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, and the <hi>Britains</hi> themselves, for some good Services, were, by him, permitted to plant Vines and make Wine.</p>

                     <p>About this time lived <hi>Carausius,</hi> a <hi>Menapian</hi> born, but whether of those <hi>Menapii</hi> that inhabited <hi>Germany,</hi> about <hi>Juliers</hi> and <hi>Trevers,</hi> or of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napii</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> about <hi>Wexford,</hi> is uncertain, but it may best seem of the latter rather, for <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> calleth him a Citizen of <hi>Menapia,</hi> and the City <hi>Menapia</hi> is placed, by Geographers, not in those Low Countries of <hi>Germany,</hi> but in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Certain it <note place="margin">Aur.

Oftentimes he would suffer these Rovers to seize the Goods and Ships of Merchants, and in their return, laden with spoil and booty, would set upon them and retake them,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:58825:160"/>
but neither restoring the Goods to the Owner, nor accounting to the Publick, he proved the grievance of the two.</p>
                     <p>But it happened that this Trade failing, the Pirates dreading his Power, and the Merchants not trusting to his protection, now no longer used Dissimulation, but seized the Merchants himself, and suffered the Pirates to pass under Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Carausius</hi> having intelligence of these things, and finding himself too great a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal to be less than an Emperour, took upon him immediately the Imperial Robe, seizes <hi>Britain,</hi> withdraws his Fleet from the defence of the <hi>Belgick</hi> and <hi>Gaulish</hi> Shoars, builds other Ships after the <hi>Roman</hi> fashion, and secures to himself the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Legion, here lying in Garrison, keeping out the Companies of Forreign Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. The Merchants and Factors of <hi>Gallia</hi> he listed, and put a Garrison into <hi>Bullen,</hi> the publick Revenues of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Belgium</hi> he converted to his own use, and by the Spoils of whole Provinces allured many barbarous Nations, the <hi>Franks</hi> especially, to side with them. These he trained to Sea-service, and was now grown so powerful that all Coasts were dangerous, and no passage left safe for the <hi>Romans</hi> to assail him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximian,</hi> by this time was set forward with a mighty Army, but when he came to the Sea-side, partly discouraged for want of Sea-men, and partly affrighted with the <hi>British</hi> Fleet that covered the <hi>Ocean,</hi> he made a stop, and sending to <hi>Carausius</hi> concluded a Peace with him, yielding to him the Government and Rule of the Island, as one who was best able to defend it from the Invasions and inroads of the Northern Nations; Hence it is, that in the silver Coyns of <hi>Carausius</hi> this League and Amity is signified on the stamp, being Portraitures of two Emperours joyning hands, with this Inscription,</p>
                     <q>CONCORDIA AUGG.</q>
                     <p>This Peace made by constraint, not choice, <hi>Maximian</hi> revenges upon the <hi>Franks,</hi> who had secretly, and under-hand sent assistance to <hi>Carausius,</hi> insomuch that coming upon them suddenly, he makes great slaughter of them, and brings them to a total subjection. But <hi>Carausius</hi> obtaining the Kingdom thus by force, and governing it with uncorrupt and unstained Reputation, nothing was wanting to the substance and magnificence of a peaceful Reign.</p>
                     <p>To stop the Inroads of barbarous Nations, he rebuilds the Wall between the mouths of <hi>Cluda</hi> and <hi>Carunus</hi> (supposed in the same place where <hi>Severus</hi> had built his) and fortified the same with seven Castles; Upon the River <hi>Carun</hi> he erected a round House of polished Stone, which River (as <hi>Minutius</hi> writes) took name of <note place="margin">Ninius.</note> him, and withal, a Triumphal Arch, in remembrance of some Victory there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>And now it was that <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> as well to preserve what they had won, as to regain what was lost, chose to themselves two <hi>Casars, Constantius Clorus</hi> and <hi>Galerius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CONSTANTIUS</hi> having got together an Army, with speedy Marches went upon <hi>Bullen</hi> unawares, where <hi>Carausius</hi> had put a strong Garrison, and beleagured it round about; The mouth of the Haven he blockt up, by driving in huge Piles of Wood into the bottom, and ramming in great Stones between, one upon another in nature of a Mould, which was so strongly wrought, that the Sea for many daies beating upon it, could not break or beat it down, and as no Relief could be sent in by <hi>Carausius,</hi> the Town was taken. But what is most observable, the very next Tide after the Surrender, made such a breach into the Rampire, that it was wholly disjoyned and broken asunder.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Carausius</hi> was treacherously slain by <hi>Alectus,</hi> one who was in special favour and trust under him, after he had Reigned seven years, as some say, with great Justice and Moderation; as others report, with Tyranny and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:58825:160"/>
                     <p>And now <hi>Constantius</hi> was wholly taken up in his Preparations (for the recovery of <hi>Britain</hi>) Rigging, and setting out his Fleet, and storing his Ships with Men and Arms, which done, he divides his Navy into several Squadrons, and at one time sets out from divers Ports.</p>
                     <p>This so amazed <hi>Alectus,</hi> who knew not where to find him, that void of Counsel, and not knowing which way to turn himself, he at last perceived, and never before, that he was enclosed by the Ocean rather than defended by it.</p>
                     <p>The Weather was foul, and the Sea so overcast with Clouds and Mists, that <hi>Constantius</hi> with his Navy passed undiscerned of the <hi>British</hi> Fleet, which lay scouting near the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to intercept his passage. Being got a shoar, the first thing he did, was, the burning his own Ships, that his Souldiers might have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in any refuge but Victory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alectus</hi> (receiving Intelligence of his Landing) sorsook the Sea, and in great haste marched into the Province, but before he could gather his strength together, he was met by a Party of the <hi>Romans,</hi> Commanded by <hi>Asclepiodotus,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Pratorian</hi> Bands; Grown desperate now, and impatient of delay, not heeding the ordering of his Men, or bringing them all to fight, he first flung off his Purple Robe that he might not be known, and then rushing suriously into the Battle (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only with the Accessories of his Treason, and his Outlandish Hirelings) was slain in a Tumultuary skirmish, and his body at last, by the discovery of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Souldier, was sound among the rest of the dead Carkasses.</p>
                     <p>They who escaped the Battle hastned to <hi>London,</hi> intending with the Pillage of that City to escape by Sea, but it so happened, that another Party of <hi>Constantius</hi> his Army, by the thick Mist at Sea, severed from the rest of their body, took their way directly to that City, and arrived just in the nick of time to relieve it. And now great slaughter was made of the <hi>Franks</hi> through all the Streets, and the Citizens not only received safety by the overthrow of their Enemies, but had the pleasure in beholding their deliverance.</p>
                     <p>At that time it was, as our Chronicles record, that <hi>Lucius Gallus</hi> was slain, by a little Brook which ran almost from the middle of the City, and of him was called <note place="margin">Cambd. <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobantes.</hi>

                        <p>WHEN the compass of the whole World <hi>(Most Victorious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour)</hi>  by your Princely Conduct was recovered, not the <hi>Roman</hi> World only (that is) the Ancient bounds and limits of the Empire, but new Nations subdued, and the Borders brought into Obedience; when <hi>Germany</hi> had been so often vanquisht, and <hi>Sarmatia</hi> discomfited, when the <hi>Vitungi, Quadi</hi> and <hi>Carpi,</hi> were driven to flight, and the <hi>Goth</hi> himself submitted, when the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> by Gifts and Presents, sought his peace, there was one thing still left behind, and wanting to the compleating of the whole, which we will not stick to confess, sorely grieved us, and seemed the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful and intolerable, for that, as it were in despite of so mighty an Empire and Government, it still held out, and suffered not the full accomplishment of your perfect Renown and Glory. For as the name of <hi>BRITAIN</hi> is but one, so the loss of it, to the Common-wealth, ought not to be esteemed small and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, a Land so plentiful of Corn, and rich in Pasture, so full of Mines and veins of Mettal, so gainful in Tributes and Revenues, so accommodated with Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and of Circuit so large and spacious, insomuch that <hi>CAESAR,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner of your Royal Dignity, and the first discoverer of that Island, thought he had found a NEW WORLD, supposing it of so vast an extent, that it could not be environed by the Sea, but rather that it encompassed the Ocean it self.</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>Britain,</hi> at that time, was not furnished with Ships of War, nor the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves at first, but soon after the Wars of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and through their frequent Engagements with the Pirates, and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> they were grown as skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at Sea as Land.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>British</hi> Nation even in those daies was accustomed only to the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> Fnemies like themselves, half naked, and not acquainted with Armour, so that for the want of knowledge therein, they were not able to withstand the <hi>Roman</hi> force, and the only Glory <hi>Caesar</hi> gained in his Expeditions, was, that he had passed the Ocean.</p>

The Merchants and Factours of <hi>Gallia</hi> were Listed in abundance, and no small number of barbarous Nations, invited by the Spoil of the Provinces, were procured to their assistance, all trained to Sea-service, by the diligent instructions of the Rebels, the first attempters of this mischievous practice. And, though our Armies in Strength and Courage were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, yet, as to Sea Affairs, they were raw and unexperienced, insomuch that this War was noised about, as likely to continue long and troublesome, and although we hoped well of the Success, yet the fame of the Rebels Advantages sounded in the ears of all.</p>
                        <p>And what added Courage to their side, was, the long impunity they had enjoyed in their wicked practices, their minds were puffed up, with Presumption, and their former despair heartened into Boldness and Insolence.

                        <p>This War then being both so necessary in the undertaking, so difficult in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and on the Enemies part grown to such a stubborn and stiff management, by the pride of their great Provisions, you (most Noble Emperour) did so take in hand, that so soon as you bent the terrible Force of your Imperial Majesty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, it presently was the Judgment of all, that the Enterprize was already performed.</p>
                        <p>For first of all, by intercession made to your Majesty, it was provided before hand, that the barbarous Nations (a thing chiefly to be fore-seen) by the absence of your divine Power, should not take advantage to raise new Troubles, for You your self in Person, You (I say) Mighty Lord, <hi>Maximian,</hi> Eternal Emperour, vouchsafed to advance the coming of Your divine Excellence by the speediest way that might be, which to your wisdom was not unknown.</p>
                        <p>You therefore suddenly came to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and not with an Army of Horse and Foot, but with the terrour of your Presence did preserve and defend that Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teir; For <hi>Maximian</hi> being once upon the River, countervailed the greatest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that could be produced, for you (most Invincible Emperour) furnishing and arming divers Fleets, made the Enemy so uncertain of his own proceedings, and void of Counsel, that then at length he might perceive that he was not defended, but rather kept Prisoner by the Ocean.</p>
                        <p>And here I must call to mind, how delightful and easie was the good fortune of former Princes, who ruled the Common-wealth with Praise, who although sitting at <hi>Rome</hi> themselves, yet had the Triumphs and Sir-names of such Nations given them, as their Captains subdued. <hi>Fronto</hi> therefore, not second to any, but in the first rank of <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence, yielded to <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour the Glory of finishing the <hi>British</hi> Wars, although he sitting at home in his Palace in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> had committed the Conduct and success of that Affair to the management of his Captains, for he confesseth, <hi>That the Emperour guiding, as it were, the Helm of the Ship, deserved the Honour of the whole course.</hi>

                           </note> (most Invincible Emperour) though your Imperial Dignity required no more, have not been only Director of this War, both by Sea and Land, but a present Actor and Engager therein, and by Your Personal Example and Resolution, the Victory was wholly atchieved; For so soon as you embarked at <hi>Sluice,</hi> you imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately infused Life and Spirit into their hearts, who as yet had not ventured to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:58825:162"/>
sail out of the River <hi>Saine,</hi> insomuch that those Captains who lay lingring in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Calmer Seas, and fair Weather, now cried to have the Sails hoised up, the Anchors weighed, and were impatient in prosecuting their Voyage, despising all tokens that seemed to fore-bode their Ruine, and so in a Rainy and tempestuous day, with a cross Wind, they set out.</p>
                        <p>But what was he that feared to commit himself to Sea, were the same never so unquiet? when you were once under sail and set forward, one voice and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was among them all (as is reported) when they heard you launched forth; <hi>What do we doubt? Why do we stay? He is now loosed from Land, He is forward in his way, and perhaps is already got over; All hands to work, we will thorough, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the dangers at Sea, yet, what Dangers are to be feared since we follow the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither did the opinion of your good Fortune deceive them, for as by their Report we understand, at that very time there fell such a thick Mist and Fogg upon the Seas, that the Enemies Navy scouting about the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> lost their expectations, and your Ships passed unseen; Neither did the Rebels keep the Seas, although not able to resist you at Land.</p>
                        <p>But now, that the same invincible Army, fighting under your Ensigns and Name, immediately on its landing, set fire to its own Ships, what induced them to it but only the perswasion of your Divine assistance? or, what other Reason prevailed with them to leave no Refuge (if need were) for flight, nor to fear the doubtful chance of War, seeing that in Battle, good and ill successes have their Common lots, but that by contemplation of your former Fortune, they certainly concluded what would follow, and were fully assured of Victory to be obtained. There were no sufficient Forces at that present with them, no mighty or puissant strength of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but they had only the consideration of that unspeakable Fortune and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, which was derived to You from the Heavens above. For whensoever Battle is offered, to make full account of Victory before-hand, dependeth not on the Courage and assurance of the Souldiers, but the extraordinary felicity of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                        <p>But, what meant the Ring-leader of that lawless Faction to quit the shoars which he possessed? Why did he forsake both his Fleet and the Haven? But that (Most Invincible Emperour) he stood in fear of your coming, whose Sails he beheld ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to wards him, and therefore whatever happened, he chose rather to try his Fortune with your Captains, than endure the force of your Highness presence. Ah mad man! That understood not, that whithersoever he fled, the power of your Divine Majesty was present, and in all places where your Countenance and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are had in reverence. He fled indeed from your presence, and fell into the hands of your People, of You was he overcome, of your Armies was he opprest.</p>
                        <p>To be short, he was brought into such Terrour, that continually looking behind him, as it were fearing you at his back, like one out of his wits, and amazed, he knew not which way to turn him, he was hurried to his destruction, neither or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Men to battle, nor Marshalling such power as he had about him, of the Old Abettors only of that Conspiracy, and the barbarous Hirelings, like one forgetful of those great Preparations he had made, he ran headlong to his ruine.</p>
                        <p>And in your felicity (most Noble Emperour) the Common-wealth had this good fortune included, that though the Victory was gained in behalf of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, yet scarce a <hi>Roman</hi> perished in the obtaining it; For, as I hear, those Hills and Vallies were covered with none but the Carkasses of Rebels, all that were found, were either of the barbarous Nations, or drest up in their counterfeit shapes and Apparel, glistering with their long yellow Hairs, but now with wounds, gashes and blood, deformed, lying in sundry postures, as the pangs of death surprized them, and as they drew in their maimed limbs and mangled parts.</p>
                        <p>Among these, the chief Ring-leader of the Thieves was found, who had cast off those Robes which in his life time he had usurped and dishonoured, being scarcely covered with one piece of Apparel whereby he might be known, so near were his words likely to prove true which he uttered before his death, <hi>That he would not have it known how he died.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:58825:162"/>
                        <p>Thus (<hi>Most Invincible Emperour</hi>) so great a Victory was appointed to You (by the consent of the immortal Gods) over all the Enemies you assailed, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Franks,</hi> for those your Souldiers also which as before I have said, held not their right Course by reason of the Mist at Sea, were now come to the City of <hi>London,</hi> where they made great slaughter (through all the Streets) of those Outlandish Hirelings, who having escaped the Battle, intended, with the Pillage of that City, to secure themselves by flight; But now, being thus slain by your Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Subjects of your Province were rescued from further danger, and took pleasure in the execution of their Enemies. O, what a manifest Victory was this, worthy of innumerable Triumphs! by which Victory <hi>Britain</hi> is restored to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by which Victory the Nation of the <hi>Franks</hi> is utterly destroyed, and by which many other Nations, found Accessories in that impious Conspiracy, are reduced to Obedience; To conclude, the Seas are cleared, and brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual quiet and security. Glory You therefore (<hi>Most Invincible Emperour</hi>) for that you have as it were got another WORLD, and in restoring to the <hi>Roman</hi> Greatness the glory of the SEA Conquest, have added to the Empire an Element greater than the Earth, to wit, the <hi>Main Ocean.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You have put an end to that War (<hi>Invincible Emperour</hi>) that seemed to threaten all Provinces, and might have spread abroad, and burst out in a flame as wide as the Ocean extendeth, or the Mediterranean Gulf doth reach. Neither are we igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, although through fear of You that Infection spread through the bowels of <hi>Britain</hi> only, and proceeded no farther, with what rage it might have advanced it self elsewhere, if it could have been assured of means to have ranged abroad so far as it desired; for it was bounded in by no border of Mountain or River, which by Garrisons appointed, may be guarded and defended, but was as free as the Ships themselves, and might (notwithstanding we have your Valour and Fortune to relieve us) be continually at our elbows to affright us, so far as either Sea reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or Wind bloweth.</p>
                        <p>For that incredible boldness, and undeserved success of a few silly Captive <hi>Franks,</hi> in the daies of <hi>PROBUS</hi> the Emperour came to our remembrance, who, conveying away certain Vessels from the Coast of <hi>Pontus,</hi> wasted both <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and not without great hurt and damage coasting upon <hi>Lybia,</hi> at length took the City <hi>Saragose</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> (a Port-Town, in times past, highly renowned for Victories at Sea) and afterwards passing the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> came into the Ocean, and so with the Fortunate success of many rash and presumptuous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, plainly shewed, that nothing can be safe from the desperate boldness of Pirates, wherever Ships can touch and have success.</p>
                        <p>So therefore, by this Your Victory, not <hi>Britain</hi> alone is delivered from Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, but to all Nations safety is restored, which might, by the use of the Seas, come to as great Perils in time of War, as to gain of Commodities in time of Peace.</p>
                        <p>Now <hi>Spain</hi> (to pass over the Coast of <hi>Gallia</hi>) with her shoars almost in sight, is in security; Now <hi>Italy,</hi> now <hi>Africk,</hi> now all Nations, even to the Fens of <hi>Maeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> are void of perpetual Cares; neither are they less joyful, the fear of Danger being taken away, which to feel, as yet, necessity had not brought them, but they rejoyce so much the more for this, that by the direction of Your providence, and the powerful concurrence of Your fortune, so great a combination of Sea-men is broken, their quarters beat up, and <hi>Britain</hi> it self, which had given harbour and protection to so long a Conspiracy, was made sensible at last of your Victory, by her restitution to peace and quietness.</p>
                        <p>Not without good cause therefore, immediately when You her long wished Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger and Deliverer was arrived, Your Majesty was met with great Triumph, and the <hi>Britains,</hi> full of unspeakable Joy, ran forth and presented themselves before you, with their Wives and Children, adoring not only your self, whom they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed as one descended from Heaven, but even the sails and tacklings of that Ship which had brought your Divine Presence on their Shoars; And, as soon as You had set foot on Land, they were ready to prostrate themselves before you, that you might, as it were, walk over the Necks of them, who desired you above all things to do it.</p>
                        <pb n="310" facs="tcp:58825:163"/>
                        <p>Nor was it a wonder they were so Joyful, seeing, after their miserable Captivity, so many years continued, after so long abusing their Wives, and the enslaving of their Children, at length were they reitored to Liberty, at length made <hi>Romans,</hi> at length refreshed with the true light of the Imperial Rule and Government. For besides the same of your Clemency and Goodness, which was sounded forth by all Nations, in Your Countenance (<hi>Caesar</hi>) they visibly read the Characters of all Vertues, in your Face <hi>Gravity,</hi> in your Eyes <hi>Mildness,</hi> in your Ruddy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion <hi>Bashfulness,</hi> in your words <hi>Justice;</hi> all which things, as by Regard they acknowledged, so with shouts of Joy they signified aloud; To You they bound themselves by Vow, to You they bound their Children, yea, and to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren they devoted all the posterity of their Race and Off-spring.</p>
                        <p>We truly (O perpetual Parents, and Lords of Mankind!) implore this of the Immortal Gods, with most earnest supplication, and hearty prayer, <hi>That our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth doth now intirely possess, in Peace and Union, whatever formerly, at sundry times, and in scattered parcels belonged to it, and that huge and vast Power, which with its own burthen was sunk and riven asunder, is now again closely compacted and joyned together, by the sure ligaments of the Imperial Government. For there is no part of the Earth, or Region under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but is either quieted by <hi>Fear,</hi> subdued by <hi>Force,</hi> or else won by <hi>Clemency;</hi> Is there any thing else remaining behind, to which the power and ambition of Man can extend, beyond the Ocean, what is there more than <hi>Britain?</hi> which is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by You, that those Nations also adjoyning to it are subject to your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. There is no occasion to invite you further, except the ends of the Ocean, which Nature forbiddeth, should be sought for.</p>
                        <p>All is Yours (<hi>Most Invincible Princes</hi>) that is accounted worthy of you, hence it proceedeth that you may equally provide for all, since all is in your Majesties possession. And therefore, as heretofore (<hi>Most Excellent Emperour</hi> DIOCLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIAN) by Your appointment <hi>Asia</hi> supplied the Desert places of <hi>Thracia,</hi> with Inhabitants transplanted thither, as afterwards (<hi>Most Excellent Emperour</hi> MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIAN) by Your orders, the <hi>Franks</hi> at length brought to a pleasant subjection, and reduced to Laws, have Peopled and manured the empty possessions of the <hi>Nervians,</hi> and the Neighbourhood of <hi>Trier,</hi> so now by your Victories (<hi>Invincible Constantius Caesar</hi>) whatsoever lay vacant about <hi>Amiens, Beavois, Trois,</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres,</hi> begins to flourish with Inhabitants of sundry Nations; Moreover Your most loyal City of <hi>Autun,</hi> for whose sake I have a peculiar cause to rejoyce, by means of this glorious Victory in <hi>Britain,</hi> hath received many and divers Artificers, of whom these Provinces abounded, and now, by their Workmanship, the same City riseth up, by repairing her ancient Houses, and restoring her publick Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Temples, so that now she accounteth her Ancient and friendly Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Rome</hi> renewed with advantage, and that she hath, You, for her Founder.</p>

                     <p>The subduing of these Rebels was esteemed a Victory, in which the power and strength of the whole Empire was engaged, and that action of <hi>Constantius,</hi> in firing of his Ships at his landing, plainly shewed, that he reckoned himself fighting for the last stake.</p>
                     <p>So much Masters of the Seas were the <hi>British</hi> Fleets in those daies, that the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ascribes to the Emperours in having reduced this Island, no less than the glory of having added the whole Ocean to the Empire, and by the Example of the <hi>Franks,</hi> a few inconsiderable Pirates at first, who from <hi>Pontus,</hi> within the <hi>Bosphor,</hi> went on in pillaging and sacking of Towns and Cities, till they passed the Streights of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar,</hi> and entred the main Ocean; He evidently shews, that to command the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of greater extent than to be Lord of all Nations besides, and that Land-Territory is but a slug in comparison of the quick and active Power of Sea Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>But that which more nearly relates to our present purpose, is, that we find in this <hi>Panegyrick</hi> the first mention of the <hi>Picts,</hi> a Nation of whose Original there is great dispute. The Oratour here, seemeth to make them Inhabitants of the North of this Island, even in the daies of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> where he saith, <hi>That at the arrival of</hi> Caesar <hi>in</hi> Britain, <hi>the</hi> Britains <hi>were only acquainted with their Neighbours the</hi> Irish <hi>and</hi> Picts.</p>
                     <p>Hence it may be supposed, the Authors of the <hi>British</hi> History took occasion ever since his daies to make use of that Nation in all their Relations of the North, and to fetch them from <hi>Scythia,</hi> or <hi>Scandia,</hi> but this cannot be gathered out of the <hi>Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick;</hi> For the Oratour (by a usual Figure in such cases) by the <hi>Picts,</hi> meaneth no more than the Northern <hi>Britains,</hi> who, about his daies, were named <hi>Picts,</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to those <hi>Britains</hi> who were civiliz'd, and lived within the <hi>Roman</hi> Pale; for after the <hi>Romans</hi> had conquered this Island, those Natives who could not be brought to subjection, but strugled continually for their Liberty, at last, by the growing Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> were constrained to take into the North, as a place of better security, full of rough and rugged Passages, desended by barren and crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy Mountains, and hemm'd in with Washes and standing Mires, for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and upon the same occasions, that the more civilized <hi>Britains</hi> upon the Invasion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> possessed that part of the Island now called <hi>Wales.</hi> And with this agreeth the Testimony of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> when he saith, <hi>That Enemies of the</hi> Romans <hi>were, by</hi> Agricola, <hi>driven into the North, as it were, into another Island,</hi> that is, within the <note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> Friths of <hi>Edinborough</hi> and <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> and none doubteth but they were <hi>Britains</hi>
                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:58825:164"/>
that inhabited those remotest parts of the Island. For can we imagine that all those <hi>Britains,</hi> Enemies to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which brought out thirty thousand Armed Men into the field against <hi>Agricola,</hi> who gave unto <hi>Severus</hi> such great Overthrows that he lost seventy thousand in one Expedition, were pull'd up every Mothers Son, and none left for seed and procreation, that they might make room only for Forreigners out of <hi>Scythia</hi> and <hi>Thrace?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that the <hi>Picts</hi> were nothing but the remnant of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and of the same Nation, Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> proveth by their <hi>Demeanour, Name,</hi> and <hi>Language.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, Both Nations, the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains,</hi> made no distinction of Sex in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <note place="margin">Camb. <hi>Brit.</hi>
                        </note> they were both alike painted; the whole Island in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, and in these latter Emperours, that part only which were uncivilized, retained that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Custome; besides, we have the Authority of all <hi>Roman</hi> Writers for this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>For, those Barbarous People, that from the Forrest of <hi>Caledonia,</hi> and furthest Tracts in the North, made Incursions on the <hi>Romans,</hi> are (by <hi>Tacitus</hi>) called by no <note place="margin">Tacitus. Dio Cass. Herod. Vopisc. &amp; <hi>al.</hi>
                        </note> other name than <hi>Britains;</hi> and After-writers, as <hi>Dio. Cassius, Herodian, Vopiscus,</hi> and others, name them <hi>Britains,</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> of <hi>Caledonia.</hi> Certainly, had these Authors known of such a Nation as <hi>Picts,</hi> they would not have been silent therein, especially if they had done such wonders as are ascribed to Them by our late Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. Neither would those <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who warred fortunately against them, to wit, <hi>Commodus, Severus,</hi> with <hi>Bassianus</hi> and <hi>Geta</hi> his Sons, have assumed the Title of <hi>BRITANNICUS,</hi> unless those they had conquered had been <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> Surely the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose chief Magnificence consisted in subduing strange and unknown Nations, if they had conquered any such People as these, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have assumed the Sirname of <hi>Pictus,</hi> and used it in their Coyns and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions.</p>
                     <p>Besides, the very Name of <hi>PICTS</hi> proveth what Nation they were of, and by whom so called; For when the <hi>Roman</hi> Language had obtained in the Southern parts of this Island, they called those <hi>Britains</hi> that lived North, and retained the Custome of Painting, <hi>PICTI,</hi> a <hi>Painted-People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is it material what <hi>Basingstoak</hi> writes of them out of <hi>Humph. Lloyd,</hi> namely, that they were called <hi>Picthi,</hi> not <hi>Picti,</hi> seeing that it is usual in the <hi>British</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Basingstoak, <hi>Not. 14. ad. 1. 5.</hi>
                        </note> Language, as well as other Northern Dialects, to abound in the Letter <hi>H,</hi> neither is the change from <hi>Picti</hi> in the Latin, to <hi>Picthi,</hi> or Picths in the <hi>British,</hi> so great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation, as from <hi>Picths,</hi> to call them <hi>Pehits</hi> and <hi>Peohtas,</hi> and their Language <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiade,</hi> as other Dialects do; as for what the same Writer produceth, that in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Panegyrick</hi> they were called <hi>Pictones,</hi> not <hi>Picti,</hi> is a mistake, for by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Coppyer, <hi>Pictonum</hi> was foisted instead of <hi>Pictorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the concordance of the Language of the <hi>Picts</hi> with that of the <hi>Britains,</hi> they that desire to be satisfied, may read Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> on that subject, neither doth the Authority of venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> in any wise, make against this Opinion, where he saith, <hi>That the Nation of the</hi> Picts <hi>came in Long Ships, and those not many, out of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Bede.</note> Scythia (<hi>as the Report goeth</hi>) <hi>into</hi> Ireland; for this might be many years after the death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and was most probable in the time of these Emperours, when the northern Nations of <hi>Scandia</hi> swarmed in these Seas, but that they brought the name of <hi>Picts</hi> with them, for the aforesaid Reasons, is improbable, but it rather seemeth, that Landing in the north of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and mixing with those Barbarous Nations there inhabiting, called <hi>Picts,</hi> they received their Name, whose <hi>Customes, Laws, Language,</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> they had espoused; So that whether they were (as <hi>Hector Boctius</hi> saith) derived from the <hi>Agathersi,</hi> or as <hi>Pomponius,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hect. Boet. Pompo. Latus, &amp; Avent.</note> 
                        <hi>Laetus,</hi> and <hi>Aventinus,</hi> and others, will have it from the <hi>Germans,</hi> or from the <hi>Pictones</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as some would bring them, or out of <hi>Scythia,</hi> according to <hi>Bede,</hi> it mattereth not, seeing what all of them call the Nation of the <hi>Picts,</hi> is in reason to be understood of some Rovers only which landed in the North, and united with that People about the daies of these Emperours, or some time before, but that ever there was the name of <hi>Picts,</hi> in <hi>Caesars</hi> daies, in this Island, or in later Emperours, such a Nation distinct from the <hi>Britains, Roman</hi> Authors, which could not have omitted such a considerable circumstance, never so much as mention. But thus much concerning the <hi>Picts,</hi> let us proceed to the History.</p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:58825:164"/>
                     <p>In the daies of these Emperours <hi>Britain</hi> was full of Excellent Work-men, and Builders, as out of the <hi>Panegyrick</hi> is gathered, whom, upon the setling of Affairs in the Island, the <hi>AEduans</hi> in <hi>Burgundy</hi> entertained to build their Temples and Publick Edifices.</p>
                     <p>Peace thus establisht in <hi>Britain,</hi> and the State quieted, <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> who had hitherto employed his Valour with success against his Enemies, now used his Rage in a bloody Persecution against his Innocent and Obedient Subjects, the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>tenth Persecution,</hi> and of all the fore-going the most Bloody, and of longest continuance, the fatal Bill of their Martyrdom was, seventeen thousand a Month, besides infinite numbers that suffered by Confiscation, Banishment, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Christian</hi> Churches were every where demolisht, their Bibles sought out and burnt, and death for any to conceal them, and all means practiced, not only to extinguish the Professours; but to root out the very Name of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                     <p>The most remarkable that had their shares in <hi>Britain,</hi> were, first, <hi>ALBAN</hi> of <hi>Verulam,</hi> beheaded at <hi>Holmhurst,</hi> since called <hi>Derswould,</hi> where now the Town of St. <hi>Albans</hi> (bearing his name) is built, of whom <hi>Fortunatus Priscus,</hi> in his Book of the praise of <hi>Virginity,</hi> writes,

                  <head>THE British History, In the Daies of DIOCLESIAN AND MAXIMIAN.</head>
                  <p>AFter <hi>BONOSUS,</hi> succeeded <hi>CARAUSIUS</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note place="margin">An. Dom. 289.</note> of <hi>Britain,</hi> in the year 289, the fourth of these Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; He made the <hi>Picts</hi> his Confederates, and entertaining all who flockt to him under the hopes of <hi>Pillage</hi> and <hi>Plunder,</hi> He constrained the <hi>Britains</hi> to make him their King, who, not knowing, now, who was their Friend or Foe, partly for fear, and partly for want of a lawful Inheritour, elected him to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Having thus gained the Power, first, he rewards the <hi>Picts</hi> with the vast Territories in <hi>Albania,</hi> and not content with Invading the property of his Subjects, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessing the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> like a proud Tyrant, he infringed all their Rights and Priviledges.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> hearing thereof, sent <hi>Alectus</hi> with three Legions to kill him, and to restore <hi>Britain</hi> to the Empire; <hi>Carausius</hi> accordingly was slain, after he had reigned seven years, but instead of giving the Kingdom to the <hi>Romans, Alectus</hi> himself usurped it, and assumed the Crown in the year 269. <note place="margin">An. Dom. 269.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He punished with great slaughter those <hi>Britains,</hi> who, forsaking the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, had adhered to the society of <hi>Carausius,</hi> and been partakers in his Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which they sorely resenting, chose <hi>Asclepiodotus</hi> to revenge, exhorting him to set upon him in <hi>London,</hi> whilest he was celebrating a Feast to his <hi>Country Gods,</hi> at whose Arrival, <hi>Alectus</hi> forsaking his Sacrifice, and marching out with the choice of his Souldiers, entered Battle with him, but was slain after he had reigned three years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Livius Gallus,</hi> a Captain of <hi>Alectus,</hi> still held <hi>London,</hi> to the reducing whereof <note place="margin">An. Dom. 299.</note> 
                     <hi>Asclepiodotus,</hi> now King, summoned the <hi>Demeta,</hi> or the Inhabitants of that part of the Island now called <hi>South-Wales,</hi> the <hi>Venedoti,</hi> and those of <hi>Deira</hi> and <hi>Albania.</hi> With these Forces he beleagures the City, and with his War-like Engines batters down great part of the Wall. <hi>Gallus</hi> perceiving himself able to hold out no longer, comes to Parly, and surrenders the Town upon Condition to march out Armed, which being agreed to, <hi>Asclepiodotus</hi> enters, but the <hi>Venedoti,</hi> contrary to Articles, fell upon <hi>Gallus</hi> and slew him, at a Brooks-side within the City, called after his Name, <hi>Walbrooke</hi> or <hi>Gal-brooke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:58825:165"/>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Asclepiodotus</hi> got the full possession of the Kingdom, but being not able, or skilful to defend his Subjects from the cruelty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who in his daies raised the Persecution in <hi>Britain,</hi> he was slain by <hi>Coilus</hi> Duke of <hi>Colchester,</hi> after he had reigned about one year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>COIL,</hi> the third of that name, after the death of <hi>Asclepiodotus</hi> assumed the Crown, and now <hi>Constantius</hi> having heard of the Troubles in <hi>Britain,</hi> under the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Usurpers, lands upon the Coast, <hi>Coil</hi> informed thereof sends Embassadours to crave Peace, and promises Subjection and Homage, upon condition that he should enjoy the Kingdom of <hi>Britain,</hi> paying the accustomed Tributes and Tolls to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Constantius</hi> agrees, and receives Hostages, and not long after marries <hi>Helena</hi> his Daughter, than whom a fairer Virgin never lived, and who, besides that, she was an excellent Musitian, and generally instructed in all Liberal Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Coil,</hi> after one years Reign, died, and left the Kingdom to <hi>Constantius,</hi> who Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in the Right of his Wife <hi>Helena,</hi> so that again the <hi>British</hi> Succession returned <note place="margin">An.

                     <head>Fl. Val. Constantius Chlorus.</head>
                     <p>AFTER the Resignation of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi>Maximian,</hi> the Empire which hitherto was held entire, though often under <note place="margin">An.

The Western Provinces (the <note place="margin">Eusebius.</note> Government whereof alone relateth to our present History) fell to <hi>CONSTANTIUS,</hi> the Son of a Daughter to <hi>Crispus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Claudius,</hi> the second of that name, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Rome.</hi> A Prince wise and valiant, and so free from Ambition, that he chose rather to Govern well, than much, resigning to <hi>Galerius</hi> the Provinces of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> as lying too remote from the Seat of his Residence, which he held in <hi>Britain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He favoured and encouraged the <hi>Christians,</hi> and abhorred the Superstitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of divers Gods, acknowledging but One only, the Maker and Ruler of all things; and to try the Faith of his Courtiers, he proclaimed a publick Sacrifice, at the solemnity whereof, whosoever should be absent, and refuse to offer, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately (as he pretended) to be discarded, and those only that conformed should be retained.</p>
                     <p>Such were alwaies sure to be of the Religion of their Prince, who had held the Faith only as a Court-fashion, presently crept and cringed to the Gods (as they thought) of their Soveraign; But the Complement took not, that they were all turned out of their Services, with this Rebuke, <hi>That he who is difloyal to his God, can never be true and faithful to his Prince.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many other worthy Actions are reported of this <hi>Constantius</hi> in favour to the <hi>Christians,</hi> but the full establishing their Religion, and the publick Authorizing thereof, was reserved to <hi>Constantine,</hi> his Son and Successour. For having reigned two years, he died at <hi>York,</hi> in his last Expedition against the <hi>Caledonians</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>CONSTANTINE</hi> his Son, hearing of his Fathers sickness, escaped from <hi>Galerius,</hi> with whom he was left Hostage, and riding Post from <hi>Rome,</hi> on the way lamed and maim'd all the Post-Horses, to the end he might not be overtaken or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, and so arriving at <hi>York,</hi> was with great joy received by his Father, who sitting up-right in his Bed, in the presence of his Counsellors, spake as followeth;

                        <hi>I have here a large Epitaph and Monument, to wit mine own Son, whom I leave on Earth to succeed me in the Empire, who (by Gods assistance) shall wipe away the Tears of the Christians, and revenge the Tyranny used against them, and in this, above all things, I have placed my felicity;</hi> which said, <hi>Constantine</hi> received his Fathers last breath, whereupon an Ancient Oratour spake thus unto him; <hi>Thou entredst this Sacred place, not as a Competitour of the Empire, but as Heir apparent and ordained already, and forthwith that Fathers house of thine saw Thee the lawful Successour;</hi> For there was no doubt, but the Inheritance, in right, belonged unto him whom the Destinies had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the first begotten Son to the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>CONSTANTIUS</hi> dying at <hi>York,</hi> his Son <hi>CONSTANTINE,</hi> by the last Will and Testament of his Father, was designed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <note place="margin">An.

                     <p>But however they write, that the Souldiers respecting rather the Publick good, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Panegyrick Oration to</hi> Constantine the Great.</note> than yielding to his private affections, forcibly invested him in the Purple Robe; he weeping, set spurs to his Horse, because he would avoid the endeavour and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Army that called so instantly upon him; The felicity of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth over-ruled his Modesty, and therefore the <hi>Panegyrick</hi> crieth out in these words; <hi>O fortunate</hi> Britain, <hi>and more happy now than all other Lands, that hast the first sight of</hi> Constantine Caesar!

                     <p>At his first entrance, having pursued the relicks of the War begun by his Father, against the <hi>Caledonians</hi> and other <hi>Picts,</hi> and carried it on further to the Invading of the more Northern Nations, and the Inhabitants of those Islands, that are conscious (saith he) of the Suns setting, partly by Force, and partly by Treaty (for he had <note place="margin">Euseb. <hi>vit.</hi> Constant.</note> greater Affairs called him to <hi>Rome)</hi> he gained all to himself, not sparing to allure, with large Fees and stipends, all such whom neither fair words nor force of Arms could oblige to his Party. By such like Arts, his open and prosessed Enemies he drew to his Friendship, and his old Adversaries to be his especial Familiars.

                     <p>Some make his return into <hi>Britain</hi> before his engagement with <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and that out of the words of <hi>Eusebius</hi> (which nevertheless may relate to his after <note place="margin">

wanted assistance;</hi> And in another place, <hi>After he had furnisht his Army with mild and modest Instructions of Piety, he invaded</hi> Britain, <hi>that he might likewise instruct those who dwelt environed round about with the Waves of the Ocean, bounding the Suns setting, as it were, with those Coasts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The memory of this happy Expedition is preserved to posterity in a Coyn of his the Reverse whereof beareth a Man on Horse-back, with this Inscription round it, ADVENTUS AUGUSTI, and by these Letters <note n="†" place="margin">Pecunia <hi>Londini</hi> notata.</note> P.

                     </p>
                     <p>But his Policy was wanting in this point, that he was the first who made way for Barbarous People to break into <hi>Britain, Germany</hi> and <hi>Gaul;</hi> For when he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Northern Nations, growing over-secure on that side, he translated those Legions that lay in defence of the <hi>Marches,</hi> partly into the East, where he had built his new City <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and in their stead built Forts and Holds, and partly into Cities more remote from the said <hi>Marches,</hi> so that soon after his death, the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> forcing the Towns and Fortresses, brake into the Provinces, in which respect he is blamed by <hi>Zosimus,</hi> as the main and principal subverter of a most flourishing Empire; From hence <hi>Malmsbury</hi> writeth, <hi>That he brought from this Island a great power of</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish <note place="margin">Zosimus.

                        <hi>Souldiers, by whose Industry, and good Service, having obtained Triumphal Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to his hearts desire, and attained to the Empire, such of them as were past Service, and had performed the painful part of Souldiers their full time, he planted in a certain part of</hi> Gaul, <hi>westward, upon the very shoar of the Ocean, where at this day their Posterity remaining, are wonderfully grown even to a mighty People, in Manners and Language much degenerating from our</hi> Britains. But I fear he hath too boldly colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of the words of <hi>Zosimus,</hi> forasmuch as there is no particular place recorded by him, where those Cities which he calleth, <hi>More remote from the Marches</hi> were scituate, and the <hi>Britains</hi> in <hi>Gaul</hi> are supposed (more probably) to be of an earlier Plantation in those parts.</p>
                     <p>About this time, as plainly appeareth by the Code of <hi>Theodosius, PACATIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS</hi> was the Vicegerent in <hi>Britain,</hi> for by this time the Province had no more <note place="margin">An. Dom. 319.</note>

                     <p>He ordained four Prefects of the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> to wit, of the East of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of <hi>Gaul.</hi> Two Leaders or Commanders of the Forces, the one of Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the other of Horse-men, in the West, whom they termed <hi>Praesentales.</hi> For Civil Government, there Ruled <hi>Britain</hi> the Praefect of the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> or Grand <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neschal</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and under him the Vicar General of <hi>Britain,</hi> who was his Vicegerent, and honoured with the Title of <hi>Spectabilis,</hi> as much as to say <hi>Notable</hi> or <hi>Remarkable.</hi> Him obeyed respectively, to the number of the Provinces, two Consular Deputies, and three Presidents, who had the hearing of Civil and Criminal Causes.

                     <p>The <hi>Comes</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> seemeth to have Ruled the Inland-parts of the Island, who had with him seven Companies of Foot, and nine Cornets or Troops of Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

                     <p>The General of <hi>Britain,</hi> that is, Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> who defended the Marches or Fronteirs against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> had the Command of thirty eight Garrison-Forts, wherein kept their stations 14000 Foot, and 900 Horse-men; so that in those daies if <hi>Pancirolus</hi> hath kept just computation) <hi>Britain</hi> maintained 19200 Foot-men, and 1700 Horse-men, ormuch thereabout, in Ordinary. <note place="margin">Pancirolus.</note>

                     <hi>Constantine</hi> hearing of his Usurpation, sends <hi>Trahernus,</hi> his Unkle by his Mothers side (whom he had made Senatour of <hi>Rome</hi>) to reduce him to Obedience, <hi>Traherne</hi> with three Legions arrived at <hi>Britain,</hi> and at his landing took a City named <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris,</hi> at which place <hi>Octavius</hi> meeting him with a great Army, not far from <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> in a set Battle overthrew and put him to flight; <hi>Traherne</hi> escaping into <hi>Albania,</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> (by Sea, saith <hi>Basing stoak</hi>) was pursued by <hi>Octavius,</hi> but not with like suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, for meeting him in a place called <hi>Vestenavalia</hi> (the Manuscript hath it <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marlandia</hi>) he was by him overcome and constrained to flie into <hi>Norway,</hi> leaving his quarrel to be revenged by the Count of <hi>Westmorland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilest he is soliciting the <hi>Norwegians</hi> for help, <hi>Traherne</hi> is slain in an Ambush laid for him in a Valley, as he came from the City <hi>London,</hi> of whose death <hi>Octavius</hi> having notice, returns into <hi>Britain</hi> and again assumes the Kingdom. This happened (saith <hi>Fabian</hi>) about the year 329, in the 22 or <hi>23d.</hi> of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and about two <note place="margin">Fabian.</note> years after the said <hi>Octavius</hi> had usurped.</p>
                  <p>Being again established, he Ruled the Island (as the <hi>British</hi> Chronicle affirmeth) with great Justice and Moderation, even to the daies of <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> which (saith <hi>Fabian</hi>) was fifty four years.</p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:58825:168"/>
                  <p>But in this he erreth, in not considering that <hi>Gratian</hi> was admitted by his Father <hi>Valentinian</hi> to the Empire in the fourth year of his Reign, which was <hi>An.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Octavius</hi> now grown Old, began to think of a Successour, he had one only Daughter, whom he had thoughts to give in marriage unto <hi>Conan Meridoc,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cornwals</hi> Nephew, but the Nobles not consenting, he was advised to send to <hi>Rome</hi> for a Noble Man named <hi>Maximian,</hi> Cousin to the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Helena's</hi> side, to invite him to take his Daughter, and with her the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maurice</hi> the Son of <hi>Conan</hi> (though the Historian might have chosen a fitter Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) was sent on this Embassage, and performed it in such effectual manner, that <hi>Maximian</hi> readily embraced the motion, arrived in <hi>Britain,</hi> and notwithstanding the opposition made by <hi>Conan Meridoc</hi> to the contrary, obtained the Daughter, and with great solemnity performed the Nuptials.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Maximian,</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> History, is called <hi>Maximus,</hi> of whom we shall hear more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Basing stoak</hi> writeth, that <hi>Octavius</hi> was reduced by <hi>Constantine</hi> in Person, and that after his Victory, by the intreaty of his Mother <hi>Helona</hi> he encompassed <hi>London</hi> with a Wall of three miles in circuit, having six Gates, and where the River <hi>Thames</hi> begins and ends the City, at those two Corners he built a Tower and Castle; Hence he saith this City was called <hi>AUGUSTA,</hi> and the Provost of the <hi>Augustian Treasury</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Roman</hi> History, and first instituted by this Emperour in <hi>Britain,</hi> had his name not from the Emperours who were called <hi>Augusti,</hi> but being Treasurers of <hi>Augusta,</hi> or <hi>London.</hi>

                     <p>Hereupon <hi>Julius Firmicus,</hi> (not that Pagan Astrologer, but the <note place="margin">Jul.

The Waves now of the Sea, unto this time well near unknown to us, have trembled, and the</hi> Britains <hi>were sore afraid to see the unexpected face of the Emperour. What would ye more? The very Elements as vanquisht, have given place to your Vertues.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Constans</hi> was he who called a Counsel to <hi>Sardica</hi> against the <hi>Arrians,</hi> at which were assembled three hundred Bishops, and among them the Bishops of <hi>Britain,</hi> who having condemned the Hereticks, and establisht the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed by their Voices and Judgment, approved the Innocency of <hi>Athanasius.</hi> But this Prince being youthful, and casting away all care of the Empire, and drowned in Pleasures, became grievous to the Provincials, and nothing acceptable to his Souldiers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that <hi>Maxentius,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Jovi</hi> and <hi>Herculii,</hi> beset him in a Town called St. <hi>Helens,</hi> as he was hunting, and there slew him, whereby the Prophesie was fulfilled, <hi>That he should end his daies in his Grandmothers lap,</hi> of whom that Town indeed took its name.</p>
                     <p>This Castle of St. <hi>Helens</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Speed</hi>) was scituated among the <hi>Taporis,</hi> a <note place="margin">Speed <hi>Chron.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Maxentius</hi> was then in the Army a Count of a City in <hi>Germany,</hi> called <hi>Augusta Vindelicorum,</hi> he by the incitement of one <hi>Chrestus</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> when the day was appointed, makes a feast to the Souldiers; <hi>Marcellinus</hi> seigning that his Sons Birth-day was to be solemnized, when the Company was warm with Wine, <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi> withdraws, and putting on the Purple Robe returned again to the Company. They who were not privy to this design, were nevertheless, by the suddenness of the Stratagem, forced to comply, insomuch that having a good Party about him, as he was Robed he hastned to the Palace. The Emperour wearied by Hunting, his usual diversion, was laid upon the Bed, but not asleep as they expected, so that hearing them enter, he escaped to the Temple, but in vain, for <hi>Gaison,</hi> one of the chief Conspiratours, haling him from the Altar, slew him.</p>

                     <p>The Ingratitude of this <hi>Maxentius</hi> to his Master is more remarkable, in that he was not only his bountiful Prince, but had been once his Deliverer; For in a Mutiny in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> wherein the Souldiers would have killed him, he fled into <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans</hi> his arms for refuge, and was protected under his Royal Vesture.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Maxentius,</hi> by the <hi>British</hi> History, is made King of this Island, and by <hi>Basingstoak</hi> the successour of <hi>Constans,</hi> although <hi>Constantius</hi> the younger Brother of <hi>Constans</hi> succeeded in the West, and out-lived this <hi>Maxentius.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>At this time the General of all the War-Forces throughout <hi>Britain</hi> was <hi>Gratianus,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>FUNARIUS</hi> (so called either from his Trade formerly exercised, being a <hi>Rope-seller,</hi> or, as others say, from his exceeding strength, five Souldiers being not able, with all their force, to wrench a Rope from him) he being out of favour with the Emperour, because reported to have given entertainment to <hi>Maxentius,</hi> was not only constrained to return home, being cashier'd of his Military employment, but was also fined, by <hi>Constantius,</hi> in the confiscation and loss of his Goods.</p>
                     <p>And now a severe Inquisition fell upon <hi>Britain,</hi> to detect those who had adhered to the Party of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and the <hi>Inquisitor</hi> sent by <hi>Constantius</hi> was <hi>Paulus,</hi> a <note place="margin">Am. Marcel. <hi>lib. 15. cap. 2.</hi>

                        <hi>Spaniard,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>CATENA,</hi> for his severe inflicting of Chains and Manacles upon the accused, or, as <hi>Basingstoak</hi> reporteth, for his cunning linking his Plots <note place="margin">Basingstoak, <hi>lib. 6.</hi>
                        </note> and Devices together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Martinus,</hi> an Aged and worthy Commander, was then Vicar of <hi>Britain,</hi> who was much concerned and grieved at the rigid way of his proceedings, but whilest he endeavoured to protect others (by the cunning of <hi>Paulus</hi>) was himself taken in the snare.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For this PAULUS (having a crafty and subtle head) was sent hither to search out such Persons who had sided in the Conspiracy with</hi> Maxentius, <hi>insomuch for the desire of gain, after he had patched and pieced many faults of some together, (whether the Persons were guilty or not, he regarded not) he seized all their Estates and Fortunes, and so vigorously proceeded to spoil and undoe many, imprisoning the Free-born, and tormenting them with Chains and Fetters; such base and unworthy Acts being committed by him, in the daies of</hi> Constantius, <hi>as these, branded the whole Emperours Reign with disgrace and scandal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Paulus <hi>perceiving his trade decayed by means of the Vicar,</hi> MARTINUS, <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to carry him away Prisoner, with divers others, before the Emperours Counsel, for which cause</hi> Martinus <hi>endeavoured to stab him, but missing his pass, immediately with the same weapon became his own Executioner, which loss, by many, was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserated, for as he was a Man honest he deserved great Reputation.</hi>

                     <p>Paulus, <hi>after he had sufficiently stained himself with Innocent blood, returned to the Princes Court, against whose coming with Prisoners, Racks, Drags, Tortures, and Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were prepared, so that many of them were proscribed and outlawed, some banished, and others died by the Sword; Did not the judgment of God justly reward him for his Cruelties, when under</hi> JULIAN <hi>he was burnt alive?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the neck of these proceedings, other Calamities followed in <hi>Britain,</hi> for the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> barbarous Nations, brake down the Fronteirs, and taking advantage of the Troubles and destruction of the Province, wasted far and near.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>JULIAN,</hi> lately chosen Caesar, and afterwards Emperour, was then wintering at <hi>Paris,</hi> who having notice of their Incursions, yet because the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were but in a doubtful condition of Allegiance (for it was dangerous to leave <hi>Gaul</hi> without a Governour) durst not adventure to go in person into <hi>Britain,</hi> but sent <hi>Lupicinus,</hi> at that time Colonel of the Infantry and Master of the Armory, to quell the Rebels, and compose the Affairs in the Province.</p>
                     <p>He was an excellent Souldier, well skilled in all Military Affairs, but withal of a haughty and boasting nature, a big Speaker, and in his gesture savouring much of the <hi>Buskin</hi> in Tragedies, and it was a question whether he were more Covetous or Cruel.</p>
                     <p>Having raised an Army of light appointed Men, to wit, the <hi>Herulians, Batavians,</hi> and many Companies of the <hi>Maesians,</hi> now <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> he sets out from <hi>Bullen</hi> with a Fleet well mann'd, with a good fore-wind, in the dead of Winter, and landing at the Haven <hi>Rutupiae,</hi> over against <hi>Bullen,</hi> he marched directly to <hi>London,</hi> in hopes the sooner to give the Enemy Battle, but what his successes were is not left to Posterity; Certain it is, he was recalled by <hi>Julian</hi> the succeeding Emperour.</p>
                     <p>And now the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie, whereof <hi>Constantius</hi> was a great favourer, having spread over the whole World, crept also into <hi>Britain,</hi> a Nation desirous of change, and stedfast in nothing, concerning which, hear our ancient <hi>Gildas</hi> complaining: <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> 
                        <hi>From the first year of</hi> CONSTANTINE the Great, <hi>a sweet consent and harmony of Christ the head, and his Members, had still continued, were it not for that persidious</hi> Arrianisme, <hi>that so much poysoning and corrupting us, caused so great a Separation, as frequently so subjects us to be drawn away with Novelties, and sticking close to nothing either firmly or seriously.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To nourish the deadly Opinions of these <hi>Arrians, Constantius</hi> called (of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Church four hundred Bishops) to <hi>Ariminum,</hi> contributing to their better maintenance necessary Provisions, which (by the <hi>Aquitanes, French</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi>) was accounted a very unseemly thing, and so refused the acceptance thereof, although it was an Express of the Emperours good-will. Three only out of <hi>Britain,</hi> being more necessitous than the rest, received that maintenance, but esteemed it more void of corruption, and safe, to charge the Common-Treasury, than the estate of a private Man.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Constantius</hi> died, when he had Reigned seventeen years, without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitour seven years in the life of his Brethren, and thirteen a <hi>Caesar</hi> in the daies of his Father <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> according to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Zosimus,</hi> which compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">Socrates.

                  <p>THE quarrel between <hi>Magnentius</hi> and <hi>Constantius</hi> being the chief matter of this Princes reign, <hi>Basingstoak</hi> reporteth after this manner:</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Magnentius</hi> had slain <hi>Constans,</hi> he sent Letters to his <note place="margin">Basingstoak, <hi>lib.</hi> 6.</note> Brother <hi>Constantius</hi> with Embassadours to this purpose; That he would be content with <hi>Thrace,</hi> and the Eastern Empire, and suffer him to enjoy <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> now in his possession, to which receiving no Answer, and hearing that <hi>Constantius</hi> was advanced towards <hi>Italy</hi> to revenge his Brothers death, he resolves by force of Arms to maintain his Suit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Constantius</hi> hearing of his Preparations, and fearing to engage too deeply the <hi>Roman</hi> State in Civil combustions, yields to him <hi>Gallia,</hi> upon condition he would quit his other pretences, which, <hi>Magnentius</hi> now grown high, and not accepting, they both prepared for a War. The place where they met was at <hi>Mursa,</hi> before the Fight, <hi>Magnentius</hi> taking Counsel of a Sorceress, was advised to sacrifice a Virgin, and to give her Blood, mixed with Wine, to the Souldiers to drink, whilest in the mean time she performed her Charms, which done, and the impious Ceremonies being over, the Battle began, in which <hi>Constantius</hi> was Victor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnentius</hi> leaving his Horse and Imperial Robes at random (that he might be thought slain) fled disguised, and gathering together as many of his scattered Forces as he could rally, sent to <hi>Constantius</hi> first by a Grave Senatour, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and afterwards by Bishops, to desire only the Government of <hi>Gallia</hi> to be held of him under the Title of Duke only.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Souldiers</hi> hearing of this base Submission, and doubting his Fortune was but low, fled to <hi>Constantius</hi> daily, so that <hi>Magnentius</hi> finding it high time to give Battle whilest he had any left with him, met <hi>Constantius</hi> in the Field, but was again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, when flying to <hi>Lions,</hi> and perceiving his own Followers ready to betray him to gain favour with the Conquerour, having first feigned himself Mad, he mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered himself after he had reigned three years. Thus <hi>Basingstoak;</hi> but I fear in some circumstances he confounds <hi>Magnentius</hi> with that <hi>Maxentius</hi> who was overcome by <hi>Constantine.</hi>

And now <hi>Paulus</hi> the Notary, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who carried on the bloody Inquisition in <hi>Britain</hi> in the last Emperours daies, falling into the displeasure of <hi>Julian</hi> (as I said before) was burnt alive.</p>
                     <p>This is all that relates to our Island in the daies of <hi>Julian,</hi> saving that from hence he exported every year great store of Corn to maintain the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrisons in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> He Reigned about three years, and was slain by a Dart in the <hi>Persian</hi> Wars.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Almains</hi> in these daies were of great repute for their hardiness and skill in War, and their Princes highly esteemed for their faithful Service and constant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But it seemeth that <hi>Fraomarius,</hi> as likewise <hi>Erocus,</hi> who took Commissions under the <hi>Romans,</hi> were expell'd their Kingdom by some Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Insurrection of their People, for the Nation of the <hi>Almains,</hi> we read, in these daies mightily infested the <hi>Romans,</hi> and invaded their Province of <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Rhetia,</hi> so that they who followed <hi>Fraomarius</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> seem to be a Party of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> who attended their Prince in his banishment, Men of Spirit and Nobility, and therefore most likely to do considerable Service for the honour of their Prince, and the quieting of the <hi>British</hi> Nation.</p>
                     <p>The Expedition of <hi>Fraomarius</hi> with his <hi>Almains</hi> into this Island, appeareth to be in the fifth year of this Emperours Reign, <hi>An. Dom. 370.</hi>

                     <q>
                        <p>By the general Plots and Contrivances of those Barbarous People <hi>Britain</hi> was sorely distressed and afflicted, <hi>Nectaridius,</hi> who at that time was Lieutenant to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage <note place="margin">Amm Marcel. <hi>lib.</hi> 27, and 28.</note> Maritime Affairs, lost his life, and <hi>Bulchobaudes,</hi> a General, by the crafty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the Enemy was prevented in his designs.</p>
                        <p>The Emperour, after he had received Information of these sad disasters, sent <hi>Severus,</hi> then Lord Steward of his Houshold, to rectifie and set in order miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; but being in a short time after called back, was not able to effect what he so much desired; After that <hi>Jovinus</hi> went to the same parts, and in great haste sent <hi>Proventusides</hi> to request a potent Force (but this place in the Text Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> apprehends, was corrupted) as the necessity of the cause required.</p>
                        <p>So many dreadful Afflictions and Calamities being daily spread abroad of the Island, <hi>Theodosius</hi> was chosen, and hastned with all expedition thither, because he was esteemed a Person so fit for that employment. Having collected to himself a sufficient number of stout and valiant Men, the better to strengthen Legions, as Cohorts, led the way with much Courage and Resolution.</p>
                        <p>About that time the <hi>Picts</hi> were severed into two Nations, that is, <hi>Dicaledonians</hi> and <hi>l'icturiones,</hi> the <hi>Attucots,</hi> a fierce and resolute People, with the <hi>Scots,</hi> in divers parts where they roved, did great mischief. In like manner the <hi>Gaulish</hi> Cohorts <hi>Frankners,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> being next Neighbours to them, made great spoil and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock both by Land and Sea, and what with murthering Captives, firing Towns, and plundering, represented all places deplorable, and much to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied.</p>
                        <p>To put a stop to the current of these Grievances (if Fortune would have so consented) this zealous and vigorous Captain intended a voyage to the utmost bounds of Earth, for when he arrived to the Sea-side of <hi>Bullen,</hi> which is sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from an opposite piece of Land by a narrow street, called the <hi>Sleeve,</hi> ebbing and flowing, where the Waves are wont to mount up with swelling Tides, and of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:58825:172"/>
a sudden to humble themselves by a low and submissive level, the better to favour the Passenger, from whence having, by slow and chary sailing, passed the Ocean, he gained the shoar of <hi>Rhutapia;</hi> called <hi>Ribchester,</hi> or <hi>Richborow</hi> by <hi>Sandwich,</hi> over against it, a place more freed from Rage and disturbance, from whence, after that the <hi>Batavians, Heruli, Jovii,</hi> and <hi>Victores,</hi> who followed, were come. Upon this he departed, and reaching that Old Town, <hi>AUGUSTA,</hi> (now the famous City of <hi>LONDON</hi>) divided his Army into several parts, he charged upon these robbing Adversaries so briskly, thinking it a time most proper as they were laden with the Spoyls and destruction of his Friends, discomfiting those that were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling forward their Captives, and such as also drave away Cattle, that they were forced to leave their Prey, and think of nothing more for the present, than how to make, safely, their escapes.</p>
                        <p>Having made restitution of the Goods so taken to the Owners, save only some small encouragement reserved for the Souldiers, he hastned into the City, now pretty well cleared from Calamities. And moreover, having been advised by the information of revolting Fugitives, and confession of Captives, that so great a multitude of sundry Nations, so resolute and perverse in their Natures, were not to be vanquish'd but by sudden Excursions, and private Contrivances, therefore did not by this first success, puff himself up either with an absolute security, or adventure greater exploits, resting in himself doubtful of the future event.</p>
                        <p>After he had proclaimed promises of Impunity, he summoned as well the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Runagates, as divers others that went different Journies without controul, to offer themselves for his employment. As soon as most of these summoned were returned, he, loaded with Cares, curbed his former motion, insomuch that he called for <hi>Civilis</hi> by name, intending him a Deputy Governour of <hi>Britain,</hi> a precise keeper of Justice and observer of Right, although something touched in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with a haughty disposition. He likewise sent for <hi>Dulcitius,</hi> a Captain very knowing in War-like employments.</p>
                        <p>Now gaining courage to a willing heart, he left <hi>Augusta,</hi> and with faithful and couragious Souldiers, brought great comfort to the ruinated estate of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> by fore-laying an Ambush in all places against the Barbarians, where was thought to be the greatest advantage, and encouraged the Common. Souldiers much by engaging them in no hot Service, but would take to himself the first essay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thereby evidencing the part of a stirring and hardy Souldier, as the charge and courage of a noble General, putting to flight divers Nations, who thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves secure, through Pride, or vain boasting, were stirred up to invade the <hi>Roman</hi> Government.</p>
                        <p>For a long space of time, the foundation of Peace being thus laid by him, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Cities were restored to their former security and freedom, which before had suffered under many troubles and dangers.</p>
                        <p>In the time of these his Atchievments, there had like to have happened a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Act, which might have been a cause of raising new Troubles, had it not been destroyed in its infancy. <hi>Valentinus</hi> of <hi>Valeria Pannonia,</hi> one of a proud Spirit, Brother to the Wife of that pestilent <hi>Maximinus,</hi> first Deputy Lieutenant; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward President, for some remarkable fault of his was banisht <hi>Britain;</hi> Through impatience till he could act his Villany, rose up in Arms against <hi>Theodosius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving all imaginable Plots to raise disturbance, occasioned by some private and inward Pride and Malice. And although he perceived him, alone, able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with his Designes, yet attempted to solicite as well the Banished persons, as Souldiers, promising a Reward, the more easily to draw them to perform for him some publick Attempts.</p>
                        <p>When the time drew near these projects should take effect, the General being forewarned thereof, committed <hi>Valentinus</hi> (with some of his pickt Confederates) into the hands of Captain <hi>Dulcitius</hi> to see them executed, but took care withal, not to make any farther enquiry after other Conspiratours, because he was a Man excelling in Military knowledge all others in that Age, and moreover fore-casting, the future events might prove noxious in too much disturbing the minds of the factious Provinces, whereby it might raise new Commotions. Waving that, and applying himself to reform many Enormities, most necessary, as fortune prospered
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:58825:172"/>
him in his undertakings, peace and quiet was restored, those Garrison-Forts and ruined Cities he rebuilt, Fronteirs with standing-Watches he fortified, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince which had so much subjected themselves to the Enemies he recovered, and so strengthned it in its former estate, and, according to his own will, it was Ruled by a lawful Governour, and was called VALENTIA, from the Princes will and pleasure.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Areans,</hi> a sort of People instituted by those of Ancient times, falling by slow degrees into corrupt Vlces, were driven from the places where they most resorted, as convicted publickly how they received Bribes, and promises of large Rewards, to discover to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> whatever we designed to be acted for us. It being their charge to hasten sometimes to one place, sometimes to another, to acquaint our Captains of all disturbances, the People near adjoyning being at any time in a readiness to rise.</p>
                        <p>Having compleated all these his Noble Acts, was ordered to attend at the Princes Court, and leaving the Provinces safely rejoycing, was had in as great esteem as either <hi>Furius Camillus,</hi> or <hi>Papirius Cursor,</hi> and receiving the honourable and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Complements of all men towards him, even as far as the Narrow Seas, he safely arrived (with a prosperous Wind) to the Princes Camp, where hew as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with all the joy and applaud imaginable.</p>

And indeed, the first assaies of his Power were well employed to the good and preservation of his Country; The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> who with their Inroads continually wasted the Province, he utterly subdued and drove back, when pussed up with his success, and not content with his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in <hi>Britain,</hi> with the flower and strength well near of the <hi>British</hi> Youth he passed the Seas, and arriving at the mouth of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> drew to him the whole puissance of the <hi>German</hi> Army.</p>
                     <p>His Royal Seat he made at <hi>Triers,</hi> whence he is called by <hi>Gregorius Turonensis, Trevericus Imperator,</hi> and spreading his wings (saith <hi>Gildas</hi>) the one as far as to <note place="margin">Gregor. Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronensis. Gildas.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Against him <hi>Gratianus</hi> made his Power, but after five daies skirmishing was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken by his own Soudiers, put to flight, and forced to beg his peace. St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> was sent Embassadour, who in outward shew obtained it, but the event proved that Treachery only, and Treason, iwere intended; For <hi>Maximus</hi> wholly intent how he might make away <hi>Trajan,</hi> at last compast it by this wile; He caused Rumors to spread abroad, and Letters given to <hi>Gratian,</hi> how that his Wife was coming in person to visit him, which <hi>Gratian</hi> believing, and hastning to meet her, opening the Litter wherein he thought she was, was barbarously murthered by <hi>Androgathius,</hi> taking in his bosom his deaths wound, where he hoped to have received his Empress.

                     <p>All things thus succeeding to the desire of <hi>Maximus,</hi> having setled the State of <hi>France,</hi> and casheir'd those Officers who had sided with <hi>Gratian,</hi> he created <hi>Victor</hi> his Son, <hi>Caesar,</hi> committing his Infancy to <hi>Nannius</hi> and <hi>Quintinus,</hi> Masters in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary skill, whom he appointed to be his Tutors. And now he sends his Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who governed in the East, to require, or rather to demand to be admitted sharer in Power, which was for the present consented unto by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius,</hi> and he saluted Emperour by him, and his Image exhibited to the <hi>Alexandrines,</hi> and set up in the publick Market-place.</p>

                     <p>Having thus by Violence and Extortion graspt all into his possession, and filled his own Cosfers with the spoil of the Common-wealth, he made the defence of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion a cloak to cover his oppression and Tyranny. <hi>Priscillian,</hi> and other Hereticks, convicted in the Councel of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and appealing (as their manner is) to his usurped Tribunal, he condemned to death, although disswaded by <hi>Martin</hi> that good Bishop of <hi>Towrs,</hi> alleadging, <hi>It was sufficient they were Excommunicated by the Church, to which in matters of Faith they were only ameanable;</hi> These were the first that (being Executed by the Civil Power for matters of Religion) left a foul and dangerous president to posterity.</p>
                     <p>After this, he entred with his whole Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> which struck such terrour into <hi>Valentinian,</hi> that flying to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> he earnestly besought him to undertake his Quarrel, and to redress the Violence of <hi>Maximus. Theodosius,</hi> after much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty (for he upbraided <hi>Valentinian,</hi> because an <hi>Arrian</hi>) consented to his Suit, and with all his Forces marehed against the Tyrant, who then lay secure at <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and in two Battles overthrew him, whom afterwards betrayed by his own Souldiers, he delivered to the Executioner; His Son <hi>Victor</hi> was vanquished and slain in <hi>Gallia,</hi> and <hi>Andragathius</hi> who had assassinated <hi>Gratian</hi> threw himself headlong into the Sea. The <hi>British</hi> Souldiers who had assisted <hi>Maximus,</hi> invaded (as saith <hi>Bede</hi>) that part <note place="margin">Bede.</note> of <hi>France</hi> called <hi>Armorica,</hi> from whence the <hi>Britains</hi> first arrived into this Island, but in this <hi>Bede</hi> is infinitely mistaken, or else we are altogether ignorant of his meaning.</p>
                     <p>This was the end of <hi>Maximus</hi> and his Empire, who is reasonably supposed to be that <hi>Clemens Maximus,</hi> who had under his Command the second Legion <hi>Augusta,</hi> which was removed from <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, and lying long in Garrisonat <hi>Isca, Silurum,</hi> or <hi>Caerleon</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> was afterwards translated to <hi>Rhutupia,</hi> or <hi>Richborow,</hi> for he is called by <hi>Arsonus</hi> the <hi>Rhutupine Robber,</hi> and that his name was <hi>Clemens,</hi> that Inscription of the <hi>Bononians,</hi> set up to his Honour, doth sufficiently witness:</p>

                     <p>And now the <hi>Britains</hi> finding themselves deserted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations continually assaulting them, the <hi>Scots</hi> from the <hi>Irish</hi> Seas, the <hi>Saxons</hi> from the <hi>German,</hi> and the <hi>Picts</hi> from the North, beholding withal the desolations of the Continent, through the weakness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire and the power of its Enemies, the <hi>Vandals</hi> who had wasted <hi>Belgia</hi> even to those places whence is nearest passage into <hi>Britain,</hi> and learing lest the heating-flame of their Neighbours fire might fly over to them also, thought it expedient to choose some General or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Commander to lead them.

                        </note> was Deputy of the Island, but his carriage not agreeing with their giddy Courses, him they as suddenly slew, and in his stead set up <hi>Gratian,</hi> a Country-man of their own, whom they Crowned and arrayed in the Purple Robe, and adored as their Prince, but the favour of a heady Rout is as fatal as its fury, for upon some slight mislike taken to him after four Months end, they deprived him not only of life, but Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire also.</p>
                     <p>There was among them a Common Souldier whose name was <hi>Constantine,</hi> with him on a sudden so taken, they are upon the conceit of a luckiness in his name, as without any other visible Merit to create him Emperour.</p>

Upon the <hi>Alpes</hi> as well <hi>Cottiae</hi> and <hi>Penninae,</hi> as those towards the Maritime Coasts where ever the passages lay open, he placed Garrisons, built Forts and Castles, and in <hi>Spain</hi> under the Conduct of his <note n="*" place="margin">Constant.</note> Son, whom (of a Monk) he had made his <hi>Caesar,</hi> he warred with the like fortune and success.</p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:58825:176"/>
                     <p>And now grown high and proud by the constant current of so many Felicities, not content that <hi>Honorius</hi> had freely yielded to him a share in the Empire, and kindly accepted his excuse (wherein he alleadged the force of the Souldiers in advancing him to that Authority) in hostile manner he passed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and intended to march di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against <hi>Rome;</hi> But having information that <hi>Alaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> (whom lately he had made his Ally) was dead, he returned to <hi>Arles,</hi> where he planted his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seat, and commanded the City to be called <hi>CONSTANTINA,</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation perhaps of <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> who had done the like in the East, and whose Name he had found so lucky to him in all his concerns. Here he ordained, that the Assemblies of Assizes for seven Provinces should be held.</p>
                     <p>And now well seated in the Empire, he sent into <hi>Spain</hi> for his Son <hi>Constans,</hi> to the end that meeting together they might consult further concerning the establishment of the Empire. <hi>Constans</hi> receiving his Fathers Message, without any delay sets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on his Journey to him, leaving his Wife, and the furniture of his Court at <hi>Caesar Augusta,</hi> or <hi>Caragosa,</hi> and trusting the management of all Affairs, during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to the care and conduct of <hi>Gerontius</hi> a Britain, whom a little while after, upon slight occasion he again displaced.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constans</hi> being now come to his Father, seemed rather to be sent for to partake with him in his Vices than Counsels, for by this time grown heedless of any danger from <hi>Italy,</hi> he gave himself up to all Riot and Luxury, so that advising his Son to return into <hi>Spain,</hi> he was mindful of nothing more than the pleasing his Appetite alone, and providing of delicate Meats to satisfie his Gluttony.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constans</hi> taking his leave of his Father, having sent his Forces and Retinue before, receives unwelcome News, that <hi>Gerontius</hi> having revolted from his Obedience, had set up <hi>Maximus,</hi> one of his Vassals and Followers, for Emperour, and having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together great Forces of <hi>Barbarians</hi> was upon his march against him and his Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constans</hi> allarum'd with these Tidings, dispatcht immediately <hi>Edo-beccus</hi> unto the <hi>German</hi> Nations, himself attended with <hi>Decimius Rusticus,</hi> who of the Master of the Offices was advanced to be <hi>Praefect,</hi> and accompanied with his Army of <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Almanes,</hi> and other Military Forces, passeth into <hi>France,</hi> intending with all speed to return again to his Father <hi>Constantine,</hi> but intercepted by <hi>Gerontius</hi> in his way, at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in a Combat lost his life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gerontius</hi> marching to meet <hi>Constantine</hi> found him at <hi>Arles,</hi> against which City he laid close siege, calling the <hi>Vandals</hi> to his assistance, who encouraged by him, as before by him they had been represt, breaking into <hi>France,</hi> overrun most part of the Province.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Honorius</hi> had sent an Army out of <hi>Italy,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius Comes</hi> his General, at the arrival whereof in those parts, <hi>Gerontius,</hi> deserted <note place="margin">Sosom. <hi>lib.</hi> 9.

And first having cut off the head of his Friend <hi>Alanus,</hi> as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, in the next place he dispatches, though with great reluctancy, his Wife also, being much intreated and importuned by her, refusing to out-live her Husband, and desiring to be freed from the Violence of an inraged Crew, for which her resolution, <hi>Sozomenus,</hi> an Ecclesiastical Writer gives her high praise and commendation; This done, he turns his Sword against himself, but that missing to perform the work, with his Ponyard he finisheth his resolution and dies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constantius</hi> now streightned on all hands, and discouraged with some ill success of <hi>Edobeccus,</hi> after he had been besteged with his other Son <hi>Julian</hi> four Months, and Reigned four years, flings off his Purple Robe and turns Priest, and hoping under that shelter to secure himself, not long after surrenders the Town, but his habit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no sanctuary to him, he was carried into <hi>Italy,</hi> and there beheaded together with his Son, to whom he had given the Title of <hi>NO BILISSIMUS,</hi> and a Brother named <hi>Sebastian.</hi>

                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:58825:177"/>
                     <p>Whilest these things were doing, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> taking advantage of the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Government of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who at <hi>Arles</hi> minded nothing but his Pleasures, brake into the Provinces, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> and the <hi>Vandals</hi> into <hi>Gaul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> now destitute of aid, yet held under by them who had not power to protect them, forthwith took Arms, and resolving to stand on their own defence, freed their Cities and States. In like manner their Neighbours, the <hi>Britains</hi> of <hi>Armorica,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Gaulish</hi> Provinces by their example did the same, casting out the <hi>Roman</hi> Presidents, and setting up for Liberty, ordained Common-wealths of their own.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Roman</hi> Power which had been called into <hi>Italy,</hi> when once the fear of <hi>Alarick</hi> was over, and <hi>Constantine</hi> dead, made return into the several Provinces; And it seemeth that <hi>Victorinus</hi> of <hi>Tholosa</hi> might be sent <hi>Praefect</hi> of this Island, if it were not he whom <hi>Stilico</hi> sent hither. <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Cambden,</hi> whom I follow, assign the time of his being here after <hi>Gratianus Municeps,</hi> and <hi>Constantine the Tyrant,</hi> though others say it was before, however certain it is, that during his residence here he was very active against the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan</hi> writes, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to reduce the <hi>Picts</hi> into a Province, he gave occasion of their calling back <hi>Furgutius,</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> whom <hi>Maximus</hi> by their help had quite driven out of the Island.</p>
                     <p>He is highly commended by <hi>Rutilius Clandius</hi> the Poet, out of whose Verses his History is gathered; they are these,</p>

                     <p>Seeing that this <hi>Victorinus</hi> (by most Authors) is placed after <hi>Constantine the Tyrant,</hi> I suppose he might be sent with that Legion whom <hi>Honorius,</hi> upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond request of the <hi>Britains,</hi> granted to their assistance, or if it were before that he governed here, and was recalled against <hi>Alaricus</hi> then besieging <hi>Rome,</hi> certain it is, that the <hi>Britains</hi> exhausted of their Youth by <hi>Maximus</hi> first, who transplanted them into <hi>Gallia</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Armorica;</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Constantine,</hi> not having Power sufficient of their own to defend themselves from the Northern Incursions, and wanting the assistance of the <hi>Romans,</hi> first having tried what they could do by freeing themselves from Forreign Yoak, grown as weary of their Liberty as they had been formerly of Bondage, sent unto <hi>Honorius,</hi> humbly craving his Protection, to which Message they received no other answer, but in Words, by which he exhorted them to stand upon their own Guard, and so quitted them of the <hi>Roman</hi> Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                     <p>Thus ended this famous Empire of the <hi>Romans,</hi> first in <hi>Britain,</hi> and not long after in <hi>Italy</hi> it self, having born chief sway in this Island, though never wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, nor at one time intirely possest, for the space of four hundred sixty two years, if we account from the first arrival of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> to the taking of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Alarick,</hi> in which year <hi>Honorius</hi> wrote those Letters of Discharge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Britain</hi> thus deserted by the <hi>Romans,</hi> was left unable to defend it self, having all the flower and choice of her Youth drawn out to serve in the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrisons abroad, whilest others had forsaken their Country to follow the Ambition of such Tyrants whom they had headily advanced to the Purple Robe, and having Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given them in <hi>Gaul</hi> never returned, so that before I proceed to set down the Calamities of the <hi>Britains,</hi> when left to themselves and their own Counsels, it will not be amiss to shew, how from time to time the <hi>Romans</hi> drew out their Youth, and what numbers attended the Tyrants, which were so frequently advanced in the latter daies of the Empire, when there was no end of their Levies out of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To begin with the <hi>Romans</hi> first, <hi>Trebellius Maximus</hi> transported into <hi>Germany</hi> a great number of <hi>British</hi> Souldiers to make good the Faction of <hi>Vitellius</hi> against <hi>Otho; Honorius Flaccus</hi> in the same cause sent out eight thousand chosen Souldiers, <hi>Albinus</hi> in the bloody Battle at <hi>Lyons,</hi> against <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour, lost fifty thousand Men, most of which were of the <hi>British</hi> Cavalry.</p>
                     <p>This loss laid the Province naked, and left it open to the Insolence and Violence of Forreign Invaders, and <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> (as <hi>Malmsbury</hi> reporteth) carried <note place="margin">Malmsbury.</note> out such numbers with him, that to their Assistance especially he owed his Victories, and the Empire of the whole World. Afterwards he planted them on the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coast of <hi>France,</hi> called <hi>Armorica,</hi> next drawing out those Souldiers who lay for the defence of the <hi>Marshes</hi> and <hi>Fronteirs,</hi> he seated them in other parts of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, carried some into the East, and instead of those Living-strengths, he built Castles and Forts, which seized by the Enemy, proved continual annoyances to the <hi>Britains.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximus</hi> the Tyrant, who slew <hi>Gratian</hi> the Emperour, levied vast numbers of <hi>Britains,</hi> and transported them into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Ninnius</hi> writeth, that he would not send them home again, but gave unto them many Countries even from the Pool, or <note place="margin">Ninnius.</note> Meer, which lieth above Mount <hi>Jovis,</hi> unto the City that is called <hi>Cantguic,</hi> and unto <hi>Curcocchidient.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And he that annexed brief Notes unto <hi>Ninnius</hi> reporteth, how truly I cannot tel, the <hi>Armorican Britains</hi> which are beyond Sea attending <hi>Maximus</hi> in his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they could not return, wasted the Western-coasts of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and when they had married their Wives and Daughters, cut out all their Tongues, for fear lest the succeeding Progeny should learn their Mother Language, whereupon we call them in our Tongue <hi>Lhet vydion,</hi> that is, <hi>Half-silent,</hi> or <hi>Tongue-ty'd,</hi> because they speak confusedly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Constantius</hi> who was elected only for his Name transported most of the flower and strength of the <hi>Britains</hi> into <hi>Gallia</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> where, in his Quarrel, many of them perished, and the rest never returned, having Seats allotted them in the West of <hi>Gaul,</hi> or else followed the Emperour in his Wars.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that <hi>Prosper Aquitanus</hi> wrote thus; <hi>At this instant of time, in respect of the decay of the</hi> Roman <hi>Forces, the power and strength also of the</hi> Britains <hi>was brought</hi>

                        <hi>low, and unable to make resistance.</hi> For which cause, and occasion, our Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> speaks thus; <hi>When the Tyrants had rid the Country of all, save half</hi> Barbarians, <hi>none were there, either in Towns or Cities, but who gave themselves upto Epicurism.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Britain</hi> now forgetting the use and practice of good Arts, and wanting assistance of vigorous Youth, for a long time lay open to the Mercy of Ravening mouths that confin'd upon her, which was evidenced by the Incursions of the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> many lost their lives, Cities were subverted, Villages fired, insomuch as all lay naked and low, to express the Rage and Fury of merciless Invaders.</p>
                     <p>The Islanders in this streight, after they had buryed their Wealth, much of which hath been since found, chose rather to flie unto the Mountain-Country, than to stand the hazard of a set Battle, purposing after that to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to request assistance.

                  <p>THE <hi>Britains</hi> upon dislike to <hi>Honorius</hi> for that he had slain <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico,</hi> who, by the report of our Histories, did great Service for them, chose <hi>Marcus</hi> for their King, but him (not found agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their humour) they slew, and set up <hi>Gratianus Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps</hi> in his stead, a <hi>Britain</hi> born but a great Tyrant, so that not enduring him above four months, they kill'd him likewise, in which circumstances our stories agree with the <hi>Romans,</hi> but in the election of <hi>Constantine</hi> they vary; For he whom the <hi>Romans</hi> call a <hi>Common Souldier,</hi> and had the Empire for his Name only, by them is derived of Noble lineage, and made the Brother of <hi>Aldroenus</hi> King of <hi>Armorica,</hi> and the fourth from <hi>Conan Meridoc,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and first King of <hi>Armorica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the earnest request of <hi>Vitelinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> he was sent by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aldroenus</hi> into <hi>Britain,</hi> and landed at the same Port that <hi>Brute</hi> had formerly done, namely, <hi>Totness.</hi> Having subdued the Enemies of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and Reigned to the commendation of all People the space of ten years, he was slain by a <hi>Pict,</hi> his especial Confident.</p>
                  <p>He left Issue by his Wife (a Woman of Noble extraction, and bred up by <hi>Vite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi>) three Sons, <hi>Constantius</hi> (whom the <hi>Roman</hi> Histories call <hi>Constans</hi>) <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> and <hi>Uther,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Pen-Dragon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Constantius</hi> being a Man of weak parts in his Fathers time, had been made a Monk, and placed in the Abby of <hi>Amphibalus</hi> in <hi>Winchester,</hi> and now, after his death, by the cunning of <hi>Vortigern</hi> a powerful <hi>Britain,</hi> who desired to draw the management of Affairs to himself, was taken out of the Abby and made King, and not long after slain by his Guards of <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> who for that intent were placed about him,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:58825:179"/>
and suborned by <hi>Vortigern</hi> upon hopes of Reward, but the Deed done, <hi>Vortigern</hi> caused them all immediately to be strangled, by which means he not only prevented their discovering him, but gained such reputation for Justice and Integrity that he was chosen King.</p>
                  <p>The other Sons of <hi>Constantine</hi> fled into <hi>Armorica,</hi> where they continued until the alteration of Affairs called them back.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Count Palatine,</hi> better to bring the <hi>British</hi> History to the <hi>Roman,</hi> writes, That <hi>Constantine</hi> left behind him four Sons, whereof <hi>Julian,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> History, was one, but the Relations of the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Records have been all along so different in circumstances, and so disagreeing in setting down even matter of Fact it self, that the hopes of reconciling them would be fruitless. All therefore that is left in this place, is, to bemoan, that at the fall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in these parts, that which was truly <hi>Roman</hi> decayed also, namely, <hi>Learning, Eloquence,</hi> and <hi>History,</hi> so that for the future we must steer our course by other Guides, and in many places shall often want such clear and impartial Authors, by whom hitherto we have been directed.</p>

                  <head>THE AFFAIRS OF BRITAIN, From the decay of the ROMAN State, To the Entrance of the SAXONS.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Britains,</hi> as we heard, being acquitted of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Jurisdiction by <hi>Honorius,</hi> in the year of Christ 410, <note place="margin">An. Dom. 4104</note> and of the coming of <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> 462, the Right of Government falling into their own hands, began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir themselves at first in their new Freedom, living after their own Laws, and standing on their own Defence; But as People more fond of the name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> than apprehensive of the weight of <hi>Governing well,</hi> they grew heady and violent in their new Affairs, and eager in what they understood nor. None more stout and daring in Counsels, but in Action none so fearful and and relenting, all pretending to know what ought to be done, yet all drawing back in the performance.</p>
                  <p>Thus in a short time, when the heat of Liberty was once spent, and the Enemy daily increased, they quickly found their old temper returning upon them, a slavish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind, and slothfulness of Body, then they perceived it was not stomack, or a hot and sudden love of Licence could protect them, but that diligence, wisdom, and labour was wanting, so that their Spirits drooping continually, they shrunk by degrees into their former tameness of mind, and grew as weary of their new tried Liberty, as they had been of their old Subjection. For being no longer able to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:58825:180"/>
support themselves against the continual Incursions of the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> they again sent Letters to <hi>Honorius,</hi> humbly begging his protection, and vowing Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Rome,</hi> if their Enemies were once removed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Honorius</hi> out of compassion to their Miseries, rather than desire of Rule, sent them a Legion, who coming over made great slaughter of the <hi>Picts,</hi> soon drove them beyond the <hi>Marches,</hi> and having cleared the Fronteirs, caused a Wall or Rampire to be built cross the Island, from Sea to Sea, where <hi>Agricola</hi> had formerly built one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, between the Friths of <hi>Edinborough</hi> to the City <hi>Alcluith</hi> on <hi>Dunbritton,</hi> but it being cast up with Turf only, and that slightly, as soon as the <hi>Romans</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the defence of <hi>France,</hi> the Barbarous Nations soon broke down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run it, and pouring into the <hi>Province</hi> like a Torrent, made great devastations, killing, burning, and destroying wheresoever they came.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> on the other hand, out of their Carroughs, or Leather-Vessels, wherein <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> they used to pass the <hi>Scitick</hi> Vale, land in whole swarms, and with no less fury, out-rage and cruelty, carry, harry, and make havock of all; thus bandied between two merciless and insolent Enemies, both striving which should out-do the other in Spoil and Rapine.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> once again send their Embassadours to <hi>Rome,</hi> in mournful manner, <note place="margin">An. Dom. 418.</note> with their Garments rent, and sand on their heads, humbly imploring that they would not permit so Ancient a Province, and so serviceable to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to become a prey and scorn to Barbarians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Third, then Emperour, pitying their Complaints, sends certain Regiments to their assistance, who coming upon these greedy Spoilers, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent only on Plunder, made great slaughter of them, rescued the <hi>Britains,</hi> and cleared the whole Province. Then, partly at the publick Charges of the State, and partly at the Contributions of private Men, they built another Wall, not of Turf as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but of Stone, twelve foot high and eight broad, traversing the Island in a direct line from East to West, where <hi>Severus</hi> had walled before, namely, from <hi>Newcastle</hi> on <hi>Tine</hi> to <hi>Solway-Frith</hi> on the <hi>Irish</hi> Sea, between certain Cities placed as Fronteirs to stave-off the Enemy. On the South-coast also, being an open Shoar, and not free from their Inroads, they built Towers, cast-up Forts and Block-houses at conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient distances, and on certain heights.</p>
                  <p>Having thus secured the Island on both sides, they exhorted the <hi>Britains</hi> now to <note place="margin">An. Dom. 423.</note> stand in their own defence, and manfully to maintain their Country against rude and barbarous People, not stronger than themselves, if their own Fears had not made them so, to which end they instructed them in the Art of War, and left pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of their Arms and Weapons behind them, and with many encouraging words, and lectures of Valour to a Hen-hearted Auditory, gave them a final farewel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intention to return again.</p>
                  <p>This last friendly Expedition of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was under the Conduct of <hi>Gallio</hi> of <hi>Ravenna, Buchanan</hi> names him <hi>Maximianus,</hi> and writes, That <hi>Firgus,</hi> first King of <note place="margin">Buehanan.</note> the <hi>Scots,</hi> after their second coming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Dursius</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> were both slain in fight against him, and that <hi>Dioneth,</hi> a supposed King of <hi>Britain,</hi> or Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> who assisted them, hardly escaped the Battle. But of any such person as <hi>Dioneth</hi> ruling in this Island our Histories make no mention, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it is, that they who but just now sued so earnestly to <hi>Rome</hi> for succour against the Common Enemy, the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> should now enter into League with them, and oppose their Friends, who came so far and kindly to relieve them.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Dursius</hi> and <hi>Firgus,</hi> Kings of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> the supposed Leaders of all these Incursions into <hi>Britain,</hi> as it is not my business to gain-say their History, so neither will I relate their Actions in particular, although set down in the <hi>Scottish</hi> Histories with exactness of Circumstances, namely, their order of Battle, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Fight, their different Entrenchings, Marches, Sieges, Numbers of slain, and Articles of Peace, things whereof <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> make not the least mention, Authors of far greater Credit and Antiquity than any produced by the <hi>Scottish</hi> Writers.</p>
                  <p>But thus much may be noted in this place, that it seemeth not to accord with the truth of History, that those Nations that at this time infested the Island, rather with wild and licentious Inroads, than a just and regular War, and are described
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:58825:180"/>
(by <hi>Gildas</hi>) like ravenous Wolves, or Tories, issuing from their hollow Caves, Dens, <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> and lurking Holes, and alwaies taking advantage of the <hi>Romans</hi> absence, should be supposed to be under Order and Discipline, in a steady course of Invasion, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we consider with what ease they were repulsed at the appearance of one Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion only, and how, without the least molestation, they suffered the Wall to be built, a thing they would never have permitted, had they been as well linked together in great Bodies, and under good Government, as their minds were unanimous in Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Rapine. No more therefore are the <hi>Scottish</hi> Writers to be heeded in such Relations, than <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> when he varies most from Authentick story.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the <hi>Romans</hi> were finally departed, and their Resolution of not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gildas:</hi> An.

In the mean time, they who kept Garrison on the Wall like idle Spectatours, and more dreading to be assaulted, than daring to oppose the growing Enemy, stood trembling and quaking upon the Battlements, like Men placed rather to view their Losses than to revenge them; whilest day and night they kept ward in their Stations, by continual beholding their Foe, they conceived the more dreadful apprehensions of them, and by doing nothing spent their Spirits and grew idle.</p>
                  <p>Thus standing with Weapons in their hands, and esteeming it Manhood sufficient if they did but face the Invader, they tamely suffered the half-naked <hi>Picts</hi> to come under the Battlements, and with their Engines and Hooks to pull them down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, the rest, quitting the Wall, betook themselves to flight, and left the Enemy in possession of the Fronteir-Cities, who having with such ease broke into the Province, followed their fuccess with like vigour, pursuing the <hi>Britains</hi> into the Inland-Countries, and making havock and destruction wheresoever they came.</p>
                  <p>To the heap of these Calamities without were added no less from within, for the <hi>Britains</hi> employed in the Guard of the Fronteirs had neglected the Tylling Ground, upon which so great dearth and scarcity ensued, that they were constrained, for want of Provisions, to rob and pillage each other. They who came from the North, as may probably be supposed, and had fled from the! Enemy, being not able to buy when they came to the Southern parts, seized what they could find, upon which rose Discords and Animosities, Civil dissensions and Wars. For this Nation (as <hi>Gildas</hi> observeth) though feeble in repressing an Enemy, yet in homebred-quarrels was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> obstinate and hardy.</p>
                  <p>And now whilest they wore themselves out with continual acts of Hostility, the Famine grew general upon all, the whole Country was exhaust of Bread, the staff and strength of life, and those miserable People that remained were forced to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their lives by Hunting, and such like Prey as the wild Forrest would afford. Notwithstanding these great calamities and troubles in the State, there happened new divisions in the Church, for Heresie groweth fastest in distracted times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agricola</hi> the Son of <hi>Severianus,</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> had spread his Doctrine wide among the <hi>Britains,</hi> but the sounder part disliking his Opinions, but not able to confute them, beg'd assistance from the Churches in <hi>France,</hi> who sent them <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Auxere,</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> of <hi>Troys;</hi> These coming into <hi>Britain,</hi> by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduous preaching in Churches, Fields and Streets, and, as some write, by doing Miracles, confirmed many in the Faith, regained others, and in a publick Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Verulam</hi> confuted the chief of the Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>The time of <hi>Germanus</hi> his Arrival is uncertainly guessed at, most probably in the year 430. <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> placeth him under the year 446, not long before the entrance of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and indeed, certain it is that he had to do <note place="margin">Mat. <hi>Westm:</hi>
                     </note> with that Nation here, as shall be shewn in the sequel; But that it was after they were called into this Island under the Leading of <hi>Hengist</hi> and <hi>Horsus,</hi> and not before, cannot be collected. For the Incursions of the <hi>Saxons</hi> into <hi>Britain</hi> were no new thing before their publick Arrival, wherefore I shall follow on the course of <hi>Germanus</hi> his Actions in these troubled times, not breaking them into parts and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:58825:181"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> with joynt Force, making daily inroads from the North, those <hi>Britains</hi> who for fear or hunger had not yielded themselves to the Enemy, but stood daily upon their defence, gathering into a Body from out of Mountains, Caves and thick Woods, full of bushes, Bryers and Brambles, began to march with all their strength against the Enemy, but jealous of their own Power, and it may be now, as <hi>Gildas</hi> writeth, trusting more on the assistance of God than Man, they sent for <hi>Germanus,</hi> and his Colleague, in the strength of whose prayers they had more considence than in the numbers of their Men; Being come, their presence in the Camp was no less than if a whole Army were joyned to their assistance. It was in the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> when the People, instructed by the daily Sermons of these Pastors, came flocking to receive Baptism. There was a place in the Camp set apart for Divine Service, and dressed up with Boughs on Easter-day.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy having intelligence of this, and thinking that the <hi>Britains</hi> were more intent upon Religion than the War, advance, after the Paschal Feast, as to a certain Victory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>German,</hi> who had notice of their approach, undertakes the conduct of that day, and riding out with some selected Troops to discover a place fit for Ambush, finds a Vally, encompassed with many risings, through which the Enemy was to pass. Here he placeth his Men, and orders them that what word they heard him pronounce, the same they should repeat with an universal Shout.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy goeth on secretly, and <hi>German</hi> thrice aloud cries <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> which answered by the Souldiers, with a sudden noise and clamour is doubly ecchoed from the Hills and Vallies. The <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> startled hereat, and supposing it the noise of a huge Host, flung down their Arms and fled, and for hast many of them were drowned in the River which newly they had passed.</p>
                  <p>The Victory thus obtained without hands, gave to the <hi>Britains</hi> plenty of Spoil, and proeured to the Person and Preaching of <hi>German</hi> greater Authority and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than before.</p>
                  <p>The place of this Victory is reported to have been in <hi>Flintshire,</hi> by a Town called <hi>Guid-eruc,</hi> and the River is supposed <hi>Allen,</hi> where a Field retains the name of <hi>Maes German</hi> unto this day.</p>
                  <p>Some have called into question that part of the Relation which maketh mention of the People flocking to be Baptized by <hi>German,</hi> seeing that <hi>Pelagianism</hi> was never Re-baptized, and the Heathenish Religion, for a long time before, is not so much as heard of in <hi>Britain?</hi> But, I think, this cannot take away from the truth of this story, seeing 'tis writ by a Man living so near the times, for it is not to be meant of the whole Army of <hi>Britains,</hi> but of some part only, and those perhaps Friends and Allies to them; For in a mixture of Nations which in War, either the taking of Prisoners, or the Revolt of disaffected persons, naturally causeth, what wonder is it if there might be <hi>Scots, Picts</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Germans</hi> Camp, especially if we consider what intelligence he had of the approach of the Enemy, and the exact time of their coming, which could be given him by none but such who fled over to them, and that many of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> were desirous to embrace the Christian Faith, and wanted only opportunity to do it, may be gathered, in that <hi>Palladius</hi> a Deacon, about this time was ordained, and sent by <hi>Celestine</hi> the Pope to be Bishop over them. No marvel therefore, if many of the <hi>Picts</hi> entring into <hi>Britain,</hi> and beholding the Lives and Conversations of the Christians here, might be converted from their savage Customes and Religions, and desire to be Baptized by that Man, of whose miraculous Life and Doctrine they had heard such wonderous Relations.</p>
                  <p>These Astions happened about the year 430, when <hi>German</hi> departing the Land, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> taking advantage of his absence, prepared again for a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion. The <hi>Britains</hi> wearied out with continual Wars, and not expecting any more Miracles for their deliverance, send to <hi>Rome</hi> for assistance about the <hi>39th.</hi> year of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and of our Lord 446. Their Letters were directed to <hi>AEtius,</hi> or <hi>Agitius,</hi> then President of <hi>Gallia,</hi> with this Inscription: <note place="margin">

                  <q>We the poor Remnant of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and your Vassals, besides the Enemy, are afflicted by Famine and Mortality, which at this time extreamly rageth in our Land.</q>
                  <p>Withal they beg him to consider, how nearly it concerned the Honour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to protect and succour a Province, which for five hundred years almost, had constantly adhered to their Interest, that if they were now weakned, and in a condition rather to <hi>take</hi> than <hi>give</hi> assistance, they desire him to call to mind, that it was <hi>Their</hi> occasions, not their own, that had reduced them to those necessities; the strength of the <hi>British</hi> Youth were exhausted in the <hi>Roman</hi> Service, and the Land lest naked to uphold the grandure of the Empire. And, besides the loss of their Youth, their wealth had been wasted and consumed in maintaining so many Legions in forreign Service, and their stores of Corn spent in supplying the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces abroad.</p>
                  <p>To these their urgent Requests they receive no Answer at all, for the Empire sorely infested and overspread with <hi>Huns</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> was not in any condition to give them assistance; insomuch that wearied out with continual Complaining in vain, and the Famine daily increasing upon them, like Men in a desperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their comfort lying only between the choice of two Evils, some meerly to get sustenance, yield themselves to the disposal of the Enemy, whilest others, more hardy and resolute, maintain their lives with what the Woods and Forrests afford them, oftentimes, as their Necessities urged, or Advantage invited them, would <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> they make sallies upon the Enemy, and that with good success, led on (as may be guessed) by some worthy Commander, who advised them not to trust in their own Power but the Divine assistance; And perhaps, if computation would permit, which in these times is very much confused, by the <hi>Divine assistance</hi> nothing more is here meant, than the fore-said miraculous Victory obtained by <hi>German,</hi> near the River <hi>Allen;</hi> But however I shall follow the series of <hi>Gildas</hi> in setting down the History of these Times.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> or <hi>Irish</hi> Robbers (for so are they indifferently called) finding such stout resistance where they least suspected it, for the present depart home with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to return upon the next fair occasion inviting them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Picts</hi> also, who not long before, as hath been mentioned, had seated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the utmost part of the Island, even unto the Wall, now retired to their new Habitations, and, saving a few Inroads, which now and then they made upon the Borderers, lived without any great molestation, so that the <hi>Britains</hi> eased from their Enemies began anew to tyll the Ground, which after long discontinuance yielded her fruit in such abundance, as the like in no Age before had ever been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
                  <p>But the Sore of Famine being healed and skinned, others more virulent broke out, <hi>Riot, Luxury</hi> and <hi>Wantonness,</hi> the usual attendants of Fulness and Plenty, and with them all Vices incident to Humane nature. For, besides <hi>Fornication, Adultery, Uncleanness, Rapes, Incest,</hi> the necessary Companions of Intemperance, <hi>Contentions, Strifes, Civil discords</hi> arose among them, and they who had been feeble and weak in repressing a forreign Enemy, in vindicating their private Animosities were eager and obstinate.</p>
                  <p>But that which <hi>Gildas</hi> faith most especially conduced to the corrupting of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the overturning the state of all goodness in the Land, and so continued in his daies, was, the hatred of Truth, and the Maintainers of it, the love of Lies, with the Forgers thereof. Evil they called good, and good evil. To be wicked and lewd was honourable, but to be vertuous poor and disgraceful; blind themselves they became haters of the Light, and the measures of their Actions was what was
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:58825:182"/>
most pleasing to themselves. No other differences of good or evil were admitted, all weighed alike, saving that the worst was most an end the weightier. All things were done directly contrary to the Publick welfare and safety, not by the Laity only, but the Clergy also, and they who should have been Examples of Vertue often proved the Ring-leaders to Vice. Many of them lovers of Wine and Drunkenness, wallowing in that sin grew benumm'd and senseless, others swoln with Pride and Wilfulness became contentious, envious, indisereet in their Judgments, uncapable to distinguish what was good, what evil, what lawful, or unlawful.</p>
                  <p>Thus qualified, both Priests and People, they resolve (saith <hi>Gildas</hi>) to choose <note place="margin">Gildas.</note> several Kings of their own (for that they had not all one Monarch, appears not by the custome of the past Ages only, but the succeeding also) the particular time of their election, as by the confused computations of those troublesome daies, may be most probably guessed was in the year 446, or 447, which was the year of <hi>AEtius</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 446, <hi>or</hi> 447.</note> his Consulship, as appeareth out of the Kalendar of the <hi>Consuls,</hi> when having sued to <hi>Rome</hi> for Assistance they were absolutely rejected, and so forced to stand upon their own safeguard.</p>
                  <p>And who would not think but that a People thus left to themselves, and bereaft of so potent Allies as the <hi>Romans,</hi> would have behaved themselves cautiously and warily in so great a concern. But hear what <hi>Gildas</hi> saith of their heady and rash proceedings in this weighty Affair: <hi>Kings</hi> (saith he) <hi>were Anointed not according to Divine approbation, but the Voices and Suffrages of such as were more Cruel than others, and again as suddenly deposed and murthered by their Advancers, without examining the truth, to make room for others more Insolent and Cruel. If any of their Princes seemed more mild, and inclinable to good Counsel, upon him, as the Subverter of</hi> Britain, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to his Person, the open hatred and malice of all was levelled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Affairs proceeded in the State, and in the Church no less Commotions ensued, for <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> again getting head, through the means of a sew, the <hi>British</hi> Clergy not able to withstand it, intreat the second time <hi>German</hi> to their assistance; He with <hi>Severus</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Lupus,</hi> his former Associate, coming into the Island, stand not now to dispute as formerly (for the generality were not infected with the Heresie) but discovering the Heads and teachers of the new Doctrine, adjudge them to Exile, who being by the Secular Power delivered to him, were by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed beyond Sea, where he disposed of them in such places as they could neither infect others, and were themselves under cure, by better Instruction; <hi>Germanus</hi> the same year died in <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After his departure the <hi>Britains</hi> receive News, that their old Enemies, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> were returning with greater preparations than ever, that they threatned the destruction of the whole Land, and intended no less than to plant themselves from one end thereof to the other. But before their Arrival, as if the Instruments of Divine Vengeance were at strife, which should first destroy a wicked Nation, the residue that the Sword and Famine left alive, were now swept away with a sore Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, insomuch that the living scarce sufficed to bury the dead.</p>
                  <p>But for the present, as one Evil drives off another, the destroying Plague pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the Land from the more Barbarous spoylers, which, for fear of the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion durst not engage too far in the Inland Countries; But as soon as the Infection ceased the Enemy began to advance, and were entred as far as <hi>Stamford</hi> on the River <hi>Welland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>VORTIGERN,</hi> then King of the <hi>Britains,</hi> newly elected to the Crown, hearing of their approach, was then meditating how best he might secure himself, and had resolved to flie into those parts of the Island now called <hi>Wales</hi> (of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of this <hi>Vortigern,</hi> and his advancement to the Crown, I have spoken before in the <hi>British</hi> History, under the Emperour <hi>Honorius</hi>) he is described by the truest Historians, an insolent and haughty Tyrant, neither wise in Counsel, nor experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in War, yet doted on by the People for his Vices so well suiting with their own, heedless of the Common danger, and esteeming the Publick Treasure as a Fund only, to satisfie his Lusts and Extravagance. Nevertheless, awakened with the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the People, he summons a General Councel to provide some better means than hitherto had been found, to put an end to these Incursions from the North, where it was concluded, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> should be called into <hi>Britain,</hi> and Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours

                  <p>
                     <hi>Most Worthy</hi> Saxons, <hi>The distressed</hi>

Leave us not below our present Enemies, and we shall be ready to perform whatsoever by you shall be imposed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus writes an Author of their own, yet <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> saies, that they promised no Subjection, but League and Amity only.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> thus invited to what they willingly would have sued for, made no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, but returned this short and speedy Answer: <hi>Be assured that the</hi> Saxons <hi>will be true Friends to the Britains, and not only stick close by them in their Adversity, but be at all times ready to procure their wealth and prosperity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Embassadours return joyful with these Tidings, but how the <hi>Saxons</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their Promise you may read in <hi>Gildas,</hi> and shall be declared in their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing History.</p>
                  <p>At what time these things happened in <hi>Britain,</hi> according to the diversity of Computations, in this most confused Age, can be but uncertainly guessed at. For by the several accounts of Authors there are at least twenty years difference, whilest some measure the time from the <hi>AEra,</hi> others from another, amidst so great variety I have thought fittest to follow the most received Opinion, which makes the Entrance of the <hi>Saxons</hi> to be about the year of our Lord 448, or 449, and the Actions of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in this Island, in the year 431 to 447, in which time both his Expeditions are <note place="margin">Saxons, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 448, <hi>or</hi> 449. German, <hi>An.</hi> 431, <hi>to</hi> 447.</note> included. Neither let any wonder, that being the <hi>Saxons</hi> came not before the year 448, and <hi>German</hi> is reported to have defeated that Nation before the year 447, how this can possibly be reconciled, since I have said before, that it was no new thing for the <hi>Saxons</hi> to make Incursions into this Island long before they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited hither by publick Authority. Yet that the Reader may not be ignorant of the diversity of Actions, which (as I said) proceeded from diversities of <hi>AEra's,</hi> I will set them down distinctly according to the most Authentick Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bede</hi> and his Followers reckon the years thus: <hi>In the thirty first year of</hi> Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius <hi>the Younger, and of</hi> Christ 430, <hi>the</hi> Britains <hi>craved assistance, but in vain, of</hi> AEtius <hi>the third time Consul.</hi> Thus <hi>Bede.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here may be enquired which is the principal <hi>AEra</hi> by which this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is made. If it be the year of Christ 430, then the difference will be whether <hi>Theodosius</hi> began his Reign in the year 399, or 407, which are eight years difference; The <hi>AEra</hi> therefore must be brought from <hi>Theodosius</hi> his Reign, for <hi>Bede</hi> supposeth him to have begun his Reign in the year 399, and in some Copies of <hi>Ninnius</hi> there is a note of Computation adjoyned, which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> saith taketh away all scruples, and clears all doubts, which maketh the beginning of his Reign to have been <hi>Anno</hi> 407.</p>
                  <p>Again, if you make the chief <hi>AEra</hi> of this Computation to be <hi>AEtius third time Consul,</hi> the difference is greater, and we must now seek out the time from the Kalendars of the Councels, and we shall find that the third Consulship of <hi>AEtius</hi> fell out to be in the thirty ninth year of the said <hi>Theodosius,</hi> which should be (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Bede</hi>) in the year 439, and yet in that account is made after the Birth of Christ 446, and supposeth <hi>Theodosius</hi> to begin his Reign (according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in <hi>Ninnius</hi>) in the year 407, whereas, according to <hi>Bede,</hi> it should be in the year 399.</p>
                  <p>Thus much as to <hi>Bedes</hi> first Account, next he saith, <hi>Under</hi> Valentinian <hi>the Third,</hi> German <hi>once or twice came into</hi> Britain, <hi>and led an Army of</hi> Britains <hi>against the</hi> Picts <hi>and</hi> Scots.</p>
                  <p>Here the Computations must be made of <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour, and <hi>German.</hi> The time of <hi>Valentinian</hi> after <hi>Theodosius</hi> is uncertain, yet of necessity must be after the year 446, according to <hi>Bede,</hi> and yet <hi>German</hi> by approved Authors (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> relates) died in the year of Grace 435.</p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:58825:183"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninnius</hi> writeth, that <hi>German</hi> returned into his own Country after the death of <hi>Vortigern.</hi> Now considering that <hi>Vortigern</hi> called in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> saith, <hi>That in the first year of</hi> Martianus, <hi>and the year of our Lord 449, the Nation of the</hi> English Saxons <hi>arrived in</hi> Britain; how is it possible, that <hi>German</hi> dying in the year 435, could return into his Country after the death of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> who called in the <hi>Saxons</hi> in the year 449, and lived many years after.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Christ 433, <hi>Prosper Tyro,</hi> who then lived, writeth, That <hi>Britain,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prosp. Tyro.</note> after sundry overthrows, was brought in subjection to the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see one Computation draweth us back whilest another setteth us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, whilest some reckon from <hi>Christ,</hi> some from <hi>Theodosius,</hi> some from <hi>AEtius,</hi> some from <hi>Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Martianus,</hi> and others from <hi>German.</hi> But it will not be here amiss, among the rest of the Computations, to set down that which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in some Copies in <hi>Ninnius.</hi>

                  <p>From the year wherein the <hi>Saxons</hi> came into <hi>Britain,</hi> and were received by <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern,</hi> unto <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <p>By this Account, the coming of the <hi>Saxons</hi> into <hi>Britain</hi> was in the twenty first year of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Younger, in the year of our Lord 428, and this (saith Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>) cometh nearest to the Computation of <hi>Bede.</hi> But I have rather followed the received Opinion, calculated from the Consulship of <hi>AEtius,</hi> who (in <hi>Gildas</hi>) is called <hi>AEgitius,</hi> and in another Copy <hi>AEquitius,</hi> than by so far setting back the time, upon too much nicety, to differ from all other Historians.</p>
                  <p>Having shewn the manner, occasion, and time how the <hi>Saxons</hi> first entred this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will now be necessary to relate, by what craft and policy <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <p>But during the time, his Souldiers had so Couragiously acted in his absence as to deserve Reputation, he secretly managed his Interest at home, providing them greater supplies as occasion should offer, and gathering a greater Body together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice given him, speedily embarked with his Brother <hi>Horsus,</hi> and observe the luck of it, that no sooner they appeared in <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> but were received with great joy by King <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>After his Reception, the King gave him little or no rest (for the present) in his new Territories, till he had received further proofs of his Valour and Conduct, in quelling the rage and fury of his inveterate Enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Battles with these <hi>Picts</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> maintained to their great honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, yet some Historians will not believe that ever King <hi>Vortigern</hi> was a Man of so weak a Judgment, so earnestly to urge so crafty and powerful a Nation, as the <hi>Saxons</hi> then were, to his assistance, but that at first they came by chance into the Island, according to an ancient Custome among the <hi>English Saxons,</hi> a People in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> as it was also at first among other Nations, that when in multitudes a People so increased that their own Country was not able to contain them, by an especial Edict of their Prince a set number was chosen out to cast Lots, how many for that year were to depart the Land, and seek out new employments in the Wars of other Nations, For so hath it been conjectured of these, that they came out of their own Country into <hi>Britain,</hi> to offer themselves to serve in their Wars for meer want of employment and sufficient maintenance at home, which was the first occasion given for their Arrival into this Land.</p>

                     <hi>Hengist,</hi> by this time, having gained a considerable Interest among the <hi>Britains,</hi> and more especially perceiving, that the King wholly depended upon his Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, takes his advantage in considering the best and surest means how he might spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily advance his greater Promotion, not only during his own life, but his Heirs and Successours after him, in order to which <hi>Polidore Virgil</hi> saith, <hi>That he fenced a Country round about, with which he was only entrusted, afterwards planted Garrisons in such</hi>

                  <p>The King not yet perceiving the shower of Misfortune with black Clouds threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, takes <hi>Hengists</hi> further Advice in hastning speedy Orders for a greater supply of <hi>German</hi> Forces, in pretence of securing the Land more firmly from the rage and power of his Enemies, which, in truth, at last proved but to promote and strengthen his own <hi>Greatness,</hi> which so long he had fore-cast in his head to accomplish, esteeming it also to be a great Honour to his Name and Family, that he should approve himself to be the only Man that first laid the foundation of a <hi>Saxon Monarchy</hi> in so Great and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned a Kingdom as <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> which was not only so esteemed in those daies, but by the <hi>Phoenicians, Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> their Predecessours.

                  <p>The King no sooner saw this Beautiful Virgin at a Banquet, unto which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by <hi>Hengist,</hi> but so infinitely admired her Person, Beauty, and Noble Behaviour, that nothing would divert his resolution, or quench the heat of so sudden a passion, but the deserting his own Queen to obtain <hi>Rowena</hi> in Marriage, but <hi>Hengist</hi> craftily managing his designs, modestly complements the King with humble and submissive Excuses, much after this manner; <hi>That neither his Daughters degree, Person, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was suitable to Majesty, or the Greatness of his Dominions and Empire;</hi> yet at last, through the earuestness of the Kings Importunities, he gave his consent for his speedy Marriage.</p>
                  <p>By this <hi>Hengist</hi> was not only honoured in being Related to a <hi>British</hi> Prince, but firmly received a confirmation of the Kings Gratitude, the Kingdom of <hi>Kent</hi> for his Recompence, which formerly had been governed by one <hi>Guorongus,</hi> a Vice-Roy to manage State Affairs in that Province.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>German</hi> Alliance with King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> in a short time made the <hi>Saxon</hi> Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates more burthensome to the State than their late Enemies, which at first a little startled the King, nevertheless the crafty and fortunate inventions of <hi>Hengist,</hi> strengthned by the power of that beloved <hi>Rowena,</hi> so eclipsed the Kings sight, yea so weakned his Power, that he gained further leave to send into <hi>Germany</hi> for his Brother <hi>Occa,</hi> and his Son <hi>Ebusa.</hi> The pretence was, that the Enemy grew too heady and strong for him, and that by such aids and assistance he could better undertake the defence of the South parts, when at the same time, They, if here, might preserve the North. Some report, although not without contradiction to others, that this <hi>Occa</hi> was the Son of <hi>Hengist,</hi> and <hi>Ebusa</hi> his Uncles Son, but the difference in Opinions in this point is not much material: sufficient that the story is true that such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by name, were called hither by the advice and procurement of <hi>Hengist,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the power of a <hi>Saxon</hi> Interest.</p>
                  <p>The Nobility of the <hi>British</hi> Nation now sensible of their destruction, knew it was too late to reclaim a Luxurious and careless Prince, and as to little purpose to endeavour the recalling of a neglected opportunity, wherein once they might have stopt the current of such dangerous Events and Accidents; For their Consultations, now, with the King, how to prevent <hi>Occa</hi> and <hi>Ebusa</hi> from entring the <hi>British</hi> shoars were wholly rejected, through the inseparable affection he bore to the content and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of his new Associate. The manner of <hi>Occa</hi> and <hi>Ebusa's</hi> behaviour after their Arrival, is briefly thus:</p>
                  <p>After the King had given his consent for the landing of a powerful Army of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> there came with them, as their Generals, <hi>Occa</hi> and <hi>Ebusa,</hi> and coasting towards <hi>Britain,</hi> they struck Sail for the <hi>Orkney</hi> Isles, after whose arrival the Inhabitants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great and unspeakable damages, and not long after the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> bore an equal share in affliction, for after they had sufficiently executed their Tyranny
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:58825:184"/>
upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> they proceeded to <hi>Northumberland,</hi> where, for some time at their first entrance intended only to make a short stay, but in process of time, too well approving the accommodation of that Country, they esteemed it a place worthy of longer residence, yet not so fully and absolutely possessing it as to govern it under the title of KINGS, but Subjects of <hi>Kent,</hi> till ninety nine years after their first possession.</p>
                  <p>Now it is that again we hear, how infinitely afflicted and moved the Subjects of King <hi>Vortigern</hi> were at the increasing Power of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and because (as I said before) they could not perswade him into the belief of such great dangers likely to happen, they universally agreed in Counsel among themselves to bereave him of his Regal <note n="†" place="margin">Deposed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter six years Government.</note> Power and Dignity, and in whose stead they placed his Son <hi>Vortimer,</hi> which, for the present, put the Nation into no small confusion and hubbub, besides gave new occasions to the <hi>Saxons</hi> to revive Insurrections, and commit upon the distressed Inhabitants most deplorable spoil and havock.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bede,</hi> and others, are silent of <hi>Vortimers</hi> taking possession of the Crown about this time, and consequently that there happened no such fewd and heart-burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween King <hi>Vortigern</hi> and his Nobility, upon the account of the <hi>Saxons</hi> Arrival into this Land. For they say, that when the <hi>Saxons</hi> came into the Land, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as Friends, Aiders, and Assisters of the disturbed <hi>Britains,</hi> against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But I conceive, <hi>Bede,</hi> and others, might mistake the true Timing of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions in that State, forgetting the time of the breach of Covenant between them, and so might easily mistake one time for another, as I find the <hi>British</hi> History in several other cases, are worthy of too great blame and reprehension.</p>
                  <p>What Courage the <hi>Britains</hi> took after all these discouragements, in the daies of <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> shall be shewn in a following Treatise relating to the transactions in that Princes Reign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hengist,</hi> by Birth, however he dissembled his Quality in that modest behaviour of his, in behalf of his Daughter, to King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> was of the Princely Blood of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Race, born in <hi>Angria</hi> in <hi>Westphalia,</hi> the Son of <hi>Wiht-Gisil,</hi> of the Line of Prince <hi>Wooden.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Kent</hi> he obtained by his power and policy, not Right, which in the daies of <hi>Julius Casar</hi> was never known to be an intire Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as it was alwaies governed by four Petty Kings of the <hi>British</hi> Race. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he obtained not the Kingdom by right of Inheritance, yet was he to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his Policy, Valour, and Conduct, He possest not the Kingdom above se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, but laid the foundation of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Government, and approved himself an Example, yea the first Rule and direction to <hi>Egbert,</hi> afterwards a K. of the West <hi>Saxons,</hi> how to reduce the whole Kingdom into one happy and entire state of Monarchy; So that before we proceed to the History and Chronicle of his Successours, who, after their Arrival, bore the greatest sway in this Kingdom, and by success of Arms, and vast supplies received from the Continent, easily overcame and mastered the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Natives, a People at that time reduced to a small number, laden with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, yea worn out with continual Calamities, it will not be amiss first to set down their Original and progress through most parts of the World ere they arrived into this Island, their Religion, some Customes, annexing other memorable things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to their Arts and Polity, that having at once before our eyes the Vertues and Vices of our Ancestours, we may know the better what to follow, what to avoid, and may the better be enabled how to discern the methods and means whereby to preserve that Empire intire and inviolable, the Foundations whereof have been by them laid so firm, solid, and lasting.</p>
                  <p>But before we proceed to the Antiquity and History of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to treat briefly of the Original and Antiquity of the <hi>Romans,</hi> a People so renowned for their ancient Conquests, and so well esteemed for their good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Nation.</p>

            <head>THE ANTIQUITY AND ORIGINAL OF THE ROMANS,</head>
            <p>THEIR Religion, government in State Affairs, discipline in War, with several of their Rules and Methods relating to their Polity; Unto which is added Some Observations upon what relates more particularly to the <hi>Greek</hi> Idolatry, omitted in a former Treatise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PLUTARCH</hi> reckons up many supposed Founders of ROME, <hi>Herodotus, Marsylus,</hi> and some others, will have them descended from the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and <hi>Coecilius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Historiographer, in <hi>Strabo,</hi> proves that <hi>Rome</hi> was built by the <hi>Graecians,</hi> because the <hi>Romans,</hi> after <note place="margin">Strabo, <hi>lib. 5, p. 159.</hi>
               </note> the manner of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> by ancient Institution and Custome did sacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and that the <hi>Romans</hi> also worshipt the Mother of <hi>Evander;</hi> Yet the most vulgar received Opinion, is, that <hi>Rome</hi> was the work of <hi>ROMULUS</hi> from the Foundation, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> were a Body aggregate, and compounded of <hi>Sabines</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> and others are of Opinion, which I have shewn in another place, that they were a conflux of the worst of the Neighbouring People of that State; For <hi>Romulus,</hi> after the deposing and murthering his Uncle <hi>Amulius,</hi>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:58825:185"/>
and re-instating his Grandfather <hi>Numitor</hi> in the <hi>Albane</hi> Throne (having got together Shepheards and some Malefactours, that had fled for of Justice from their natural Princes) soon left <hi>Aiba</hi> to the quiet enjoyment of his Grandfather, he himself not being willing to live under any other Laws than his own, or else the nobleness of his Ambition dehorting him from injuring one, whom lately he had so generously restored, resolves to contrive the model and platform of his future Government, yea lay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the foundation of his own Greatness; For being made KING by the general consent of his ragged Associates, and that consent confirmed, ratified, and establisht by lucky signs and tokens from the Gods; after several contrivances and designs pitches upon Mount <hi>Palatine,</hi> where he himself, and his Brother, had been exposed by their Uncle <hi>Amulius,</hi> as a fortunate place for their erecting a New City, hoping that as the Gods (from a poor, miserable, and abandoned Infant) had made him a glorious King, so by the same power they might, in time, of this little Village make a considerable Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Moreover he looked upon this Mountain as the fittest place for defence, if any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy should dare to oppose him, and a place very inconvenient for the approaches and assaults of all Besiegers, nevertheless secured it with a Ditch and Wall. But lest the three adjoyning Mountains, <hi>viz. Capitoline, Coelian,</hi> and <hi>Quirinal,</hi> might rather serve (as they lay then) for <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Bulwarks,</hi> from whence the Enemy might storm and molest his New City, he fortified them with a Ditch and a Wall also, and placing therein Garrisons, they served instead of Castles for the security of the City; But after he had subdued <hi>T. Tatius</hi> King of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> he gave to him and his People the <hi>Tarpeian,</hi> or <hi>Capitoline</hi> Mountain to inhabit, bringing it also within the Walls and compass of the City. <hi>L. Tarquinius Priscus</hi> mended and repaired the Walls with Stone, which before were cast up with Mud and ordinary Rubbish, but <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> was the first that encompast <hi>Rome</hi> with a Stone-wall, adding to the City three other Hills also, both Kings and People being as ambitious in augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their City, as they were in propagating and increasing the largeness of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Empire.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It was so enlarged and admirably beautified with the Spoyls and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Chiefest places of <hi>EUROPE,</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> (which was first scarce a Mile in compass) was afterwards esteemed as one of the Wonders of the Earth. And without question 'twas a pleasing spectacle, which could make St. <hi>Augustine</hi> (otherwise a Person of great gravity and self-denial) to his other two pious wishes, annexed this, <hi>Of seeing</hi> ROME <hi>in its full Glory.</hi>

               <head>Of the distinction and division of the People.</head>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Romulus</hi> had secured his City, he began to think on conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient waies of Policy whereby he might the better attain to a certain method of Government, that might be best suitable to the genius of his rude and disorderly Subjects, who therefore ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them into three National Tribes or Wards.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The first Ward was of the <hi>SABINES,</hi> called <hi>Tatienses.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The second of the <hi>ALBANS,</hi> viz. <hi>Ramnenses.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The third was of the <hi>LUCERES,</hi> named so from the Grove where the <hi>Asylum</hi> or Sanctuary stood, whither the People of all conditions daily repaired for defence and protection, and every Ward was divided into ten Parishes.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Then he distinguisht them according to their Degrees and Offices, calling the Oldest, best, and ablest of his Citizens (if they had Children) <hi>Patricii,</hi> and the Meane sort <hi>Plebeii,</hi> enacting Laws containing the duty, negotiation, and obligation of both.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Patricii</hi> were to superintend Religion, bear City Offices, administer Justice to the Common people. The <hi>Commons</hi> were to look to their Cattle, tyll the Ground, exercise all Handicrafts.</p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:58825:185"/>
               <p>Out of all those Seniours he chose an hundred, whom he called <hi>Senators</hi> from their Age, who for distinctions sake wore a half-Moon upon their Shooes after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, the letter standing for one hundred.</p>
               <p>With these he consulted in things more particularly concerning the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; but lest puft up with Pride, these <hi>Patricii</hi> should contemn and trample upon the Commonalty, and the Meaner sort envy the happiness of the Great ones, which in time might prove the seeds of <hi>Sedition,</hi> to prevent such Inconveniences he so effected the matter, that each should be mutually obliged, and absolutely depend one upon another, making it lawful for any of the Commons to choose (according to an old Custome of the <hi>Thessali</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi>) whom he pleased out of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricii</hi> for his Patron.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Patron</hi> was bound, by Office, to appear and answer for his Client in all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, to manage his business to the best advantage, whether absent or present. In a word, to endeavour as much as he could his ease and quiet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Client</hi> was to pay all due respects to his Patron, assist him with his Purse in raising Portions for his Daughters, to redeem him and his Sons (if taken Prisoners by the Enemy) into Liberty, to contribute largely, when their Patron sued for any honourable Office of State, to pay all pecuniary Mulcts arising from private Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, never expecting again eithe Use or Principal, and to present, on the Kalends of <hi>January,</hi> their Patrons with <hi>New-years-gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not lawful for them to give their Votes for any of the contrary Party, if they did, they were guilty of the breach of Statute made against Traytors, and fell under the Curse of their <hi>Decemviral-Law,</hi> viz. <hi>Patronus si Clienti, Cliensvè Patrono fraudem faxit, sacer esto.</hi> By vertue of which Law, they were mutually obliged to be faithful one to another.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Gentry took great pride in vying with one another, who had in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue most of these Clients, nay, many Provinces and Nations too, had one of the Great ones at <hi>Rome</hi> for their Patron, to plead for them in their absence, the Senate many times referring their Causes to be decided by the Patron they had chosen, resting satisfied in his determination.</p>
               <p>This Custome kept them so entirely united, that it preserved the City free from slaughter, and those inhuman Civil Wars, which (through neglect) afterwards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (though there were several Quarrels between the Commons and Gentry but soon compos'd) for the space of 630 years.</p>
               <p>After the Expulsion of <hi>Tarquin</hi> they were divided into Senatours, Knights, and People.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Senatour</hi> was he which at first was chosen by the Kings, next by the Consuls, afterwards by the Censors into that great Councel of State called the <hi>Senate,</hi> whether Noble-Man, Knight, or Plebeian. The value of a <hi>Senatours</hi> Estate, until the time of <hi>Augustus,</hi> was <hi>Octingenta Sestertia,</hi> 60001.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Knight</hi> (a Name of great esteem and honour among the <hi>Romans</hi>) was an Order betwixt the Senatour and Commonalty, they were chosen into that Society by the Censors, who at the time of their Election delivered them a Ring for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the Commonalty a Horse, to be maintained in Peace and War at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charge, so that the Commonalty were not allowed the use of Rings. The estimation of a Knights Estate was, <hi>Quadringenta Sestertia,</hi> viz. 30001. which sum, if any waies imbezelled, or they had committed any notorious Crime, those Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were taken from them, and themselves degraded from the reputation of that Order. Their Robes were little different from the Senatours, only the purple Studs, or Tufts of the Senatours Garment were somewhat larger. They degraded for unseemly Gestures, and irreverent Responsals, or for having lean and poor Horses, which seems to prove that their Horses were kept at their own charges, and not at the publick expence of the State.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Commonalty,</hi> whom <hi>Livy</hi> calls <hi>Ignota Capita,</hi> Men of little or no account, were <note place="margin">Livy.</note> the same there as in other Countries, yet if any of them had attained to a Knights E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and Procured from the Censors a Horse and Ring, he was accounted a Knight, and might be capable of being chosen into the Senate, yet those Senatours that were chosen from among the Plebeians, were, for any notorious fault, liable to be degraded, and have their Names enrowled in the <hi>Caerites Tabulae,</hi> or Censors
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:58825:186"/>
Tables, whereby they were deprived of giving their Votes, as did other Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
               <p>The next division of the People, was, into <hi>Nobiles, Novi,</hi> and <hi>Ignobiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Noble-Men</hi> were those that could produce the Images of their Ancestors, which were equivalent to our Coats of Arms; Their <hi>Novi</hi> were those that had only their own, and were beholding more to their Vertues, than their Ancestors, for their Nobility. <hi>Ignobiles</hi> were those that had none of their own, or of their Predecessours.</p>
               <p>Now an <hi>Image</hi> was the Effigies or representation of any Person of their Family, whose glorious Actions had formerly preferred him to any of the great Offices of State, which Images were used carefully to be kept in Wooden Presses, in the best part of their Houses; For, to none but those who had born the Curule Magistracy was the use of Images lawful, but after the Commons, by an Act of Senate, were made capable of obtaining those places as well as the Gentry (without doubt) they also might have the priviledges of using Images also.</p>
               <p>These Images were sometimes placed over the Gates of their Houses, with Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>UT EORUM VIRTUTES POSTERI NON SOLUM LEGERENT, SED ETIAM IMITARENTUR.</hi> Upon daies of Feasting and Rejoycing these Figures were spruck't up with Garlands and Flowers, but on daies of Mourning they were deprived of all their Jovial Ornaments, seeming to sympathize and partake with their sorrow. They were represented commonly but from the shoulders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the matter whereof they were made being Wax; But when any of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold died they were carried before the Corps (as I have shewn more fully in the Ceremonies of Deifying their Emperours) with a Body or Trunck annexed to them, <hi>Addito ut magnitudine quàm simillima apparerent reliquo corporis trunco,</hi> that they might seem proportionable in length to the Person deceased, they were dressed up in the Robes peculiar to the quality of the Person, the Ensigns of his Office being alwaies carried before him.</p>
               <p>The Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> were distinguisht by the difference of Freedoms in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and were termed either <hi>Liberti, Libertini, aut Ingenui.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Libertus</hi> was he that had been formerly a Slave or Servant, and afterwards was made free. The Son of any Person thus made free was called <hi>Libertinus,</hi> and the Son of two that were born free, or of two Libertines, was termed <hi>Ingenuus.</hi> These were capable of the Order of Knight-hood, but not of being elected into the Senate, which we may gather from <hi>Suetonius</hi> his own words, who saies, <hi>That, anciently, the dignity</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> 
                  <hi>and honour of being a Senatour, was conferred not upon the</hi> Pronepotes Civium Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum, <hi>but upon the</hi> Abnepotes, viz. <hi>such as were removed four degrees from a</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus.</p>
               <p>The usual way of their making them Free was after this manner, <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Ceremony of the</hi> Roman <hi>Freedom.</hi>
                  </note> The Master bringing his Servant, whom he desired should be made free, took the Servant by the Head, or any other part, saying to the Praetor, <hi>I will that this Man be made Free,</hi> and then he let him go. Some say, They used to take the Servant a box on the Ear, turn him round, and then let him go out of their hands. Then the <hi>Praetor</hi> laying a certain Rod, called <hi>Vindicta,</hi> upon the head of the Servant, said, <hi>I pronounce this Man free after the manner of the</hi> Romans, his Head at the same time being shaved, received of the <hi>Praetor</hi> a Cap in token of his Liberty.</p>

               <p>AFTER <hi>Romulus</hi> his death, his Successours, till the Reign of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>the Proud,</hi> thought it not only their greatest security to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their People with great Justice and Moderation, but the highest point of Glory also, to admit them into a share and participation of the Government, that it might be said, <hi>They Ruled over Princes rather than Slaves.</hi> And although most Writers agree, that the Polity of <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical,</hi> it seems rather to have been a mixture of Monarchy, Aristocracy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, therefore they were divided, accordingly, under the Government of a King, Senate, and Commonalty, the power and prerogative of their KING, was,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Jus rerum Sacrarum,</hi> a Right over all Ecclesiastical Affairs, to constitute what Religious Orders he pleased, and to see that all Sacrifices and their Ceremonies were rightly performed, and to offer up in his own Person, as being their <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> in case their Wars did not call him aside, all Propitiatory Oblations for the appeasing and averting the Anger of the Gods.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Legum morumque Patriarum custodiam,</hi> the preservation and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all Laws and Customes whatsoever, the determining of all Controversies of weight, referring all business of smaller consequence to the decision of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; yet in case of wrong Judgment, reserved to himself a power of otherwise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging the Matter as the cause required.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jus Senatus &amp; Comitiorum,</hi> a power of assembling Senate and People, propounding what he thought convenient, but first giving his Opinion of it again, yet that constantly took place, and prevailed most, which was confirmed by the Suffrages of the greatest number.</p>
               <p>In the dispose of the Senate, or Great Councel of the City, was the Publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, and consequently the ordering of the Revenues and Expences of the State, the Treasurers themselves having no power (unless for the use of the Kings, and that of the Consuls afterwards) to expend upon any Publick account whatsoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an especial Order and Decree of Senate; Under their cognizance also fell enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and heinous Crimes, committed within the Confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> likewise of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting and taking into favour any private Person, or City of <hi>Italy,</hi> that implored the favour of their assistance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That Great and Royal Prerogative of sending Embassadours, and giving Audience to those of Forreign Princes, was solely in the Power of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>These Senatours (at the sacking of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Gauls</hi>) were singly taken for Gods, and together, by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> his Embassadours, for so many Kings at an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. <hi>Tarquin,</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Elder,</hi> was so tender of displeasing them, that being presented by the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> with a Golden Crown, and an Ivory Scepter with an Eagle on the top, he refused to appear in publick with those Ensigns of Majesty, till <note place="margin">Dion, <hi>lib. 3.</hi> Livy, <hi>lib. 9.</hi>
                  </note> he had leave from the Senate and People, which Custome the succeeding Kings after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards retained.</p>
               <p>The Election of their Kings, and afterwards of the chief Ministers of State, the making of Laws, concluding on War or Peace, was altogether in the Jurisdiction of the People.</p>
               <p>By such Polity these Kings secured themselves from danger of the suspicion of Tyranny, and consequently assured and confirmed themselves in the love of their Subjects. Neither could the People reasonably desire innovation or change, where they were governed by no other Magistrates than of their own choosing, where they were obliged to live under no other Laws than of their own making, or forced to be engaged to any other Wars than of their own concluding.</p>
               <p>By this kind of <hi>Equilibrium</hi> of Power was <hi>Rome</hi> peaceably and happily governed by its first Kings, the Royal Prerogative seldom interfering with the Peoples privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But <hi>Tarquin,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>the Proud,</hi> overstraining his Prerogative, spoiled the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58825:187"/>
harmony and concord of the whole Government, the King and People being before like a <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>eighth</hi> that are Unisons, strike one and the other shakes, that is, they were highly concerned in the honour of their King, and the King in the loss and sufferings of his people; But <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who had seized on the Throne by Violence and Usurpation, was resolved to defend it by Rapine and Murther, and justifie them too by Insolence, though as insupportable as both; At his receiving the Title of MAJESTY he seemed to have laid down all his Humanity, for after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering his Father-in-law (over whose dead Corps <hi>Tarquinius</hi> his Wife commanded her Coach-man to drive, at her return from proclaiming her Husband KING) he trampled on both Priviledges and People; Some he banisht by his Cruelty, others through the insupportableness of his Behaviour, he committed continual Maf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres and Butcheries on the Senate and People. So that while this Feaver lasted, <hi>Rome</hi> was like the Torrid Zone (supposed by the Ancients) too hot to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
               <p>But the People, by the disposition and vertue of their Primitive Laws, being too well acquainted with <hi>Majesty</hi> to be made any longer Slaves, finding the Kings resolutenets and violent Nature not at all to be moved by their Complaints, which were constantly blasted with the odious Name of <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Treason,</hi> upon the ravishing the beautiful <hi>Lucretia</hi> by <hi>Tarquin's</hi> Son, <hi>Sextus,</hi> being animated and headed by <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus,</hi> were inraged to that degree of Courage, that they began to expostulate their Liberty with their Swords in their hands, driving the Tyrant (taught by his own Example) from the Throne into perpetual banishment, teaching Governours what it is to out-live the Affections of their well-meaning Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>After this they stood up so stiffly for Liberty, that though <hi>Porsenna</hi> King of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truria</hi> (commiserating <hi>Tarquin's</hi> condition) came with a puissant Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instate him in the <hi>Roman</hi> Throne, yet they maintained their cause so gallantly, and gave so many signal Testimonies, nay miracles of their Valour, witness the Actions of <hi>Horatius Cocles, Mutius Scaevola,</hi> that <hi>Porsenna</hi> of a terrible Enemy became a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Friend, and chose rather to make Peace with them (although the Victory was well nigh assuredly his own) than unjustly oppress so much an injured Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>That they might the better hereafter stop the Precipice of their future ruine, and free themselves from the like Jealousies and Fears, they first made it their business to render the word KING as detestable and odious as the power of a Tyrant; And the People taking a solemn Oath never to admit <hi>Monarchy</hi> among them for the future, they erected a Government consisting of two Officers chosen out of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioii,</hi> whom they called CONSULS, named so from their Duty, not their Power. They were <hi>two,</hi> that one might be a stop and check to the Ambition of the other; Their Government was Annual, that through shortness of time, and multiplicity of business, they might not have leisure enough to fall in love with the Majesty and Grandeur of their Office, supposing they would govern the better, when they knew, that afterwards they were to live private Men under the Commands of others.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus,</hi> who had been the chief Authors and sticklers in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling <hi>Tarquin,</hi> were chosen <hi>Consuls</hi> by the People, yet they fearing Tyranny might run in a Blood, deposed <hi>Collatinus</hi> in a short time after, for being a kin to <hi>Tarquinius Superbus,</hi> though he was Husband to <hi>Lucretia</hi> who had been so lately ravisht, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> in his place, who (to oblige and secure the Fears of the People) caused his own House to be pulled down, because it looked so like a Castle and place of Defence; <hi>Brute</hi> on the other side, hearing that there was a plot on foot, among the young Gentry of <hi>Rome,</hi> of restoring the <hi>Tarquin's,</hi> and that his own Sons had a hand in it, he brought them to the Market-place, where they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly whipt, and asterwards to the Block, where they lost their Heads.</p>
               <p>It was not lawful for any Person to sue for the Consulship till he had first past through, successively, the Offices of <hi>Quaestor, Aedile,</hi> and <hi>Praetor,</hi> and arrived to the forty third year of his Age, that is, past the extravagances of Youth, and free from the infirmities of Old Age, the greatest concerns of Peace and War depending solely on their management.</p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:58825:187"/>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had alwaies so great a respect and honour for this place of Dignity, by vertue of which their Empire was enlarged, their Liberties strongly upheld, that to encrease the <hi>Majesty</hi> of it, changed the Ancient date of things which before was <hi>ab Urbe condit à</hi> (in favour of them) into <hi>L. AE. T. V. Consulibus,</hi> viz. <hi>John Anoaks,</hi> and <hi>John Astiles</hi> being Consuls.</p>
               <p>The Ensigns of their Office was the <hi>Sella Eburnea,</hi> the <hi>Ivory Chair,</hi> which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about in a Charriot, where the <hi>Consul</hi> sate administring justice. The great Gown of State called <hi>Trabea,</hi> was worn, first by their Kings, asterwards by the Consuls. Lastly, twelve <hi>Lictors</hi> or <hi>Serjeants,</hi> which went before one Consul one Month, the second another, with bundles of Rods in their hands, and Axes bound up in the middle, the one gently to correct small offenders, the other to lop off (from Humane society) those that were otherwise incurable.</p>
               <p>These Consuls had power of stopping any proceedings in the Senate, as may be seen by Ambitious <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who passionately desired <hi>Africa,</hi> then the seat of the War and of Glory, for his Province, threatning the Senate, that unless he had his will he would have nothing to pass in the House.</p>
               <p>In the time of Sedition, or any sudden danger from abroad, they chose a <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> to whom was committed an Arbitrary Power, and different in nothing from a KING, but in Name, and the continuance of six months in the Office. From him lay no appeal to the People, twenty four <hi>Lictors</hi> went before him, as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended (by the greatness and Majesty of his Authority) he should affright the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious into their wonted Obedience, and having no equal to dispute his Commands, (the consequence of equality in Arms may be learnt from the fate of <hi>Paulus AEmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Ter. Varro,</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Cannae</hi>) might, by the suddenness of his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, prevent the Storm before it grew too blustering and violent, or, if it did, he might be in a better capacity of opposing it, the strength of an Army consisting in the Union of their Forces under one Commander; Besides, the opinions of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or an Assembly, commonly are very inconstant, great diversity and mutability arising from such numbers, or from the wranglings of two adverse Factions, we seldom finding any such irresolutions in a single Person.</p>
               <p>From hence, and from their sending single Persons as Governours of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces (however the Senate, and wiser sort of the People, dissembled) we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude on their approbation of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as the fittest form of Government to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel danger, and enlarge their Dominions, although their Judgments were perverted and blinded by Ambition (Passion being most commonly stronger than Reason) for in <hi>Aristocratical</hi> and <hi>Democratical</hi> Common-wealths, most Men are capable of a share in the Government, which under <hi>Monarchy</hi> was impossible for them to attain to; And we may easily see how much they esteemed Monarchy in the latter Ages, <hi>Viz.</hi> their Government of <hi>Great Britain</hi> by <hi>Vice-Roy's,</hi> not in the Name of the Senate, but Emperours in possession.</p>
               <p>From the root of the Consulship sprung those two great branches of the <hi>Censor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and <hi>Praetorship,</hi> the Consuls, in whose Power they were formerly included, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the most part employed in the Wars, were forced to confer them on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons, for the regulation of Manners, and distribution of Justice at home.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Censors</hi> took cognizance of all Ill-manners, they had power to degrade both Senatour and Roman-Knight from the Honour of their constituted Order, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the People, in case they deserved it, from a more honourable Tribe to a less, from whence they were called the <hi>Masters of Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides these things, they also took care of all Publick-works, as, mending High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, Bridges, and Water-courses, the reparations of Temples, and several other Buildings. If any man encroached upon the Streets, High-waies, or other places that were in use for the Publick good, the <hi>Censors</hi> compell'd him to make satisfaction for the injury committed.</p>
               <p>They had also the letting out of Lands, Customes, and other Publick Revenues to Farm, so that most of the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> were beholding to this Office, as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining themselves by some of the Trades thereunto belonging; and this was no small help to preserve the Dignity of the Senate, the Commonalty being obnoxious to the Censors, which were alwaies of that Order, and careful to uphold the Reputation thereof.</p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:58825:188"/>
               <p>They also took notice of those that mis behaved themselves in the Wars, or went about to discourage any of the Souldiers, after any notable defeat. Thus we see <hi>Marcus Attilius Regulus,</hi> and <hi>P. Furius Philus,</hi> called <hi>L. Caecilius Metellus</hi> to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for that, after the Battle of <hi>Cannae,</hi> he held discourse with some of his Companions about flying beyond the Seas, as if <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> had been no better than lost.</p>
               <p>They also pronounced Infamous, those, that having brought to <hi>Rome</hi> the Message of their Fellows made Prisoners at <hi>Cannae,</hi> returned not back to <hi>Hannibal;</hi> as they were bound by Oath, but thought themselves thereof sufficiently discharged in that they had stepped back once into his Camp, with pretence of <hi>taking better no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Captives Names,</hi> as also, all those that had not served in the Wars after the term the Law appoints.</p>
               <p>In their keeping was the <hi>Censual-Roll,</hi> or <hi>Doomsday-Book,</hi> wherein was the true Estate and value of what every Man was worth, that the People might be the better Governed, and the easier distinguisht.</p>
               <p>They continued in their Office five years, and yet if one of them died, his place was lookt upon as ominous, yea dangerous to the Common-wealth, one of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi> dying that very year that <hi>Rome</hi> was sackt, and almost destroyed by the fury of the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were two <hi>Praetors,</hi> or Lord Chief Justices, the one for judging and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters between Citizen and Citizen, whom they called <hi>Praetor Urbanus,</hi> the other for adjusting the Controversies of Strangers, and was termed <hi>Praetor Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinus,</hi> and <hi>Praetor Minor,</hi> but afterwards, Law-suits increasing, there were many more added to the former, who were to sit in the Court of Life and Death.</p>
               <p>The two Chief <hi>Praetors</hi> took notice of all matters concerning Equity and Wrong, between Man and Man, and under them the <hi>Centum Viri,</hi> but especially all Crimes Capital, as Treason, Murther, buying of Voices for the obtaining of Magistracy, &amp;c. which were at first heard by the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Consuls,</hi> and afterwards by certain Persons appointed by the People for that purpose, who were called <hi>Quaesitores Parricidii;</hi> But in time, the hearing of these Publick, or Capital Causes, was confirmed and transferred unto certain Magistrates, who continued in their Office a whole year. Others had their Office no longer than they sat in Judgment, which were, for distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake, called <hi>Praetores Quaesitores,</hi> and their Causes <hi>Quaestiones perpetuae,</hi> because in their Causes there was one set form of giving Judgment constantly used, whereas, in Private and Civil causes, the <hi>Praetor</hi> yearly changed the form, by hanging up new Fdicts and Laws, by which he intended to administer Justice, that year, to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for as the Causes were different, so were the signs and distinctions of their Courts, a Spear erected denoting the <hi>Nisi Prius</hi> Court, and a Sword hung out in token of that which related to the sentence of Life and Death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Praetor Urbanus</hi> was wont, at the entrance into his Office, to collect a set form of Administration of Justice, out of the former Laws and Edicts of other <hi>Praetors,</hi> according to which he would distribute Justice all the year following; And lest the People might be ignorant of the contents thereof, he caused it to be hung up in publick view. This form of Justice was termed <hi>Edictum,</hi> because he did thereby forbid, or command something to be done.</p>
               <p>This Edict being delivered out, the administration of Justice consisted in the use of one of these three words, <hi>Do, Dico, Addico,</hi> he is said <hi>Dare actionem,</hi> when he grants an Action or Writ against any man, <hi>Dicere jus,</hi> when he passeth Judgment on him, <hi>Addicere res aut personas,</hi> as when he in the Court doth see and allow the delivery of the thing, or the Person, on which Judgment is passed. The form of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was thus; After Judgment had been pronounced in Court, the Party which prevailed, laid his hand on the thing or person against which Sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, using this form of words: <hi>Hunc ego hominem, five hanc rem ex jure Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritium meum esse dico,</hi> then did the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Addicere, i. e.</hi> approve the challenge, and grant a present possession.</p>
               <p>But these forms and waies of proceeding being uncertain, and the Law it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to most of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonalty, as lying for the most part in the Breast of the <hi>Praetor,</hi> to avoid this incontroulable power, and the infinite disadvantages
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58825:188"/>
that daily ensued, Three men were deputed by the Senate to go to <hi>Athens,</hi> and other <hi>Greek</hi> Cities, to make a collection of what Laws they thought convenient, by which they were resolved the City should be governed.</p>
               <p>At their return the <hi>Consuls</hi> were deposed, and the Government of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth put into the hands of Ten Men, all of Consular dignity, to whose wisdom and Integrity was referr'd the new modelling of the Laws contained in the Ten Tables, having power of curtailing what was superfluous and unnecessary, and of interpreting any thing that was dark or obscure, and of adding any thing where they found a necessity or occasion; From the addition of two Tables, they were called the Laws of the twelve Tables, the Fountain from whence the Civil Law proceeded.</p>
               <p>These Men were allowed the same Ensigns of Majesty, and the same power and Authority as the Consuls formerly had, as of calling together the Senate, ratifying and confirming their Decrees, and managing the chief business of State; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less but one at a time took this Power upon him, the others in the mean while differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little from private Men.</p>
               <p>The People at first were so in love with this <hi>Decem-Viral</hi> way of Governing, that they willingly diminished and abated their own Priviledges, to advance the Credit and Honour of their new laid Greatness; These <hi>Ten</hi> abrogated the Statute of <hi>Appeal,</hi> made by <hi>Valerius Publicola,</hi> to the Judgment of the People, and they not much grumbling at it, expected that the Greatness they allowed them in <hi>Majesty,</hi> would be sufficiently recompenced by the happiness and infinite advantages they should receive from the Justice and Moderation of their Government; But they, now they had gotten the Reins in their hands, began to contrive how to make that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perpetual, which before was but Annual; They agreed among themselves, that every one should take upon him the grandeur and Authority of a <hi>Consul,</hi> intending, by Cruelty and Oppression, to force the People into a certain fear and dread of their Authority, rather than by Mild usage, to let them fall (gently, and by degrees) in love with their own Slavery, and bondage.</p>
               <p>'Tis strange, that they having all formerly proved good <hi>Consuls,</hi> should, when they came to be good Lawyers, prove such ill Governours; For they instead of Instructing the People by their Laws, by their insolent Oppression and Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, gave occasion daily of their Complaint and Murmur, making the Law rather a share, than a help or ease to the People (as hath often appeared to the grief of other Nations in successive Ages) punishing the faults of the Commonalty (which, for the most part, proceeded from Necessity) by the same Laws they desended the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances of their own Passions.</p>
               <p>These Oppressions and Injuries were patiently endured by the People, but <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius Claudius,</hi> a Man of a bolder and wickeder Nature than the rest, lusting after the fair, but vertuous <hi>Verginia,</hi> whom (according to the Law) 'twas below him to marry, and purposing to leave no kind of means unattempted for the enjoyment of his Love, and the more speedier easing of his tormented mind, resolved (not reflecting upon <hi>Tarquinus</hi> his fate) to have recourse to strength and Authority, where the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Love was ineffectual, hoping by the Law to justifie his Rape, as well as his other Brethren had sormerly their Oppressions and Wrongs. This his project pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very unsuccessful, for the Father of the Lady, though of a low Degree, yet of a great and generous Spirit, killed his Daughter in an open assembly to secure her Honour.</p>
               <p>This last fault of <hi>Appius</hi> was so unparallel'd an Indiginity, that 'twas like a great spot of Oyl upon Cloth, which seems to have diffused and spread it self abroad to that degree of inhumanity and ugliness, that they lookt upon the Ravisher rather, as a Monster, then a Man; <hi>Appius</hi> was forced, through shame and fear of the fury and anger of the Multitude, to be his own Executioner in Person, his Companions in the Government, on the same account, quitting their Offices also.</p>
               <p>This was the second time, that, in the Honour of the Female Sex, they changed the form and manner of their Polity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Consuls,</hi> after this, were restored to Soveraignty again, and although the storm seemed to have ceased, yet the Waters kept on rowling still, for not withstanding the People had fully satisfied themselves for the asfront put upon <hi>Verginia,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:58825:189"/>
the rest, yet now as their Courage was elevated, and their Party strong, they were resolved to petition the Fathers to lay aside all distinctions of Marriage, making it lawful for the Nobility and Commonalty to marry with one another, if the Parties could agree about the Bargain, alledging that the impossibility of <hi>Appius</hi> his marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Verginia</hi> (the one a Peer, the other a Plebeian) was the chiefest Cause, that put him upon so horrid a piece of Villany.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> gratiously condescended to a grant of their requests, but the People finding, that the Nobles scarce would match themselves with the Plebeians, and no great probability of the Plebeians mixing their Blood with the Nobles, unless by a Decree of <hi>Senate,</hi> they were in as great a possibility of obtaining the great Offices of State, as the Nobles, thought it convenient, now their hand was in, to prefer a Bill of being made capable of the Consulship also. The <hi>Senate</hi> at first look'd upon the Demands, as too saucy and confident; yet found the Denyal to be altogether as dangerous (fearing lest they would have recourse to their old refuge, of forsaking the City, leaving the <hi>Senate</hi> to be Princes without Subjects) by the advice of <hi>Claudius,</hi> took a middle course, enacting, that there should be six persons appointed to steer the Commonwealth; three to be chosen out of the Nobility, and three out of the Commonalty, whom they termed <hi>Tribuni militum Consularis Potestatis,</hi> allowing them the power of Consuls; but at the same time, checking their Insolence, by denying them the <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Greatness</hi> of the Title.</p>
               <p>This form of Government lasted not above seventy eight years, the <hi>Senate</hi> at last decreeing, that one Consul should be chosen out of the Nobility, another out of the People; nay, a Citizen, whose Vertues could entitle him to it, should obtein the Dictatourship, making Merits equal with Nobility.</p>
               <p>The People thus sharing, with the Nobility, in the Government, now was the time for busy Heads to lay their ambitious designs, and shew the utmost of their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note,</hi> Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour originally were conferred for the sake of vertue, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; witness Sir <hi>Walter Rawleighs</hi> Hist. of the World.</note> skill in feeding the humours of the People: Now the <hi>Tribunes</hi> (who at first were chosen as Protectours of the People, to preserve their Liberties free from Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Insolencies of the Nobility) did not only justifie their Affronts and Indignities towards the <hi>Senate,</hi> under the notion of upholding the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the People, but turned the Government quite into a perfect Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy.</p>
               <p>The affections of the Common People were sway'd now more by flattery and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption than desert, and the Commonwealth lay like a Vessel, driven too and fro by the wind of Ambition; all good men fearing, and the bad wishing, when it would split it self on the Rock of a Civil War, having nothing to loose, expecting to be gainers by the wreck.</p>
               <p>In this juncture, up-start <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> contending sor the management; <hi>non aliud discordantis Patriae remedium est quàm ut ab uno regeretur,</hi> there was no other way of saving a male-contented and seditious Commonwealth, than by the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Government of it to the unlimited Power of one Person; But these men, as they were extraordinary valiant, so were they beyond all measure cruel, delighting rather in blood than in War; yet neither (it seems) thought fit to be Rulers of so large an Empire, who took more pleasure in the slaughter and banishment of their fellow-Citizens, than in their security, unity and welfare at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marius</hi> soon after submitted himself to the forces of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and Fate, leaving the world in as great obscurity as he came into it; for although afterwards <hi>Sylla</hi> by decree of <hi>Senate</hi> was made perpetual Dictator, yet of his own accord, mildly and weakly resigned it, which was the occasion of <hi>Caesar's</hi> expression, <hi>Sylla dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re nesciit—</hi> That <hi>Sylla</hi> did not understand, what it was to be a Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
               <p>The two next that appeared on the Stage, were the two greatest Captains in the world, <hi>i. e. POMPEY</hi> and <hi>CAESAR,</hi> who, as they had formerly been of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Factions, so they now began to take up the same Pretences. The ground of their Quarrel (as is reported) was, that <hi>POMPEY</hi> would endure no equal, nor <hi>CAESAR</hi> allow of any superiour: (<hi>i. e.</hi>) The one would brook no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner in the Government, the other none to leap into the Saddle before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:58825:189"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey,</hi> was the Favourite of the Nobility, <hi>Caesar</hi> the peoples Darling, the one valued himself by the number of his Conquests, the other by the difficulties of his Victories. In fine, they were Men whom Courage never failed, or Fortune frown'd on or deserted; They began now to be jealous of one anothers Actions, endeavouring the suppression of the contrary Faction, as an increase and accomplishment of their happiness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey,</hi> and his Faction, made it their business (whilest <hi>Caesar</hi> was employed in the conquest of <hi>Transalpine, Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi>) to cross all his designs and projects at <hi>Rome,</hi> reflecting on the Counsel given by his Kinsman <hi>Sulla.</hi> He began now vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously to oppose and obviate the daily increasing Greatness of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who proved too great a Politician, and of too resolute a nature to let pass Opportunities, which of themselves were apt enough to slip away; therefore marching with his Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> he resolved to set his own Forces against <hi>Pompey's</hi> Power, where, by his old Success and good Conduct, confirming his Reputation, <hi>Pompey</hi> was forced to leave <hi>Italy,</hi> and pass over with his Army into <hi>Greece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar,</hi> after he had setled his Affairs in <hi>Italy,</hi> soon after followed him, thinking that the shortness of time he allowed him to reinforce his Army would be the surest way of facilitating his Conquest; But had <hi>Pompey</hi> continued his first Resolution of playing the <hi>Fabius Cunctator,</hi> and forbore longer engaging with him, <hi>Caesars</hi> good Fortune could scarce have preserved him and his Army from an absolute Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pompey</hi> being perswaded more by the importunities and rash Counsels of some of his Followers, than by his own Judgment, to a resolution of fighting, not at all becoming the Age and Wisdom of so great a Captain, was totally routed at the Battle of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> from thence <hi>Pompey</hi> escaped into <hi>AEgypt,</hi> to his old Friend <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who instead of repairing his Fortune (for some private Reasons of State) struck off his Head, preferring the favour of the Conquerour before either Generosity or Friendship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar,</hi> as a reward of his Valour, seized on the Empire, being made by Decree of Senate, perpetual <hi>Dictator,</hi> yet at last he was paid home for his bold Attempt, receiving in the <hi>Senate-house</hi> no less than twenty three wounds, as a reward of his five years Usurpation. For it seems, the <hi>Romans</hi> had enjoyed their Liberty over long, and lost it too late to forget it so soon.</p>
               <p>'Tis to be admired that Great Men, although they are sometimes fore-told of their destruction, by previous signs, yet think it a great weakness to credit it, and a signal injury to be put in mind of their own Mortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> was forbidden entring <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> fore-warned of coming to the Senate, yet the Admonishers, by both, thought frivolous and vain; for having been so long above Fortune, in the frequent successes in their Wars, they verily thought themselves beyond the reach and malice of Fate. But Fortune who had been his good Friend in his life time, made him sufficient amends for the unkindness she had shewn him at his death;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> By fixing the Empire afterwards in his Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Leaving his Name to his Successours, as the greatest title of Honour <hi>Majesty</hi> it self was capable of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> and lastly, By the appearance of a <hi>Star</hi> after his death, which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people thought to be his <hi>Soul,</hi> placed there by the especial favour of the Gods, to upbraid the <hi>Senate</hi> of Ingratitude, and Inhumane actions.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Julius,</hi> young <hi>Octavius,</hi> whom <hi>Caesar</hi> made his Heir, came to <hi>Rome,</hi> to demand of <hi>Antony</hi> his Inheritance left him by his Father <hi>Julius,</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>Antonies</hi> Delaies that there was little good to be done, he told the People, He intended it not for himself, but as a Donative to be distributed amongst Them, which procured Him the Love, and <hi>Antony</hi> the Curses and Hatred of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antony,</hi> after the defeat given him by <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Pausa,</hi> repaired to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> perswading the good natur'd General to march with his Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> proposing to him the Empire as the ends of his labour, but <hi>Octavius</hi> understanding their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, thought it his best way to bring himself into the League also, meaning, under this pretended Friendship, only to stay till time should present him with a
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:58825:190"/>
fitter opportunity of ruining both, which very soon happened, for <hi>Antony,</hi> after he had overthrown <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> makes over with what haste he could into <hi>AEgypt,</hi> to assure his dearest <hi>Cleopatra</hi> of the truth and constancy of both his Love and good Fortunes; <hi>Octavius</hi> soon catcht hold of the opportunity this their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered him, for having lately found by experience what advantages <hi>Antony</hi> had over him by joyning with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> was resolved for the future to allow them no such odds over him, wherefore for some private Reasons, best known to himself, suddenly seizes <hi>Lepidus</hi> in his Camp, deposes him from a share in the Government, and confines him to <hi>Rome</hi> as a single Person.</p>
               <p>Once again the Empire was laid at stake, but <hi>Antony</hi> proved the unfortunate Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, for consulting more his Love (than his Reason) <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> than his old Captains, determined to venture All in a Sea-battle, wherein he was overthrown by the good Fortune and Conduct of <hi>Octavius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus being acquitted of all Competitors, he enters <hi>Rome</hi> in a Triumphant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, where, by his Vigilancy, Wisdom and Gentleness, he firmly established (though against the grain and humour of the <hi>Roman</hi> People) the greatest Empire that ever was.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> very much agreed in superstitiously observing good daies and bad, making several conjectures from the Weather, from the crossing of the way by a <hi>Hare,</hi> or <hi>Cat,</hi> from a <hi>Hens</hi> crowing, from the entring of a <hi>black Dog</hi> into their Houses, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That which was first adored in the World instead of its Creatour, is supposed, by some, to be the <hi>Sun,</hi> which was occasioned by some broken Traditions, conveyed by the Patriarchs to their Children, touching the dominion of the <hi>Sun</hi> by day, and by the constant wondring of the Heathens themselves, at the glorious constitution and admirable course of that Coelestial body, with the infinite advantages it daily bestowed on Mankind; Upon the same account, soon after', came the <hi>Moon</hi> to be worshipped, the chief place from whence this poyson dispersed it self over the East, is thought, by <hi>Meade,</hi> to have been <hi>Babylon,</hi> from <hi>Revelations 17. 15.</hi> where <note place="margin">Rev. 17. 15.</note>

               <p>Now this, as it was the most ancient Theology of the Heathens, so was it in it self more reasonable and natural than that which was taught the People by the Poets, called <hi>Poetick,</hi> or <hi>fabulous Theology;</hi> For they lighting on some imperfect Relations concerning the Creation, and some broken Traditions touching GOD, and the Wonders he wrought in the behalf of his People, have so strangly inveloped the Truth, by delivering it in a dark and mystical sense, and by mixing it with divers trumperies and figments of their own brains, that the lustre of <hi>Moses's</hi> Writings could scarce be discovered; For they made their Verses and Songs, more to please and wheedle the weak Multitude into an opinion of their Wisdom, and veneration of their Persons, than (by any solid reason) to satisfie the minds of their Auditors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those new-fangled Deities.</p>
               <p>What an infinite number of <hi>Gods,</hi> and strange <hi>Legends</hi> concerning them, did they invent and hammer out from the Attributes and Miracles of the Great and True <hi>GOD,</hi> and from the confused stories of <hi>Adam, Cain, Noah,</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Joseph,</hi> and others, &amp;c. so that at last they were forced, for distinctions sake, to divide them into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Orders, namely, <hi>Dii Consentes seu Majorum Gentium, Selecti, Patricii, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signiores, Dii Medii, Dii Infimi;</hi> At last, not only every Nation, but every City, nay private Families had their peculiar Tutelar Gods, and every Wood and Fountain had certain <hi>Nymphs</hi> assigned unto it.</p>
               <p>The truth of which may plainly be seen from the Oath and Covenants between <hi>Hannibal,</hi> General of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> Embassadour of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon.</hi>

                  <p>He is said first of all to have taught the <hi>Italians,</hi> That <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> was fitter for Religious <hi>Asses,</hi> than eating and drinking; He also introduced Altars among them, and taught several Rites and Ceremonies used in Sacrifices.

                  <p>He was called more particularly <hi>Father,</hi> though that appellation grew afterwards common to most of the Gods, his <hi>Effigies</hi> in the Capitol of <hi>Rome</hi> was very much admired, for the artificial placing of the Fingers.

                  <p>He had at <hi>Rome</hi> three Temples sacred unto him, but I shall only speak of that which was built by <hi>Romulus,</hi> upon the Peace made between him and <hi>Tatius,</hi> in which was the Image of <hi>Janus</hi> looking two waies, an Emblem of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Sabines,</hi> who upon this Peace became one People.</p>

                     <hi>JUPITER</hi> was the Son of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Rhea,</hi> or <hi>Ops,</hi> but how he came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be Deified, we must learn from <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The God <hi>JUPITER.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are of Opinion (<hi>saies he</hi>) that after <hi>Saturn</hi> took his place among the Gods, that <hi>Jupiter,</hi> justly and lawfully (and not by force) succeeded in the Kingdom, <hi>although o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say, Saturn</hi> being foretold by an Oracle, at the Birth of his Son, that he should be expelled the Kingdom by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> was moved by Interest of State, for his own security, to destroy all his Sons, hoping by that means to prevent and nip Rebellion in the bud; But <hi>Ops</hi> resenting this his Inhumanity, and seeing no hopes of appeasing her incensed Husband, privately sent him to be brought up by the <hi>Curetes</hi> that lived about Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> these recommended the bringing up of the Infant to the care of certain <hi>Nymphs</hi> that inhabited a Den thereabouts, who fed him with <hi>Goats-milk</hi> and <hi>Hony.</hi> After he came to mans estate he built a City on <hi>Ida,</hi> the relicks of whose Ruines remain to this day.</p>
                  <p>This God exceeded all men in Valour, and all other Vertues whatever; for pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing himself of the Kingdom after <hi>Saturn,</hi> he contributed very much to the ease and comfort of Mans life.</p>
                  <p>He first taught that <hi>Justice</hi> was to be observed, and <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Injury</hi> to be avoided, all <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Controversies</hi> he determined by the acuteness of his Judgment, making the peace and Happiness of Mankind his great business. The <hi>Good,</hi> by perswasions, he invited to proceed in Vertue, and the Insolencies of the <hi>Wicked</hi> he restrained by fear of punishment.</p>
                  <p>He Travelled through most parts of the World, publickly denouncing War against all Robbers and Irreligious Persons, commending and introducing Equity and Laws; About the same time is reported his Victory over the <hi>Giants,</hi> who depending upon their strength, unjustly opprest and brought into slavery the rest of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; In few words, for all these benefits he was accounted a God, and sett Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices appointed for him, but as he grew up to this height of Glory, so we have good reason to believe (if good Authors, but especially the Poets, have not belyed him) that he soon fell from his wonted Vertue; nay, by their relations, he was so far from a Divinity, that he is made altogether a Monster in humanity. What Woman, but of ordinary Beauty, near him, could escape the fury and violence of this lecherous, hot-backt Deity. The Oblations he most delighted in were Maiden-heads of his own sacrificing, wherefore he translated more Whores to Heaven, for their kindness and Beauty, than Religious Persons for their Piety and Vertue, many of the <hi>Stars</hi> being supposed to have been either his Concubines or Bastards, and that he might be wicked and debauched enough for a Heathen-God, he is reported to have married his own Sister, and to have offended in the sin of <hi>Sodom</hi> with his little <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> but perhaps many of those stories were put upon him by some <hi>Heathens,</hi> who thought the Essence of a Deity consisted rather in the largeness of its Power, than in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of its Goodness.</p>
                  <p>He was painted (according to <hi>Albricus</hi>) sitting in his Majesty in an Ivory Throne, having in his Left hand a Royal Scepter, with the other casting Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts to Hell, and trampling under his feet the <hi>Giants</hi> overthrown with the same, near him was an Eagle, which flying between his legs, carried away by force a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Boy named <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> having in his hand a Bolt, or Beaker-Cup, ready as it were to present it to <hi>Jupiter.</hi>

               <p>And <hi>Pythagoras</hi> condemned <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi> to Hell, to be there stung and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Serpents for delivering such impertinent, senceless and improper stuff con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Gods, by which we may guess what opinion the wiser sort of <hi>Greeks</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of the Deity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> likewise at first had far modester conceptions, and more proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the nature of God than those in the time of <hi>Tarquinius Priscus,</hi> who was the first that introduced Images and Pictures of their Gods into their Temples, a thing absolutely forbidden the <hi>Romans</hi> by <hi>Numa,</hi> who taught them to believe, that God had neither form or likeness of Man or Beast; which was very consonant to the doctrine of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> who taught the Gods were invisible, incorruptible, and only intelligible.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Augustine</hi> (out of <hi>Varro</hi>) affirms, that the <hi>Romans</hi> for above 170 years worshipped the Gods without Images, which custom (said <hi>Varro</hi>) if it had still continued, the Gods had been more purely worshipped.</p>

                  <hi>Numa</hi> (as it appeared afterwards) by his Books that were found at the digging up of his Grave, condemned the Superstition that he had establisht, as altogether vain and delusive. <hi>It seems that he</hi> (saith Sr. <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi>) <hi>did intend to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to wiser Ages, which he thought would follow, as one that had not been so foolish as to believe the Doctrine wherein he instructed his own barbarons times;</hi> And now, we have good reason to believe, that he lookt upon what he laid down to the <hi>Romans</hi> concerning Religion, rather as a fit way of Policy whereby he might reduce a savage Multitude of <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Outlaws</hi> to Civility, and direct them into a better course of life, than as the true and proper sentiments he had of the Deity.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless the <hi>Proetor</hi> of the City (though <hi>Numa</hi> cried out of the Grave, and gave testimony against himself, that the Religion he had instructed them in was false and erronious) was so far satisfied in the truth and reasonableness of it, that though he strongly credited <hi>Numa</hi> in one point, yet strangly distributed him in the other, therefore with a great deal of zeal and vehemency of Spirit acquainting the Senate whither this Opinion tended; The Books immediately were commanded immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be burnt, as contrary to the Religion then in use among them. The truth is, they had good reason of State for it, having prospered better under this than any Nation did before or after them, for although their Religion in it self was but a meer Politick-cheat, yet the constant Belief, and strong Opinion they had of their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Gods in assisting them (if their Sacrifices were rightly performed) was the chief thing that rendred them incapable of irresolution and despair.</p>

               <head>Their Order of Sacrificing was after this manner.</head>
               <p>WHEN the Priest had brought the Sacrifice to the Altar, he standing laid his hands upon it and pray'd: In the beginning of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he made his first addresses to <hi>Janus</hi> and <hi>Vesta,</hi> believing them to be the chiefest Deities at all Sacrifices, and that the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of their Vows ought to be made to them, if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thereby to receive favourable Access to any of their other Gods: their Prayer being ended, the Priest laid the Corn, <hi>Meal</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> with some <hi>Frankinsence,</hi> on the head of the Sacrifice. This was called <hi>Immolation,</hi> then he poured upon it Wine, but before that was performed, he took a little earthen Chalice or Ewer, out of which he tasted of the Liquor, then giving it to the People that stood about him to do the like. This Ceremony was called <hi>Libation,</hi> this being effected, the Priest pluckt off the Hair that grew between the Horns of the Sacrifice, and committed it to the slames as his first Offering, then turning towards the East, he drew a crooked Knife along the Beasts back, from his forehead to his tayl, commanding his Attendants to cut the throat of the Sacrifice so presented and dedicated to the Gods, called by some <hi>Cultrarii,</hi> and <hi>Victimarii,</hi> by others, <hi>Popae,</hi> or <hi>Agones,</hi> some made haste to catch the Blood in Vessels, others, to skin the Beast and wash it, others, to kindle the fire, then the <hi>South-sayer</hi> or <hi>Priest,</hi> with an Iron-knife made diligent inquiry, by turning the Entrails, whether the Gods were pleased with the Sacrifice, not daring to touch them with his hands, fearing that if the Sacrifice was polluted, his hands would presently rot off.</p>
               <p>After they had made a sufficient inspection, those Sub Officers cut from every bowel and part certain pieces, which they wrapped up in Meal, presenting them in Baskets to the Priest, who immediately laid them on the Altar, and burnt them, which they called <hi>litare,</hi> or <hi>reddere,</hi> that is, <hi>to please,</hi> or <hi>satisfie,</hi> by Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>It was not lawful to light this fire with any of the <hi>Olive</hi> or <hi>Lawrel</hi> Tree, nor with the thick or gross Bark or rotten Root of an <hi>Oak,</hi> being things esteemed to carry mischief and ill Omens in them.</p>
               <p>When that part of the Sacrifice which belonged to the Gods was consumed by the fire, then did the People return to their Feastings and Junkettings, singing, whilest they were at meat, songs in praise of their Gods, Revelling, and dancing to Cymbals about the Altars of their Gods, intending that every part of their bodies should be serviceable, in its kind, to their Religion, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> were ever backward (or else would fain seem so) in bringing an unjust War upon any of their Neighbours, many of their Writers affirming, all Wars whatsoever, if not justly and upon good grounds undertaken, to be unlawful; By <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> therefore were certain Priests constituted, whom they called <hi>Feciales,</hi> whose duty it was, to put the Senate in mind (before they made War with any Confederate Nation) seriously to consider, Ambition and Interest being laid aside, whether the cause of their Quarrel was founded upon Justice and Reason; Neither would the <hi>Romans,</hi> although the Injuries they suffered were great, and the affronts insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, do, as the <hi>French</hi> lately in <hi>Flanders,</hi> appear in an hostile manner in the Enemies Country, before they had given out some Reason concerning the grounds and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the War, they esteeming it neither Honourable, nor Just, to bring a War with all its sad consequences on a sudden into an Enemies Country, before they had tried milder waies for obtaining satisfaction; Therefore upon any wrong done them, they sent their <hi>Feciales,</hi> or Spiritual Embassadours, to the Country of their Oppressours, who, when they arrived, invoked <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and all the Gods, to be witness of the Justice of their Cause, cursing both themselves and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> if they came to desire any thing but their Right, Whomsoever they met in the Fields, or at the Gate of the City, they called them as witnesses of the justness of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, then going to the Market-place, they declared to the Magistrates the Cause of their Embassie, demanding, in the name of the Senate and People, restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Wrongs and Injuries offered to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> or else a delivery of the Persons that had been the cause of them, shewing the unwillingness of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, though for regaining their own, to enter into a War with any Nation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them thirty three daies to consider the Proposals, to which, if they received no satisfactory Answer, they returned to the Senate, telling how they had duly performed their office, and their Adversaries obstinately refuseing to deliver up their Right, then, if they pleased, they might lawfully engage themselves in a War against a People that were detested by Mankind for their Insolence, and odious for their Perjury to the Gods.</p>
               <p>If the Senate consented to it, they returned with a Dart to the borders of their Enemies, where, in the presence of Three at the least, naming the name of the People

they were sent against, declared in what manner they had exasperated and offended the <hi>Romans,</hi> and therefore the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> had commanded them to proclaim War against them, which here they did: having so said, they flung a Dart into their Territories, which was a sign that War was denounced. <hi>Peace</hi> alwaies was proclaimed by the usual form and Ceremony that followeth;</p>
               <p>One of the Embassadours, commissionated by the Senate (both sides having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on Peace) took up a Stone, using this form of words, <hi>If uprightly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Mental reservation and deceit I enter into this League, let all things prove prosperous and successful to me, but if I do, or think otherwise, I wish I may, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I am (all other being safe) fall down dead as this Stone falls out of my band,</hi> and thereupon he cast out of his hand the Stone.

               </p>
               <p>War being proclaimed, they generally appointed a sett day, place, and time for a Muster, whither all the <hi>Romans</hi> (that were by reason of their Age fit to bear Arms) punctually repaired, all above seventeen, and under forty six, being liable to an Impress.</p>
               <p>The General, the better to secure himself of the sidelity, Allegiance, and love of his Souldiers, obliged them singly to an Oath, whereby they solemnly swore, <hi>That in the greatest dangers they would never for sake their Captain, or in time of distress de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert their Country.</hi> They swore likewise, <hi>That they would readily obey and put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution the Command of their General, if the performance of it was not impossible.</hi> This Oath was termed <hi>Sacramentum Militare.</hi>

               <p>This publick Muster of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens was yearly appointed, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were elected by the Military Tribunes, under the Consuls.</p>
               <p>If any Souldier for fear had withdrawn himself, and did not appear at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Consul, they either imprisoned him, or confiscated his Goods, or sold him for a Slave, intending to deprive him of the Name and priviledges of a <hi>Roman,</hi> for as he had not Courage, so was he not accounted worthy to be owned of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Blood.</p>

               <p>Their Army consisted of <hi>Legionary</hi> Souldiers, and <hi>Auxiliaries.</hi> It was lawful for none to fight in these Legions unless they were <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens born, free by Father and Mother, and was inrolled in one of their five Classes. Slaves, Libertines, Old men, Boyes, and Stage-players, &amp;c. were never suffered to fight, unless some urgent necessity required, as for want of number, and more speedy expedition.</p>
               <p>At first they received no pay, but every one at his own Charges, moved thereunto by the love of his Country served the Common-wealth. <hi>Anno</hi> 347, at the sacking of <hi>Anxur,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Volsci,</hi> the Footmen entred into pay, and three years after the Horsemen, a Footmans pay being but three <hi>Asses,</hi> the least piece of Mony currant amongst them, an Horsemans pay was about seven pence, being to find themselves necessary Rayment and Provisions out of it; <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> raised it to six or seven of these <hi>Asses</hi> a day, <hi>Augustus</hi> (after the settlement of the Common-wealth) setled the Souldiers pay, allowing them ten <hi>Asses</hi> a day, so that this pay, Monthly, amounted to the value of a <hi>Roman</hi> Crown, which was the double value of the <hi>French</hi> Crown.</p>
               <p>Thus was the Art Military, which at first was an honourable Calling, by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of some Princes, and the necessity of others, made a Mercenary trade, and way of livelyhood, and which afterwards proved one of the causes of the ruine of the Empire.</p>
               <p>What number a <hi>Legion</hi> consisted of is uncertain, the difference arising from the diversity of times. At first it consisted of 3000 Foot, and 300 Horse, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards increased to four or five thousand, and <hi>Caius Marius</hi> made it up of his own
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:58825:196"/>
accord (without any Decree of Senate) to 6200 which number it seldom exceeded.</p>
               <p>Now, as of what Number a Legion consisted was uncertain, so was the number of Legions afterwards themselves. At first they were but four, each Consul had two under his command, afterwards, according as the necessity and circumstance of time required, they came to be X, XIV, XIIX, XX, and in process of time more.</p>
               <p>Every Legion had a peculiar Name by which it was distinguisht from the rest, which it commonly took either from the order of the Muster or Inrollment, as <hi>first, second, third,</hi> and <hi>ninth Legion,</hi> or from the place of the Warfare, as <hi>Macedonica, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannica,</hi> or from their General, as <hi>Augusta, Vitelliana,</hi> or from some Accident, as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrix Fulminatrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Legion consisted of ten Companies, or Cohorts, and every Cohort consisted of three small Companies or Maniples, <hi>viz.</hi> a Maniple of the <hi>Hastati,</hi> a Maniple of the <hi>Principes,</hi> and another of the <hi>Triarii.</hi> These three sorts of Souldiers were separated by distance of place from front to back, so was every Battle divided into his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples,</hi> and these were divided by little allies and waies one from another, that the <hi>Hastati</hi> (who ever in front began the Battle) if they found themselves unable to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain the shock of the Enemy, might retreat, and withdraw themselves through those Allies, into the distances which were between the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> where they rested themselves, while the <hi>Principes</hi> charged the Enemy; But if the Officers thought it convenient, they clapt them both into one Body, and so charged the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in gross, and in case this did not take effect to their minds, they retired again into the distances between the <hi>Triarii,</hi> and so they gave the last onset, all three Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies being united together. This way of fighting was commonly used by <hi>Caesar,</hi> who never was known to have used the former, but only in a case of great necessity in his Wars against the <hi>Britains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These three several sorts of Souldiers, made three several sorts of Battles. The <hi>Hastati,</hi> who were alwaies placed in the Front, were called <hi>Acies prima,</hi> behind these in convenient distance stood the <hi>Principes,</hi> termed <hi>Acies secunda,</hi> and behind them in like manner the <hi>Triarii,</hi> and made <hi>Aciem tertiam.</hi> The <hi>Velites</hi> are omitted, as being no part of their standing Battles, and the other three sorts of Souldiers to be distinguisht from these, were termed <hi>Milites subsignani,</hi> for these <hi>Velites</hi> being not divided into Bands, had consequently no Ensigns of their own, but were distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst other Companies, so that every Maniple had forty <hi>Velites</hi> attending upon it.</p>
               <p>When the Consuls had pitcht upon the number of Souldiers, they gave the Oath, the Tribunes pickt out the poorest and weakest sort, and called them <hi>Velites,</hi> who sustained the same place as our forlorn hope, but those that promised in the aspect better Valour, and besides Persons of more considerable Fortunes, were termed <hi>Hastati,</hi> the strongest and lustiest body'd Men, from the prime of their Age, were termed <hi>Principes,</hi> and the eldest and best experienced, <hi>Triarii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As a Maniple contained two Centuries or Orders, so a Century consisted of an hundred Men, and was the least Company in a Legion, but when a Legion was ready to joyn Battle with the Enemy, the least Body it contained was a Maniple. The two Orders being joyned together, in every Order was a Centurion or Captain, and a Lieutenant also, whom they termed <hi>Optio,</hi> or <hi>Turgiductor.</hi> Those that had Command over a thousand Footmen, were called <hi>Tribuni militum,</hi> he that was <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> and had the Command of the whole Army, was called <hi>Imperator,</hi> and his Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, <hi>Legatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chiefest Weapon used by them was the Pile, which is described thus by <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius;</hi> To be a casting-Dart, the staff whereof is almost three Cubits long, and had an hands breadth in thickness, the Staves were armed with an head of Iron, equal in length to the Staff it self, but in that sort half the head was fastned up to the middle of the Staff, with plates of Iron, like the head of an Halbert, and the other half stuck out of the end of the Staff like a Pike, containing about one fingers breadth in thickness, and so decreasing less and less unto the point which was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. This Head was so slender, that the weight of the Staff would bend it as it stuck. <hi>Lipsius</hi> saith an hands breadth, for the Staff in thickness was too unweildy to be managed by any mans hand, therefore he interprets it to be four Inches in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, if the Staff were either round or square. But <hi>Patricius,</hi> in his Parallel, maketh
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:58825:197"/>
the Staff to have an hands breadth in the Butt end, but the rest of the Staff he maketh to decrease Taper-wise unto the head of the Iron, where it hath the thickness of a mans singer, and so it answereth both in form and weight to a Pestle, from whence it had its name (as <hi>Varro</hi> noteth) <hi>Quod hostes feriret ut Pilum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Legionary Souldiers had no other offensive Weapon than one or two <hi>Piles</hi> at most, and their Swords, by which it may be gathered, all their Victories came by buckling at hand-blows, for they came alwaies so near before they cast their Pile, that they left themselves no more time than might conveniently serve to draw their Swords. Neither would their Arms of defence, which were compleat, besides a large Target which they carried on their left Arm, suffer them to make any long pursuit, or continued chase, whensoever a light armed Enemy did make any speedy Retreat.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Target</hi> (according to <hi>Polybius</hi>) contained two foot and a half in breadth, and four foot in length, of what form or fashion soever they were of.</p>
               <p>There were two sort of <hi>Targets</hi> in use amongst the Legionaries, the one oval, the other of equal latitude, and resembled the fashion of a Gutter-tyle, and was called <hi>Scutum imbricatum.</hi> The substance of this Target was a double Board, one fastned upon another with Lint and Bulls-glew, and was covered with an Oxes-Hide, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stiff Leather, the upper and lower part of it was bound about with a plate of Iron or Brass, which they called <hi>Umbo; Romulus</hi> brought them up first among the <hi>Romans,</hi> taking the use of them from the <hi>Sabines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> were such Forces as were sent to the <hi>Romans</hi> by the <hi>Praefects</hi> of the Neighbour and Confederate Countries, at the command of Consul or General. Their Horsemen were divided into Troops, called <hi>Turmae,</hi> containing thirty Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, every <hi>Turmae</hi> was again divided into three less Companies, called <hi>Decuriae,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ten Horsemen, whence their Captain was called <hi>Decurio;</hi> But those to whom the several wings of Horsemen were committed, were stiled <hi>Equitum praefecti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Horsemen (saith <hi>Polybius</hi>) at the first carried but a weak, limber Pole or Staff, and a little round Buckler, but afterwards they used the furniture of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> which <hi>Josephus</hi> affirms to be a strong Launce or Staff, and three or four Darts in a Quiver with a Buckler, and a long Sword by the Right side. Upon any sudden Expedition, out of the whole Army were taken the choicest Young-men, both for strength and agility, to them were given little round Bucklers, and seven Darts apiece. These Souldiers practiced to ride behind the Horsemen, and speedily to alight from their backs at a Watch-word given, and so to charge the Enemy on foot. This custome was first used at the Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> and first brought into practice by one <hi>Q. Navius</hi> a Centurion, and he was honourably rewarded for it by <hi>Q. Hulvius</hi> the Consul, and from hence (saith <hi>Livy</hi>) grew the institution of the <hi>Velites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had four forms of the front of a Battle, the first was called <hi>Acies recta,</hi> when neither the Wings, nor the Battle advanced one before another, but were all carried in a right line, and made a strait Front.</p>
               <p>The second form was called <hi>Obliqua,</hi> when one of the Wings was advanced nearer the Enemy than the rest, to begin the Battle, and this was commonly called (as <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> noteth) the Right wing, as having great advantage against the Left of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The third form was called <hi>Sinuata,</hi> when both the Wings were advanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the Battle stood backwards off from the Enemy, after the fashion of a half Moon.</p>
               <p>The last form was <hi>Gibbosa,</hi> or <hi>Gibbera acies,</hi> when the Battle is advanced, and the two Wings lagg behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar's</hi> custome in Marching, was, to send his Cavalry and light armed Footmen before the body of his Army, both to discover and impeach the Enemy. For these Troops were nimble in motion, and fit for such services, but if the danger were greater in the Reer than Front, they marched in the tail of the Army, giving security where was most cause of fear; But if they were found unfit to make good that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in that place, as it often fell out in <hi>Africa</hi> against the <hi>Numidians,</hi> he then remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them as he found it most convenient, and brought his Legionary Souldiers (which were the strength of the War) to march at the back of the Army, to make good that which the Horsemen were not able to perform.</p>

               <head>The manner of their Encamping.</head>
               <p>THE Centurion that went before to choose a convenient place, and having found a fit scituation for their Camp, first assigned a station for the Generals pavilion, which was commonly in the most eminent place of the Camp, from whence he might easily overview all the other parts, or any Alarum or sign of Battle from thence might be discovered from all parts; This Pavilion was known by the name of <hi>Praetorium,</hi> the General of the Army being formerly called <hi>Praetor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this place they stuck up a white Flag, from which they measured every way an hundred foot. The <hi>Area</hi> or content thereof was almost an Acre, the form of the <hi>Praetorium</hi> was round and high, in this <hi>Praetorium</hi> was the Tribunal, or Chair of State, and the place of Divination, which they called <hi>Augurale,</hi> with other appendices of Majesty and Authority.</p>
               <p>The Generals Tent being thus placed, they considered which side of the Pavilion lay most convenient for Water and Forrage, and on that side they lodged the Legions, they being divided one from another by a Street or Lane fifty foot in breadth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of Honour that every Legion had in the Army. So were they lodged in the Camp, either in the midst, which was accounted most honourable, or towards the sides, a place of meaner reputation.</p>
               <p>Between the Tents of the first Maniples in every Legion, and the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> there went a Way of one hundred foot in breadth throughout the whole Camp, which was called <hi>Principia.</hi> In this place the Tribunes sate to hear matters of <hi>Justice,</hi> the Souldiers exercised themselves, and the Leaders and chief Commanders frequented it as a place of Publick meeting, on either side the Emperours Pavilion, in a direct line, to make eaven and streight the upper side of the <hi>Principia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Tribunes</hi> had their Tents, every Tribune confronting the head of his Legion. Above them, towards the head of the Camp, were the Legates and Treasures, the upper part of the Camp was strengthned with some select Cohorts and Troops of Horse, according to the number of Legions that were in the Army. <hi>Polybius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the Camping used in his time, when they most commonly had but two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in the Army, with as many Associates, placeth the <hi>Ablecti</hi> and <hi>Extraordinarii,</hi> which were select Bands and Companies, in the upper part of the Camp, and the Associates on the outside of the Legions.</p>
               <p>The Ditch and Rampier that encompassed the whole Camp about, was two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot distant from any Tent, whereof <hi>Polybius</hi> giveth these Reasons;</p>
               <p>First, That the Souldiers marching into the Camp in Battle array, might dissolve themselves into <hi>Maniples, Centuries,</hi> and <hi>Decuries,</hi> without tumult and confusion, and again, if occasion, were offered to sally out upon the Enemy, they might very conveniently (in that place) put themselves into Companies and Troops, and if they were assaulted by night, that the Darts and Fire-works (which the Enemy might cast) should do them no harm.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ditch</hi> and <hi>Rampier</hi> was made by the Legions, every Maniple having his part measured out, and every Centurion overseeing his Century; The approbation of the whole work belonged to the Tribunes, and their manner of Intrenching was thus.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers being girt with their Swords and Daggers, digged the Ditch about their Camp, which was alwaies eight foot in breadth at the least, and as much in depth, casting the Earth thereof inwards. But if the Enemy were not far off, the Ditch was eleven, fifteen, or eighteen, in latitude and altitude, according to the discretion of the General, the Ditch being as broad at bottom as at top. The Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier from the brim of the Ditch was three foot high, and sometimes four, made after the manner of a Wall with green Turfs cut all to one measure, half a foot in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a foot in breadth, and a foot and a half in length, but if the place wherein they were encamped would afford no such Turf, then they strengthned the loose earth with Boughs and Faggots.</p>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:58825:198"/>
               <p>The Rampier they properly called <hi>Agger,</hi> the outside whereof that hung over the Ditch, they used to stick with thick and sharp Stakes, fastned deep in the Mound for their better security.</p>
               <p>The Camp had four Gates, the first was called <hi>Porta praetoria,</hi> which was alwaies behind the Emperours Tent, and this Gate did usually look towards the East, or to the Enemy, or that way the Army was to march. The Gate opposite to this was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Porta decumana,</hi> a <hi>decimis Cohortibus,</hi> for the tenth or last Cohort in every Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was lodged to confront this Gate. By this Gate the Souldiers went out to fetch their Wood, Water and Forrage, and this way their Offenders were carried to Execution. The two other Gates were called <hi>Portae principales,</hi> for as much as they stood opposite to both ends of that so much respected place which they called <hi>Principia,</hi> on'y distinguisht by these Titles of, <hi>Laeva principalis &amp; dextra,</hi> the lest, and right hand principal Gate.</p>
               <p>All these Gates were shut with Doors, and in standing Camps, fortified with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, upon which were planted Engines of defence. Their Tents were made of Skins and Hides, held up with props, and fastned with Ropes, eleven Souldiers being contained in a Tent, which society was called <hi>Contubernium,</hi> the chiefest of whose company was named <hi>Caput Contubernii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> never suffered their Souldiers to lodge one night without the Camp, where they were enclosed with Ditch and Rampier, and for the greater security of every Member, every one, both Free and Servile, were sworn by the Tribunes, not only, not to take away any thing by stealth, but also if they found any thing, to bring it to the Tribunes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> divided the whole night into four Watches, every Watch containing three hours; The first began at six of the Clock at night, and ended at six in the Morning, and these Watches were distinguished by several notes, and sounds of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets or Trumpets, that by distinction and diversity it might easily be known what Watch was sounded.</p>
               <p>The Charge and Office of sounding Watches belonged to the chief Centurion of a Legion, whom they called <hi>primus Pilus,</hi> or <hi>primus Centurio,</hi> at whose Pavilion the Trumpeters attended, to be directed by his Hour-glass.</p>
               <p>We must take notice, that the chief Ensigns (of the <hi>Romans</hi>) of every Legion, was an Eagle, which alwaies attended upon the principal or chief Centurion of the said Legion. The Ensign of a <hi>Maniple</hi> was either an Hand, Dragon, Wolf, or Sphinx, as it appeareth (beside the testimony of History) by the Column of <hi>Trajan</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> where in the Ensigns are sigured with such portraitures, so that these resembling the proportions of living Creatures, bad their fore-parts alwaies carried that way which the Legions were to march, or where they were to fight.</p>
               <p>When the General had determined to sight, he hung upon the top of his Tent a scarlet Coat or Flag, that thereby the Souldiers might be warned to prepare for Batde.</p>
               <p>The second warning was, the proclaiming Battle by sound of Trumpet, and this was a noise of many Trumpets at once, which they termed by the name of <hi>Classicum a Calando,</hi> which signisieth <hi>Calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third was the encouraging of Souldiers with an Oration, and confirming their Valour by the strong motives of Reason.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> way of Victualling was far more advantagious than ours, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Sutlers, for 'tis impossible that they should follow an Army, upon Service in the Enemies Country, twenty or thirty daies together, with sufficient provision for such a multitude of Men, whereby a General is often forced to hazard the whole upon unequal terms, or to sound an unwilling Retreat; But the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp was either furnisht with Corn from the Provinces and next Confederate Nations, or when they were in an Enemies Country in the time of Harvest, by the Souldiers themselves, who reaped and gathered Corn, and delivered it threshed and cleansed to the Treasurer, that it might be kept till the day of payment, upon which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out so much Corn to every Souldier, for a certain time (which the nature of our Victuals will not admit) by which measure they very well knew the next day of payment. Every Foot-man received after the rate of a bushel a Week, which was thought sufficient for him and his Man, for if they had paid them in Mony, it
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58825:198"/>
might have been wasted in unnecessary expences. This Corn they ground with Hand. Mills, which they alwaies carried with them for that purpose, making it into hasty Cakes for themselves and their Servants; To sell or exchange this Corn for Bread was accounted a great Crime, insomuch that <hi>Salust</hi> reckons it up amongst other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours of the Discipline corrupted.</p>
               <p>In their assaulting or taking Towns they used several defensive Engines, after they had encompast the Town with a broad and deep Ditch, they raised a Rampier or Mount called <hi>Agger,</hi> made of Earth and other substance, which by little and little was raised forward, until it approacht near the place against which it was built, that upon it they might erect Fortresses and Turrets, and so fight with advantage of height.</p>
               <p>The sides of this Mount were of Timber, to keep in the loose matter, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts which were towards the place of Service, were open, without any Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, for on that part they still raised it, and brought it nearer the Walls.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> often raised these Mounts in the mouth of an Haven, to over-top the Town.</p>
               <p>They used also moveable Turrets with wheels, driving them to the Walls of a Town, these were of two sorts, <hi>great</hi> and <hi>little,</hi> the lesser sort are described by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> to be sixty Cubits high, and the square side seventeen Cubits, the breadth at the top, was a fifth part of the breadth at the Base, and so they stood sure without danger of falling.</p>
               <p>There were commonly ten stories in these little Turrets, and Windows in every story, in every one of these stories were Souldiers, Engines, Ladders, Casting-Bridges, by which they got upon the Walls, and so entred the Town. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of these Turrets were covered with Iron and Welt-coverings, to save themselves from fire.</p>
               <p>They had another Engine termed <hi>Vinea,</hi> which was a little House or Hovel, made of light Wood, that it might be removed with greater ease, the roof was supported by divers Pillats of a foot square, whereof the foremost was eight foot high, and the hindmost six, and between every one of these Pillars was sive soot in distance; It was alwaies made with a double Roof, the first or lower Roof was of thick Planks, the upper of Hurdles to break the force of any weight cast upon it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out destroying the building; The sides were of Hurdles to defend the Souldiers, the upper Roof commonly covered with raw Hides to keep it from burning.</p>
               <p>Many of these Hovels were joyned together in rank and order, when they went to undermine a Wall, the higher end was put next the Wall, that all the weights that were thrown upon it might tumble down without much damage to the Engine. It was driven (from place to place) upon four wheels as occasion required.</p>
               <p>Another was the <hi>Testudo,</hi> of which I have treated and described in another place.</p>
               <p>Their offensive Weapons were <hi>Balista,</hi> or the <hi>Sling,</hi> which is thus described by <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> translated by <hi>Godwyn; Between two Planks there is set a frame, and fast joyned a strong and big Iron, reaching out in length after the manner of a good great Rule; Out of the round body whereof, which is artificially wrought, there lieth forth farther out a four-square Beam, made hollow, with a direct passage in manner of a narrow Trough, tyed fast with many Cords, or Sinews twisted one within the other, and thereunto are joyned two wooden Screws, near unto one of which standeth the cunning Balister, or Engineer, and subtilly putteth into the hollow passage of the Beam a Wooden-shaft, with a big head glewed fast unto it, this done, on both sides, two lusty young men do bend the Engine, by turning about certain Wheels, when the top of the head is drawn to the uttermost end of the Cords, the shaft being carried forth by the</hi> Balista, <hi>by the inward force thereof, flyeth out of sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Battering Ram <hi>was a great Tree or Beam like unto the Mast of a Ship, having a piece of Iron in manner of a Rams head fastned at the end thereof, with which they did demolish the Walls of a City, it was hung unto a Beam which lay cross over a couple of Pillars, and hanging thus equally ballanced, it was by force of Men pulled backward, and then recoyled upon the Walls.</hi>

                  <hi>Malleoli</hi> (saith the same Author) <hi>were certain Darts fashioned in this manner; There was an Arrow made of a Cane, betwixt the head and the neck whereof was fastned an Iron full of clifts, which Arrow, like unto a Womans distaff, was finely made hollow within the belly, yet open in many places; In the belly it received fire, with suel to feed on, and thus being gently discharged out of a weak Bow (for with an over strong shooting, the fire was extinguished) if it took fast hold on any place, it burned the same, and water being cast thereon the fire increased, neither was there any means to quench it, but by casting Dust upon it.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> after a Victory, are observed to have been less Cruel and Insolent than any other People whatsoever, yet they had punishments among them, but such as were suitable to the obstinacy and malice of the Enemy. Some they punished with death, some they exposed to sale in the Market place, some they enforced to pay them Tribute, others they banisht their own Country, giving those forsaken Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories as a reward to their Old Souldiers, which place ever after was accounted a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony, to others, sometimes, they were content to allow them a peacable possession of their Country, upon condition they would tender due respect and allegiance to whatsoever Government the Senate should think fit to place over them, who was commonly called <hi>Proconsul,</hi> and his Power, in his own Province, was little less than absolute; For he did not only rule and dispose of all things as he thought best, and most advantagious to the safety of his Province, but also without leave from the Senate, or People, might undertake a War with any Neighbouring Nation.</p>
               <p>The absolute disposition of the whole course of it, whether it were to Treat, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate, Compound, or what else they thought convenient, for the advancement of the Common-wealth, did also wholly rest upon his direction.</p>
               <p>Touching the security (which the <hi>Romans</hi> required) of the Loyalty of such People as they had conquered, their manner was to take Hostages, a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Male-children of the chiefest Men of that Nation, whose lives depended upon their Parents fidelity, and ended with the first suspicion of Rebellion, which Custome, besides the present good, promised the like, or better Security, to the next Age, when as those Children, by Conversation and Acquaintance, should be so affected to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that returning to their own Country, their Actions might tend to the advancement, rather than any way to the prejudice of the same.</p>
               <p>And lest the love of Liberty and Freedom should prevail more with them, than that affectionate Nature had enjoyned to bear to their Children, they did what they could to take away the Instruments of Rebellion, by causing them to deliver up such Arms and Weapons as were there present, and so became suitable to that Petition of Peace which they had presented to them.</p>

               <head>Of their Habits.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>GOWN</hi> was the particular Habit of the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> in time of Peace, they being as easily distinguished from all other Nations by that expression of <hi>Gens Togata,</hi> as they were by that of <hi>Populus Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus;</hi> This Gown, according to some, was open before, according to others, sowed down to the bottom, and close, it came down to the Ankles, and was made without Sleeves, so that it was to be taken up and cast behind their backs, before they could make use of their Arms. But this liberty of casting back their Gowns, for the use of their Arms, was not allowed the first year to those that wore the <hi>Toga Virilis,</hi> as favouring too much of sauciness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty, according to that of <hi>Cicero, in Orat. Pro Calio nobis annus erat unus ad cohibendum brachium, Toga constitutus.</hi> The matter of which it was commonly made, was Wool, more for use than ornament, the wearing of Silks not being in use among the <hi>Romans</hi> till good Manners were out of fashion.</p>
               <p>The just measure or quantity of Cloth a true <hi>Roman</hi> Gown took up, was six Ells, yet it was made sometimes larger or straighter, of courser Wool or finer, according to the estate of the Person that was to wear it.</p>
               <p>That this Gown was to be girded or tuckt up, <hi>Sigonius</hi> affirms out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius</hi>

                  </note> his second Book, and saies, that this Cincture or Girding was three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <p>The first was the loose kind of cincture, notwithstanding which the tayl or gard of the Gown swept the ground.</p>
               <p>The close kind of girding, was, when the bosom of the Gown was so tucked up before that it could not reach the feet.</p>
               <p>The last was called <hi>Cinctus Gabinus,</hi> which was a Warlike-girding, not so that the whole Gown should be tucked up about the middle, but that it being cast quite backwards, the Person should gird himself with one skirt thereof.</p>
               <p>This manner of Girding the <hi>Consul</hi> used, when he was going to proclaim War, which Custome he received from a City of <hi>Campania,</hi> called <hi>Gabii,</hi> for the Citizens of this place being suddenly set upon by their Enemies, as they were at Sacrifice, girded one skirt of their Gowns about them, and so went to the Wars, where they obtained a memorable Victory, but <hi>Aldus Manutius</hi> stoutly opposes this Opinion, and proves it out of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> that they girded their <hi>Tunicks,</hi> not their <hi>Gowns,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aldus Manut. <hi>ex</hi> Suet.</note> suspecting that place of <hi>Macrobius</hi> (which <hi>Sigonius</hi> quoted as advantagious to his own purpose) of errour and corruption, for <hi>Suetonius</hi> speaking of the same thing, saies, That <hi>Caesars</hi> Tunick, not his Gown, was loosly and effeminately gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>There were several sorts of Gowns used by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>Toga praetexta,</hi> so called, because 'twas edged about with Purple, the <hi>Greeks</hi> termed it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; This Gown was worn at first only by the <hi>Roman</hi> Priests, and chief Magistrates, next it was allowed to Noble-men and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but afterwards it grew the habit of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Children, both Male and Female, in general.</p>
               <p>The Boys used this Gown till they came to be seventeen years of Age, and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens till they were married, so that this word <hi>Praetextati</hi> signified both young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Magistrates.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Toga pura,</hi> so called from the whiteness of its Colour, in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because it was free from all admixtures of Purple. It was termed also <hi>Virilis,</hi> as being the general wear of all private Men, at the going out of the sixteenth year of their Age, and also of all new married Women.</p>
               <p>It was called also <hi>Libera,</hi> because at that time they were free from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeings and chidings of their Tutors, and capable of all Freedom as other Citizens were.</p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:58825:200"/>
               <p>And the day of laying down the <hi>Praetexta,</hi> and taking up this, was called in their Kalender, <hi>Liberia,</hi> at which time, they, or their Relations, put into the Treasury (which was in the Temple of <hi>Youth</hi>) a <hi>Roman</hi> Penny, whereby they knew the true number of those that came to Mans estate that year.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Toga Candida,</hi> which was worn by those that sued for publick Offices, called <hi>Candida,</hi> because, besides the natural Whiteness of its colour, it was arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially made more intensively white and conspicuous with Chalk, from hence those that stood for such Offices were termed, <hi>Candidati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Toga pulla,</hi> this Gown (whilest the Common weal flourisht) was only used by Mourners, but under the Emperours, when the <hi>Toga alba,</hi> or <hi>Virilis,</hi> grew out of fashion, these black Gowns were the ordinary wear of the Common people.</p>
               <p>Hence grew that distinction, unknown to former Ages, of <hi>Pullati,</hi> which signified the Commonalty, and <hi>Candidati,</hi> the better sort of Citizens, and not those (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it signified) which sued for Magistracies. With such Gowns, in most parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> they wrapped up their dead, from whence <hi>Juvenal</hi> takes occasion to write thus,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Pars magna <hi>Italiae</hi> (si verum admittimus) in quá</l>
                  <l>Nemo togam sumit nifi mortuus—. <note place="margin">Juvenal.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Such Gowns in <hi>Italy</hi> (if truth wee'l hear)</l>
                  <l>The dead instead of Winding-sheets did wear.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The <hi>Sordida Toga,</hi> which was also the wear of the Poorer sort, was not of a Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black colour, as <hi>Sigonius</hi> falsly imagined, but was a Gown which at first was White, but afterwards, by long usage and constant wearing, became durty and sullied, for the Richer and neater sort of People alwaies went abroad in White garments, and if by walking they had contracted any filth, there were Fullers at <hi>Rome</hi> on purpose, who would take out those spots with <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Chalk,</hi> and restore them to their pristine colour.</p>
               <p>But on the daies of publick and private Rejoycing, they appeared in fresh Gowns more particularly, the Meaner sort also, who could not change so often, were wont, on daies of Publick Games (that they might seem finer, and gentiler than ordinary) to Chalk their Gowns all over, but the Nobility, who alwaies appeared in White, if they were supposed Guilty, during the time of their Arraignment, both they, and their Relations, wore this <hi>Toga Sordida,</hi> their Hair, and their Beards, long, neglecting on purpose all kind of Ornaments, that they might the easier incline the People to pity and favour.</p>
               <p>Not only the <hi>Romans,</hi> but the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nobility also affected this colour of White, thereby distinguishing in like manner their People from their Noble-men, and those of the better Rank they termed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Chorim, Albatos,</hi> Men in White, and on the contrary, the ordinary sort <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Chaschucim, Sordidatos,</hi> Men clad in foul Garments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Toga Picta</hi> was an <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Garment, of a Purple colour, embroidered and richly wrought with Gold, worn generally by those that had the liberty of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph allowed them, therefore 'twas some times called <hi>Toga Triumphalis,</hi> brought to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Tarquinius Priscus,</hi> after the conquest of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> sometimes <hi>Toga Palmata,</hi> from the Palm-branches which were wrought in it, betokening Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Toga Purpurea</hi> was not wrought or flowered, but plain, differing in that respect from the <hi>Toga picta,</hi> and from the <hi>Praetexta,</hi> in regard that was all white, except the Border or Edging, which was purple, this all purple, having no such gard or edging at all.</p>
               <p>There were three sorts of Gowns termed <hi>Trabeae,</hi> the first consisted of Purple only, termed <hi>Trabea consecrata,</hi> sacred to the Gods, the second was of Purple woven upon White, called <hi>Trabea Regia,</hi> worn by their Kings, the third was Scarlet woven upon Purple, called <hi>Trabea Auguralis,</hi> which the <hi>Augures,</hi> or <hi>Sooth sayers</hi> only did wear.</p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:58825:200"/>
               <p>After the deposing of their Kings, the <hi>Trabea Regia</hi> was worn by the Consuls also.</p>
               <p>Under their Gown they wore a Garment streighter and shorter, called <hi>Tunica,</hi> at first 'twas made without Sleeves, afterwards with them, on those that had not the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of wearing the larger Studs, it was so girded, that the forepart came down something below the Knee, the hinder part to the middle of the Ham, it being pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Women only to wear them lower, and to Centurions higher. It was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted unseemly and scandalous if they reached down to the Ankles, or if the Sleeves covered the hands.</p>
               <p>This Garment, in continuance of time, grew the general wear of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Citizens were distinguisht by it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Senators</hi> Coats were embroidered with large studs of Purple, like broad Nail-heads, whence they were termed <hi>Lati-clavia,</hi> those on the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights were somewhat less, and these Coats were called <hi>Angusti clavia,</hi> the Tribunes of the Souldiers were distinguisht (from one another) in quality and worth, by the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and narrowness of these Studs in like manner, also the Commonalty wore them plain, and these were called <hi>Tunicaerectae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon these Coats they commonly wore Campaigne Coats, or long Cloaks, to defend them from the Weather, called <hi>Lacernae,</hi> and <hi>Penulae,</hi> which covered their hands also, being buttoned or clasped under the Chin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lacerna</hi> was in frequent use in the Camp among the Souldiers, so that as <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatus</hi> signified Citizen, so <hi>Lacernatus</hi> was used for a Souldier, but when the Civil Wars broke out, the <hi>Toga</hi> was laid aside, and these <hi>Penulae Lacernae,</hi> but especially the <hi>Tunicae,</hi> became all in fashion, so that this distinction grew useless and unnecessary in the conclusion.</p>
               <p>The Lord Generals Coat was called <hi>Paludamentum,</hi> and the Souldiers usual Coat <hi>Sagum.</hi>

               <head>Of the Womens Garments.</head>
               <p>THE Matrons and honester sort of Women, wore a long Robe or Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called <hi>Stola,</hi> which came down to their heels, bordered about at the bottom, but the <hi>Roman</hi> Courtizans were known by their wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gowns, a proper attire for those that were more in love with Mens Breeches than their own Petticoats.</p>
               <p>They wore also a <hi>Pallium,</hi> or Mantle, which, on occasion, they put over their <hi>Stola's</hi> and <hi>Tunicks,</hi> something differing from those which were worn by Men and Boys.</p>
               <p>They secured and defended their stomacks against Cold with a <hi>Capitium,</hi> or Stomacher, their Shoulders and Breasts they streightly bound with Swadling-bands, left the shoulders should grow too broad, or start out and prove unequal, or lest their Breasts should swell into too large a round: they had their Tire-women, and many of the waies of dressing their Heads, and setting off their Faces, as ours have now adaies.</p>
               <p>This full account have I given you of the <hi>Romans,</hi> not only to shew you the manner of the People, but the nature of their Government, if not all, part of which, doubtless, they used, during so many hundred years time they had (by their Conquest) reduced this Island in subjection to their Empire and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Old <hi>ROMANS</hi> (as I said before) were nothing but a Company of Thieves and Out-Laws, which <hi>Juvenal</hi> very plainly and ingeniously affirms in these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verses, checking a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen overvaluing himself upon the account of his Nobility.</p>

               <p>Afterwards they proved a very Just, Grave, and sober sort of Men, but above all things extreamly Ambitious, <hi>Semper appetentes gloriae praeter caeteras Nationes sunt Romani,</hi> saies <hi>Tully; The</hi> ROMANS <hi>were ever (beyond all Nations) desirous of Glory.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tully.</note> And that they were Valiant and strangly Resolute in as great a measure, is evident from History, for in the lowest ebb of Fortune, and greatest distress of the Common-wealth, when no Human wisdom could perceive any way of escaping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Ruine, then were they proudest, their Demands almost insolent, and their Hopes outwardly greatest.</p>

that could be done he must first depart out of <hi>Italy,</hi> neither in the height of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> good Fortune, did they ever wrong the <hi>Roman</hi> Courage with the least thought of Irresolution and Despair.</p>
               <p>What happy Constellation was predominant at the founding of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> I cannot certainly tell, but that it was led and directed by the especial care and providence of the Gods, whose favour it had merited, and to whom it was most dear above all other places, may be reasonably presumed on from the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderableness of its beginning, and the continuance and long-life of its Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>Thus much we have discoursed purposely on the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the benefit of those that understand not Latin, that they may, in some measure, be acquainted with some few of their Customes, and the forms of Government used by those Ancient Hero's, thereby to know how much we owe to their Memories; for certainly, we ought to be obliged rather to them for their Victories, than any waies concerned at their Conquests, who were to us, and most Nations elsewhere, rather civil Tutors than domineering Tyrants; Wheresoever they came, unless highly provoked, they built and beautified more than they destroyed, and treated the Inhabitants as Friends and Allies rather than bitter Enemies.</p>
               <p>What infinite pains did they take in mending the Roads of many Counties, and making their rough and boggy places passable, for producing commerce and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance amongst the Natives themselves.</p>
               <p>At what vast expences did they maintain their Legionary Souldiers, and erect Courts of Judicature, for quelling the private Animosities of the Inhabitants, when the Revenues they exacted would scarce quit Charges, or the place it self prove worth the keeping, excepting that of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> So that all their Cruelties we can complain of, is the reducing of the Savage Nations, by force of Arms, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their reasonable Laws, when milder usage could not effect it. Neither have we reason to think much at the loss of our Liberty, when't was exchanged for such a glorious Subjection, under which slavery we lived more happy than under our own mild Extravagances, which hurried us headlong into a thousand Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> relinquished <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> suffering the Government to relapse into the Natives hands, upon those Letters of Discharge sent hither by <hi>Honorius,</hi> then with the Empire (to use Mr. <hi>Miltons</hi> own words) fell also what before in this We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern WORLD was chiefly <hi>Roman,</hi> namely, <hi>Learning, Valour, Eloquence, History, Civility,</hi> and even <hi>Language</hi> it self, the particulars of which have been more largely shewn in a former Treatise.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE British KINGS In the Daies of the SAXONS, WITH Some necessary Observations upon the Monument of Stone-Henge, Part whereof still remains upon <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS Catalogue of the <hi>British</hi> Kings, is the sacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of that memorable and scattered State, only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at the entrance of the <hi>Saxons</hi> into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who for several years, after their Invasion, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced not only their affection to their Country (in maintaining considerable oppositions against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) but justified also their Tempers and Spirits, to be not inferiour to the undertakings of their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CONSTANTINE,</hi> at the Request of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>London,</hi> made in the name of the whole Kingdom of <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> after his Banishment, entred the Isle (upon certain Terms and Conditions, before-hand concluded and confirmed) with an Army, by whose power and assistance was
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:58825:203"/>
given to the Enemy a considerable overthrow, but the <hi>Scotch</hi> Writers, seeming to grasp all to their own Honours, make themselves sole Masters of that daies enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and yet confess, that they lost <hi>DONGARD</hi> their King in the same Battle. But as the story goes, for the general part, after the <hi>Britains</hi> had obtained the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, they conveyed their General <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Chichester,</hi> and there (according to their promise) Crowned him King.</p>
            <p>This establishment spirited not a little the King, to rule his People nobly and justly, using his utmost endeavour to defend them from the assaults of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Constantine</hi> (as some think) was slain by the treachery of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> of whom I have spoken particularly in this place, to shew by what ways and devices Ambition advanced <hi>Vortigern</hi> to the Imperial Government. For, before <hi>Constantine</hi> was to be made a Sacrifice, in his own House, to the treachery of the Conspirator, he privately procures a censiderable Party, of the Nobility and Commons, to Vote with him, that <hi>Constantius,</hi> King <hi>Constantines</hi> eldest Son, in case the King should die, might be sent for out of the Abby of <hi>Winchester</hi> to succeed in his Fathers Government, who, during the Kings life, continued there a Monk, the People then believing his parts uncapable of a better employment.</p>
            <p>Now observe, I pray, <hi>Vortigern's</hi> policy, <note n="*" place="margin">Some called him <hi>Constans.</hi>
               </note> for because he thought he would afterwards continue as simple and indiscreet for Government, was preferred to his Fathers Dignity, and so not being able to govern himself, the trust of State-Affairs, <hi>Vortigern</hi> hoped, in a short time might be committed to his care, <hi>Which,</hi> thinks he, <hi>is a very good preparation for me (more insensibly to the World) to invest my self not only with the Robes, but Authority, of my Soveraign;</hi> And at last, indeed, so it proved, for abusing the mild Nature and good Disposition of the King, in a short time graspt both <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> into his own possession.</p>
            <p>The Guardians of his two Brothers, <hi>Aurellus Ambrosius,</hi> and <hi>Uter</hi> Sirnamed <note n="†" place="margin">Called <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragon</hi> from his fierceness of spirit.</note> 
               <hi>Pendragon,</hi> being too sensible of <hi>Vortigern's</hi> fraudulent deportment, hurried them away into <hi>Britany</hi> in <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Aldrogius,</hi> although the <hi>Britains,</hi> at that time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not his delusions, thinking verily, that what he acted was out of an honest and sincere principle, more to protect the King and his People, than any advance of his own power or Interest. But the conclusion proved to the contrary, for after by a new plot, he had procured also <hi>Constantius</hi> to be made away, the better to gild over his own Innocency, prosecutes several of the innocent <hi>Scots</hi> with death, as I have already shewn, in suspicion only of being concerned in murthering the King.</p>
            <p>This so infinitely pleased the People, that when they met to choose a new King (by reason <hi>Constantius's</hi> two Brothers were in <hi>France,</hi> and besides, too green in years to Govern) he Complemented some of the chiefest of the Nobility to joyn with the Commonalty, especially such as he knew had a good opinion of him, to elect him for their Soveraign, saying, <hi>It would conduce much to the satisfaction of the People, and consequently preserve Peace in that disturbed Age,</hi> inferring moreover, <hi>that they had no just cause to be in the least jealous of him, who had given them such frequent testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his honest deportment, care, and loyalty;</hi> so that managing his business so crastily, it was impossible that so rude and credulous an Age should prie, and dive into his so sudden designs, but must be answered in their desire in compleating him their absolute Monarch, who, after receiving the Kingdom into his protection, the better to secure to himself the continuance of his ill-gotten Power, strengthned the Tower of <hi>London</hi> with a considerable Garrison.</p>
            <p>After that, he Records (the better to ingratiate himself with the People) in a List all his especial Favourites, that had promised him to assist the severe prosecution of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and his Sons Adherents: But the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> hearing how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly the new <hi>British</hi> King had dealt with their Country-men, rose up in Arms against him, who reduced the <hi>Britains</hi> to that extremity and sorrow, that (for that instant of time) they knew no certain expedient to prevent their attending distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>After the deposing of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> entred his Son <hi>VORTIMER</hi> upon the Government, but after a few years Reign his Father again was restored. <hi>Vortimer's</hi> Salutation, soon after his reception, by the People, was with a new raised War
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:58825:203"/>
against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> which happened in several Battles, of which I shall only treat in brief.</p>
            <p>The first Encounter was near the River <hi>Derwent,</hi> where he gave the <hi>Saxons</hi> a great overthrow; the second at <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or</hi> Agli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthorp. <hi>Eldol</hi> made his escape after he had kill'd 17. of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with a Hedge-stake.</note> 
               <hi>Episford,</hi> in which Battle <hi>Catigern, Vortimer's</hi> Brother, and <hi>Horsus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Hengist,</hi> flew each other, but this Victory, as the <hi>British</hi> Histories will have it, must be allowed then also. The third was, when the <hi>Britains</hi> fought them by the Sea-side, and drave them to the Isle of <hi>Tenet;</hi> Also at <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> where, after a sharp contest, the <hi>Britains</hi> again had the better of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, <hi>Vortimer</hi> fought them in <note n="*" place="margin">Upon a Plain near <hi>Aylsford</hi> and at <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sord.</hi> Not named who she was.</note> 
               <hi>Kent,</hi> at <hi>Thetford</hi> in <hi>Norfolk;</hi> also not far from <hi>Colchester</hi> in <hi>Fssex,</hi> but the place where, and time when, I have not seen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ROWENA,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> perceiving that the fortunate Successes of her Sons undertakings would wholly destroy her Husbands Interests, by contriving his death, puts a stop to the current of his atchieving Greatness, which proved a means too, to conclude the Troubles of a six years Government, for being destroyed by <hi>Rowena</hi> (to preserve her own Interest) <hi>Vortigern</hi> was again restored, during the time of whose Banishment he made his abode in <hi>Wales,</hi> where he built a Castle upon the Mountain <hi>Cloaricus,</hi> called <hi>Seneron</hi> or <hi>Guanercu,</hi> because it stood not far from the River <hi>Guana,</hi> but whether built at his first or second entrance into <hi>Wales</hi> Authors differ.</p>
            <p>The time of this his Restauration seemeth (according to some Relaters) to be in the daies of <hi>Hengist;</hi> For 'tis said, that so soon as <hi>Hengist</hi> was advised of <hi>Vortigern's</hi> Reception, he collected together a great Army, but hearing the <hi>Britains</hi> at that time, in all probability, were likely to over-power him, he sent for <hi>Vortigern</hi> to meet him upon <hi>Salisbury-Plain</hi> with the chiefest of his Nobility, unarmed, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (as he pretended) to treat for Peace, but <hi>Hengist</hi> intending Treachery, that what he could not obtain by force, he would compel by policy, secretly advised his Associates, to put under their long Coats crooked Knives, that as soon as the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word was given, they were to execute their But chery upon the <hi>British</hi> Nobility, and their Attendants, which, as the story is related, was executed upon all save <hi>Vortigern</hi> (<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Or</hi> Agli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthorp. <hi>Eldol</hi> made his escape after he had kill'd 17. of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with a Hedge-stake.</note> 
               <hi>Eldol</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester</hi> made his escape) who only was concluded should be taken Prisoner, the better to qualifie the rage and fury of the <hi>Britains</hi> against him.</p>
            <p>The King, to redeem himself out of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Captivity, delivered to them the sole Government of three Provinces. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> seems to believe this Massacre of the <hi>Britains</hi> to be acted at a Banquet, unto which <hi>Hengist</hi> had invited the King and his Nobility, which seemeth to me very improbable, having before shewn, that the occasion of that invitation was solely grounded upon the Politick intentions of causing the King to fall in love with his Daughter, meerly to gain the Crown.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Vortigern</hi> was Duke of the <hi>Guises,</hi> a Prince of a Noble extract, <hi>Vortimer</hi> and <hi>Pascentius</hi> were his Issue by his first <note n="*" place="margin">Upon a Plain near <hi>Aylsford</hi> and at <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sord.</hi> Not named who she was.</note> Wife. By <hi>Rowena,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Hengist,</hi> he had a Daughter, whom afterwards he incestuously married, of whom he begat a Son named <hi>Faustus,</hi> who, after mature judgment, knowing himself to be the Off-spring of such impious Parents, hoping thereby to divert those heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which by reason thereof might otherwise fall upon him, spent his time in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Prayers, and solitary Meditations.</p>
            <p>The Nobility and Clergy, being much disturbed at the sordid and inhumane Actions of this Prince, endeavoured, what in them lay, to reclaim and reprehend his Insolencies, and more especially, to shew their dislike to his incestuous Marriage with his own Daughter, and the spreading of the poysoning Doctrine of <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,</hi> which was again about to revive by the promotion of his <hi>Saxon</hi> kindred, as appears by their second meeting in Councel, which was as followeth.

            <p>Thus translated,</p>
            <p>A second <hi>British</hi> Councel, held by St. <hi>German</hi> Bishop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and a great number of the Clergy and Laity, against the arriving of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie, and against the Incestuous marriage of King <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern</hi> with his Daughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THe same year</hi> (viz. 449.) <hi>'twas reported, that the</hi> Pelagian <hi>Heresie in</hi> BRITAIN, <hi>by the means of some few Abettours and Authors, began to revive and bud out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain</hi> 
               <note place="margin">An Dom. 449.</note> 
               <hi>afresh, whereupon the prayers and earnest desires of the Clergy were forthwith sent to that Holy Man St.</hi> German, <hi>beseeching him once more to take upon him the Cause of GOD, in which, but a little before he had been so victorious. The Good Man very readily condescended to a compliance with their desires; For joyning with himself, in this Affair</hi> Severus, <hi>a Man of eminent Sanctity (who had been the Disciple of St.</hi> Loup, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Troy's, <hi>and then ordained Bishop of</hi> Triers, <hi>and who had preached the Word of God to the People of the I'rov nce of</hi> Germania <hi>prima) took Shipping (and happily the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58825:204"/>
Elements consenting) arrived in</hi> Britain, <hi>where, by the antidote of Preaching, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly healed the wounds of Incredulity, and by the medicine of his Doctrine cured the Imposthume of</hi> Blasphemy. <hi>This Perversity or Heresie, with its Authors, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men being condemned, for a long time after the Faith remained pure, and undefilable in these places; All things being thus composed, these Blessed Priests returned with the same happiness they arrived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Besides all these Evils</hi> Vortigern <hi>took his own Daughter to Wife, which bore him a</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Faustus:</note> 
               <hi>Son, but when this was fully known to St.</hi> German, <hi>he came to reprehend the King, with all the</hi> British <hi>Clergy, but whilest a great Senate of Clergy and Laity were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting, the King praeinstructed his Daughter, that she should go to the Assembly and deliver up her Son into St.</hi> German's <hi>Arms, and say, that he was the Father of it, and so she did as she had been taught. St.</hi> German <hi>received the Child with a great deal of Courtesie, and began to say,</hi> I will be to thee a Father, but I will not suffer thee unless I have a Razor, with a pair of Scissors and Comb, which shall be lawful for thee to present to thy Carnal Father. <hi>The Child, as soon as he heard it, very readily obeyed the good Old Man, and going towards his carnal Grandfather, and carnal Father</hi> Vortigern, <hi>said,</hi> My Father, clip and comb the Hair of my head, <hi>at which the King was silent, and would return no Answer again to the Child, but rose up exceeding angry, seeking how he might conveniently flie from the face of St.</hi> German, <hi>so that he was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and condemned not only by St.</hi> German, <hi>but all the</hi> British <hi>Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For some time many of <hi>Vortigern's</hi> Subjects (as we have shewn) at first applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Vertues, but by the proofs of his succeeding Actions, were sound to be vailed over only with the appearance of a dissembling Sanctity. How long did he commit that Incestuous Marriage with his own Daughter (yea, the Off-spring of a <hi>Pelagian</hi>) before it was discovered to the Councel! How unworthily did he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card his first Wife, who was a Christian, to obtain, through the dictates of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamable Lusts and Concupiscence, the Pagan Daughter of <hi>Hengist!</hi> How politick was he, in endeavouring to acquit himself of the blame and reproof of a whole Senate, for begetting a Son of his own Daughter! How many Innocent persons suffered (as I may say) Martyrdom by his unjust contrivances, to promote his own Interest and Greatness; and the better also to uphold himself excused, in the name of Innocency, how did he seduce the Ignorant people into a full perswasion of his honesty and good meaning towards them!</p>
            <p>By this his dissimulation and subtilty he out-stript his Predecessours in Power, meaning all those Kings since the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest, as they were more like Generals than Kings of Provinces, many of them being permitted by the <hi>Romans</hi> to Rule, not after the manner of Sovereignty, but as Instruments to commemorate to after-Ages, how they lived under them in slavery and bondage, but <hi>Vortigern</hi> (although he had the ill fortune once to be deposed) was happy in having no Copartner or sharer afterwards in his Provinces, save what he carelessly threw away at one cast to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> upon his last releasment out of their Captivity.</p>
            <p>Was there great blame to be laid to his <note n="*" place="margin">Vortimer.</note> Sons charge, for accepting the Crown in his life time, or his own miscarriage in disobliging the People to enforce him out of possession? In what a discontented condition did he remain during his Sons Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, although alwaies treated by Mildness and Courtesie, but after his Sons decease, through the Treacherous contrivance of <hi>Rowena,</hi> the People, being streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for want of a Governour in such distracted times, and crediting his Penitence, but chiefly depending on his Valour and Conduct, reinstated him in the <hi>British</hi> Throne, by whose fierce and resolute opposing their Enemies, he occasioned the loss not only of many a mans life, but the destruction also of the considerable part of many a Noble Province.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AMBROSIUS AURELIANUS,</hi> only in hopes of his fortunate success, was chosen King by the <hi>Britains;</hi> A Man of a mild and sweet nature, and the last branch of the <hi>Roman</hi> Root, who (through providence) gained many Victories in the behalf of his distressed People; Notwithstanding, in the heat of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, doubtless, would have been willing to have received a more Valiant spirit, that could but have given them but at lest the hopes of a more secure freedom from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tyranny.</p>
            <pb n="394" facs="tcp:58825:205"/>
            <p>Passing the River <hi>Humber,</hi> the first Expedition he undertook was the routing the <hi>Saxons</hi> at the Fight of <hi>Macsbel, Occa</hi> the Son of <hi>Hengist</hi> escaped to <hi>York,</hi> but by reason of a quick pursuit was forced to surrender himself to <hi>Ambrosius,</hi> who (out of his Favour and Courtesie) released him freely and nobly without any Ransom, as it appears by some Writers, that he gave to him <hi>Galloway,</hi> near the <hi>Scots</hi> Country, to inhabit, but took sufficient Hostages, that neither himself nor his Consederates should take up Arms against him, taking into his possession all places where the <hi>Saxons</hi> were most conversant, and had almost ruined to obtain them, repairing Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Cities, and Towns, as had been by them so miserably demolished, and there impowred Priests, capable of preaching the Word of GOD to the People.</p>
            <p>At the time when <hi>Ambrosius</hi> lay very sick of a doubtful distemper, <hi>Pascentius, Vortigerns</hi> youngest Son, appeared at the head of an Insurrection, laid siege to <note n="*" place="margin">Now called St. <hi>Davids.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mencvia</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> he took it, and did much mischief in all places that lay within the reach and limits of his Malice and Envy.</p>
            <p>The Cause of <hi>Ambrosius</hi> was managed with good success, by <hi>Uter Pendragon,</hi> but in the interim one <hi>Copa</hi> (privately procured by <hi>Pascentius</hi>) who feigning himself to be a <hi>British</hi> Monk and Physician, offered his advice to <hi>Ambrosius.</hi> The good Man lying sick and weak, meaning honestly himself, and thought verily that the Monk did so, took his dose of Poyson, instead of an healthful Antidote to expel his distemper, which in a very short time put an end to his daies at <hi>Winchester.</hi> Yet others (to salve that notable piece of Treachery) report, that he died of a Wound (in a fierce and terrible Battle against the <hi>Saxons</hi>) in the West part of <hi>Britain;</hi> And other Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, in contradiction to <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Gildas,</hi> although as credible Authors as some others make him the Branch of a Noble <hi>Britain,</hi> whose sudden death, for a time, put a stop to the Wars between them and the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto this <hi>Ambrosius</hi> is ascribed the building of <hi>STONE-HENGE</hi> upon <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> in remembrance of the <hi>Britains</hi> Massacred by the Treachery of <hi>Hengist,</hi> and which gives an occasion to some to believe it, as by digging very near the place where the Monument now standeth, have been found pieces of Old fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Armour, with Bones of Men of a large size, which could be no other but the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> buried by that Temple, and in all probability built by them, of which I shall speak more at large anon.</p>
            <p>Others report, how the <hi>Britains</hi> erected this Monument for the sake only of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius</hi> (in which place he is said to be there slain and buried) in memory of his great service done to them in the behalf of their Country, which <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> seems to testifie, but how far that Author is to be credited, I must (with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) leave it to better Judgments to examine.</p>
            <p>But that the Materials of this Sepulchre (according to the prodigious fancy and dreams of some <hi>British</hi> Writers should be fetcht out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there being Stones of the like nature, and equal magnitude, by industry and labour, to be found not far off that place) by the help of fifteen thousand Men, under the Conduct of <hi>Uter Pendragon,</hi> seems not only improbable but impossible also, nevertheless it shews the Zeal of the <hi>Britains,</hi> in promoting the Honour of their Prince, rather than clearing a true evidence or cause of that matter, or the original Founders thereof, occasioned partly, I say, out of their entire affection to their King, rather than to give an occasion for after Ages too much to puzzle their brains, in enquiring out a more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and more Honourable Original.</p>
            <p>Again, Others have been deluded into a belief (through the strangness and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude thereof) that it was erected by the Magick Art of <hi>Merlyn;</hi> This hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned a Traditional talk to pass through the inouths of several succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the Stones, being so set, cannot be told exactly; but to wipe away that Imaginary cheat out of mens minds, and that they may clearly see that there is no Magick, either to blind their sight, or to stupisie their Judgment, if they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly tell them, let them sollow this ensuing direction; Observe the orders of the Circles as they now appear, and not rashly pass from one to another confusedly, taking especial care that they observe where they first begin to number, and the just number of every Stone will be found exactly, and proceeding after that order and method they may be alwaies told over without missing.</p>
            <pb n="395" facs="tcp:58825:205"/>
            <p>And for the better information of all persons who have not had leisure to search into the different Opinions of Authors, touching the occasion of the erecting that stately Monument of <hi>STONE-HENGE,</hi> and that I may have the better opportunity to deliver my own Opinion thereof, I will present to the Reader a brief Relation concerning the same, in these following Observations.</p>
            <div type="treatise">
               <head>A TREATISE OF THE Ancient Monument CALLED STONE-HENGE.</head>
               <p>UPON the Plains, about six miles from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> towards the North, in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> stands, and for many Ages hath stood, a structure, the Architraves whereof are so strangly and artificially set upon the heads of the upright Stones, that they hang, as it were, in the Air, from whence not improperly termed STONE-HENGE. When it was in its primitive Glory, without doubt, it did shew it self a more admirable piece of curiosity, and now, if lookt upon by a Judicious Architect, will appear to retain the Idea of its pristine Workmanship, but having suffered so much through the injury of Time, and violence of the Weather, it seems to others, at this present (as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> saies) no otherwise than an huge and monstrous piece of Work, such as <hi>Cicero</hi> calls, <hi>Insanam substructionem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it appears now, 'tis thus described by him; <hi>Within the circuit of a Ditch</hi> (saith he) <hi>there are erected, in manner of a Crown, in three ranks or courses one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Camb <hi>Brit.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>another, certain mighty and unwrought Stones, whereof some are twenty eight foot high, and seven foot broad, upon the heads of which, others (like overthwart pieces) do bear and rest cross-wise with small Tenons and Mortises, so as the whole frame seemeth to hang.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <note n="*" place="margin">Stone-henge <hi>Restored.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Inigo Jones,</hi> Architect to King <hi>James,</hi> upon diligent survey, and further enquiry, found it to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Temple, consisting of the <hi>Tuscan</hi> Order (which is, a plain, grave, and humble manner of Building) round, and open or Roofless at top. Of the whole Fabrick he giveth this account; <hi>The whole work in general</hi> (saies he) <hi>being of a Circular form, is one hundred and ten foot Diameter, double winged about, without a Roof, Anciently environed with a deep Trench, still appearing, about thirty foot broad, so that betwixt it and the work it self, a large and void space of ground is left; It had, from the Plain, three open Entrances, the most conspicuous thereof lying North-east, at each of which was raised, on the out side of the Trench aforesaid, two huge Stones Gate-wise, parallel whereunto, on the inside, two others of less proportion. The Inner part of the Work consisting of an Hexagonal figure, was raised by due sometry upon the Bases of four equilateral Triangles (which formed the whole Structure) the Inner part likewise was double, having within it another Hexagon raised, and all that
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58825:206"/>
part within the Trench scited upon a Commanding ground, eminent, and higher by much, than any of the Plain lying without, and in the midst thereof, upon a foundation of hard Chalk, the Work it self was placed, insomuch, that from what part soever they came unto it, they arose by an easie ascending Hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arguments by which he proves it a <hi>Roman</hi> Edifice (for the further satisfaction of the Reader) in short, are these.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That the</hi> Tuscan <hi>Order is purely an</hi> Italian <hi>Invention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Scheam (consisting of four equilateral Triangles, inscribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the circumference of a Circle) by which this Work,</hi> Stone-henge, <hi>is formed, was an Architectonical Scheam used by the</hi> Romans.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the Portico at</hi> Stone-henge <hi>is made double, as in structures of great Magnificence the Ancient</hi> Romans <hi>used, witness the Temple dedicated to</hi> JOVE <hi>the Thunderer, built by</hi> Augustus Caesar <hi>at the foot of the Capitol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That there is a Portito within the Cell, or greater Hexagon, reduced like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise into the same figure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that the <hi>Romans</hi> used to make <hi>Portico's</hi> on the inside of their Buildings, as well Sacred as Secular, manifestly appears by the Ruines of their <hi>Basilica's,</hi> or Courts of Judicature, and by that Temple without a Roof, anciently dedicated to <hi>JOVE</hi> in Mount <hi>Quirinalis,</hi> now the Horse-Mount in <hi>Rome.</hi> But these <hi>Portico's</hi> were more particularly used by the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Temples uncovered, and Roof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, which may be gathered from <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 1. Lib. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Vitruvins; Hypaethros in interiore parte habet column as remot as à parietibus ad circuitionem, at Porticus, peristiliorum.</hi> Temples open to the Air, and without Roofs, have Columns on the inside, distant from the Walls, as Courts, Portico's about them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>Architects, in distinguishing the manner of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, alwaies observed</hi> (as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Vitruvius</hi> tells us) <hi>the greater the Columns were, the closer they set them together: so in this piece of Antiquity, the Stones being great, the spaces betwixt them are likewise narrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>That the Architraves in this Work, were all of them set without Mortar, and fixed upon the upright Stones by Tenons, in the very same manner as in great Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, where the Stones are solid, and of more than ordinary bigness, the</hi> Romans <hi>were wont to do. They laid them without any unctious or incorporating matter; Nullo salta glutino,</hi> faith <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 1. Lib. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Leo Baptista Albertus, and concludes it to have been erected to the God</hi> COELUS, <hi>from the order, form, and aspect of this Antiquity;</hi> a further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which the Reader may find at large in <hi>Stone-henge Restored.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though the make and fashion of which <hi>Stone-henge</hi> consists, is very proper for the God <hi>COELUS,</hi> yet considering that the <hi>Romans</hi> seldom erected Temples to this God in any of their Provinces, and that no substantial Reason can be given why they should do it here, we may with more probability (but with submission to better Judgments) conclude it consecrated to their God <hi>TERMINUS,</hi> it being probable that upon these Plains, as upon others in <hi>England,</hi> namely, <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market-Heath, Kettering,</hi> and many more, as likewise in other natures where vast <hi>Heaths</hi> are found which cannot be terminated with <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> such Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were set up, or Ditches digged, Moulds raised, were, by different precincts, distinguished.</p>
               <p>And to make these Bounds more Sacred, that he might be cursed whoever leaped over, or removed the Land-mark of his Neighbour, they consecrated these Moulds or Monuments to the honour of this their God, whom, for that particular office of guarding and distinguishing the Fronteirs of Precincts or Provinces, they called by the name of <hi>Terminus,</hi> or <hi>Bounder,</hi> and the scituation, form, aspect, and order of <hi>Stone-henge;</hi> seems very agreeable to the nature of that Deity.</p>
               <p>And that which the more confirms the Opinion, is, that there is a Structure in <hi>Scotland</hi> almost the same with <hi>Stone henge,</hi> sacred to the God <hi>TERMINUS,</hi> and (according to the conjecture of Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>) built about the same time that <hi>Stone-henge</hi> is supposed to have been. The description of it you may read in the same Author, in <hi>Scot. p. 28.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hard by this Wall of Turf</hi> (saies he) <hi>what way as the River</hi> Carron <hi>crosseth the Sheriffdom of</hi> Sterling, <hi>towards the left hand; are seen two Mounts cast up by Mans hands, which they call</hi> Duni pacis, <hi>i. e.</hi> Knoits of Peace, <hi>and almost two miles lower
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:58825:206"/>
there is an ancient Round building, twenty four Cubits high, and thirteen broad, open in the top, fram'd of Rough stone without Lime, having the upper part of every Stone so tenonted into the nether, as that the whole work rising still narrow, by a mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing and clasping upholdeth it self;</hi> Some call this the Temple of the God <hi>TERMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS,</hi> and that the Limits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was near <hi>Carron,</hi> is affirmed by <hi>Buchanan</hi> in these Verses;</p>

                     <hi>Roma</hi> securigeris praetendit Moenia <hi>Scotis,</hi>

                  <l>Hic spe progressus positd, <hi>Carronis</hi> ad undam</l>
                  <l>Terminus <hi>Ausonii</hi> signat divertia Regni.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> rais'd a Wall against the Pole ax'd <hi>Scot,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Despairing any further to promote</l>
                  <l>Its weary Eagles, for near <hi>Carron's</hi> sands</l>
                  <l>The utmost Limit of her Empire stands.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Now according to this description, who does not see a great analogy and simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude between <hi>Stone-henge</hi> and this Building, they being both round, open, and without a Roof, and the Stones in either unwrought, and tenonted without Mortar; or other conglutinous matter. Had this, in time, been surveyed by a judicious and learned Architect, it might probably have been found altogether of the like fashion; and built for the same purpose. As for those signal differences that are now between them, we must attribute them to the length of Time, and the more injurious rage of those barbarous and savage People that made frequent inroads into this Tract, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable Enemies, both to the <hi>Romans</hi> and Civility, looking upon their Buildings; rather as Monuments of their Slavery, than Ornaments to their Country, it having fared otherwise with <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> as scituated amongst a more civilized sort of People.</p>
               <p>Besides these, the <hi>Caledonian</hi> Britains, not very long after, drave the <hi>Romans</hi> back as far as the River <hi>Tine,</hi> and although <hi>Hadrian</hi> came himself in Person into <hi>Britain,</hi> about the fortieth year after <hi>Agricola's</hi> Expedition, and reformed many things in it, yet he went no farther forwards, but contented himself with the loss of that part of the Province, which he found alwaies subject to Incursions, and the least defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. So that we may suppose, after the <hi>Britains</hi> had thus far regained upon their Enemies, that they made spoil and havock of whatever was <hi>Roman.</hi> Or perhaps, this Structure was not designed so stately and Magnificent, at first, as <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> it being a vain thing to erect Publick buildings, with exquisite skill and vast expence, in a Country, where the Natives would neither admire the one, or gratefully look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and acknowledge the other. But whether it was formerly a Building of the like nature with <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> or (according to <hi>Ninnius</hi>) a Triumphal Arch erected by <hi>Carausius,</hi> I shall leave to the Readers Judgment to determine.</p>
               <p>Several Arguments I have produced to prove <hi>Stone-henge</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> structure, and a Temple dedicated either to <hi>Goelius</hi> or <hi>Terminus, Pan, Diana,</hi> or whomsoever different Opinions hath fastned it upon; But there are many things which, in my Judgment (but with submission to better Reason when alleadged) that seem to argue this great Pile to be of far higher date than the times of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Neither think I it altogether to be neglected, what name the <hi>British</hi> Writers (living in succeeding Ages) call it by, namely, <hi>Corea Gigantum,</hi> and they further add (as <hi>Giraldus Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brensis</hi> witnesseth, though fabulously) that it was brought from the farthermost parts <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Girald. Comb.</hi> de adm. Hib. cap. 18.</note> of <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to separate Truth from a Fable, and to find out an Ancient Tradition, wrapt up in ignorant and idle Tales; Why may not these Giants, so often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, upon this, and other occasions, be the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> as we have proved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other occasions, and the Art of erecting these Stones, instead of the <hi>STONES</hi> themselves, brought from the farthermost parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> the known habitations of the <hi>Phoenicians?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:58825:207"/>
               <p>I could never imagine (as I have shewn in another place) that the <hi>Romans,</hi> in so few years, could be taken for Giants in <hi>Britain,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> supposeth, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering, that even in those Ages the notion of Giants began to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded; and the more acquainted the <hi>Britains</hi> had been with that Nation, the more were they taught to cast off such monstrous imaginations.</p>
               <p>If any object, <hi>That the Structure seemeth of</hi> Tuscan <hi>order, and so purely</hi> Italian, let them consider, that the <hi>Tuscans</hi> were (as <hi>Grotius,</hi> and others prove) of <hi>Tyrian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Grotius.</note> Original, and in all probability brought with them (from <hi>Phoenicia</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi>) that order of building; So that what one Colony of the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> carried into <hi>Italy,</hi> another, with the same reason, might bring into <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, it is to be observed, what the Restorer of <hi>Stone-henge</hi> confesseth, namely, That in all his Travels, through <hi>Italy</hi> and other Countries, he found no Structure of like Order exactly with this, insomuch that he admires it for its Rarity, and especial difference from all others, it being properly a mixture of the <hi>Tuscan</hi> and <hi>lonick</hi> Order.</p>
               <p>Now, that the <hi>lonians</hi> were immediately derived from a Colony of the <hi>Phoenicians, Herodotus</hi> especially, and all Authors with him agree, so that seeing this <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> is esteemed in this Age a mixt Building of <hi>Tuscan</hi> and <hi>lonic</hi> Order, both <hi>Phoenician</hi> Nations, why may not it be accounted a Work of the Ancient <hi>Phoenicians?</hi> In, or about that time the <hi>Tuscans</hi> used one sort of Building, the <hi>lonians</hi> another, why might not the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> use both waies in <hi>Britain,</hi> as being the People from whom both waies were originally derived?</p>
               <p>In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, not far from this Antiquity was found a Table of Mettal, made up of <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> inscribed with many Letters, but of so strange a Character, that neither the Antiquaries of that Age, nor Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> School-Master of <hi>Pauls,</hi> could make any thing of them.</p>
               <p>The Mettals, <hi>Tynn</hi> and <hi>Lead,</hi> seem to shew the Table of <hi>Phoenician</hi> composure, and had it been preserved to this day, we might possibly have found the Letters to have been of the same stamp also; for had they been <hi>Roman</hi> Characters, they could not have been ignorant of them, or if <hi>Gothick,</hi> which, at first sight look like <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi> Letters, they also were sufficiently understood in that Age. And herein I accuse not any (of those times) of the want of knowledge in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Tongue; they might easily know the Character, and yet overlook it, as not expecting it in <hi>Britain,</hi> as men oftentimes in looking for things lost, miss of the place where they are by too much poring on that spot of ground, where in more reason they think they should be found.</p>
               <p>These are Motives that induce me to believe this Monument ancienter than the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> seeing that neither the <hi>Romans,</hi> who have Recorded things of less moment to their advantage, nor succeeding Authors after them, have made any mention of so famous a Work, but contrary what we find of it is involved in Fables of Giants, which, in my Judgment, more properly belongs to the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> than <hi>Romans.</hi> And as the Author of <hi>Stone-henge</hi> Restored, without any Authority, but the openess of the Roof, judgeth the Structure to be consecrated to <hi>COELUS,</hi> who was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in such Temples, why may it not be lawful for me to guess, to what God the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> (if it were their building) dedicated this Magnificent pile.</p>
               <p>We have read, that the <hi>Phoenician</hi> HERCULES first discovered this Nation, and to him, every where, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> in following Ages, built Altars, and erected Temples, as their Tutelar Deity.</p>
               <p>Now, if we consider the great Pillars he is said to erect in the Streights of <hi>Cades,</hi> called <hi>The Pillars of</hi> Hercules, and how the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> represented him alwaies leaning upon Pillars; why may it not be probable, that this Pile, consisting of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Pillars, and not a continued Wall, being vast Stones standing distinct from one another, contrary to the nature of other Temples, why might it not, I say, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to HERCULES, especially if we consider that they adored <hi>Hercules</hi> as the <hi>Sun,</hi> who is represented, by the <hi>Heathen</hi> Hierographers, looking through Chinks and Crevises, with this Motto,</p>

               <p>Since, in speaking of the foregoing place, I intimated that the Character in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed on it might not impossibly be <hi>Gothick,</hi> which is the same with the Old <hi>Saxon,</hi> it will not be altogether tedious to insert their Opinions, who bring the Date of this Structure to the time of the <hi>Saxons</hi> arrival into <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have been of Opinion, that <hi>STONE-HENGE</hi> was erected as a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in honour of some of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Nobility, and they alleadge, the Custome of that Nation was, <hi>in reering great Monuments for the Tombs of their Gentry.</hi>

               <p>Besides, these Great Stones were the only Libraries, or places of preserving that little Learning they had. <hi>Archiepiscopus</hi> Upsalentis, <hi>de</hi> Getis <hi>in</hi> Gothlandia, <hi>in praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> cap. 8. <hi>Fuerat enim ab Origine Regni</hi> Gothorum <hi>magnus in ejus incolis gloria &amp; laudis appetitus, proindè praeclara majorum gesta in carmina &amp; versus quodam Poetico more sed patrio Sermone redigere curaverunt, eaque in conviviis, ut juventutem ad vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem excitarent, frequentèr concinebant, quae tandem nè aevi longaeva vetustate aboleri possent Rupibus &amp; Saxis insculpserunt;</hi> There was ever from the very beginning of the <hi>Gothick</hi> Empire, a strange thirst and desire in that People after Praise and Glory, wherefore they carefully reduced into Rithm the famous Enterprizes of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors after a Poetick fashion, but in their Native Language, which they were often to sing at their Feasts, that they might incite their Youth to an imitation of their Ancestors Vertues, which they inscribed on great Rocks and Stones, lest they should, through length of time, perish and be forgotten.</p>
               <p>This Custome of erecting Stones on the Graves of the deceased, they used very frequently here also.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Cornwal</hi> there are to be seen Nineteen Stones set in a round Circle, distant every one about twelve foot from the other, and in the very Centre there is one pitched far higher and greater than the rest.

               <p>
                  <hi>Roll-Richstones</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> was also erected after some memorable Victory by <hi>Rollo</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> who afterwards conquered <hi>Normandy.</hi> And although anciently, in many places they reared these Stones after a rude confused manner, and without any Art, for the aforesaid uses, yet without question, through length of time and continuance of Custome from the Flood, they placed them afterwards with greater elegancy, and exactness of figure and order, than their Forefathers had done, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming that Zeal and Superstition wrought the same effects in them, as in other People.</p>
               <p>The next that falls under our consideration is, <hi>Merlyn,</hi> on whom some Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians have fathered STONE-HENGE, where we shall examine what means and abilities he had in that ignorant Age for the accomplishing so curious a piece of Work, which will be the easier done if we can but find out who he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MERLYN,</hi> by some, is said to be the Son of King <hi>Demetius</hi> his Daughter, who finding her self with Child, gave it out, either to excuse her folly in a weak and credulous Age, or by concealing her Gallants Name to save his life, a policy often used by that Sex to save their Credits; that she had been compressed by a fantastical Spirit, or <hi>Incubus;</hi> So <hi>Oenone</hi> confessed to <hi>Paris,</hi> that she had been ravisht by <hi>Apollo,</hi>
                  <pb n="400" facs="tcp:58825:208"/>
and <hi>Rhea</hi> likewise by <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Merovee's</hi> Mother, that she was got with Child by a Sea-Monster; from which preposterous congression, <hi>Merlyn,</hi> as the report is, came, who growing up to Riper years was gifted with the Spirit of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and said to have been very exquisite in the hidden mysteries of <hi>Magick,</hi> by which he very oft diverted the Melancholy thoughts of the miserable <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr., <hi>Cambden</hi> calls him, in one place, the <hi>British Apollo,</hi> in another, the <hi>British Tages. In this City</hi> Carmardin (saies he) <hi>was born the</hi> Tages <hi>of the</hi> Britains, <hi>I mean</hi> Merlyn, <hi>for like as</hi> Tages <hi>being the Son of an evil Angel taught his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the</hi> Tuscans <hi>the art of</hi> Sooth-saying, <hi>so this</hi> MERLYN, <hi>the Son of an</hi> Incubus <hi>Spirit, devised for our</hi> Britains <hi>Prophestes, nay, rather meer fantastical Dreams.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to believe that <hi>Merlyn,</hi> by the Art Magick, and by the instigation of <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Aurelianus,</hi> easily brought these Stones from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and with the same facility set them up in <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> as a Monument of the massacred <hi>British</hi> Nobility, with many other stories that fabulous. Writers have delivered of him, were, no doubt, an unpardonable folly in both Writer and Reader. Upon which occasion, pray observe how the Old Poet <hi>Alexander Necham</hi> speaks in these Verses;</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nobilis est Lapidum structura Chorea Gigantum,</l>

                  <l>Quod nè prodiret in lucem segnius artem,</l>
                  <l>Se viresque suas consuluisse reor.</l>
                  <l>Hoc opus adscribit <hi>Merlino</hi> garrula fama,</l>

                  <l>There is a Structure called the Giants dance,</l>
                  <l>Which Art its utmost trying, did advance;</l>
                  <l>For lest it should too late appear, sure Art</l>
                  <l>It self consulted, how to adorn each part.</l>
                  <l>This Fame saies, <hi>Merlyn</hi> to perfection brought;</l>
                  <l>But Fame said more than ever <hi>Merlyn</hi> wrought.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And yet to look upon all things as fabulous and ridiculous concerning him, were perhaps, too inconsiderately to wrong the Vertues of so eminent a Person; For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose but look upon him as a Man of excellent parts, far beyond any of his Age, however rendered by Fables suspected, for considering how the <hi>British</hi> Chronicles, and Fame, unanimously conspire in setting forth his Actions, we may safely believe that his admirable skill, especially in Mathematicks, was the occasion and ground of those fictitious and impertinent things they make him perform in the behalf of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> and other Princes; So that although we allow him not to be so great, or rather monstrous, as some out of their love would have him, yet we may reasonably suppose him wiser, and far above those sort of men that lived in his time, there being alwaies something of Truth to be found at the bottom of a Fable.</p>
               <p>The greatest disadvantage and unhappiness that can befal a great and generous Spirit is to be born in a dark, base, and ignorant Age, who looking on the Actions of the Brave, through the Magnifying-glass of their own fears and simplicities, make them swell, through a too forward but injurious Zeal, to that monstrosity and bulk, that their very greatness makes them suspected by Posterity, so that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite disadvantages that Fame suffers by the suspicion of after Ages, can never be recompenced by the overplus allowed in the Age they lived in, or in the next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> conjectures that this <hi>Merlyn</hi> and <hi>Ambrosius Aurclianus</hi> (who is by some supposed to have erected <hi>Stone-Henge</hi>) to be one and the same person, his words, comparing both together, are these, Common opinion, but grounded chiefly on the <hi>British</hi> Fables, makes this <hi>Ambrosius</hi> to be a younger Son of that <hi>Constantine,</hi> whose eldest, as we heard, was <note n="*" place="margin">In some Hist. <hi>Constantius.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Constans</hi> the Monk, who both lost their Lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, usurping the Empire, as some will have it: But the express words of both <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> assure us, that the Parents of this <hi>Ambrosius,</hi> having here born equal dignity, were slain in these <hi>Pictish</hi> Wars and Commotions in the Island; and that the fear of <hi>Ambrosius</hi> induced <hi>Vortigerne</hi> to call in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> it seems <hi>Vortigerne</hi> usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his Right.</p>
               <p>I perceive not, that <hi>Ninnius</hi> makes any difference between him and <hi>Merlyn,</hi> for that Child without a Father that Prophecyed to <hi>Vortigerne,</hi> he names not <hi>Merlyn,</hi> but <hi>Ambrose</hi> makes him the Son of a <hi>Roman</hi> Consul, but concealed by his Mother, as fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the King therefore sought his Life. If so, then without question, he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to have raised <hi>Stone-henge;</hi> for being not only of the <hi>Roman</hi> Race, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so living among them, 'tis undisputable, but he soon became acquainted with most of their Customs and Sciences of which they were Masters.</p>
               <p>For although in his time, through the Invasion of the <hi>Goths,</hi> Barbarism had so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-run <hi>Italy,</hi> that not only the liberal Sciences and Architecture, but the Art Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was so far lost among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were ignorant of the very rudiments of War; yet this must not be understood universally, but of the generality of the People at that time, and that there were no publick Professours of those Arts among them, and not that all the Gentry, or every individual, were so ignorant, that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius</hi> could learn nothing from their Conversation: For if that were true, we might by the same Argument prove him no Souldier.</p>
               <p>For in those times, Barbarism had so bereaft them of their skill (says <hi>Procopius</hi>) even in what manner to sound a Retreat; But his frequent Successes in his Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Saxons</hi> contradict the one, and his often repairing Forts, Cittadels, and Temples evidently shew not only his willingness, but his skill and ability also to have done greater things, had his Wars allowed him sufficient leisure and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Besides, if there were no skilful Architect in <hi>Britain,</hi> at this time, who was it that built <hi>Vortigerne's</hi> Castle, which was made so strange, that he thought it was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to entertain the assaults of his enemies, if any should dare to oppose him.</p>
               <p>Now though we have supposed him to have skill and ability enough for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing such a piece of Work, yet it will scarce be proved notwithstanding, that he was the Author of it; for <hi>Stone-henge</hi> being two miles distant from <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> where the massacred <hi>Britains</hi> are said to be interred, it would be against Reason and Custom to imagine, That he should set up a Monument so far from the Graves of those he intended to honour; unless we should say, that these <hi>British</hi> Historians (taking some things upon report) might a little mistake the place, as well as good Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have done formerly, or that more out of Love and Zeal than any relation to truth, they delivered to Posterity they were buried in the Church-yard in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of <hi>Ambresbury</hi> hard by, rather than any vast and wide Plain, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring decent and religious Burying before the magnificentest Interment, and consecrated ground more than all the Monuments and Marks of Honour in the World.</p>
               <p>Besides <hi>Geff</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in his Fifth Book says, <hi>Jussit</hi> Vortigernus <hi>&amp; Cives &amp;</hi> Saxones <hi>Maiis Kalendis quae jam instare incipiebant juxta</hi> Ambrii <hi>Caenobium convenire.</hi>

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:58825:209"/>
For with what Reason can we suppose <hi>Hengist,</hi> who (to our fatal experience) we found politick enough in laying the design, on a sudden to prove so ill a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as to allow of a Conference at <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> a Town wholly at <hi>Vortigern's</hi> devotion, and of indifferent Concourse, as being the usual place of Interrment for the <hi>British</hi> KINGS, rather than two Miles from it on <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> which afforded him greater security for his own Person, and the rest of his Company, and was more suitable to his own Son he had then in being, unless he trusted so much to their Seaxes, as to dispatch the business before those of <hi>Ambresbury</hi> could come up to the relief of their Country-men, which cannot reasonably be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>And though the same Author, <hi>Geoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> saies, that these Massacred <hi>Britains</hi> were buried, <hi>in Coemiterio quod est juxta Coenobium,</hi> yet I question whether he did not speak more after the phrase of those times he wrote in, than those that he wrote of. For I very much doubt whether Monasteries, so early, and so near, had Church-yards laid out to them, Churches I am sure had not for a long time after, but the only Argument to prove this a <hi>British</hi> Monument is <hi>Catigern's</hi> Tomb, who fell in a Battle against <hi>Horsa,</hi> where the Tomb only differs from this in bigness, and as being fixed without Mortises and Tenons, as we have it expressed by Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> in his description of <hi>Kent,</hi> wherein he sets down several other things (worthy of observation) relating to that Country.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Against these <hi>Uter</hi> prudently made all the haste he could (with resolution, upon the first opportunity) to give them Battle, lest this new Pretender, through length of time, might steal away the Affections of the unstable <hi>Britains,</hi> and he himself bring his own Credit in question, by delaying the Engagement, insomuch that the one being actuated by his own natural fierceness, from whence termed <hi>UTER,</hi> the other spurr'd on by Ambition, the Fight for a long time stood doubtful, but in the end <hi>Pascentius,</hi> and his <hi>Irish</hi> Associates were slain, ill defending their claim to that, which their Fathers before them held by as bad a Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelius</hi> being dead, and himself freed from all Competitors in the Kingdom, he began to have an eye upon the proceedings of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> For understanding how <hi>Esk</hi> and <hi>Occa, Hengist's</hi> Sons, had harrassed and spoiled the Country as far as the City of <hi>York,</hi> with all the speed therefore imaginable he wade after these Free-Booters, and as suddenly defeated them, taking the two Brethren prisoners; A good

natured Prince (without doubt) that spared the Lives of those that were, by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, stealing his Kingdom, and whose Father, but a little before, had sacrificed 300 of his Nobility.</p>
               <p>In this Prince his time landed <hi>Kerdic</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> a new Enemy sierce and hardy, who notwithstanding all opposition <hi>Pendragon</hi> could make, daily discomsited the <hi>Britains,</hi> and gained Territories large enough for himself and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>Now, whether this happened whilst he was doting on the fair Dutchess of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> and so could not spare time to attend their Motions, sure it is we read that the <hi>Britains,</hi> to recover what they had lost, set upon the <hi>Saxons,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Natanleod</hi> or <hi>Nazeleod,</hi> a certain King of <hi>Britain,</hi> but were sufficiently routed by <hi>Kerdic</hi> and his <hi>Saxons,</hi> from whence the place in <hi>Hantshire,</hi> as far as <hi>Kerdicsford,</hi> now <hi>Chardford,</hi> was called of old, <hi>Nazaleod.</hi>

These had Justice on their side, and <hi>Arthur</hi> eleven points of the Law, Possession, and a good Sword to make it good, they often backt their Pretences with a good Army, and were as often defeated by this young Prince; yet not so throughly, but that they held him in Plea all his life-time, upon occasions, assisting the <hi>Saxon</hi> against him, and at <hi>Cambula</hi> in <hi>Cornwall</hi> (saith <hi>Leland</hi>) this <hi>British Hector</hi> encountering <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Lotho's</hi> Son, slew him outright, and received of him his own deaths wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninnius</hi> reports, that he over-threw the <hi>Saxons</hi> in twelve great Battels, but with what credit, I know not; <hi>Kerdic</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> during all the time of <hi>Arthurs</hi> Reign, continually gained ground of him, and possest himself of <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Hantshire,</hi> in defyance of all the opposition he could make against him; but after the fight at Mount <hi>Badon,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> are said to have sate down quietly for a good while, after which those restless Spirits would scarce have done, had they not stood in fear of an Army more powerful than their own: Therefore we may with some Reason be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he gave the <hi>Saxons</hi> some considerable defeat, and might, with all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, have eased the Kingdom of that troublesom Enemy, had not his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Spirit been almost consumed and over-wearied by their continual Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys.</p>
               <p>Fame has done no Prince more Injury than this, for by representing him so far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all proportion, she has made him Monstrous, and by her over-fond talking, hath made Posterity suspect (with some reason), whether there ever was any such Person. The <hi>Bards</hi> styled him IMPERATOR BRITANNIAE, GALLIAE, GER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANIAE, DACIAE, now who can believe, that he should ramble so far to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase new Countreys, especially with the blood of his own People, that could not defend his own against the Enemy at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caradoc</hi> relates, that <hi>Melvas,</hi> King of that Country, which is now called <hi>Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi> detained from him (his wife <hi>Guenever</hi>) in the Town of <hi>Glaston,</hi> for the space of a whole year, and afterwards restored her, at the desire of <hi>Gildas,</hi> not by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion or force, that <hi>Arthur</hi> could make against him: If this be true, then <hi>Arthur</hi> seems to be a very unlikely Man to run-over <hi>Germany,</hi> that could not chastise the affront of a little Prince of <hi>Somerset,</hi> that had so much defiled his Bed.</p>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:58825:210"/>
               <p>Now the greatest Argument we have to prove, there was ever such a Man as <hi>ARTHUR,</hi> is this; King <hi>HENRY</hi> the Second, whilest he was at <hi>Pembroke,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Girald. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brensis.</note> diligently hearkning to a <hi>Welch Bard</hi> that was singing the notable Exploits of King <hi>ARTHUR,</hi> and taking particular notice of the place of his Burial (the Song de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing it to be in the Churchyard of <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> and that betwixt two Pyramids) commanded, for his further satisfaction, that they should dig thereabouts. When they came some seven foot deep, they found an huge broad Stone with a Leaden-Cross fastened to it, and on that side that lay downward, in rude Letters was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this Inscription,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>HIC JACET</l>
                  <l>SEPULTUS INCLYTUS</l>

               </lg>
               <p>And digging nine foot deeper, his Body was found in the Trunk of a Tree, the Bones of a great bigness, and in his Skull were perceived ten wounds, the last very great and plainly seen.</p>
               <p>By him also lay <hi>GUINEVER</hi> his Queen, seeming perfect and whole till it was toucht, then appearing to be nothing but Dust, but the <hi>Restorer</hi> of <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge</hi> (with more probability) hath found her Tomb at <hi>Ambresbury. Among other Sepulchres</hi> (saies he) <hi>found at the said Monastery, it is worthy Memory, that about the beginning of this Century, one of them hewn out of a firm Stone, and placed in the middle of a Wall, was opened, having upon its coverture rude Letters of massie Gold, to this purpose;</hi>
                  <q>R. G. A. C. 600.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Interpreted,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Regina Guinevera Arturi Conjux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Bones within which Scpulchre were all firm, fair yellow coloured Hair about the Skull, a supposed piece of the Liver near upon the bigness of a Wall-nut, very dry and hard, and together therewith were found several Royal habiliments, as</hi> Jewels, Veils, Scarfs, <hi>&amp;c. retaining even till then their proper Colours. All which were afterwards very choicely kept in the Collection of the Right Honourable</hi> EDWARD, <hi>then Earl of</hi> Hertford; <hi>and of the aforesaid Gold divers Rings were made, and worn by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships principal Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which Tomb, is supposed, by the same Author, to be the Sepulchre of Queen <hi>GUINEVER,</hi> Wife of King <hi>ARTHUR,</hi> especially the letters <hi>R. G. &amp;c.</hi> viz. <hi>Regina Guinevera, &amp;c.</hi> and the date, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 600, if rightly Copied, agreeing with the time of her death.</p>
               <p>Besides, <hi>Leyland</hi> affirms, that several Writers make mention, she took upon her a <hi>Nuns</hi> Veil at <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> died, and was there buried, unto which he gives so much credit, that (whatever <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> delivers to the contrary) he will by no means allow, either her Body to be afterwards translated from <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> or
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:58825:211"/>
at any time buried, by her Husband King <hi>ARTHUR,</hi> at <hi>Glastonbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto <hi>Leyland's</hi> Reasons for her Interrment at <hi>Ambresbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> it seems, inclines also, because wholly silent of her Sepulchre discovered any where else, though at large sets down the Circumstances of her Husbands Body, it being found at <hi>Glastonbury,</hi> for had Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> found any thing inducing him to believe her Body had been, together with his there found, he would never, certainly, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it from Posterity.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Constantine the IV.</head>
                  <p>THis <hi>CONSTANTINE</hi> (according to some Writers) after the death of Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> Reigned as a Tyrant over <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonshire,</hi> at the same time with <hi>Aurelius Conanus, Vortipor,</hi> and <hi>Malgo,</hi> but, according to others, by the appointment of <hi>Arthur</hi> a little before his death, he succeeded him alone in the Kingdom, the <hi>Britains</hi> unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously ratifiing the choice, as expecting mighty things from the Person their admired Champion had pitched upon for their Governour. But, as many private Persons, who were before good Subjects, have proved but bad Kings after they came to the Crown; So it fared with this <hi>Constantine,</hi> who being more conceited of his Power, than knowing in the waies of Governing, grew on a sudden so intollerably proud, that he slighted his Enemies, contemned his Friends, and measured Justice by the length and strength of his own Sword.</p>
                  <p>Possibly he had found the inconvenience of it sooner, had not the <hi>Pictish</hi> War broke out, which diverted the minds of his incensed <hi>Britains</hi> another way. For the <hi>Picts</hi> hearing that after the death of <hi>Arthur, Constantine</hi> was made King, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with an Army in favour of the Sons of <hi>Mordred, Arthur's</hi> Nephews, to settle them in their Right. But these he happily routed, chasing his two Rivals with their Governours, taking Sanctuary, the one in <hi>Winchester,</hi> the other in <hi>London,</hi> to the very Altar, but the sacred Reverence of the place stopt not his fury, for he slew them there, with their two Governours, without any consideration of the tenderness of their years, or holiness of the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gildas</hi> sharply inveighs against this Prince for his <hi>Adultery,</hi> forsaking his lawful Wife, and for his <hi>Perjury, &amp;c.</hi> lastly, for murthering these two Children. Yet these being the Sons of the false <hi>Mordred,</hi> who had created his predecessour <hi>Arthur</hi> so much trouble all his life time, by his frequent Rebellions, and, at last, gave him his deaths wound, seems a little to take away from the Cruelty of the Action.</p>
                  <p>After he had Reigned about four years, he was slain by his Kinsman <hi>Aurelius Conanus,</hi> and Interr'd at <hi>Stone-henge,</hi> by his Ancestour <hi>Uter Pendragon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the death of <hi>Constantine,</hi> there appeared three Pretenders to the Crown at once, <hi>AURELIUS CONANUS,</hi> Lord of <hi>North-Wales, VORTIPOR,</hi> Lord of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> and <hi>MALGO CONANUS</hi> (as <hi>Gildas</hi> stiles him) <hi>Dragon of the Isles.</hi> Every one of these usurping the Title of KING of <hi>BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN,</hi> though too weak to defend themselves, and it, from the swelling Greatness of the Victorious <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Most Historians make them to have reigned successively, but they seem to me to have been petty Kings at one and the same time; for by the reprehensions of <hi>Gildas</hi> 'tis plain, that those Princes lived all at one and the same time, unto whom he spake personally, which could not be had such successions of years past as is laid down by those Historians; Besides, 'tis said that <hi>Aurelius Conanus</hi> was a Prince of a Noble heart, free, and liberal, but given much to the maintenance of strife and discord among his People, which in my mind, will best be understood of his difference with his two Competitours, <hi>Vortipor</hi> and <hi>Malgo,</hi> and their Subjects, which indeed were
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:58825:211"/>
his also, as taking upon him the stile of KING of <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> especially if we consider he had watchful Neighbours about him, who were willing to take the greatest advantage over him they could.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gildas,</hi> in his <hi>Invectives,</hi> terms <hi>Vortipor</hi> the unworthy Son of a good King, as <hi>Manasses</hi> was to <hi>Ezechias.</hi> Now this <hi>good King</hi> cannot be <hi>Aurelius Conanus,</hi> who is reprehended for his Vicious life by him as much as any, and consequently <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por</hi> was none of his Son, so that how he came to succeed him in the Kingdom, as their Historians pretend, can scarce be made out.</p>
                  <p>What great Actions these three Kings did, during their Reign, or what good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities they were indued with, is not hitherto known, there's but a very slender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them in the Rolls of Fame, which may make us suspect they were guilty of very few, and those scarce worth the committing to posterity. In <hi>Gildas,</hi> and other Histories, we may find a large Catalogue of their bad ones.</p>

                  <p>BY this time the <hi>SAXONS</hi> had fixt themselves secure enough in <hi>Britain,</hi> none of the <hi>British</hi> KINGS being able utterly to dispossess them, through the continual Supplies (they received out of <hi>Germany</hi>) of their new Acquisitions, yet this Prince something revived the decaying Spirit of the <hi>Britains</hi> by his own Example, behaving himself briskly, and proving fortunate against them in several Battles, whereupon the <hi>Saxons</hi> (to rid themselves of so dangerous an Enemy) called to their assistance <hi>Gurmundus,</hi> a <hi>Norwegian</hi> Captain (but, as some say, sent for from <hi>Ireland</hi>) who surrounding the <hi>Britains,</hi> dismayed at so great an Army, secured themselves in the Town of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> but the Besiegers, though they were not excellent at taking Towns by Assault, thought upon an Invention that did their business as well, for fastning fire to the feet of several Sparrows they had taken for that purpose, being let loose they flew into the Town, and lighting upon the Thatched-houses, and other combustible matter, set all on fire. Upon this, the <hi>Britains</hi> rather burnt out than carried on by Courage, made a short sally, but being over-powred by numbers, were at last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, leaving many of their Nobility dead upon the place; In the mean time, whilest the <hi>Britains</hi> maintained this Fight, <hi>Careticus</hi> stole out of the Battle, securing himself among the Mountains in <hi>Wales,</hi> where he found more security, though less plenty.</p>
                  <p>Now were the <hi>Saxons</hi> Lords of all <hi>Britain,</hi> this being the last <hi>British</hi> King that had any thing to do in the Eastern parts of this Kingdom, being confined thence forward, in the West, by the Rivers <hi>Severne</hi> and <hi>Dee.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gurmundus,</hi> after he had destroyed a great part of the Country, he delivered it up into the possession of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who willingly and thankfully received it at his hands.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>BRITAINS,</hi> ever since the Battle of <hi>Badon hill,</hi> had been at variance amongst themselves, and now, since the Fight of <hi>Careticus,</hi> they could not agree who should be their Governour, twenty four years together they were led by sundry Rulers against the Enemy, but finding by experience, into what precipices and disadvantages their stubborness and rash Counsels had brought them, with joynt consent chose <hi>CADWAN,</hi> Ruler of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> King over them.</p>
                  <p>This Prince, though his Dominions were lesser than those his Ancestours formerly possest, yet he gave early proofs to the World, that the greatness of his Mind was nothing diminished. For presently, after his Election, he raised a large Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to enforce satisfaction from the <hi>Saxons,</hi> for shedding the Innocent blood of 1200 Monks of <hi>Bangor.</hi>

                     <hi>EDELFERD,</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who had caused this Massacre, understanding his design, thought not to be behind hand with him, wherefore asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating himself with most of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes, brought a good Army into the Field to meet his Opposer; Both Armies were now in sight, and every one expected when the Storm that was over their Heads would break, but on a sudden it blew over, and fair Weather immediately appeared to both Parties; For partly by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Friends, and partly from a serious consideration of what sad consequence Victory it self must needs be to either Party, a Peace was concluded, and these two irreconcilable Enemies became, for a long time after, loving Friends.</p>

                  <p>THis PRINCE was nothing inferiour, if not superiour to many of his Predecessours, in Conduct and Valour, alwaies behaving himself victoriously (too severely and rigorously according to the <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers, how true I know not) against his old Enemy the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

                  <p>Vengeance, though late, overtook these <hi>Northumbrians</hi> for Inhumanly butchering the Monks of <hi>Bangor,</hi> pursuing afterwards the <hi>Saxons</hi> with that vehemence, that nothing could satisfie his fury but the extirpation of both their Race and Name. Besides, he not only slew many of their Princes, and most commonly routed their Armies, but dispossessed them of their Kingdoms at his pleasure, two years after <hi>Penda's</hi> death, making a Grant of the Kingdom of <hi>Mercia</hi> to his Son <hi>Ulfridus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He Reigned forty eight years, his Body being embalmed, was enclosed in a Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Image, and set upon a Brazen Horse of excellent beauty.

                  <p>According to the <hi>British</hi> Historians, <hi>Cadwallader</hi> succeeded <hi>Cadwalls,</hi> but if we consider the Eminent <hi>Saxons</hi> he is said to have slain, his going to <hi>Rome</hi> to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Pope <hi>Seigius,</hi> his dying shortly afterwards, and his being buried in the Church of St. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> he will appear to have been one and the same with <hi>Cadwallader</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> for which cause we omit a particular discourse of him in this place, and this observation Mr. <hi>Speed,</hi> and some others, have not made concerning the same, as they have set him down positively, a succeeding King in the <hi>British</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <head>THE ANTIQUITY AND ORIGINAL OF THE SAXONS.</head>
               <p>BEING to write of the <hi>SAXONS,</hi> a Nation who, next to the <hi>Romans,</hi> possessed this ISLAND, and so well establisht their Laws and Language therein, as to this day they remain in force to their Posterity, being not as yet wholly rooted out, though often subject to alterations and revolutions: It will not be amiss there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to trace their Originals and progress to the first Ages of the World, but unnecessary to fill up their Antiquities with forged stories out of <hi>Berosus,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Cuisco</hi> the Grandchild of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Father of the whole <hi>German</hi> Nation. It shall suffice to obtain leave to go no higher than <hi>Wooden,</hi> from whom the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes in general claimed their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and from whom (Deified for his great Deeds) <hi>HENGIST</hi> and <hi>HORSUS,</hi> who first arrived in <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> are said to descend in the fourth degree.</p>
               <p>But before we write of the particular Actions of this Prince, his leading the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Getes,</hi> from <hi>Scythia</hi> and <hi>Cimmeria,</hi> into the Northern parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> whence they spread themselves all along upon the Coasts of the <hi>Baltick,</hi> and so round to <hi>Belgium</hi> and <hi>Batavia,</hi> it will be necessary first to shew, what manner of People they were, and by what names called at their Arrival into <hi>BRITAIN,</hi> which known, we may the easier go back to the discovery of their true Originals.</p>
               <p>Those therefore that possest themselves of this ISLAND, were generally known by the names of <hi>SAXONS, ANGLES,</hi> and <hi>JUTES,</hi> all branches of the same Stock, though called differently, agreeing exactly in Language, Customes, and Religions.</p>

                  <head>First therefore of the SAXONS.</head>
                  <p>THE Name of the <hi>SAXONS,</hi> for a time, before their publick Arrival, and a good while after, was more universally known than that of the <hi>JUTES</hi> or <hi>ANGLES,</hi> though this latter in succeeding Ages prevailed more, and the name of the <hi>Jutes</hi> seemeth to have been the Ancienter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Isidore</hi> deriveth the <hi>Saxons</hi> from the Latin word <hi>SAXUM,</hi> a <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Rock.</hi>

                     <hi>The Nation of the</hi> SAXONS (saith he) <hi>possesseth the shoars of the Ocean, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approachable Marches, from whence they received their Name, being a hardy and strong People, and more famous than others for Piracy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed we know what terrible apprehensions the <hi>Romans</hi> had of them, who maintained here a Military Force against them, under a Commander whose Title was, <hi>Count of the</hi> Saxon <hi>shoar in</hi> BRITAIN; about the daies of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> when <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rausius</hi> was employed against them, they became famous under the name of <hi>SAXONS,</hi> and, I think, were not known to the <hi>Romans</hi> till <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> whatever some suppose of <hi>Axones</hi> in <hi>Lucan;</hi> but I fear this derivation from <hi>SAXUM,</hi> a <hi>Stone,</hi> will not be allowed, though they who go about to make it appear ridiculous and impossible, bring no other Arguments than what are fetched from the Northern Records, which say (but how truly I will not here examine) that the Name of the <hi>Saxons</hi> was in the World a thousand years before our Saviour Christ, long before the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue prevailed.</p>
                  <p>As for them who derive their Name from <hi>Askenas,</hi> or from <hi>Saxo</hi> the Brother of <hi>Vandal,</hi> it is easie to be guessed from whence they forged such Fables, and so little deserve an Answer, that they are not worthy so much as to be mentioned in this place.</p>

                     <hi>Cambden,</hi> brings them from the <hi>SACAE,</hi> a kind of <hi>Scythian</hi> People about <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria,</hi> from whom they were called the Sons of the <hi>Sacae,</hi> or <hi>Sacasons,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction <hi>Saxons. These,</hi> they say (out of <hi>Strabo</hi>) <hi>leaving their Ancient seats, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered</hi> Bactriana, <hi>and the best part of</hi> Armenia, <hi>and called it after their Name</hi> Saca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sena, <hi>and so on by continued success passed to</hi> Cappadocia, <hi>that part especially which lieth on the</hi> Euxine <hi>Sea, afterwards to the</hi> Hircinian <hi>Wood, and having conquered</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, <hi>to have named a part of it</hi> Sacasena, <hi>or</hi> Saxonia; thus <hi>Geropius.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> observeth how <hi>Ptolomy</hi> placeth the <hi>Sassones</hi> in that part of <hi>Scythia,</hi> and the truth is, there is but little quarrel as touching the Circumstances of their habitation. For that the <hi>Saxons</hi> came from these parts, I think on all hands is agreed, but whether through the <hi>Hircinian</hi> Wood, or <hi>Sarmatick</hi> Sea, into <hi>Germany,</hi> variously is disputed upon the credit of different Authors, though not much material to this point.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> and <hi>Verstegan,</hi> Men exactly skill'd in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, destroy <note place="margin">Shering, <hi>de Orig,</hi> Angl, Versteg.</note> this derivation of the <hi>Saxons</hi> from <hi>Sassones, Sacasons,</hi> or such like words, by telling us that raex, in the singular number signifieth a <hi>Saxon,</hi> and that <hi>Seaxen, Seaxna, Seaxena,</hi> as likewise <hi>Saxen, Sachsen, Sassen,</hi> and the like, are Plurals, and signifie many <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>SEAX</hi> being the Original name of a <hi>Saxon</hi> in their own Language, and <hi>Seaxen</hi> the Plural of it, it is manifest that adding of <hi>son</hi> to <hi>Seax</hi> to make <hi>Saxon,</hi> is but a fiction, seeing there was never heard in the World any such word as Saexson, or the like, to signifie a singular <hi>Saxon;</hi> But the mistake ariseth from the Plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which, in the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Dialect, often terminates in <hi>n,</hi> as <hi>Children, Oxen, Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, &amp;c.</hi> Now if any say that <hi>Seax</hi> may come from the <hi>Sacae,</hi> the contrary, for ought can be known, mav be as true.</p>
                  <p>The Opinion which cometh nearest to truth, is, that they are called from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Weapon they wore different from other <hi>Germans,</hi> and peculiar only to their own Nations, It was made crooked in the nature of a Sickle or Scyth, the edge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the contrary side, after the manner (though more bent) of our ordinary Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. This Weapon was named in their Tongue a SEAX, and we read, that, in that treac' erous Party upon <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> appointed between <hi>Hengist</hi> (the first <hi>Saxon</hi>
                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:58825:214"/>
that landed in this Island) and King <hi>Vortigern,</hi> it was agreed that both Parties should meet unarmed, but the <hi>Saxons</hi> either fearing the worst; or intending Treason and Treachery, carried privately under their Garments short Knives, or Cutlets, which upon the Watch-word given, <hi>Dem cout Seaxes,</hi> that is, <hi>Take your Seaxes,</hi> they immediately drew out so suddenly, and slew of the <hi>Eritish</hi> Nobility no less than three hundred.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Seax</hi> which they wore was sharp on one side, but the back was either blunt, or made after the manner of a <hi>Saw,</hi> according to the curiosity of the Workmanship, these Weapons being called <hi>Seaxen,</hi> it will not be amiss to shew from whence the word is derived which gave Name to our Ancestours.</p>

                     </gap>. <hi>SAGS,</hi> saith <hi>Wormius,</hi> in his <hi>Runick</hi> or <hi>Gothick</hi> Lexicon (which <note place="margin">Worm: <hi>Lex.</hi>
                     </note> was the Dialect of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as shall be more fully shewn) signifieth a kind of <hi>Sword,</hi> or <hi>Dagger,</hi> whose blade and hand was almost equal, it was sharp on one side, and not unlike to a crooked Knife. The <hi>Saxons</hi> had two sorts of Weapons, a greater and a lesser, the long <hi>Seax</hi> they wore by their sides, the other, called the less <hi>Seax,</hi> or hand <hi>Seax,</hi> was either wore in the Scabbard, or else in a Sheath distinct by it self. Now as the lesser Weapon, or <hi>Knise,</hi> is derived from the <hi>Gothick Sags,</hi> and in the Plural <hi>Sagsags,</hi> so the greater also hath the same Original, for as that made in the nature of a <hi>Sickle</hi> is called <hi>Saex,</hi> so this is termed (according to <hi>Megeser</hi>) a <hi>Saison,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Megeser.</note> or <hi>Sesson,</hi> which signifieth a <hi>Sythe,</hi> and at this day in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> they name a <hi>Sythe</hi> a <hi>Sassen,</hi> and a <hi>Saxon</hi> they call <hi>Dle Sassen;</hi> and that this kind of Weapon was generally used by the <hi>Getes,</hi> from whom the <hi>Saxons</hi> are derived, shall be proved, <hi>Statius</hi> testifying the same in these Verses,</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> in his description of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> tells us, <hi>That in</hi> Wales <hi>there was</hi>

                  <p>THEY are of the same Original with the former, and the reason of their Name is diversly given. <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> fetcheth it from <hi>Angulus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Dan,</hi> and Son of <hi>Humblus,</hi> whom others call <hi>Humilus;</hi> Others, <note place="margin">Saxo <hi>Gram.</hi> Gerop.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Geropius Becanus</hi> deriveth it from <hi>Angelen,</hi> or <hi>Anglen,</hi> a <hi>Fish-hook,</hi> and saith, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> arrogated this Name to themselves, <hi>because, living on the Sea-coasts, nothing passed on the Waters, but was drawn and hookt in by them;</hi> But this Erymology, as it savoureth of fancy more than truth, so doth it carry in it self its own confutation, for the <hi>Angli</hi> or <hi>Angili</hi> were so called long before they came to the Sea-coasts, even when they were an Inland-people, as shall be shewn more fully in the sequel.</p>
                  <p>The next Opinion which seemeth to carry more right, and hath hitherto been most generally received, is, that they took name from <hi>ANGULUS,</hi> that is, an <hi>Angle</hi> or <hi>Corner,</hi> their ancient Country, about <hi>Sleswick,</hi> being a narrow Isthmus lying upon the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. Of this mind is Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> though afterwards he contradicts himself; and <hi>Verstegan</hi> writes thus, <hi>The word Eng, in the ancient</hi> Teutonick, <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To prove this Opinion <hi>Bede</hi> is quoted, who writeth, <hi>That the</hi> ANGLES <hi>came out of that Country which is called</hi> Angulus, <hi>and is reported, from that time, to lie waste between the Provinces of the</hi> Saxons <hi>and</hi>

                  <p>Thus we see the the progress of the <hi>ANGLES</hi> set down from <hi>Angulus,</hi> or <hi>Anglia</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> Southward, by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> and others, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whereof is true, as shall manifestly be shewn. For as it is not to be denied, but that our <hi>English</hi> Ancestors came from this Province into <hi>Britain,</hi> yet that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Name originally from it, call it <hi>Angulus,</hi> or <hi>Angle,</hi> or <hi>Old England,</hi> which you please, and so carried it into <hi>Germany,</hi> cannot in reason be supposed upon the following account.</p>
                  <p>First, because the name of <hi>Angli,</hi> or <hi>Angili,</hi> was known in the World long before they had possession of this Country, when they were an Inland-People, living far within the Continent, which being true, makes it evident that the <hi>ANGLI</hi> gave name to this <hi>Province,</hi> and not the Province to them.</p>
                  <p>To put this out of dispute, it is to be observed that <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and after him <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who first wrote of the <hi>Angli</hi> or <hi>Angili,</hi> make them an Inland-People, and part of the <hi>Suevians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ptolomy</hi> divideth the <hi>Suevians</hi> into three Nations, the <hi>Longobardi, Semnones,</hi> and <hi>Angili;</hi> Now the <hi>Suevians</hi> were a Nation who never continued above a year in one place, but, as <hi>Caesar, Strabo,</hi> and other Authors witness, continually ranged up and down, still seeking out new Habitations, roving therefore through <hi>Germany;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Caesar. Strabo.</note> that part of them called <hi>English Suevians,</hi> gave names to the forementioned Places, <hi>Ingolstad, Engleburg, &amp;c.</hi> and at length, after the daies of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> passed into the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:58825:215"/>
                     <hi>Cimbrick Chersoness,</hi> a Province whereof they accordingly gave the denomination of <hi>Angulus,</hi> or <hi>Angel;</hi> For, in the daies of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> in that part of <hi>Denmark</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Ethelward</hi> place the <hi>Angli,</hi> we read of no such People there, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himself, in those very Provinces, reckoned the Inhabitants by these Names, the <hi>Chali, Cobandi, Sabalingii,</hi> and <hi>Sigulones,</hi> and setteth down the <hi>Angli</hi> far enough from hence, among the <hi>Suevians</hi> in the Mediterranean parts of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Add to this, that most Authors bring their Original from <hi>Westphalia,</hi> where <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern</hi> standeth, and others have thought it probable they might primitively proceed from <hi>Pomerania;</hi> where the Town <hi>Angloen</hi> flourisheth.</p>
                  <p>These considerations moved <hi>Cisner</hi> to think, that the <hi>Angli Suevi</hi> mentioned in <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and the <hi>Angli Saxones,</hi> so called by <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Ethelwerd,</hi> were not the <note place="margin">Cisner. Bede.</note> same People, because the former were certainly an Inland-Nation, and a branch of the <hi>Suevians,</hi> the latter a Sea-faring People, and of the Race of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> But they who shall consider, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Suevians</hi> were of the same Original, and Anciently of the Common Name and Stock of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> by which general appellation they were promiscuously called by the Ancients, as also how the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Nations were alwaies shifting Habitations, by which means they got new Names often, and often scattered the same Name on divers Nations, will have no reason to doubt, but that our ancient <hi>English</hi> Ancestors descended from those <hi>English Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> mentioned in <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who having long wandered in <hi>Germany,</hi> afterwards possessed that Province in <hi>Denmark,</hi> which from their Name of <hi>Angili,</hi> was called <hi>Angulus,</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> and from which Country they afterwards passed into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that our <hi>English</hi> Ancestors did not receive their Name from that narrow Isthmus in <hi>Denmark,</hi> but on the contrary it received its name from them, it remaineth to be shewn from whence they might probably have taken it.</p>

                     </note> that the Original fo the <hi>Angli,</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> may in all likelyhood be seen in the ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of <hi>Englebett</hi> and <hi>Englehard,</hi> and such like <hi>Teutonick</hi> names, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self doth not attempt at it. Neither have I read of any yet, who have adventured to give their Opinions in this matter. Amidst so great silence of Writers, my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be offensive to any, seeing it contracticteth none.</p>
                  <p>The Name therefore of the ancient <hi>Angili</hi> or <hi>Angli,</hi> so called by <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> from which our <hi>English</hi> proceedeth, is not to be fetched from the Latin <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi> a <hi>Corner,</hi> because <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> gave not that name to the People so <note place="margin">Tacit. Ptolomy.</note> called, but set it down as they received it from the <hi>German</hi> Nations. The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal therefore of the Name seemeth, as in reason it should, to be derived from the <hi>Teutonick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as it is vanity to think that our present <hi>England</hi> received its name from <hi>lying in a Corner of the World,</hi> or that <hi>Old England</hi> in <hi>Denmark</hi> was so stiled from its <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness,</hi> and upon that account gave name to the <hi>Angli,</hi> who were called <hi>Angli</hi> long before they ever set foot on that Province, so on the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that the <hi>Teutonick Ang,</hi> and in finer pronunciation <hi>Eng,</hi> signifying a <hi>Corner,</hi> was nevertheless the true Root and Original of the name of the <hi>Angli,</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> not because they lived in <hi>a Corner of the World,</hi> or in that <hi>Nook of Denmark,</hi> but because that part of the <hi>Suevians</hi> called <hi>Angli,</hi> might possess themselves of narrow and streight Passages in the Mountainous parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> which upon that account might be called <hi>Angland,</hi> and in finer speech <hi>England,</hi> and the Inhabitants themselves <hi>Anglants</hi> or <hi>Englants,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Teutonick,</hi> as much as the <hi>possessour of narrow</hi> or <hi>streight Countries,</hi> and for better found are called <hi>Angili</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and truer <hi>Angli</hi> by <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that which further induceth me to believe that <hi>Eng</hi> or <hi>Ang,</hi> a <hi>narrow</hi> or <hi>streight place</hi> in the <hi>Teutonick,</hi> in this sence is the true Original of the <hi>Angli,</hi> is, that <hi>Engern</hi> in <hi>Westphalia,</hi> as also <hi>Angloen</hi> in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> are both scituated upon such narrow Passages, as I have been credibly informed, either of which places may reasonably be supposed the ancient Seats of the <hi>Angli,</hi> and in the Geographical <hi>Charts</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> we find part of the <hi>Suevians</hi> called <hi>Angli,</hi> seated in a <hi>narrow Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,</hi> under the Mountain <hi>Melibocus.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Angli</hi> therefore having received their Name from <hi>Aug</hi> or <hi>Eng,</hi> a <hi>Nook</hi> or <hi>Corner,</hi> gave the same name (but whether out of design, or by chance, is uncertain) to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> from whence it proceeded into <hi>Britain,</hi> and grew in time to such credit and reputation, that the name of <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Jutes</hi> wearing away by degrees, this only prevailed, especially when King <hi>EGBERT,</hi> about the year 800, <note place="margin">Toe time when the Name of <hi>BRITAIN</hi> was first changrd into <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
                     </note> by solemn Edict proclaimed that the whole ISLAND should be called <hi>Engelonð,</hi> that is, <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and the Inhabitants <hi>Englishmen,</hi> a Title it seems so much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that our Ancestours used no other to vaunt themselves with, whilest our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies only, the <hi>Scotch, Welch,</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> call us <hi>Sassous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reason why the name of <hi>English</hi> prevailed above those of <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Jute,</hi> seemeth to be the conceit men had of something extraordinary signified by it. <hi>Engel,</hi> in all <hi>Teutonick</hi> Dialects, is as much as an <hi>Angel,</hi> and <hi>E</hi> in <hi>English-man,</hi> as it is pronounced <hi>Engelisce,</hi> or <hi>Engelsche,</hi> as it is written, signifieth word for word <hi>an Angel-like-man.</hi> Upon this account perhaps our Ancestours were fond of this Title, which is not extraordinary to be supposed, considering that the like hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in other Nations. The <hi>French,</hi> when they would express some Action done by any of their Nation, usually say, <hi>It was done like a French-man,</hi> which with him sounds the same as a <hi>Gentle-man,</hi> and this from the <hi>Teutonick Franck,</hi> signifying <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Noble,</hi> so that their ancient name of <hi>Gauls</hi> is worn out, although the <hi>Francks,</hi> a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Nation, whose Name hath universally prevailed, were but a handful in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the native <hi>Gauls,</hi> and were not able to give their Language to that People, who nevertheless received Name from them. In the like manner we read the name of <hi>Quirites</hi> given to a <hi>Roman</hi> Army, was so great a Charm as to stop a Mutiny in its height. The Towns <hi>Maleventum</hi> and <hi>Epidamnus,</hi> were for some ill signification changed by the <hi>Romans</hi> into <hi>Epidaurus</hi> and <hi>Beneventum,</hi> not to instance in other matters of the like nature, why may not therefore the more rugged <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Jute,</hi> give place in the opinions of the Inhabitants, to that of <hi>English,</hi> or <hi>Angelick-men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Conceit of our Ancestours was furthered by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, upon this occasion, <hi>It happened, during the time of the Heptarchy,</hi> ELLA <hi>then Reigning in</hi> Deira, <hi>a Province belonging to the Crown of</hi> Northumberland, <hi>that certain Youths named</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles <hi>in</hi> Britain, <hi>transported to</hi> Rome, <hi>and there exposed to Sale, attracted the eyes of all by their exceeding comliness, and among the rest</hi> Gregory, <hi>not yet Pope. He enquired of them, what Nation they were, to which they answered</hi> Angles, <hi>the similitude of name with</hi> Angels, <hi>easily drew a natural reflection from the good Old man, who presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,</hi> That not without reason were they so called, having Faces more resembling <hi>Angels</hi> than <hi>Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conversion of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> ensuing upon this happy interview, gave Reputation to the name of <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Angles,</hi> which (without question) daily grew into great credit, and increased with that Christianity it had so luckily occasioned, insomuch that whereas before, by our own Writers, this Island was called still by the name <hi>Britain,</hi> and by Forreigners, <hi>Saxonia Nova,</hi> and <hi>Saxonia Trasmarina,</hi> that is, <hi>New Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Forreign Saxony;</hi> King <hi>Egbert,</hi> who first brought the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> into one entire Kingdom, by publick Edict (as I have already cited) ordained that it should be stiled <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> and the Inhabitants <hi>ENGLISH,</hi> if not in memory of its Conversion, yet certainly for some opinion the Inhabitants had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of that Name above the rest, which could probably arise from no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than these recited; for otherwise why should the <hi>Angles,</hi> who in the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> possessed only <hi>Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgsbire,</hi> with the <hi>Isle of Ely</hi> (upon the Union of the VII. Kingdoms) give name alone to all the rest, especially considering that the Union proceeded not from them, but the West <hi>Saxons.</hi> This is the reason that in writing the Affairs of this Nation, until King <hi>Egbert,</hi> who first by publick Authority changed the name of it, I conclude all things under the name of <hi>Britain,</hi> it being properly, and not till then, called <hi>Anglia</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> when the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> was reduced into one entire Kingdom.</p>

The Reason why the name of</hi> Angles <hi>or</hi> English, <hi>prevailed above that of</hi> Saxon <hi>or</hi> Jute.</p>
                  <p>THis name of <hi>Saxon</hi> is very ancient if we find out the true Original of it, which once discovered, will give great light into the antiquity of our Ancestours. They proceeded from <hi>Jutis,</hi> or <hi>Juteland</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and by the <hi>Danish</hi> Writers are called <hi>Jutae,</hi> and <hi>Juitae;</hi> But before I proceed any further, it will be necessary to wipe away those Mistakes made by <hi>Verstegan</hi> upon this Subject, a Man otherwise Learned in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, yet, who by an over-fond opinion of his skill therein, and through ignorance of true Antiquity, hath fixed many novel and false Originals upon Places and People in <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus he writeth, <hi>Now as touching the third sort of</hi> Saxon <hi>People, which were called the</hi> Vites, <hi>some will have them called</hi> Juites <hi>and not</hi> Vites, <hi>and others will have them called</hi> Geates, <hi>or rather</hi> Gothes, <hi>but with these latter I mean not to meddle, for that they overshoot the Mark too far, and so will never hit it. Venerable</hi> Bede <hi>calleth them plain</hi> Vites, <hi>and noteth the Isle of</hi> Wight, <hi>which yet retaineth that Name of them, to have been (besides other places of the Continent) their Habitation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The occasion of this errour in <hi>Verstegan,</hi> upon which he groundeth on his own head a false derivation of the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> proceeded from the printed Copies of <hi>Bede,</hi> where instead of <hi>Jutes</hi> or <hi>Getes,</hi> was foisted in <hi>Vites.</hi> The <hi>Saxon</hi> Version hath it <hi>Getes,</hi> not <hi>Vites; Comon hi of ðrim folcan ðam gestran gestan germanie of seaxum &amp; of Angle &amp; of geatum</hi>; <hi>They derived their Original from three of the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antest Nations of</hi> Germany, <hi>the</hi> Saxons, Angles, <hi>and</hi> Getes; And again, <hi>of ꝧ land ðe Angulus is nemned getƿyn geatum &amp; seaxum</hi>; <hi>That Land which is called</hi> Angulus, <hi>is between the</hi> Getes <hi>and</hi> Saxons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ethelwerd, a Saxon</hi> Writer, calleth them <hi>Giots,</hi> and <hi>Chronologia Saxonica</hi> hath <hi>Iotes, ða com ða men of ðrim megþum germanie of cald seaxum of Anglum of Iotum</hi>; <note place="margin">Ethelwerd, <hi>Chron.</hi> Sax.</note> 
                     <hi>Those Men come from three sorts of Germans,</hi> Saxons, Angles, <hi>and</hi> Iotes.</p>
                  <p>In the Laws of <hi>Edward the Confessour</hi> they are called <hi>Gutes,</hi> and in the <hi>Peterbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> Records, <hi>Geatuni,</hi> by others <hi>Jotuni</hi> and <hi>Jetae,</hi> for <hi>Cetae, Jetae, Jutae, Juitae, Gutae, Giotae, Jotae, Geotuni,</hi> and <hi>Jotuni,</hi> are all the same Names, differing only in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and writ after various Orthography.</p>
                  <p>The Book which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> used, he affirmed had <hi>Getun,</hi> and <hi>Kranzius</hi> citing <hi>Bede,</hi> calleth them <hi>Jutes,</hi> not <hi>Vites,</hi> and <hi>Malmsbury, Huntington,</hi> with the rest of the ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers, who (without question) used <hi>Bedes</hi> Manuscript, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies one of the forementioned words, but never <hi>Vites.</hi> Neither before the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Bede</hi> was ever such a Nation as the <hi>Vites</hi> heard of in the World, and how it came to get into the printed Copy of <hi>Bede</hi> shall be guessed at hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fabritius Chemnicensis,</hi> following the opinion of <hi>Beatus Rhenanus,</hi> and treading in the same Errour, writeth, that the <hi>Vites,</hi> whom the <hi>Saxons</hi> in their Dialects call <note place="margin">Fab. Chemn.</note> 
                     <hi>Wites,</hi> had this Name in <hi>Germany,</hi> and that the <hi>Helvetii,</hi> who at this day are called <hi>Suitzers,</hi> derive themselves from them. <hi>The Wites</hi> (saith he) <hi>at several times left their Country, some passed into</hi> Britain, <hi>others crossing the</hi> Rhine <hi>seized part of</hi> Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetia, <hi>and were afterwards called</hi> Suiti, <hi>or</hi> Sulceri, <hi>which Place and Name they yet hold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, although it be said without any Authority, and so not much to be regarded, yet because it affordeth imployment for the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Dialect, <hi>Verstegan'</hi> endeavoureth to back it with pretty Etymologies. <hi>The Helvetii</hi> (saith he) <hi>are as much as to say, the</hi> Hil-vites, <hi>for</hi> Sebastian Munster <hi>reports, that some of the</hi> Vites <hi>inhabited among <note place="margin">Sebast. Munst.</note> the Mountains that divide</hi> Germany <hi>from</hi> Italy; But how came <hi>Sebastian</hi> by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, the Name of the <hi>Helvetii</hi> is very Ancient, even in <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> daies we read they were then a People, and so numerous, that with 200000 fighting Men,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:58825:217"/>
leaving their Country, and seeking new Habitations, in what Age did this Colony of <hi>Vites</hi> plant themselves there, and who preserved the Records. <hi>Caesar</hi> writes that they kept Registers of their People as the rest of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> in Greek Letters, but of their descent from the <hi>Vites</hi> was never heard till <hi>Bede's</hi> impression.</p>
                  <p>But this might pass for an handsom Invention, that which follows of the <hi>Suitsers</hi> taking their Name from these supposed <hi>Vites</hi> is too unconscionably gross, the deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation runneth thus, <hi>Vites, Vitses, Vitsers,</hi> and prefixing <hi>S,</hi> which in the <hi>Teutonick</hi> is as much as <hi>the S'uitsers,</hi> so that <hi>S'uitsers</hi> is as much as <hi>the Vitsers,</hi> just as <hi>S'winter</hi> is <hi>the Winter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now which is most reasonable, to bring the Name of the <hi>Suitsers</hi> from a novel corruption of Dialect in the West of <hi>England,</hi> where <hi>S'</hi> is used for <hi>The,</hi> which <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stegan</hi> calleth the <hi>Teutonick,</hi> or from the ancient People of the <hi>Suevi,</hi> who in all probability there planted themselves, let the Reader judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suffridus,</hi> to compleat the mistake, will needs have the name of <hi>Vites</hi> to be Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter <note place="margin">Suffridus.</note> than the <hi>Jutes,</hi> and that the latter word is made by transposition of the first Letters of the former, and to knock it home, he tells us a gallant story of a Prince called <hi>WIIT,</hi> who married <hi>Cumera</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Bocchus,</hi> King of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> and had with her in Dower that Port of <hi>Denmark,</hi> called afterwards by his name <hi>Wiitland,</hi> and by corruption <hi>Juteland,</hi> all the mischief of this Invention is, that <hi>Suffridus</hi> unfortunately took <hi>Vite</hi> to be ancienter than <hi>Jute,</hi> otherwise he could as easily have made his Prince so good natured as to go by the latter Name as well as the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jute</hi> therefore, <hi>Juite,</hi> and <hi>Gete,</hi> with such like, for they are all one, is the Ancient name of that People who came with the <hi>Saxons</hi> out of <hi>Denmark</hi> into <hi>Britain.</hi> How comes it to pass therefore, that the printed Coppies of <hi>Bede</hi> have <hi>Vitae</hi> and not <hi>Jutae?</hi> Some guess, and not improbably, that <hi>Vitae</hi> might be so made by transporting the first letters of <hi>Jutae,</hi> or by taking away the first <hi>I</hi> from <hi>Juitae,</hi> but I rather think with the worthy Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> who hath writ copiously of this Subject, That it proceeded from the Learned ignorance of some Transcriber, who being not so deeply read in the forreign <hi>Jutes</hi> as he was in <hi>Wihts,</hi> that is, the Inhabitants of the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> who in <hi>Latin</hi> were called <hi>Vitae,</hi> presently thought that these were the People intended by <hi>Bede,</hi> and so instead of the <hi>Jutae</hi> fairly put in his Neighbours the <hi>Vitae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is this a marvel, seeing <hi>Verstegan</hi> mounteth the same Steed; <hi>The Isle of Wight</hi> (saith he) <hi>retaineth that Name from the</hi> Vites, <hi>just with as much truth as</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>was so called by the</hi> Saxons, <hi>from the similitude it had with</hi> Londen <hi>in</hi> Sconie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>For who knoweth not that the name of</hi> Vectis <hi>taken from the</hi> British <hi>Guith, whence comes</hi> With <hi>and</hi> Wight, <hi>was known by that name to the</hi> Romans, <hi>hundreds of years before the</hi> Saxons <hi>Arrival.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hear what Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> saith of this matter in his Geographick Tables on the Isle of <note place="margin">Speed <hi>Chron.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Wight.</hi> Wight <hi>Island was in time past named by the</hi> Romans, Vecta, Vectis <hi>and</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctesis, <hi>by the</hi> Britains <hi>Guyth, by the</hi> English Saxons Wuitland, <hi>and</hi> Wicthland, <hi>and</hi> Wicthaea (<hi>for an Island they termed</hi> AEa) <hi>and in these daies usually called by us the Isle of</hi> Wight; <hi>It is encompassed round with the</hi> British <hi>Seas, and severed from the main Land, that it might seem to have been joyned to it, and therefore it is thought the</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish <hi>name Guyth hath been given to it, which betokeneth</hi> Separation. <hi>Now changing of Guyth into</hi> With, <hi>which was the custome of the</hi> Saxon <hi>Dialect, just as the</hi> French Guerre, <hi>Gard, Gued by them is turned into War, Ward, and Wadd, and we have a truer Original of the Isle of</hi> Wight, <hi>and the</hi> Vitae, <hi>than any that is fetched out of</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, <hi>to this multitude of Reasons and Testimonies.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>HAVING thus far proceeded in deriving the Names of our Ancestors, the <hi>SAXONS, ANGLES,</hi> and <hi>JUTES,</hi> People of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Appellations, yet agreeing in <hi>Customes, Language,</hi> and <hi>Original,</hi> it remaineth to be shewn from whence their Antiquities are to be fetched, and by what thred we are to trace them, until we come to some general Stock, out of which, like so many several Branches, they are derived. The name of <hi>SAXON</hi> and <hi>ANGLE,</hi> affordeth no light into their Original, the former being given them, or taken up, upon a particular account of a Weapon they wore different from other Nations, the latter from the scituation of their Country, so that these being circumstances of a newer date, and pointing no higher than the knowledge of such names in the World, it remaineth to be shewn, that out of <hi>JUTE,</hi> as their Ancient title, the true Antiquities of the whole Nation are to be derived.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>It remains therefore to be proved by other Reasons, as well as coherence in Name, that the <hi>GETES</hi> and <hi>SAXONS</hi> were one and the same Nation, which done, we shall find the Original and Progress of the <hi>Getes</hi> under <hi>Wooden,</hi> to be the same with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and we need seek no higher for their Original.</p>
                  <p>First therefore, the Language of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Getes</hi> is the very same, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only the difference of Dialect, by the <hi>Getick</hi> Language I mean the <hi>Gothick,</hi> for that the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Getes</hi> were one and the self-same Nation, is Learnedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> from the authority of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, the place from whence the <hi>Gothes</hi> proceeded, from the agreement of both Nations in Manners and Language.</p>
                  <p>Now that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language and that of the <hi>Getes</hi> is one, is proved from the derivation of many words in the <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongue, which have the like signification in the <hi>Saxon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And first <hi>Grotius</hi> proveth that the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who spake the <hi>Getick</hi> Tongue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived their Name from <hi>Schieten,</hi> which is as much in their Language as <hi>to shoot,</hi> because they were excellent Archers. Now who knoweth not that <hi>scyttan,</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, signifieth <hi>to shoot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth that <hi>Moeotis</hi> in the same Language is called <hi>Temerinda,</hi> which, he saith, signifieth with the <hi>Gates</hi> as much as the <hi>Mother of the Sea.</hi> Now who seeth not that <hi>Temerinda</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>Saxon, ꝧ Meren Dam,</hi> i. e. <hi>the Mother of the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maeotis</hi> seemeth to be derived from the <hi>Gothick Moat,</hi> signifying <hi>a Marsh,</hi> or <hi>Ditch of Water,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> in the latter signification the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue vet preserveth the name of <hi>Motes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The River <hi>Tanais</hi> the <hi>Getes</hi> called <hi>Sylin,</hi> according to the same <hi>Pliny,</hi> because it divideth <hi>Asia</hi> from <hi>Europe.</hi> Now <hi>sylan,</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, is to <hi>divide</hi> or <hi>separate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> are derived from <hi>saex,</hi> a <hi>crooked Sword</hi> or <hi>Hanger</hi> which they used; now <hi>Sags</hi> (as I have shewn) in the <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongue, signifieth the same.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gothick Iett,</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, both signifie <hi>a Giant,</hi> from whence comes <hi>Iotum heimar,</hi> i. e. <hi>the habitation of Giants,</hi> and <hi>Iotum-land,</hi> now <hi>Jut-land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Massagetes</hi> were called the <hi>greater Getes,</hi> now the <hi>Saxons</hi> at this day use <hi>Massie</hi> in the same signification.</p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:58825:218"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Catti,</hi> Neighbours to the <hi>Massagetes, Hadrianus Junius</hi> deriveth from <hi>Catts,</hi> because of their quickness in seizing their prey, others from <hi>Catz</hi> or <hi>Cacs</hi> in the <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongue, signifying <hi>Hunting,</hi> because they were great Hunters, hence the <hi>Italian, Caccia,</hi> taken from the <hi>Gothes,</hi> and <hi>to Catch</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Syndi,</hi> a People of the <hi>Getes,</hi> so called by the <hi>Gothes</hi> because they lived upon the Sea, <hi>Sund</hi> in the <hi>Gothick</hi> is the Sea, and part of the <hi>Baltick,</hi> to this day, in the <hi>Saxon</hi> is called <hi>the Sownd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Country of the <hi>Syndi</hi> is called by <hi>Strabo, Syndica,</hi> from the <hi>Gothick Syndic</hi> or <hi>Syndike,</hi> because that living Low they cast up Trenches to keep out the Sea, called in their Tongue <hi>Sund.</hi> Now <hi>Dike,</hi> which with us is a <hi>Ditch,</hi> in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Tongue signifieth a <hi>Rampier.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Graukenii,</hi> another <hi>Getick</hi> or <hi>Gothick</hi> Nation was so called from their <hi>Tawney Vestures,</hi> as other <hi>Getes</hi> were called <hi>Moelanchaeni</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi> from their <hi>Black habits, Grauken</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue is <hi>Tawney.</hi>

                     <hi>Suetonius</hi> in the life of <hi>Augustus</hi> mentioneth one <hi>COTISON,</hi> or <hi>Gotison,</hi> a King of the <hi>Getes,</hi> now, who seeth not that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue giveth an easie deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Name, whether you suppose him so called as the Son of a God, or the Son of a <hi>Goth,</hi> or a Good Son, it is all one.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Dio Cassius</hi> tells us of one <hi>ROLA,</hi> a King of the <hi>Getes,</hi> in the <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongue at this day he is called <hi>ROL,</hi> the original of our Name <hi>Ralph</hi> in the <hi>Saxon,</hi> as <hi>Ola</hi> and <hi>Oli</hi> of the Ancients, is changed into <hi>Olf</hi> and <hi>Oloff,</hi> frequent termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in <hi>Saxon</hi> Names, as <hi>Randolph,</hi> that is, <hi>pure-Olf, Godolphin,</hi> that is <hi>good-Olf,</hi> with another termination adjoyned to it, so <hi>Radulf</hi> comes from <hi>Rad</hi> and <hi>Olf,</hi> and not from <hi>Rad</hi> and <hi>Help,</hi> as <hi>Verstegan</hi> vainly supposeth.</p>
                  <p>But that which putteth the question beyond dispute, is the testimony of <hi>Busbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quius,</hi> Embassadour in <hi>Turkey</hi> from <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, who during his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at the Port, had opportunity to speak with two Messengers that were sent from the People of the <hi>Cimbrick Chersonesse,</hi> to complain of some grievances to the Grand Seignior.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Cimbrick Chersonesse</hi> was the Ancient habitation of the <hi>Getes,</hi> and by the Language those Messengers spake, it appeared that the Language of the <hi>Getes</hi> yet there remaining, as to the main, is the same, though something corrupted with the <hi>Turkish</hi> Idiom, as the <hi>Saxon</hi> at this present day; take the Relation from <hi>Busbequius</hi> his own words. <hi>It would not be unnecessary,</hi> saith he, <hi>in this place a little to insist on</hi>

One of them was extraordinary tall, but he seemed to carry in his countenance visible Tokens of an Innocent and harmless disposition, very much resembling the simplicity of the</hi> Flemmings; <hi>The other was shorter, but better set, of a brownish Complexion, by Birth and Language a</hi> Grecian, <hi>but through long Commerce and Acquaintance with that Nation, had attained to a competent knowledg of their Language; but the former through too nigh a Neighbourhood and Familiarity of Conversation with the</hi> Grecians, <hi>had so accustomed himself to their Tongue, that he had altogether forgotten his own. Therefore I shall here set down as a taste, some of those words he rendred into</hi> High-Dutch, <hi>for many of them were of another Form, and very different from others; Whether this diversity arose from the nature and Constitution of their Language, or from the weakness of his memory, or from the mixture of forreign words with their native Tongue I am not able to determine; To all their words they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix the Article</hi> Tho, <hi>or</hi> The, <hi>as we do, or not much differing from us.</hi>

                  <p>By these Arguments it is manifest, besides the coherence of the Names of <hi>Jutes</hi> and <hi>Getes,</hi> that our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestours were descended of that Ancient People, for nothing proveth so much the affinity of Nations as the agreement in Language. Now whereas Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> derives the <hi>Germans</hi> from the <hi>Germani</hi> mentioned by <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> and in some sort to prove it, saith, that what the <hi>Persians</hi> call, <hi>Fader, Moder, Brader, Iutcher</hi> and <hi>Baud,</hi> are in the <hi>German, Father, Mother, Brother, Daughter</hi> and <hi>Bawd,</hi> yet this proveth not the Original of the <hi>Germans</hi> from the <hi>Persian,</hi> but rather that these words were taken from the <hi>Getes</hi> who inhabited upon the Lake <hi>Maeotis,</hi> and who brought these words with the rest of their Language into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verstegan,</hi> who will not suffer that any of the <hi>German</hi> Nations were otherwise than <hi>Aborigines</hi> from their first arrival under <hi>TUISCO,</hi> to wipe away this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Language, saith, that it is not sufficient to prove an affinity in Language, to produce only two or three, or half a dozen words, for by this means any two Languages in the World might seem to have an allyance, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is none. This would be true if the words alledged were far fetched, and we were forced to run through a whole Dictionary to find only a few, and those as distant in signification as the Heaven and Earth is from each other, but where so nigh Relations, as <hi>Father, Mother, Brother</hi> and <hi>Daughter,</hi> which are alwaies in Peoples mouths, are called by the same names in two Languages, it seemeth not to happen by chance, nor is it so lightly to be regarded as <hi>Verstegan</hi> would have it; And whereas he goeth laboriously to prove, that the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Tongues have no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one another, he needed not to have taken so much pains, for the <hi>Persian</hi> Tongue as it is now spoken consisteth chiefly of the <hi>Arabick.</hi> It sufficeth, that if by the consent and harmony of these and other words occurring in both Languages, that there yet remains even among the <hi>Persians</hi> some relicks of the <hi>Getick</hi> Tongue, which was the Original of our <hi>Saxon,</hi> and brought in by them into <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus shewn the agreement of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue with the Ancient <hi>Getick,</hi> it remaineth, that in the next place the Progress of the <hi>Getes</hi> under <hi>WODEN,</hi> and other Princes be set down, where, by the way, we may see the Customes of the Ancient <hi>Getes,</hi> and compare them with those of our Ancestours; But before hand, it will not be altogether unneedful to know, that the <hi>Getes,</hi> from whom we derive the <hi>Saxons,</hi> were a branch of the Ancient <hi>Cimbri,</hi> as their very name sheweth, for it is remarkable that Geac and <hi>Kimpper,</hi> in the <hi>Teutonick,</hi> are sometimes taken in the same signification.</p>
                  <p>Now, as touching the Original of the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> I have treated before in the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of the <hi>Britains,</hi> where I shew'd, that the <hi>Britains</hi> were a branch of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who Anciently possest those very places where afterwards their Brethren the <hi>Saxons</hi> inhabited, namely, from <hi>Denmark</hi> to the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and afterwards in part of <hi>Gaul.</hi> Now, if any should ask, why, considering the Ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> and our more Modern <hi>Saxons,</hi> were derived from the same stock, namely, the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> and yet understood nothing of each others Language at the entrance of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> an Argument used by <hi>Verstegan</hi> to disprove it, I answer, That continuance of time and the mixture of the <hi>Britains</hi> with the <hi>Phoenicians, Graecians, Gauls</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> in several Ages was the occasion, yet I doubt not, were it material to prove, that there are many words in the <hi>British</hi> tongue which agree with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and which in probability they had in use long before the Arrival of the <hi>Saxons</hi> themselves.</p>

                  <p>HAVING proved the <hi>Saxons</hi> to be the same People with the <hi>Getes,</hi> both by their Name and Language, it remains that we shew by what methods, and under what Leaders they proceeded into these parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> But before we begin distinctly to declare their Progress, and to set down the true Conductors of them, it will be necessary to destroy those Imaginary Leaders, who being but Airy substances, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Mans brain, have by a strange slight nevertheless usurpt the Honour of these true Leaders and Commanders.</p>

I suppose he feared that Motto, SPECTATUM ADMISSI RISUM TENEATIS AMICI; <hi>Nay, Friends take heed you do not split with laughter,</hi> for never was a Fable writ with more confidence, bore more appearance, and withal had less truth in it. <hi>Ab uno disce omnes,</hi> the laying open this cheat will discover the rest, and I shall take the liberty of insisting longer upon it than I intended, because I find the generality of our Country infected with the venom of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Fiction, but when the Mask is once taken off, they will not be able to discern under the painted Vizards, inscribed with the names of <hi>Tuisco, Saxo, Danus,</hi> and such like Imaginary Hero's, any thing more than empty shadows, and flying Ghosts of Lies and Inventions.</p>
                  <p>To the unveyling of this Cheat, it is necessary to know from whence, first, it had its source and Original. Now the Author upon whose credit the whole mummery depends, is <hi>Berosus,</hi> as he is set out by <hi>Annius Viterbiensis.</hi> The true <hi>Berosus</hi> was an Ancient Historian, and lived in the daies of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as <hi>Georgius Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi> an Author of good Credit, and chief among the Writers of the <hi>Bysantine</hi> History witnesseth.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Berosus</hi> his Works being for many Ages lost, and his Memory only preserved in other mens Works, who upon some slight occasions have quoted him, it happened that <hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbium</hi> being about to broach some Antiquities of his Nation, and wanting an Ancient Writer to back them, pitcht upon this <hi>Berosus</hi> as the fittest Man to father his Conceits, as being a <hi>Caldean,</hi> and therefore without doubt a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, and knowing all things; for there was no Author extant that reached half his Ambition of bringing down the <hi>German</hi> Nation as he intended, evidently and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from <hi>Noah</hi> himself, in a right Line, and had he taken a Man less than a <hi>Caldaean,</hi> how was it possible that at the same time, any, but such an One, could be supposed to know the Concerns of <hi>Noah, Japhet</hi> and <hi>Askenas,</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> and those of <hi>Tuisco</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> Having therefore found out a Man fit for his turn, it remained only, that he made him speak as himself pleased, so that fathering his own Imaginations upon <hi>Berosus,</hi> and putting them out under the colour of so worthy a Name, he thought the whole business had been done, and the World would never have the wit, or leisure, to discover the cheat of his lying Oracles.</p>
                  <p>That this is true in the case of <hi>Tuisco,</hi> as well as other Imaginary Hero's, will evidently appear, if we seriously weigh these following Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:58825:220"/>
                  <p>First, the true <hi>Berosus</hi> lived in the daies of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Syncellus</hi> witnesseth, but <hi>Annius</hi> in his Preface tells the World, that his <hi>Berosus</hi> lived long before that time, by which it is manifest he took liberty to feign whatever pleased him.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, it is to be considered the same <hi>Syncellus</hi> reckoneth to us the order, method, matter and subject of the true <hi>Berosus</hi> his Writings, namely, that in his <hi>first Book</hi> he treated of the scituation of <hi>Babylonia,</hi> the fruitfulness of its Soyl, what Trees and Plants it brought forth, and what other Commodities it yielded afterwards, how in the same Book he expounded the Fables and Allegories in which the Theology of the <hi>Caldaeans,</hi> according to the custome of those Times, was wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up. This was a work proper for a <hi>Caldaean,</hi> to joyn Natural history with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and this the true <hi>Berosus</hi> performed.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Annius</hi> brings his <hi>Berosus</hi> into <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> and makes him more knowing in forreign Countries than his own, nay, the <hi>Berosus</hi> set out by him makes not the least mention of any of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> writings.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>second Book, Berosus</hi> (according to the same <hi>Syncellus</hi>) treateth of Ten Kings the <hi>Caldaeans</hi> had before the Flood, and this was the usual custome of primitive Ages, in <hi>AEgypt, Phoenicia, Greece,</hi> as well as <hi>Caldaea,</hi> for their Authors to fetch high the Antiquities of their particular Countries, and by all means (if it were possible) to equal the <hi>Jews</hi> therein, but no mention is here made that <hi>Berosus</hi> writ any thing of the <hi>Germans,</hi> how came he to be so much engaged for that Nation, of so forreign Concern, and to the knowledge whereof he could not, in modesty, then pretend? If he feigned Ten <hi>Caldaean</hi> Kings before the Flood, to advance the Honour of his own Country, must he therefore be forced to speak for <hi>Germany</hi> also? and yet it seemeth very much more an unequal proceeding in <hi>Annius,</hi> to make him give a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>German</hi> Princes, and yet omit these Kings of his own Nation.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>third Book</hi> (as <hi>Syncellus</hi> proceeds) <hi>Berosus</hi> treats of <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> and his Actions, no mention at all of any <hi>Tuisco</hi> or <hi>Tuiscons,</hi> as the false <hi>Berosus</hi> calls the <hi>Germans,</hi> so that we may vndoubtedly conclude, that the story of <hi>Tuisco,</hi> depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Authority of <hi>Annius</hi> his <hi>Berosus,</hi> is a meer Fable.</p>
                  <p>The Learned Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> hath collected, out of <hi>Athenaeu's</hi> and <hi>Hesychius,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Customes of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> for which they cite <hi>Berosus,</hi> but in the <hi>Berosus</hi> set out by <hi>Annius</hi> there is no such Customes found, by which it appears that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of the New <hi>Berosus</hi> took not the pains to examine <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, otherwise he might have made the Cheat not altogether so palpable.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Author upon whose Credit the evidence of this story depends, we come now to the Name of <hi>Tuisco,</hi> and the Story it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TUISCO</hi> is supposed by some to be the Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> begotten of his Wife <hi>Araza</hi> or <hi>Arezia</hi> (by others called <hi>Tythea</hi>) after the Flood. Others, with as much like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, make him the Son of <hi>Askenas,</hi> the Grandchild of <hi>Noah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Tuisco,</hi> whom we must for Luck-sake suppose the same with <hi>Tacitus</hi> his <hi>Tuisco,</hi> after the Confusion of Tongues, passed the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> and Peopled all <hi>Sarmatia</hi> on <hi>Europe</hi> side, and all the tract of Land as far as the <hi>Rhine;</hi> But because some might think so great a compass of Land too large for a single Colony, <hi>Aventinus</hi> joyns o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with him; <hi>Ab orbe,</hi> inquit Aventinus, <hi>restituto, anno centesimo tricesimo primo</hi> Nymbrothus <hi>regnum</hi> Babyloniorum <hi>quod &amp;</hi> Assyriorum <hi>condidit; cujus primordio</hi> Tuisco <hi>gigas, pater</hi> Germanorum &amp; Sarmatarum, <hi>cum viginti ducibus</hi> Semi <hi>fratris sui nepotibus, ex</hi> Armenia <hi>venit in</hi> Europam, <hi>amnem</hi> Tanaim <hi>que transgressus; ibidem ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem versus ejusdem frater</hi> Scytha <hi>priscus tenuit; ab hoc</hi> Germani Scythae <hi>appellati sunt, quemadmodum</hi> Plinius <hi>quoque in libro quarto Naturalis Historiae prodidit. Porrò</hi> Tuisco <hi>lustrato longè latéque eo toto tractu qui est inter</hi> Rhenum &amp; Pontum Euxinum, &amp; Tanaim, <hi>omnem ambitum in regua Toparchias &amp; Tetrarchias divisit, Regulis distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit, Colonias ubique deduxit, regiones habitatvribus implevit, anno Regui vicesimo quinte.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus translated, <hi>In the one hundred thirty first year after the Flood,</hi> Nymbroth <hi>founded the</hi> Babylonian <hi>or</hi> Assyrian <hi>Empire, in the beginning of whose Reign,</hi> Tuisco <hi>a Giant, the Father of the</hi> Germans <hi>and</hi> Sarmatians, <hi>accompanied with twenty Captains, his Brother</hi> Sem's <hi>Nephews, from</hi> Armenia <hi>came into</hi> Europe, <hi>having passed the River</hi> Tanais, <hi>his Brother</hi> Scytha <hi>sat down in the Eastermost quarters, from whom the</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:58825:221"/>
                     <hi>were called</hi> Scythians, <hi>as</hi> Pliny <hi>in his fourth Book of Natural History writes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> Tuisco <hi>having surveyed, far and near, all the tract of Land which is between the</hi> Rhine <hi>and</hi> Euxine <hi>Sea, and</hi> Tanais, <hi>divided the whole Circuit into Kingdoms and small Principalities, as Toparchies and Tetrarchies, disposing of them to petty Governours, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to all places he sent Colonies, fill'd the whole Countries about with Inhabitants in the twenty fifth year of his Reign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The exactness of time observed by the Compiler of this story, with the punctual circumstances of <hi>Tuisco's</hi> setting forth, and proceedings, would betray an unwary Reader (not conversant in such Forgeries) to the belief of part, at least, of so compleat an History. But as if it were true, it would be more admirable that so distant time should admit so plain Calculation, and the Actions of <hi>Tuisco</hi> be more perspicuous than those of the Conquerour; so, as it is false, it appears more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and deserves to be so much the more openly exposed, by how much it hath confidently pretended not only to truth, but to the greatest exactness and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness thereof.</p>
                  <p>Hear the same <hi>Aventinus</hi> in another place; <hi>Hand abs re suerit,</hi> inquit, <hi>Regulos hujusce</hi> Tuisconis, <hi>qui &amp; in penetralibus sacrae veritatis à</hi> Mose <hi>referuntur ordine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorare. Primus dux fuit</hi> Sarmata, <hi>vir armorum studiosus, &amp; peritus rei benè gerendae, amorisque popularium conciliandi; ab eo apud priscos</hi> Sarmatae <hi>quoque nuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pantur.

                  <p>Thus translated, <hi>It will not be besides my purpose to declare in order those Princes establisht by</hi> Tuisco, <hi>all which are found in the hidden Mysteries of Sacred truth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by</hi> Moses; <hi>the first Captain was</hi> Sarmata, <hi>a great lover of Arms, and skilful in the administration of Affairs, and in gaining the affection of the People; from him, according to the Ancients, the</hi> Sarmatians <hi>took Name. The second Prince was</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, <hi>called likewise</hi> Danus, <hi>the Father of the</hi> Danes, <hi>whose King is famous in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, <hi>and is called in Latin, the King of the</hi> Daci, <hi>by us, King of</hi> Danes. <hi>The Old</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Latins <hi>called them</hi> Cimbri, <hi>and</hi> Cimmerii. Geta <hi>was the third Leader, in our Language</hi> Getus, <hi>from him the Island</hi> Gotolandia <hi>takes name, lying in the Bay called</hi> Sinus Venedicus <hi>at the mouth of the River</hi> Vistula, <hi>which looketh to the South; from him the</hi> Getes, <hi>which are the</hi> Goths, <hi>proceed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These two places of <hi>Aventinus</hi> contain the principal History of <hi>Tuisco,</hi> against which Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> produceth many Arguments, some of which are of great moment; others, as it often happeneth in such cases, namely, that in discovering of a falshood, we often strain Truth and lash out on the other side, have no weight, and reflect too much upon the Credit of <hi>Aventinus,</hi> who himself confesseth, a Learned Man and Tutor to two <hi>German</hi> Princes.</p>
                  <p>First then, he wonders at the Ignorance of <hi>Aventinus,</hi> and stands amazed at his blindness in the Scriptures. His words are these, <hi>Quis non stupeat ad tantam Sacrae Scripture ignorantiam atque caecitatem.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Quis virum talem in</hi>

                     <hi>sacris ita caecutiisse attonitus non miretur,</hi> but it might have been considered that <hi>Aventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> saith no where, that the names of <hi>Tuisco, Sarmata, Geta,</hi> and the rest, were found in Scripture. His words are these, <hi>In penetralibus sacrae veritatis à</hi> Mose <hi>referuntur,</hi> which <hi>Penetralia</hi> to a candid Reader, seem rather to refer to the hidden <hi>Cabbala</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> supposed to be delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> as he received it in the Mount, and preserved to Posterity by tradition, than to the open Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> where the Progeny of <hi>Noah</hi> is not mystically, but plainly set down. Now that the <hi>Jews</hi> do pretend to a greater knowledge in the Original of Nations than is set down in the Scriptures, and ground their knowledge upon a mysterious Tradition, none can be ignorant of, who are any thing conversant in their Writings; And indeed from them, and only them, I believe the World learnt that confident way of forging Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of Ancient Princes, who must be supposed, forsooth, to give names to Nations, to these <hi>Penetralia,</hi> and not to the Scriptures, we may, if not with some reason, I am sure with most candour, suppose <hi>Aventinus</hi> referred.</p>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:58825:221"/>
                  <p>But suppose that <hi>Aventinus</hi> did mean the Scriptures themselves, yet is he not (allowing favourable construction to his words) to be supposed never to have read them, as Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> intimates.</p>
                  <p>To manifest this, I will set down the Genealogy of <hi>Noah</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond out of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers, by which it will appear, in the beginning of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, as far as the Scripture goeth, that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers use not the Name as it is literally in <hi>Genesis,</hi> but give another out of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language, which hath the same signification with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and this way of proceeding might have been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by <hi>Aventinus,</hi> when he writeth, that he found <hi>Tuisco,</hi> and the rest of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, <hi>in penetralibus sacrae veritatis quae à</hi> Mose <hi>referuntur,</hi> in the hidden mysteries of Sacred truth revealed by <hi>Moses.</hi> To evidence this, I will shew both Catalogues, and their Coherence, as they are set down by <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers, and by <hi>Moses,</hi> and how the significations correspond each with other, as far as we can go in the Holy Scriptures, but in the <hi>Saxon</hi> it proceedeth to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, from whom it may easily be carried to our present Soveraign <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Heir</hi> of this Crown by a lineal succession.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now whether the Composer of this, and other like <hi>Saxon</hi> Genealogies, had an eye to that of <hi>Moses</hi> or no, I will not determine, but if they had, as many think, and probably <hi>Aventinus</hi> among the rest, then what <hi>Aventinus</hi> writes concerning <hi>Tuisco,</hi> that he is found in the hidden Mysteries of <hi>Moses,</hi> is not so great an absurdity as Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> would have it.</p>
                  <p>Another Argument used by Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> against the story of <hi>Tuisco,</hi> is, that if he were the Son of <hi>Noah, Noah</hi> must needs have spoke the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> Tongue, or <hi>Teutonick,</hi> for, from thence must <hi>Tuisco</hi> be fetcht, not from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> forasmuch as it cannot be so much as written in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> because that Language hath no such dipthong as <hi>Ui;</hi> now whether <hi>ui</hi> in <hi>Tuisco</hi> be a diphthong or no, I will not dispute, but I am sure it may be written equivolently in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And whether <hi>Noah</hi> spake or writ that Language which we now call <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or the <hi>Cimbrian,</hi> let those argue who love to dwell altogether on the daies of <hi>Noah.</hi> I am sure <hi>Scaliger, Vossius, Gratius,</hi> and the common consent of the <hi>Criticks</hi> make the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Character of no higher date than the daies of <hi>Esdra,</hi> and as for <hi>Noahs</hi> speaking of <hi>Teutonick,</hi> if we believe <hi>Geropius Becanus,</hi> Physitian to <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and Regent of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> not only he, but <hi>Adam</hi> himself before him spake it, and he supposeth it the only Original Language. And if we give credit to <hi>Verstegan,</hi> he was resolute and serious in this opinion, as likewise <hi>Abraham Ortelius</hi> his Follower; So that to confute the story of <hi>Tuisco,</hi> by these and such like Arguments, is nothing else but to destroy one fable by setting up another in the room of it.</p>
                  <p>That there was such a Man by name <hi>Tuisco,</hi> or something like it, whom the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had in special veneration, and adored as a God, none can deny who have read <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus;</hi> probably he was the same <hi>Tuet,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> of whom we spake in the Antiquity of the <hi>Britains,</hi> who was supposed the Interpreter of the Gods, and from him the word <hi>Tuisten,</hi> signifying <hi>to Interpret,</hi> might proceed, and <hi>Cuisto, an Interpreter,</hi> by a <hi>Teutonick</hi> termination, and he himself might be called after the manner of the same dialect <hi>Tuisto, an Interpreter,</hi> instead of <hi>Tuet,</hi> taking his name from his Office, for that he was called <hi>Tuet</hi> likewise the name of <hi>Tuesday</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but whether he were that God or no; or some of <hi>Woden's</hi> Captains deified, is not much material, seeing he hath left behind him in authentick History, little or nothing to intitle him to the founding of so great a Nation as the <hi>Germans.</hi> But that he was the Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> or his Grandchild, and that he came into <hi>Germany</hi> an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty odd years after the Flood, when it is manifest that the Confusion of Languages was not till the year three hundred, moreover that in twenty five years he not only Peopled that whole tract of ground, but establisht divers Kingdoms and Principalities, is so impossible, that were it the true <hi>Berosus</hi> that told us, and not

                     <hi>Annius</hi> that makes him speak it, we could not give credit to so vain a Report without derogating from Sacred Authority, and denying Reason it self; so that leaving <hi>Tuisco</hi> and his Followers to their Imaginary progress, I shall begin with those Leaders of our Nation which are of more modern, and therefore a much truer account whose Actions, Customes and Constitutions, are not yet fully antiquated in their Posterity, and for which our Ancestours, according to the Customes of those times, did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily place them in the number of their Gods.</p>
                  <p>The first news we hear of our Ancestours, as far as may be gathered from any tolerable Authority, was their progress under the Conduct of <hi>ERICK,</hi> King <note place="margin">ERICK.</note> of the <hi>Getes</hi> or <hi>Jutes,</hi> who led them from <hi>Scanzia,</hi> first into the neighbouring Islands called by them <hi>Wettalaheyde,</hi> afterwards into those Countries named since <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and <hi>Swedeland.</hi> And in this, the general stream of Northern Writers concur, <hi>Johannes Magnus</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Upsall, Saxo Grammaticus, Cranzius:</hi> An Ancient Chronicle written in the <hi>Gothick</hi> Tongue, and after the Custome of that Age in Rithme, thus describeth it.</p>

                     <hi>Erick,</hi> as I shrewdly suspect, from the likeness of his Name and History, for the <hi>Jutes</hi> do often put a <hi>W</hi> before names beginning with a vowel, which <hi>W</hi> the <hi>Latins</hi> express by a <hi>B,</hi> so that <hi>Berig</hi> is no more than <hi>Erick</hi> or <hi>Werick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His History is almost the same, though in some few circumstances he seemeth after in time, for <hi>Johannes</hi> and <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> with other Northern Historians, write of his coming into <hi>Gothland</hi> from <hi>Seanzia,</hi> so far it agrees with the story of <hi>Erick,</hi> but then they go farther when they say, he went into the Country of the <hi>Ulmerugii,</hi> now part of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and having subdued the <hi>Vandals</hi> (who were supposed to be so called in the daies of the former <hi>Erick</hi>) to have joyned them to his other acquests; But whether these two be the same, or different Persons, the account of both their Actions is so small and inconsiderable, that it is not worth the while to be too serious in the weighing of it.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Getes</hi> had increased to great numbers in their new Seats in <hi>Germany,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">FILEMAR.</note> and began to want room, many of them transplanted themselves into <hi>Scythia,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>FILEMAR</hi> their King, the fifth from <hi>Berig.</hi> This <hi>Filemar</hi> was the Son of <hi>Gudarig,</hi> but of his Grandfather and Great-Grandfather not a word upon Record. From thence they spread themselves even to the <hi>Bosphor,</hi> and all over the Lake of <hi>Maeotis,</hi> by degrees possessing all <hi>Thracia, Dacia,</hi> and <hi>Maecia,</hi> and stretching as far as the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>About this time, next unto <hi>Filemar</hi> their King, they had in special veneration one <hi>Xamolxis,</hi> who taught them Laws and Manners, and brought them to the orders of Civil and well governed Common-wealths, then two great Families, the House of the <hi>Amali,</hi> and that of the <hi>Balthi;</hi> the <hi>Ostrogoths</hi> were in subjection to the <hi>Amali,</hi> and the <hi>Vesegoths</hi> to the <hi>Balthi,</hi> both which names seem to signifie no more to me than the Eastern <hi>Goths,</hi> and the West <hi>Goths,</hi> as the <hi>Massagetes</hi> are derived, by many, from the <hi>Getick Massy,</hi> which with us signifies <hi>great</hi> or <hi>heavy,</hi> from the vast proportion of their Bodies, and now the <hi>Getes</hi> being very powerfulin all those parts, they took different Names from the different Countries they possessed, being called <hi>Cimmerians, Sarmates, Scythians, Thracians, Dacians, Maesians, Istrians, Ponticks,</hi> from <hi>Cimmeria, Sarmatia, Scythia, Thracia, Dacia, Maesia, Istria</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> as in our parts they were called <hi>Saxons, Angles, Sueves, Germans, Celts,</hi> upon the same and other like accounts. But we must carefully take heed, in reading the History of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, that we confound not their actions with the actions of those People whose Names they afterwards took, as for example; Because the <hi>Getes,</hi> from the Conquest of <hi>Scythia</hi> were afterwards called <hi>Scythians,</hi> and from dispossessing the <hi>Celtae,</hi> part of them were called <hi>Celtae,</hi> therefore to think, as some have done, that the ancient <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> were nothing but a <hi>Getick</hi> Nation, were an opinion absurd and unreasonable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Getes</hi> being seated in these parts, by <hi>FILEMAR,</hi> and possessed of most Countries about the <hi>Bosphor,</hi> the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea, the Lake <hi>Maeotis,</hi> and the <hi>Euxine;</hi> now it is that we hear so much of them in the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Historians, and indeed, this seemeth the full Zenith of their lustre and prosperity, whether we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them by the number of their Nations, the glory of their Actions, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, Might and Puissance of their Kings; but because these things are fully treated of in <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Historians, from whence they may be easily fetched, and because they seem remote to our purpose, who intend only an account of the <hi>Getes,</hi> as they returned again, by degrees, into these Western parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and at last into <hi>Britain</hi> it self, I shall not trouble the Reader with the names of their several Kings, or their Actions in so forraign parts, but begin with <hi>WODEN,</hi> from whom <hi>Hengist</hi> and <hi>Horsa</hi> (who first made a publick Invasion in <hi>Britain</hi>) derived themselves in the third degree; For what hath been briefly, yet fully delivered by faithful Collection from those who have read the <hi>Gothick</hi> Annals, and out of the Northern Histories themselves, together with what afterwards may be said of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Customes and Language, will be sufficient to convince the Judgment as to points re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to be known of so Ancient times and People, namely, that those very People who returned into <hi>Germany</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Woden,</hi> and they who afterwards came into <hi>Britain</hi> with <hi>Hengist</hi> and <hi>Horsa,</hi> were the Race of the Ancient <hi>Getes</hi> or <hi>Goths,</hi> so famous in History, and from whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at this day, though they are least able, yet account it the highest Honour to derive themselves.</p>

                  <p>The very same account hath <hi>Messenius</hi> given of this Progress of <hi>WODEN,</hi> collected out of various Manuscripts, which would be too tedious to recite word for word, as varying only in very small and inconsiderable circumstances. It is sufficient that out of these forementioned Records and Authors (to all which <hi>Wormius, Stephanius, Arngrimas Jonas, Messenius, Loccenius,</hi> and other Northern Writers give great credit, as authentick for the most part) we learn the Procession of our Ancestours from <hi>Asia,</hi> under <hi>Woden,</hi> and those quarters where <hi>Busbequius</hi> of late years hath found out our Language yet remaining.</p>
                  <p>If any one think that the story of <hi>WODEN,</hi> King of <hi>Asgardia,</hi> is fabulous, because there is no such place to be found in any Ancient Geographers, as <hi>Asgardia,</hi> let them consider that what the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Aspurg,</hi> the <hi>Goths</hi> might call <hi>Asgard;</hi> For this was the way of the <hi>Gothes</hi> to conform their Names of places to the signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, not the sound of words, as the <hi>Saxons</hi> after them have done to many places
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:58825:225"/>
in <hi>England.</hi> Now we read in <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, namely, <hi>Stephanus Byzantinus,</hi> and <hi>Strabo</hi> of <hi>Aspurgians,</hi> which, without doubt, are the same with our <hi>Asgardians,</hi> as the name importeth; For what <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is in <hi>Greek,</hi> that is <hi>gard</hi> in the <hi>Gothick</hi> or <hi>Saxon,</hi> namely, <hi>a Tower</hi> or <hi>Castle; Konings gard</hi> was anciently the Castle in which the King of <hi>Goths</hi> held his Court. Besides that the Name is all one, so likewise the place where our Northern Writers place their <hi>Asgardia,</hi> and where <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> their <hi>Aspurgians,</hi> is the very same exactly, namely, upon the Lake <hi>Maeotic. Stephanus;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The</hi> Aspurgians, <hi>a Nation upon the Lake</hi> Maeotis, the same is gathered out of <hi>Strabo,</hi> Book the twelfth. But that which puts the question beyond dispute, is, that as this <hi>Edda</hi> placeth <hi>Asgardia</hi> in <hi>Turkland,</hi> so doth <hi>Mela</hi> make the <hi>Turcas</hi> and <hi>Aspurgians</hi> all one, so that for the truth of the <hi>Edda</hi> in this particular there cannot be required a greater Testimony.</p>
                  <p>Besides the concurrence of these Authors, there are other manifest Reasons to prove many of the circumstances true, as they are related concerning <hi>Woden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, That he came out of <hi>Asia</hi> his very Sirname of <hi>aas,</hi> so much celebrated, doth sufficiently witness; He is called sometimes <hi>Den almegiste aas,</hi> that is, <hi>the Almighty</hi> Asian, and the old form of an Oath among the <hi>Norwegians</hi> was this, <hi>Hialpf mier suo Fryer Og Niordur Og hin matke aas; So help me Fryer</hi> Niordur, <hi>and that Omnipotent</hi> Asian.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That <hi>Woden</hi> was in <hi>Rtisland</hi> seemeth not improbable, because there are so many places which to this day bear his Name in it, to instance in a couple. In a Province of that Country there is a place called at this day <hi>Oden po, Mercator</hi> calls it <hi>Oden poa,</hi> signifying, <hi>upon Oden,</hi> by which dedication the Inhabitants inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that their whole trust and confidence was upon him.</p>
                  <p>About <hi>Nerva</hi> also, upon the same Country, lieth a small Island named <hi>Wodens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi> that is <hi>Wodens Island;</hi> By the <hi>Danes</hi> it is writ, <hi>En Odes-holm,</hi> and <hi>Godes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm. fra Reffuel til Narfuen er iij. mile. fra Narffuen til Surpe er j. mile fra Surpe til Roge er ij. mile, fra Roge til Wodes-holm er iij. store mile, oc Godesholm et it lidet Lautland oc ligger balffanden mile fra laudet.

                  <p>WHAT strange and monstrous Opinions the <hi>Saxons</hi> conceived of <hi>WODEN,</hi> may be gathered out of most of their Authors, who seldom mention his Name without some excessive Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of his Person, or miraculous relation of his Magical perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, whether it were that in those Ages the pretending to supernatural assistances was indispensably necessary to the Conducting of People from their own Countries, and establishing them in New ones, or whether <hi>Woden</hi> was no more than an ordinary Leader, and his Actions made miraculous after his death, certain it is, none of all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Nation ever attained to so great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being worshipped in all places, and by all Sexes, and saluted with the highest title of Divinity, <hi>Den almegiste aas,</hi> and <hi>hin almatke aas,</hi> that is, <hi>the Omnipotent Asian,</hi> and <hi>the Asian maker of all things;</hi> By what degrees he arrived to this Honour, I will relate as it falls to my hand out of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Authors themselves. <hi>Snorro Sturlaeson</hi> writes thus of him.</p>
                  <p>WODEN <hi>was a happy and glorious Warriour, in all his Battles he alwaies came off Conquerour, and every one believed, that by a particular favour of the Gods, Victory</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sturlaefoi</note> 
                     <hi>was inseparably entayled upon his Person, and from thence derived to his Followers; For this was his constant custome when ever he sent out any to War, or intrusted them with matters of moment, to lay his hand on their Head, after the manner of Consecration, which Ceremony performed they thought themselves sufficiently blest, and beyond the reach of any misfortune whatsoever. In Dangers they invoked his Name, as a ready help in times of necessity, placing in him their whole trust and confidence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the same Author this story is told of him: Being once at War with the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> called <hi>Uaner,</hi> it happened that both Parties tired out, agreed to give each other Hostages. The <hi>Scythians</hi> sent <note n="†" place="margin">Afterward Deified.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Heimer</hi> obtained the Kingdom of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> but did nothing without the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Mimer,</hi> but <hi>Mimer</hi> dying, the <hi>Scythians</hi> perceived, by change of Affairs, that all had been managed by his Wisdom, insomuch that wanting some prudent Counseller, they sent to <hi>Woden</hi> to redemand one <hi>Quasir,</hi> whom, with the other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages they had sent, and to give him something in lieu of <hi>Quasir,</hi> they cut off <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> Head and sent it to <hi>Woden,</hi> who, no doubt, knew how to use it, who embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, by Magick Incantation made it vocal, so that it would reveal all hidden and secret Mysteries.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, he had a way to call up the Ghosts of deceased Persons, and at his pleasure shut them up in Hills and Rocks, whence he was called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Geirs Dode,</hi> and that they should sacrifice to him such as were taken in War, as a most pleasant offering and attonement to him.</p>
                  <p>After his death, he appeared to many, especially in Battle, wherein he promised Victory; Others he invited to <hi>Ualhalden,</hi> that is, <hi>the Palace of Hell,</hi> according to this the <hi>Goths</hi> sacrificed to him not only the Vulgar sort of People, but Princes and Kings, nay, some of their lesser Gods, while living, as will afterwards appear. And
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:58825:226"/>
they believed that after death they were to go into <hi>Wodens</hi> Hall, and there drink Ale with him, and his Companions, in the Skulls of their Enemies. To this end they imagined a certain Goddess called <hi>DYSER,</hi> employed by <hi>Woden,</hi> to convey the Souls of the Valiant into his drunken Paradice. And methinks I see the <hi>Danish</hi> King, <hi>LOTH BROCK,</hi> in his Fur-Leather Breeches (for so his name importeth) in as good Verses as Ale could inspire, hugging himself with the hopes of Full-pots in the World to come.</p>

                  <p>Having given you a taste of their <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the Joys thereof, you shall next hear what their <hi>Hell</hi> was; we are like to find little good eating or drinking there, a very uncomfortable place to the <hi>Saxons.</hi> Thus it is;</p>
                  <p>They supposed a Goddess <hi>Hel,</hi> which name we yet retain to signifie the place of <hi>Punishment,</hi> who by <hi>Woden</hi> received Dominion over the Infernal Regions. To her were conveyed the Souls of such as were not designed for the Blessings of the other Paradise. What they were, and what miserable attendance they had assigned them by this Inhospitable Goddess, according to their <hi>Edda,</hi> is as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hel tastade hann i Niflheim og ollum Sottdaudum Monum med og Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daudum hun a thar mykia Bolstad og eru Garder hennar forhonar haffer og grindur storar Eliud ver heitur salut hennar hungur diskur Sultur kniffur Ganglate heiter hennar Chreell gunglott Awbatt.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He</hi> (that is, WODEN) <hi>sent</hi> Hell <hi>into</hi> Nifleheim, <hi>and gave her power over nine Worlds, that she should distribute places among them who were sent unto her, namely, those that died of Diseases or Old age. There she hath many high Towns and great strong Cullices, her Palace is called Eliud, her Dishes</hi> Hunger, <hi>her Knife, Sultur,</hi> Want. <hi>Her Serving-man Ganglate, that is,</hi> Slow-back, <hi>her Waiting-woman Gaugiot, that is,</hi> Lazy, <hi>her Threshold Falland forrad, that is,</hi> Steep destruction, <hi>her Bed Ror, that is,</hi> Pining-sickness, <hi>her Blankets Blicand bol, that is,</hi> shining Curse. <hi>Hell her self on one side is Blew, on the other the colour of a Mans-skin, all over she looks fierce and dismal, so that she may easily be known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the place assigned for all who died not in Battle, but staid till <hi>Sickness</hi> and <hi>Old age</hi> carried them away. And we see that their punishment is much propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the way of their idle living, <hi>hunger, lazy Servants,</hi> and <hi>lingring sickness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read in the <hi>Danish</hi> History of one <hi>Harald Hildetand,</hi> who took great pains to avoid coming to this place, for being blind, lame, and Bed-rid, and fearing that he might die either through his sickness or Age, he commanded himself to be carried into Battle in his Charriot, where he died with these hopes, that lifting but a finger might be construed fighting, and might bring him to <hi>Wodens</hi> Hall. The <hi>Edda</hi> hath these words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Odinn heitur all Fader thui hanner fader alira guda, hann heiter og Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fader thui hanns oska Syner eru aller their er I vall falla Cheim Skipar hann wallholl og wingolff og heita their tha Einheriar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Odin</hi> is called <hi>All fader, because he is Father of all the Gods, and Walfader, that is, the Father of</hi> Slaughter, <hi>because they are his beloved Sons who fall in Battle, whom he takes to himself into his Palace, called Walholl, and Wingolf, where they are called Einheriar, that is, the only</hi> Hero's.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see, what we read of the <hi>Scythians</hi> in <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, is found true of the <hi>Saxons</hi> who descended from them, who bred up in the same Religion, could not but equal them in Valour, and let History speak never so much in the praise of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> as to their contempt of Death, the same or greater Honour is due to our Ancestours, who so much despised all other deaths, besides dying in the Field, that they gave them the Nick-name of <hi>Kerlina dond,</hi> and established the honour of Fighting well with the rewards of another World.</p>
                  <p>Besides this place of Punishment, that I have spoken of, they had another for perjured Persons, Robbers, Murtherers, and such like Malefactors, who deserved more active and pungent Tortures. These were sent to a place where one <hi>Nidhogg</hi> Commanded, a most ingenious contriver of all sorts of Torments, who drest them up according to the qualities of their Offences, boyling some, roasting others, &amp;c. with great exactness proportioning their punishments to the demerit of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>WODEN,</hi> He is said, as to his form and visage, to have been of a chearful and pleasant Countenance, to his Friends merry, jocund, and facetious; of such admirable Eloquence and sweetness of discourse, that he charmed the Hearers, and forced belief. To his Enemies he was fierce, and by a certain kind of Magick, would take away their senses, and strike Panick-fears into them. In his Conflicts with them, by certain charms he could blunt the edges of their Swords,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:58825:227"/>
that his own Souldiers, without either Shield or Armour, like ravening Wolves or Mad-dogs, wou'd overrun, slay and make havock of them, without danger to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; And this sort of furious Onset was called <hi>Berserker;</hi> besides, he had such an admirable way of deceiving the sight, that he could transform himself into various shapes. Sometimes, as though he held his breath, he would fling his Body on the ground, which there lying as dead would turn into various figures, sometimes of a Bird, sometimes of a Fish, sometimes a Serpent. When he awaked, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly aver he had been in forraign Countries, and had exact knowledge of what passed in them.</p>
                  <p>He could squench Fires, raise Tempests, stop Inundations, and with one word call up Winds at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>He had two <hi>Ravens</hi> whom he taught the use of Language, who flying into far distant places, would bring back true intelligence of new Affairs. This Fable the <hi>Edda</hi> thus interprets.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hraffnat their sitia a Urlum hans og seigia t eitu honum oll tydende thang et their heyra og sia their heita suo hugin og Munni. Cha sender hann umm daga ad fiuga umm heim a lann og koma their astur ad dagver dat ma ale that aff verdut hann margra Cydenda viis thuit kalla menn hann hraffna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gud.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Two</hi> Ravens <hi>sitting on his shoulders, whisper in his ears all new Occurrences they either hear or see. One is called Hugtnn, that is, the</hi> Mind, <hi>the other Munni, that is,</hi> Memory. Odin <hi>sends forth these every day betimes, that they should flie the World over, and at Dinner-time return. By these he receives information, and therefore he is called Rafnagud, that is, the</hi> God of Ravens; From hence the old <hi>Danish</hi> Kings bore in their Escutcheons two <hi>Ravens,</hi> and <hi>Hungar,</hi> the first <hi>Dane</hi> that entred <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in his Royal Standard carried this Bird, which Standard upon that account called <hi>Reafan,</hi> was thought impossible to be taken, and drew much People after it no doubt, as consecrated to this <hi>Rafnagud,</hi> or God of the <hi>Ravens.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WODEN</hi> (saith the same Author) introduced the way of composing Verses in numbers, and such Rythms as are now used in the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Dialect, differing in this point from all other Languages in the World whatsoever, for that the last words of the Verses answer to one another exactly in sound. And this he did with such pleasing cadences, that mixing them in his common discourse, he wonderfully allured the Hearers, and is reputed the Inventer of Poetry among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Tribe called <hi>Scalders,</hi> which, like the <hi>Bardi</hi> among the <hi>Britains,</hi> made it their business to set forth in Verses, and sing to the People the noble Actions of their Progenitors.</p>

                  <p>This Custome of ingraving upon Stone they brought with them into <hi>Germany,</hi> as appears from many Inscriptions, few whereof are now legible, in <hi>Denmark, Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Saxony.</hi> I shall only instance in one, which time hath not quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced.

                  <p>The Character wherewith they engraved were called <hi>Runick</hi> (the reason whereof shall afterwards be shewn) and were made use of by <hi>Woden,</hi> not only for Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but Magical Charms and Imprecations. These were called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Thus we see that those Characters which were before nothing but the usual Letters of the <hi>Getes</hi> in <hi>Scandia,</hi> after their removal into the North-west parts of <hi>Europe</hi> were made use of by <hi>Woden</hi> their Leader to wrap up his mysterious Incantations in, because he observed in their make, something strange, and fit for his purpose. And for this reason, after the Faith of CHRIST was received, the <hi>Runick</hi> Character (because it was especially used in Charms and Inchantments by the <hi>Saxons</hi>) began to grow so far out of Credit that many spur'd on with too much Zeal, not only destroyed such bewitching Fooleries where they found them, but burnt, without distinction, all sorts of Books written in that Letter, and defaced Monuments and old Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for no other reason, but because they bore the Character, by which means the <hi>Gothick</hi> History hath received much injury, saith Mr. <hi>Sheringham.</hi>

                  <p>Yet nevertheless, the dotage of the Vulgar on these uncouth Letters, and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they contained in them a certain power and energy (which apprehension yet remaineth among the Simple in their Charms at this day) maintained its ground so long after Christianity it self, that, as <hi>Loccenius</hi> witnesseth, <hi>Sigfrid</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop thought it necessary to have them altered, which he did by the assistance of the Pope, who utterly banished them <hi>Swedeland,</hi> in the year ML, and substituted the <hi>Latin</hi> Character in their room. The same usage they found in <hi>Spain</hi> under <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi> King of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Navar,</hi> in the year MLXXXVI, and were at last finally condemned in the Councel of <hi>Tholoun,</hi> in the year MCXVI.</p>
                  <p>From the same abuse of them <hi>Vulphilas</hi> a Bishop of the <hi>Goths,</hi> rejecting the Old <hi>Runick,</hi> invented a new Character, which he used in the translation of the Bible, and Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> supposeth, not without reason, that our Ancestours, following his example, for the rendring the Scriptures, invented the English <hi>Saxon</hi> Character. <hi>For hitherto</hi> (saith he) <hi>could I find nothing writ in that Character</hi> (meaning the English <hi>Saxon</hi>) <hi>before the Faith received, nor have I learnt that those letters were ever in use in</hi> Germany; So that till it appears to the contrary, I may very well think they were invented in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, the English <hi>Saxons</hi> in the <hi>Cimbrick Chersoness,</hi> whence they proceeded, used altogether the <hi>Runick</hi> Character, because all the Inscriptions there, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Wormius,</hi> not one is written in the English <hi>Saxon</hi> Character. Nor is it improbable, that after the Faith received, the introducing of a new way of Writing, making the Old one less intelligible, and consequently more mysterious (as we alwaies admire those things we least understand) a certain sort of Impostures taking advantage of this change, and being acquainted with the ancient Delusions, had a far greater opportunity of putting tricks upon the People in those Characters, which now remained as a Secret only among the Learned. Hence the <hi>Saxons,</hi> in this Age, (which witnesseth the change was great) never mention the word <hi>Runick</hi> without horrour and veneration, and what before was nothing but their plain Alphabet, is now become all Charm and Magick, and the old way of writing their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue termed <hi>casting a Figure.</hi> These Impostures they called by the name

                  <p>It will not be unpleasant, particularly, to relate by what means, and from what Original the so much admired <hi>Runick</hi> gained so great veneration among our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, as also what especial vertues and effects they attributed to it; how from small beginnings and the height of Paganisme it was derived from Age to Age, still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing even under that light, by which other Superstitions seemingly greater were utterly dispersed.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Runa</hi> is derived by <hi>Wormius</hi> from <hi>Ryn</hi> or <hi>Ren,</hi> both almost of the same <note place="margin">Wormius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from their being drawn in Lines, and the Latins their Letters or <hi>liter as quasi lineatur as,</hi> so the Ancient <hi>Getes</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> nam'd their Characters <hi>Runes</hi> from <hi>Ryn,</hi> a <hi>Furrow,</hi> because they were plowed-out, as it were, with the Pen, and drawn into long Lines, and the figure of the Character it self, besides the analogy of this derivation found in other Languages, highly favours this opinion, so that at first <hi>Rune</hi> among the <hi>Getes</hi> signified no more than a bare Letter or Character.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Wormius</hi> concerning this matter, derives it <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sir</hi> Henry Spelman.</note> from the <hi>Saxon</hi> pyne, which signifieth a <hi>Mystery</hi> or <hi>hidden thing,</hi> and of this opinion is Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> also, who endeavours with new Additions to strengthen it, to which end he cites <hi>Johannes Magnus,</hi> who, in speaking of <hi>FILEMAR,</hi> hath these words; <hi>Making inquiry,</hi> saith he, <hi>into the Customes of his Country, he sound among his I'eople a certain sort of Cunning Women, called Adeltunae, for in the</hi> Gothick <hi>Tongue Runa signifies an</hi> Art, <hi>sometimes particularly the Art</hi> Magick, <hi>from whence at this day there are many Stones in</hi> Gothland <hi>in</hi> Gothick <hi>Characters, called Runasten, hence we may see,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Sheringham, that the</hi> Gothick <hi>Characters took name from the signification of the word, not the figure of the letter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, by the leave of so Worthy a Person, I cannot receed from the former deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Wormius,</hi> for <hi>Wormius</hi> was not ignorant of the word pine, signifying a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and how the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Goths</hi> pretended to do miraculous things by the operation of their Characters; But I believe the word pine, signifying a <hi>Mystery,</hi> is not the primitive, but derived from <hi>Ryn,</hi> a <hi>Furrow,</hi> by which words the Ancient <hi>Getes</hi> called their Letters, and because by the power of those Letters their Priests and Wizzards pretended to do miraculous things, therefore it came to pass that the Letters themselves, called <hi>Ryns,</hi> were used to signifie a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and <hi>Runa, Art Magick,</hi> so that <hi>Adeltuna</hi> is nothing properly, but a <hi>Learned</hi> or <hi>literate Woman, Runasten,</hi> a <hi>Learned piece of work, Runet, a Learned copy of Verses,</hi> all which words in succeeding time, from the deceit of such who imposed upon the People, were taken in an ill sence, so that <hi>Adelruna</hi> came to express a <hi>Witch, Runasten,</hi> a <hi>Charm</hi> or <hi>Talismanical figure, Runet,</hi> an <hi>Incantation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither doth the Law, made by <hi>Woden,</hi> and cited by Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> to confirm Sr. <hi>Henry Spelman's</hi> Opinion, in the least destroy <hi>Wormius</hi> his derivation, it is this; <hi>Oden hafwet thenna Lagh uthi Sweriges Riike stichtat at alle dode skulle sampt medh alle Siine Agodelac och loosorer besinnerligha medh peningar upbrande blifwa meenandes theras tilkomst thes vehage lighare blifwa Gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homen effter som eelden meera aghodelar medh thecasdoda kroppar fortarde Men till een ewigh aminuelse skulle the ofwan pa the Ronuhzligha och Forste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligha begraffningar forsambla stoora Iordhoghar och hwilke myckitt got hafwa efter sigh latit them upreeste the hoga Runasteenar ofwer Siina begraffuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Woden <hi>enacted a Law, that the Dead should be burnt with all their Moveables, especially their Mony, deeming that they would be more welcome to the Gods, with whose</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Messenius Gothicus <hi>ex</hi> Joh. Mart. <hi>de Antiq</hi> Up. fal. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Corps the fire consumed most Goods. As likewise he ordained, that over the Graves of Kings and Great Men, they should raise huge heaps of Earth for an everlasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; and over the Sepulchres of such who had performed great Atchievments, they should erect high Staves inscribed with</hi> Runick <hi>Characters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the only primitive use of the <hi>Runick</hi> Writing, as well as all others, namely, to preserve the Memories of Great Persons, and so deliver their Deeds to Posterity. But when the People were once perswaded, that such Stones set up had
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:58825:228"/>
power to keep off the Enemy, meerly by the virtue and force of the Characters engraven on them, as likewise the Songs composed in the Honour of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours, and the praise of their Vertues, had not only force to stir up Vertue in the Hearers, but by meerly wearing them in Battle, would render a Man fortunate in fight, and invulnerable. Then it was, the word <hi>Runa</hi> (signifying before nothing but the <hi>Getick</hi> Character) came to imply <hi>Charm</hi> and <hi>Incantation,</hi> and the words <hi>Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi> and <hi>Adelrunae,</hi> to have evil significations.</p>
                  <p>This change of the use of the Characters, from plainly writing the sence of things to form mysterious Incantations, is, by some, attributed to <hi>WODEN,</hi> wherefore they call him in this sence <hi>Runhotdi,</hi> that is, the <hi>Inventer of the</hi> Run; But the <hi>Runick</hi> Character was long before his time, if we may believe the <hi>Edda,</hi> cited by <hi>Wormius,</hi> which attributes the invention of it to the Gods, the delivery to one <hi>Fimbul,</hi> and the manner of Ingraving, that is, the use of it in Magick, to <hi>Woden.</hi> The ancient Verses in the <hi>Edda</hi> run thus:</p>

This was the business of the <hi>Scaldi,</hi> or as others call them <hi>Scaldri,</hi> as the Poets of that Age in Verses now sung about, are expressly called from the word Skal, as the Bards of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains.</hi>

                  <p>Hence among the ancient <hi>Scandians Skalving</hi> signifies a <hi>Poetick rapture,</hi> and <hi>Scalda,</hi> a Book of the <hi>Art of Poetry,</hi> for it was the custome of those Poets not only with their Pens but their Voices also to celebrate the Actions of their Progenitours, to the end to stir up in their Youth and their Posterity an honest emulation of their Vertues.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scaldi</hi> were commonly of the chief Blood of their Country, oftentimes of the Kings Councel and his attendance in War, that with their own eyes they might be witnesses of great Actions, and not taking them upon trust, might be better able with truth to deliver them to Posterity. Those things which in the Verses of the Ancients we find wrapt up in Fables shew only the genius of the Authors, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a piece of Art to hide plain Truths under the shadow of words, by which colours as a pleasant bait they thought to recommend their works to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Besides the famous Actions of Kings and Great Persons composed in Verse, these <hi>Scaldi</hi> drew out Genealogies of their Fore-fathers, as it appears in the Chronicle of <hi>Olaus,</hi> where there is mention made of one of them. <hi>Dc taldi han longfeda til Semingh, He wrote their Progeny to</hi> Seming; and again, <hi>Itui Kuediero Uptald xxx. langfedga Rognwals, In this Verse are reckoned up thirty descents of</hi> Rognwall; upon this account these Poets were in great favour with Princes, and were liberally provided for in their Courts.</p>
                  <p>This Art of Poetry <hi>Woden</hi> brought from <hi>Asia,</hi> as besides other Arguments the very name of it sufficiently sheweth. The ancient <hi>Scaldi</hi> called it <hi>Asamal,</hi> that is, the Language of the <hi>Asians.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Stephanius,</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Saxo Grammaticus,</hi> gives this account of it; <hi>The Old</hi> Danish <hi>Tongue which was used in Rithms, the Ancients called</hi>

And it is a wonder to see how they who have hitherto written of the <hi>German</hi> Gods, do miserably puzzle and torment themselves in solving the difficulty, as if it were an unheard-of thing among the Heathens to confound the Names and Offices of their Gods.</p>

                     <hi>called</hi> Jupiter <hi>and</hi> Mercury, <hi>as appears plainly from the names of the Week-daies. For those daies which with us are named from Thor and Woden, by them are called</hi> Jupiters <hi>day and</hi> Mercuries <hi>day. If therefore we take, according to their acceptation Thor for</hi> Jupiter, <hi>and Woden for</hi> Mercury, <hi>then must</hi> Jupiter <hi>be</hi> Mercuries <hi>Son, for among us</hi>
                     <pb n="445" facs="tcp:58825:230"/>
Thor <hi>is accounted the Son of</hi> Woden. <hi>Since therefore the</hi> Romans <hi>contrariwise made</hi> Mercury <hi>the Son of</hi> Jupiter, <hi>it remains, allowing their way that</hi> Thor <hi>is a different God from</hi> Jupiter, <hi>and</hi> Woden <hi>from</hi> Mercury; But I think this knot may eatier be untied by the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Casar</hi> in his description of the <hi>Germans,</hi> writes, that they acknowledged no other Gods but those by whose influence they were especially assisted, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> and as for other Gods they had not so much as the name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who lived some years after, when the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> were better acquainted, reckoneth <hi>Mercury, Mars, Isis</hi> and <hi>Hertha</hi> in the number whom he calls <hi>Terra Mater,</hi> the reconciling of which Authors, as it is easie, so will it open the whole controversie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> when he saith, the <hi>Germans</hi> had no other Gods but the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> is not to be understood as if he spoke in general; for, without doubt, they received not their Goddess <hi>Hertha</hi> between his and <hi>Tacitus</hi> daies, but he meant they had no other <hi>Roman</hi> Gods, which he implies when he saith, <hi>As for other Gods, they had not so much as heard of their names,</hi> which hinteth at forreign Gods, not Gods of their Country.</p>
                  <p>Likewise <hi>Tacitus</hi> mentions only those Gods which they had common with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> as appears when he nameth <hi>Hertha,</hi> he presently calls her <hi>Terra Mater,</hi> a known Goddess worshipt at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as in the daies of <hi>Caesar</hi> it cannot be supposed that the <hi>Germans</hi> had much knowledge of the <hi>Romans,</hi> so when they came to be acquainted with them, as probably they might before the time <hi>Tacitus</hi> wrote, then it is reasonable to think, that like other Nations they conformed themselves in great measure to the <hi>Roman</hi> worship, ascribing the vertues and operations of <hi>Roman</hi> Deities to their own, and by an obsequious analogy, fetching the offices and imployments of their Native Gods to comply better with those more glorious Idols they received; so that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they sometimes saluted <hi>Woden</hi> with the name of <hi>Mercury, Thor</hi> with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> their <hi>Frigga</hi> with <hi>Venus, Crodo</hi> with <hi>Saturn,</hi> but that they were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the same Gods, or that the <hi>Germans</hi> learnt their <hi>Woden, Thor</hi> and <hi>Frigga</hi> in other names, from <hi>Mercury, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is against all reason and History to be believed.</p>
                  <p>A notable Example of this their conforming to the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Names and Offices of their Gods, after they had learned from them the pomp and splendour of worship, and knew how to deck and adorn their Temples, will appear in one memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Instance as it is reported in Northern Histories.</p>
                  <p>They had a Temple, saith my Author, all wrought with Gold, in which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note place="margin">Pontamus M. Adamus.</note> to view the Statues of three of their principal Gods, the chief of them was <hi>Choar</hi> or <hi>Thor.</hi> He was placed on a Couch, with a Crown on his head and Scepter in his hand, having the other two, <hi>Woden</hi> and <hi>Fricco,</hi> on each side of him, yet at such distance, as it might appear it was he from whom the Couch was especially intended. Him they worshipped as <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whose Dominion is in the Air, ascribing to him the power of raising Thundrings and Lightnings, Wind and Rain. To him they prayed for Fair weather, and increase of their Fruits. <hi>Woden</hi> on the right hand was in Armour, and to him they addressed for success in War, and Victory over their Enemies: To <hi>Fricco,</hi> on the other side, for Peace and Tranquility, Pleasure and Plenty, and this Idol was represented with a Bow and Arrows, and a great <hi>Priapus.</hi>

                  <p>In the order and placing these Gods, who seeth not that the <hi>Saxons</hi> had more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>Roman</hi> Customes than their own.</p>
                  <p>First, whereas before they represented their Idols standing, and set them upon Pillars and Obelisks, now they lay them upon Couches and Beds, exactly after the <hi>Roman</hi> posture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we see the chief Seat is given to <hi>Thor,</hi> who takes place of <hi>Woden,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Saxon</hi> account, his Father. Yet because <hi>Thursday</hi> with the <hi>Romans</hi> was <hi>Jupiters</hi> day their chief God, and comes between <hi>Wodensday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> therefore is <hi>Thor</hi> created <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and placed in the middle, and represented with a Crown and Scepter like <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the Attributes of <hi>Jupiter</hi> given to him, whereas formerly <hi>Woden</hi> and not <hi>Thor</hi> was the same to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as <hi>Jupiter</hi> to the <hi>Romans;</hi> So that we see <hi>Woden</hi> is deposed by his Son <hi>Thor</hi> in the new <hi>Saxon</hi> Theology, as <hi>Saturn</hi> was by his Son <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Old <hi>Roman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Fricco,</hi> who with the Ancient <hi>Saxons</hi> was taken for <hi>Wodens</hi> Wife, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Goddess only, is now made with a great <hi>Priapus,</hi> and we know not of what Sex to take her, having the Members of both. Sometimes they worshipped her as a God, as she carried a Bow and Arrows, sometimes as a Goddess, as she wore a Female Vesture.</p>
                  <p>This is perfectly the <hi>Armata Venus</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who took this Notion of her from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who, promiscuously, write her <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, making her an Hermophrodite <hi>Venus;</hi> So that we must not wonder that the <hi>Saxons</hi> coming acquainted with the <hi>Roman</hi> Theology, like other Nations in great measure confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it. For the analogy between the Gods of both People, as it now stands, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears nothing but a modern compliance of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Priests with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of no higher date than the mutual knowledge both Nations had of each other. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought it to confound the History of each others Theology, as to the genuine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Offices and Names of their distinct Deities; And if there appear any essential likeness between both Nations, as to the order, number, and coincidence of some of their Idols, in some circumstances with one another, we must not think the <hi>Saxon</hi> custome sprang from the <hi>Roman</hi> more than the <hi>Roman</hi> from the <hi>Saxon;</hi> But it arose from some Third and ancienter People, from whom both taking pattern in many things drew the same lines and figures.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Suenonius,</hi> in his Notes to <hi>Saxo Grammaticus,</hi> supposeth that there were three different <hi>Wodens;</hi> The first and ancientest was called the <hi>Asian,</hi> and in distinction <hi>Odin hin Gamble,</hi> that is, <hi>Woden the Elder,</hi> He was the Son of <hi>Saturn.</hi> The second was <hi>Upsalensis,</hi> and among the <hi>Swedes</hi> had a splendid Temple, shining with Gold, built to his Honour; He is also called an <hi>Asian,</hi> but was a <hi>Scythian</hi> born, these two, <hi>Saenonius</hi> thinks, are confounded in History. The third was called <hi>Mithoden,</hi> that is, the <hi>middle Odin,</hi> of whom <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> makes mention, he, whilst the other <hi>Woden</hi> was abroad in the World took occasion to feign himself a God, but at the others return, trusting more to his Heels than his Cheating tricks, he fled into <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onia,</hi> where hoping to hide himself he was slain by the Rabble.</p>
                  <p>Whether there be any truth in this Conjecture we cannot determine, certainly the History of <hi>Hengist</hi> and <hi>Horsa</hi> would require some such salvo, who (according to <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Malmsbury</hi>) derived themselves in the third degree from <hi>Woden,</hi> which if true, necessarily implies there was one <hi>WODEN</hi> at least, if not two, later in time than him we have hitherto spoken of, to which opinion <hi>Verstegan</hi> inclineth.</p>
                  <p>But when we consider, that it was the usual way of Heathen Poets not to make their Hero's above three descents from <hi>Jupiter</hi> himself, <hi>Sic à Jove tertius Ajax,</hi> saith <hi>Ovid,</hi> why may not the same liberty be allowed to the <hi>Saxon Scaldi,</hi> to flatter their Princes in placing their Names nigher their fountain of Honour, the much admired <hi>Woden,</hi> who was the same to the <hi>Saxons</hi> as <hi>Jupiter</hi> to the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and they gave him the like Titles. For as he was saluted <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Hominum pater atque Deorum,</hi> so <hi>Woden</hi> was stiled by the <hi>Saxons, Fader allra Gudanna og Mannguna, Father of Gods and Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have given a larger Treatise of him, because he was, by far, the most renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all their Idols; the words of the <hi>Edda</hi> are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Odinns er eedstur og ellstur Acanna hann radur ollumm hlutumm, og so sem onnur Godinn eru Mattug tha thiona honum ell so sem born fodur.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WODEN is the highest and chief of the</hi> Asae, <hi>and governs all things, and although the other Gods are powerful, yet they wait upon him as Children do on their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>THOR,</hi> according to the <hi>Danish</hi> History, was the Son of <hi>Woden,</hi> and came with him from <hi>Asia;</hi> hence he is called <hi>Asathor,</hi> that is, <hi>Thor the Asian,</hi> and from him <hi>Thursday</hi> taketh name. He was esteemed next in Honour to <hi>Woden,</hi> and to him they sacrificed Men as the highest testimony of their devotion; he is written some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Thaar,</hi> and hath been thought by many to be the same with <hi>Taramis</hi> of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter Tonans.</hi> Certain it is, whether from the similitude of Name, or some other account, after the knowledge the <hi>Saxons</hi> had of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he was generally taken in after Ages for <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A memorable instance of this may be given out of an old Book of <hi>Saxon</hi> Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the publick Library of <hi>Cambridge</hi> treating of the false Gods of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>

                     <hi>There was a Man in the Isle of</hi> Crete, <hi>named</hi> Saturn, <hi>of such a Cruel nature that he devoured his own Sons as soon as they were born, and contrary to the custome of other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made their flesh his diet; But he suffered one to live although he had devoured his Brothers, namely</hi> Jupiter, <hi>a Man of agreat and high spirit. He drove his Father from the aforesaid Island, threatning to kill him if he returned. He was so incontinent as to marry his own Sister</hi> Juno, <hi>who was afterwards esteemed a great Goddess; To these
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:58825:232"/>
were born</hi> Minerva <hi>and</hi> Venus, <hi>both of which, with many other Relations, their wicked Father incestuously polluted. These wicked Men were the chiefest Gods to whom the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens gave Honour, but the Son according to their filthy worship was had in greater veneration than the Father. In their erronious Religion he was especially the most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and by some Nations he is called</hi> Thor, <hi>and the</hi> Danes <hi>highly love him.</hi>

                     <hi>FRIGGA</hi> was the Wife of <hi>Woden,</hi> the Goddess of Love among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> her name comes from <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>THISA,</hi> or <hi>DISA,</hi> the Wise of <hi>Thor,</hi> and Goddess of <hi>Justice,</hi> from her it is probably thought that our <hi>Tuesday</hi> took name, as much as to say <hi>Thisday,</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> call it <hi>Tiiszdag</hi> and <hi>Diiszgag,</hi> the <hi>Dutch Diissen-dach</hi> and <hi>Dinghes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach,</hi> the <hi>Germans, Dinstag</hi> and <hi>Zinsztag,</hi> and according to these various pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations many Originals are produced of the God or Goddess to which this day was consecrated.</p>
                  <p>The English <hi>Saxon</hi> way of calling it <hi>Tuesday,</hi> as <hi>Pontanus</hi> saith, seems to refer to <hi>Teutates,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> name him <hi>Thaut, Dieth,</hi> and <hi>Duth,</hi> and think him to be <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> but then how comes his day to be before <hi>Wodens</hi> and <hi>Thors; Verstegan</hi> will have him <hi>Tuisco,</hi> but without any authority or reason, as I have shewn in treating of <hi>Tuisco,</hi> it is <hi>gratis dictum</hi> and can never be proved, for allowing that <hi>Tuisto,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> was worshipped in especial manner by the <hi>Germans</hi> as the Founder of their Nation, yet doth it not follow he was <hi>Verstegans</hi> Tuisco, or that he had a day set apart to him, the <hi>English Saxon</hi> name of <hi>Tuesday</hi> as it is easily resolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into <hi>Disdag,</hi> so where it agrees not with the other Idioms it ought not to give rule to them. For this were fondness to think that our way of pronunciation were only right, when we find all other <hi>Saxon</hi> Nations differ from us, and agree in the main among themselves. The Islanders name it <hi>Chiiszdag,</hi> and give this account of it;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>TYR,</hi> the Son of <hi>Woden</hi> (the Genitive case of whose name is <hi>Tyrs</hi> or <hi>Tys</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction) for his Martial vertues and wisdom attained Divine Honours, to him Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>They who derive it from <hi>Disa</hi> or <hi>Thisa,</hi> the Goddess of <hi>Justice,</hi> write thus; <hi>Among other Goddesses,</hi> Disa <hi>or</hi> Thisa <hi>the Wife of</hi> Thor <hi>was thought as fit to be numbred as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Wormius.</note> Frigga <hi>the Wife of</hi> Woden; From her some will have the third day of the Week called <hi>Thiiszdag.</hi> At <hi>Upsall</hi> there were anniversary Rites called <hi>Tiiszating,</hi> held in her Honour with great pomp and solemnity; from her a Town in <hi>Denmark,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Thiseivelde</hi> took name, having adjoyning to it a Spring and Fountain dedicated to her.</p>
                  <p>The name <hi>Dinstag</hi> in High <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Dinghesdach</hi> in Low <hi>Dutch, Pontanus</hi> derives from <hi>Dingen,</hi> signifying to determine Controversies, and adds that <hi>This<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pontanus.</note> among the <hi>Danes</hi> comes by contraction from <hi>Ting,</hi> in their Tongue as much as a <hi>Bench of Judicature,</hi> happily because the determination of Causes was referred to this Goddess.</p>
                  <p>In like manner some derive Sunday, not from the <hi>Sun</hi> but the old <hi>German</hi> word <hi>Sonen, to Judge,</hi> as it is found in an ancient Creed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thana chuinstie ist sonen nuekhe entitote.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</hi>

                  <p>But to return to <hi>Tuesday,</hi> what was the Original name and derivation of it, or whether it be rightly spelt <hi>Dinsdag, Tysdag</hi> or <hi>Tyrsdag,</hi> from <hi>Disa, Tyr</hi> or <hi>Ting,</hi> is uncertain, but it seemeth to me that our way of writing it <hi>Tuesday</hi> is not so ancient as any of the former, and appeareth of no longer date than the coming of the <hi>Saxons</hi> into our parts, where the name of <hi>Teutates,</hi> or <hi>Theut,</hi> was much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.</p>
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:58825:233"/>
                  <p>They had also a Goddess named <hi>Eoster,</hi> whom I also suppose was of no higher Antiquity, being the same as <hi>Astarte</hi> of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Britains.</hi> Hence the <hi>Saxons</hi> called <hi>April, Oester monat,</hi> and the Feast of the Resurrection <hi>Eoster,</hi> though some bring it from the word <hi>Ost,</hi> or <hi>East; Verstegan,</hi> because the East-winds blow in that Month, Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> because the <hi>Saxons</hi> called the Rising of CHRIST by the name os <hi>East.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hertha</hi> was another Goddess of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> she was worshipped as <hi>Mater Deûm</hi> among the <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>the Mother of the Gods,</hi> because from her all things were supposed to take being. <hi>Hertha</hi> or <hi>Herthus</hi> was thought to preside in human Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs (saith <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaking of the <hi>Germans</hi>) and to relieve the People, saith the <hi>English</hi> Translation of Mr. <hi>Cambden;</hi> The words of <hi>Tacitus</hi> are <hi>invehi populis,</hi> which relates to a Custome the <hi>Romans</hi> used of bearing about her Image in publick Processions, the People following with loud Acclamations, together with Fifes, Cymbals, and little gingling Bells. She was represented with Cities and Towrs upon her head, because she was the supporter of them, and therefore the Poet, writing of her Procession, saith,
<q>—incedit Turrita per Urbes.</q>
And, perhaps out of the words of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> some such Custome might have been taken up by the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rheda,</hi> another Goddess of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> from whom the Month of <hi>March</hi> was <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Beda</hi> de tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, cap. 13.</note> called <hi>Rhedmonath,</hi> because then they especially sacrificed to her. This Month was also called <hi>Lenctmonat,</hi> as much as to say <hi>Length-Month</hi> saith <hi>Verstegan,</hi> because then the Daies began to grow longer than the Nights.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nocca</hi> was their Sea-God, <hi>Wormius</hi> Monument. <hi>Dan. lib. 1. cap. 4. I have found in a Manuscript, that our Country-men held a certain distinction of Terressrial and Water-Gods, for the increase of Corn and Fruit, they addressed themselves to one whose name is not expressed, but was the same as the</hi> Roman <hi>CERES. They held that one Nocca, like</hi> Neptune, <hi>had the Government of the Sea, and they give out when any was drowned, that he was snatched away by</hi> Nocca. <hi>Nocken tog hannembort.</hi> In some places of <hi>Denmark</hi> they call him <hi>Nicken,</hi> and report that not in the Sea only he hath been seen, but in Rivers also and deep Brooks, in the shape of a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monster with a Mans-head, especially to such miserable folks as are just upon the brink of drowing. And they report that some being taken out of the water dead, were found with their Noses red, just as if some body had violently suckt blood from them, and hence it is a common saying, <hi>Nicken haffuer sugit hannom, Nicken hath suckt him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mara</hi> was their <hi>night-Hagg</hi> which used to torment them in their sleep, hence they said <hi>Maren rider ham, the Mare rid him,</hi> and to this day some superstitiously take the Disease called <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> or the oppression of the Chest, for a <hi>Witch</hi> or <hi>Goblin,</hi> and call it <hi>the Night-Mare.</hi> Hence came the word <hi>Mar,</hi> to signifie a Disease in general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Taufana,</hi> whether a God or Goddess is uncertain. This Idol is mentioned by <hi>Tacitus,</hi> whose Temple upon the confines of the <hi>Marsians</hi> was destroyed by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Caesar</hi> (saith he) <hi>to the end that the waste and spoil of the Country might spread wider, divided his greedy Legions into four Bodies, for the compass of fifty mile together with Fire and Sword he made havock of all, not sparing either Sex or Age.

Therefore Tanfana mentioned by</hi> Tacitus, <hi>seemeth to have been nothing else but the Patron or Lord of some Grove.

Nations to fetch the names of their Gods from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Trees, and especially Groves; So</hi> Jupiter <hi>of the</hi> Romans <hi>was called</hi> Fagitalis, <hi>from a Grove of</hi> Beech-trees <hi>consecrated to him</hi> (<hi>as</hi> Pliny <hi>writeth.</hi>) Thus <hi>Loccenius.</hi>

                  <p>But this derivation seemeth not satisfactory, upon the account that the Ancients worshipped their <hi>Fawns</hi> and <hi>Satyrs,</hi> and such like Gods that presided in Woods and Groves, not in that high manner as we may gather <hi>Tanfana</hi> was worshipped. To such petty Deities they erected only Altars of <hi>Turf</hi> and such like materials, and offered Fruits and Spices upon them; And when we read of <hi>Jupiter Fagitalis</hi> or <hi>Viminalis,</hi> or the like, we must not understand by them was meant the chief <hi>Thunderer,</hi> but take them for some <hi>Vejoves</hi> or little <hi>Jupiters,</hi> who, for such small Offices they were imployed in, were contented with a wooden Statue, and once a year a Garland. Had <hi>Tanfana</hi> been such a God or Goddess only, certainly <hi>Tacitus</hi> would not as he doth so particularly make mention of him, for, whereas he passeth over all other Sacred places, he especially recordeth this Temple of <hi>Tanfana,</hi> giving it the title of CELEBERRIMUM TEMPLUM, <hi>the most famous Temple,</hi> so that we may rather take him for some great Divinity, and so indeed his name importeth, for as <hi>Fan</hi> signifieth <hi>Lord,</hi> so doth <hi>Tan</hi> or <hi>Thane, Great.</hi>

                     </note> Tanfan <hi>the God of Lots from the Saxon word Tan, signifying a</hi> Lot. And this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation seemeth more congruous, because the Antient <hi>Saxon's</hi> who possessed <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia</hi> and the Countries adjoyning, used especially to decide their affairs by Lots, and he refers us to <hi>Somner's Saxon</hi> Dictionary upon the word, and the <hi>Saxon</hi> History of <hi>Bede,</hi> concerning their election of Captains by Lot. <note place="margin">Bede <hi>Nist. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. l. 5. c. 11.</hi> Tacitus <hi>de</hi> Germanis.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this was a very Ancient custome of the <hi>Germans</hi> in general, <hi>Tacitus</hi> who writ of this very <hi>Tanfan</hi> taketh notice. <hi>They used also casting and drawing Lots very much, their way of proceeding was plain, they cut down a Branch from some Tree that bare fruit, and then cleft the same into little slips, and after they had distinguished them with different notches, they scattered them helter-skelter upon a white Cloth. If it were a Publick Consultation, the Priest of the City; if a, Private, the Master of the Family first praying to the Gods, and with eyes lift up to heaven, took each of them up three times, and then interpreted them according to the mark set before upon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this description it is scarce to be doubted but <hi>Tanfan</hi> was their God of Lots, to whom they addressed themselves to interpret future Events, and perhaps it was to him they payed their Vows (a Custome mentioned by* <hi>Sidonius</hi>) when they <note place="margin">Lib. 8. Epist. ad <hi>Numant.</hi>
                     </note> drew out every tenth Captives by Lot, and hung them up upon a Tree; or if this strangling of Captives was performed to the honour of <hi>Woden,</hi> according to his own institution, yet the particular determining of the party most acceptable might be the peculiar office and imployment of <hi>Tanfan. Tan</hi> properly signifies a <hi>twig</hi> or <hi>slip,</hi> and by a Metonimy a Lot made of a <hi>Twig,</hi> or as <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath it, <hi>the Branch of a Fruit-bearing tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Laws of <hi>Friesland</hi> (Tit. 14.) there is one yet extant concerning the manner <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hottomans</hi> disput. de feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, lib. 5.</note> of Casting Lots, which it seems continued in use after Christianity it self, some few circumstances only varied, but the name of <hi>Tan</hi> (whereby they called their Lots) still exactly preserved. The Law runs thus;</p>
                  <p>The Lots ought to be after this manner, Two slips cut off from a Branch (which slips are called <hi>Ta<hi rend="sup">e</hi>nes,</hi> one signed with the sign of the Cross, the other unmarked) being wrapt up in a clean Cloth are to be laid upon the Altar, or on some Relicks, and the Priest, if any be present, or for want of one, some young Child may take
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:58825:234"/>
one of those Lots from the Altar, in the mean time prayers are to be made to God. If those seven who have sworn concerning Manslaughter committed, have sworn true, that he should shew it by some evident token. If he takes up the Lot which hath the sign of the Cross, they shall be innocent that have sworn, but if he take up the other then every one of the seven shall make his own Lot, that is a Ta<hi rend="sup">e</hi>ne made of a Twig, and shall sign it with his own mark, so distinctly, that he and the rest that stand about may know it again to be his. This done, they shall wrap them all up in a clean Cloth, and then lay them on the Altar or Relicks, then the Priest, if any be present, or if not, as was said before, some innocent Child shall take them one by one from the Altar, and as they come, demanding, at every one whose Lot it is, shall deliver it to the true party that knoweth it to be his own, he whose Letter is last of all drawn shall be forced to make composition for the Man-slaughter, the rest whose Lots came before shall go free.</p>
                  <p>Had not this custome by deciding Controversies by Lot been used in a Religious way by the Heathen <hi>Saxons,</hi> the Christians had never brought it into the Church, who though they thought it necessary to comply with some Customes, which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of those times would not be weaned from, yet they never thought fit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance them to a higher nature; so that what was here performed on the Christian Altars, was no more than what had been done on the Heathen before, the Object only of the worship being changed from <hi>Tanfana</hi> their God of <hi>Lots,</hi> to the true GOD who knoweth all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alfur,</hi> by this name they called their <hi>Elves</hi> inhabiting Rocks and Caves, and the Sacrifices to them were called <hi>Alfblot,</hi> they were supposed not above a cubit long; the <hi>Goths</hi> called them <hi>Dwergh,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons</hi> Dpeng and Dpeonh, from hence we call a little Man a <hi>Durgin</hi> at this day. The chief of these <hi>Elves</hi> or <hi>Fairy's</hi> was <hi>Mod Sognor,</hi> the second <hi>Durin,</hi> &amp;c. their Nation was divided into <hi>Guttels,</hi> or <hi>Trulls</hi> and <hi>Coballs, good</hi> and <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> but of this enough.</p>
                  <p>We read of another famous Idol among the <hi>Saxons</hi> named <hi>Irman-saul,</hi> the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of its name is variously guessed at, some would have it written <hi>Metmes. saul,</hi> i. e. the Pillar of <hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> who appears was worshipped by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.

                  <p>The Inscription being Latin, it should seem that it was the Statue of some Hero set up by the <hi>Saxons</hi> after their acquaintance with the <hi>Romans;</hi> And because the proper name of it is <hi>Irmen Saul,</hi> not <hi>Hermes Saul</hi> (for how came the <hi>Germans</hi> to be acquainted with the Greek name of <hi>Mercury</hi>) <hi>Schedius</hi> with great reason guesseth it was the Effigles of <hi>Harminius</hi> Captain of the <hi>Cherusti,</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> Nation in the daies of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> and that by corruption of time, for <hi>Harmans Saul</hi> it came to be pronounced <hi>Irman Saul,</hi> which alteration is so small, and the divise of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue agreeth so exactly with the History of <hi>Harminius,</hi> that his opinion seemeth more than probable; For never man deserved more to be placed in the number of the Gods than this <hi>HARMINIUS,</hi> who, by <hi>Roman</hi> Writers themselves, is stiled <hi>The Deliverer of Germany;</hi> and is confessed to have given the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, then in its full strength, such a blow, as made the foundation of it shake for a long time after.</p>
                  <p>His History therefore I shall not think impertinent or tedious to deliver, because it condubeth to the Illustration of this Monument, and to the Honour of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, who at the first grapling with the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagles under the Conduct of this <hi>Harminius</hi> gave them such sensible marks of their power and policy, as their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himself at that time, nor their Writers after could never dissemble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quinctilius Varus,</hi> a man of a quiet disposition and easy parts, more accustomed to the slow method of Camps than the quick motions of War, dull and covetous, <note place="margin">Velleius Paterculus.</note> was Commander of the <hi>German</hi> Army, who thinking the <hi>Germans</hi> had nothing of Man in them, but voice and figure, began to cast with himself, that whom the Sword could not tame, Laws and Jurisdiction might allure and temper.</p>
                  <p>With this design having entered the midst of <hi>Germany</hi> he set up his Courts and Tribunals, and drew out the Summer in hearing and determining Causes. But they, who in the midst of their fierceness had secret reserves of cunning and craft, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion full of subtilty and deceit, now with feigned processes, and seeming hot accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of one another, then, when the Cause was decided, with high prayers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Justice, which ended those Controversies by Hearing, which used to be determined by the Sword, drew <hi>Quinctilius</hi> into so great security, that he thought himself rather a Judge in the <hi>Roman</hi> Courts, than a General in the midst of <hi>Germany.</hi>

                  <p>Whereupon a young Gentleman of a sudden apprehension and quick wit, by <note place="margin">Florus, <hi>lib. 4. cap.</hi> 21.</note> name <hi>HARMINIUS,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sigimer</hi> a Prince of that Country, of a lively Countenance, and carrying the sparkes of disdain in his eyes, who had served for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly under the <hi>Romans,</hi> and attained to the Equestral Order, seeing the pride of <hi>Quinctilius</hi> increase with his security, entered into thoughts how he might ease his Nation from that growing Insolence; For now the <hi>Germans</hi> generally began to be weary of <hi>Quinctilius,</hi> who with his Rods and Axes exercised a too arbitrary and <note place="margin">Vell Paterc. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. Aventinus.</note> lordly power over them: wherefore taking into his Conspiracy a few of the chief of his Country, namely, <hi>Liber</hi> a Priest of the <hi>Catti, Segimund</hi> the Son of <hi>Segestus,</hi> a Priest of the <hi>Cherusci, Veromarus, Egmarus,</hi> and his Son <hi>Sosithacus, Berthorites, Theodoricus,</hi> all <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes, he began to put his designs in execution, but he could not carry it so privately, but that intelligence was brought to <hi>Quinctilius</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign by <hi>Segestes</hi> the Father of <hi>Segimund,</hi> one of the Conspirators; but <hi>Quinctilius</hi> not believing the report, like one lull'd in a deep sleep, and <hi>Harminius</hi> not giving time for a second Alarum, the plot took effect. <hi>Quinctilius</hi> is assaulted by a Party just as he ascended the Tribunal, whilst others in great numbers set upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers in their Camp, who not being able to defend their Trenches, which were on every side invaded, and trusting to the Woods and Marshes, are here most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably cut in pieces and destroyed by their nimbler Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quinctilius</hi> seeing all lost slew himself with his own Sword, hastning that death which otherwise the insulting Enemy might have made more dishonourable. <hi>Caesar,</hi> when he heard of this defeat, which was ever after called <hi>Variana Clades,</hi> like a man distracted tore his head and beard, often crying out, Quinctili Vare <hi>redde Legiones;</hi> he commanded Watches to be kept in the City, and the Day continually to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served with Mourning and Supplications: Besides he vowed to <hi>Jupiter</hi> the <hi>Magni Ludi,</hi> or Great Solemnities (which were not usual but in the highest extremity) if he would bring the Commonwealth to a better condition. And this blow, saith an Author of theirs, was so considerable, that whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire before was <note place="margin">Florus.</note>
                     <pb n="454" facs="tcp:58825:235"/>
scarce bounded by the Ocean, now it was contained within the banks of the River <hi>Rhine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HARMINIUS</hi> being rid of the <hi>Romans</hi> (take it from <hi>Tacitus</hi>) began to affect the Kingdom, but the found the liberty of the People to cross his design, so that after long contention with them, and various fortune on both sides, he fell at last by the treachery of his own Relations, without doubt the Deliverer of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and who engaged with the <hi>Romans,</hi> not in their infancy, as other Princes, but in their most flourishing condition. In Battels he had various success, in War unconquerable, he is yet celebrated amongst Barbarous Nations: These are the very words of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> so that we may reasonably imagine, that this <hi>Herman Saul</hi> was set up to his Honour by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who (as <hi>Schedius</hi> reporteth) used in a kind of Martial dance, being compleatly armed and girded with their Enemies Swords, in certain turns to surround the Pillar, and at every turn falling on their knees kiss and adore it.</p>
                  <p>Besides, they had three other Idols <hi>Rugiivith, Porevith,</hi> and <hi>Porenuth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rugiivith</hi> was represented with seven Faces upon one head, and seven Swords by his side, and an eighth in his hand; he was made taller and thicker than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a Man, and was worshipped as <hi>Mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Porevith</hi> had five Heads, but had no Armour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Porenuth</hi> had four Faces, and a fifth on his Breast, on the forehead of which was his Left hand, and his Right on its Chin.</p>
                  <p>I believe they had the same Original as <hi>Suantovite,</hi> another Idol of theirs, which <note place="margin">Schedius.</note> was represented with four Heads and four Necks, two looking forward, the other two backwards. In his Right hand he held a Horn set with divers Mettals, which the Priest every year fill'd with Wine, prognosticating by the greater or lesser de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the Liquor the plenty of the year succeeding. His Left arm was set a kimbo, his Tunick reached to his ankles, his Feet touched the ground, the bottom of them being hid in the earth. Not far from him was set his Harness and Charriot, and other badges of Divinity.</p>
                  <p>Once a year, after Fruit-time, they sacrificed before the doors of his Temple, and kept a solemn Feast of their Nation; The Priest, all the while he was in the Temple, held his wind, which when he had occasion to draw, he ran to the door, for fear the God might be polluted with humane breath.</p>
                  <p>He had a Horse maintained for him, on which he was thought to ride to Battel, for often after fight with the Enemy he was found in the Stable all in a foam, and dirty. It was lawful only for the Priest to feed and keep him.</p>
                  <p>To this Horse they sought for presages in War, and inquired Events in battel; and this Custome of consulting with Horses was generally used through all <hi>Germany,</hi> and perhaps was the occasion of the Arms of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Names of <hi>Hengist</hi> and <hi>Horsa,</hi> and others, who were so called from this particular Beast.</p>
                  <p>This Idol was destroyed by <hi>WALDEMAR,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> but the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it continued for a long time among the <hi>Boemians;</hi> nay, at this day they have no greater salutation, when they entertaina Stranger or a Friend, than to say, <hi>Wité</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Schedius.</note>
                     <hi>Wité:</hi> Thus far <hi>Schedius,</hi> which if true, that the manner of saluting comes from <hi>Suantovith,</hi> then <hi>Wité</hi> is the name of the Idol, and <hi>Suanto</hi> an addition only; and hence we may derive <hi>Porenuth</hi> and <hi>Porevith,</hi> as much to say as <hi>Poorvith,</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giviith,</hi> as much as <hi>Rugar with,</hi> or <hi>With</hi> the Helper; and it is to be observed, that the make of all of them agree in the manner of multiplying their Heads and Faces.</p>

                  <p>Prono, this Idol held in its Right hand a Plow-share, in its Left a Spear with an Ensign, about its Temples Coronets, his Feet decked up, upon one of them hung a little Bell; his Priest was called <hi>Mich,</hi> he is taken for <hi>Brennus,</hi> not the <hi>Gaul,</hi> but an <hi>Angle.</hi>

                  <p>Crodo was another God of the <hi>Saxous,</hi> he was represented an Old man standing <note place="margin">Schedius.</note> upon a Fish, which we call a <hi>Pearch,</hi> he was covered over with a loose Garment tied to him with a Linnen girdle, his Feet naked, he held a Wheel and a Pitcher, full of all sores of fruits, Roses and Apples. His naked Head signified that God ought to be worshipped with pure mind, and uncovered. By his Linnen-garment was expressed Liberty, for the inviolable defence of which they ought to resist their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even with hazard of their lives, as a <hi>Pearch</hi> doth a <hi>Pike.</hi> The Wheel was to put them in mind of Unity, that they should unanimously, and with joynt force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Enemy. By the Linnen-girdle was noted Friendship, which ought to be preserved without spot or blemish. The Pitcher with the Fruit denoted Time, which produceth all things for the use of Man; Thus <hi>Schedius.</hi>

In his Left hand he held up a Wheel, and in his Right he carried a Pail of water, wherein were flowers and fruits. His long Coat was girded unto him with a Towel of white Linnen; his standing on the sharp finns of this Fish was to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that the</hi> Saxons <hi>for their serving him, should pass stedfastly and without harm in dangerous and difficult places. By the Wheel was betokened the knit Unity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Concord of the</hi> Saxons, <hi>and their concurring together in running one course.

                  <p>They likewise counted their time, not by Daies, but by Nights, and we at this day say a Sennight and Fortnight, not Sevendaies and Fourteendaies. And the reason of their counting by Nights and not by Daies might arise from that high super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition they had of the <hi>Moon,</hi> whose Increase and Wane they observed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Actions of the highest concern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They used to engrave upon certain squared Sticks</hi> (saith <hi>Verstegan,</hi> but whence he had it I know not) <hi>the course of the Moons of the whole Year, whereby they could alwaies certainly tell, when the New Moons, Full Moons, and Changes should happen, as also their Festival daies; and such a Carved stick they called Al-mon-aght, that is to say, Al-mon-heed, to wit,</hi> the regard or observation of all the Moon's; <hi>and hence,</hi> saith he, <hi>is derived the name of</hi> Almanac.</p>
                  <p>This derivation is like many others of the same Author, carrying a World of seeming Invention and pure Ignorance, for who knoweth not that <hi>Almanac</hi> is an <hi>Arabick</hi> composition, from which Language also we borrow many other terms in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy, as <hi>Nadir</hi> and <hi>Zenith,</hi> and in Chimistry the words <hi>Alchimy, Alembic,</hi> all made up of <hi>Greek</hi> words with the <hi>Arabick</hi> particle <hi>Al.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They made Leagues and Friendships in blood: Thus <hi>Hading</hi> Son of <hi>Gran,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> entered into Society with <hi>Liser,</hi> the Pyrate, as <hi>Saxo</hi> writeth. <hi>The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Saxo Gram. <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</note> Danes, <hi>When they made a League, used to bedaub their foot-steps with blood sprinkled on them, strengthening the Obligation of friendship with the mutual mixture of their blood, by which Method</hi> Liser <hi>and</hi> Hading, <hi>being knit together in the strictest Bonds of Amity, proclaimed War against</hi> Loker, <hi>Lord of the</hi> Curetes.</p>
                  <p>This Custom the <hi>Getes</hi> in all probability, brought out of <hi>Scythia</hi> with them, for, we read, it was the Customs of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> as is plainly seen in <hi>Lucian's</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue, inscribed <hi>Toxaris,</hi> or Friendship,, wherein <hi>Toxaris</hi> is introduced, thus speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>As soon as we have cut our fingers, and dropped the Blood into a Bason, and dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the top of our Swords in it, and then lifting up the Cup, and drunk both together, there is nothing that can part us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth almost the same of them, for having put Wine in an earthen <note place="margin">Herod. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</note> Vessel, they mix their own blood with it. <hi>They that make the League with a little knife, or sword, make a gash in their bodies; then they dip their Seax, Arrows, Pole-Ax and Sword in the Cup, which done, they use many Imprecations, and afterwards drink up the Wine, not only they who make the League, but their Followers of the chief Rank.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same is witnessed also by <hi>Pomponius Mela:</hi> but it is needless to heap up Testimonies in a thing so evident. And that this Custom generally spread over <hi>GERMANY</hi> may be gathered out of another Author of good Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Germans,</hi> saith he, <hi>in their Drinking-Festivals embracing each other cut the</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Veins of their foreheads, and the blood that falls into the Cup they stir about with the Wine and drink it off, thinking they have attained the highest piece of Friendship, when they have tasted one anothers blood. After this sort of drinking they anoint their Heads with the oyl of Roses or Hony to allay Vapours, but for want of that, they use Wine and Spikenard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they were to consult of matters of weight and importance, besides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of Beasts Intrails they especially observed the neighing of Horses; For this purpose the whitest that could be pickt out were kept at the publick charge in Groves and Parks set apart from them. These were never set to Common work, but drew the Holy Chariot, which was followed by the Priest, and King or Prince of the City. Their Presages, of all others, carried the greatest credit both with Priest, People, and Prince, for they looked on themselves as the Servants of the Gods, but their Horses as their Intimates.</p>
                  <p>This Custome continued longest in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> as <hi>Saxo Grammaticus</hi> and <hi>Cranzius</hi> observe, where they had this custome of consulting them.</p>
                  <p>When a War was designed against any Province, they set up before the Temple three rows of Spears, over every Spear two other ran cross-way, then the Horse was led out by the Priest, who used many Prayers upon the occasion; when the Horse came to the ranks, if he passed them with his right foot forward and not left, then they counted it a good Omen, but if but once in passing them he put his left before
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:58825:238"/>
his right, then they desisted from their Enterprizes. <hi>From this great opinion they had of Horses, perhaps</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Cainbden</hi>) <hi>the Dukes of</hi> Saxony <hi>gave a Horse for their Arms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To try before hand what would be the issue and event of War, they used some way or other to get a Prisoner of that Nation with whom they were to make War; when they had taken him, they chose out one of their own Country men to fight with him, and having armed both Champions with the distinct Weapons of their own Nation, they reckoned by him that was Conqueror, which side would carry away the Victory.</p>
                  <p>In matters of moment which could not otherwise be decided, they used among <note place="margin">Saxo Gram.</note> themselves to refer the Controversie to combat. Thus <hi>Handing,</hi> Prince of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Helgo,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> fought about the right of the possession of <hi>Juteland;</hi> in which combat <hi>Hunding</hi> was slain, and the <hi>Saxons</hi> upon agreement made before, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the Country to the <hi>Danes:</hi> So our Historians mention the like between our <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>Canute</hi> the <hi>Dane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was a very ancient Custome of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as appears by those Reasons given, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sched.</hi> Synt. 21 cap. 46.</note> why they retained it even under Christianity it self; amongst which this is one, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had received it from their Ancestors in the Island</hi> Scandia. This was called Kamp-fight, and he that fought it Kampffet.</p>
                  <p>I have spoken before, how the <hi>Saxons</hi> counted it the highest ignominy in the World to die by Age, or Disease, and this was generally the opinion of all the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations. <hi>Cicero</hi> writes of the <hi>Cimbrl,</hi> that about to die in Battel they rejoyced exceedingly, but made heavy moans in time of Sickness. And <hi>Lucian</hi> admires this Theology of theirs;</p>

                  <p>Thus much concerning the more Ancient Customes of the <hi>SAXONS;</hi> We come now to those times, wherein they began to appear upon our Coast, until their arrival in <hi>Britain:</hi> take the account as it is here and there delivered in Good Authors.</p>
                  <p>THis Nation of the <hi>SAXONS</hi> was generally of a most Warlike temper, their valour and hardiness in War is thus celebrated by <hi>Zosimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>For Courage of mind, (<hi>saith he</hi>) strength of body, and enduring labour and travel, they are of all the <hi>Germans</hi> most renowned; the same saith <hi>Orosius,</hi> who stileth them terrible for hardiness and agility. <hi>Marcellinus</hi> said, they were dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the <hi>Romans</hi> for their sudden and quick motions; and <hi>AEgysippus</hi> makes them a nimble, swift, and dodging Enemy. <hi>Saxony,</hi> saith he, is a Region or Country in respect of its Marshes unapproachable, and surrounded with combersom Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, not easie to be passed through; By reason whereof, although they procure to themselves greater security for War, and although it self was often represented Captive to exalt the <hi>Roman</hi> Triumphs, yet they retain the repute of being a most Valorous People, especially excelling all others in Piracy; howbeit, trusting to their swift Pinnaces and Fly-boats (not in fine force) provided rather for flight, and to make escapes, than to stand to battel.</q>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:58825:239"/>
                  <p>Exactly after the same manner <hi>Isidore</hi> describes them. <q>The Nation of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> scituated upon the Coasts of the Ocean, and among Marshes unpassable, is for Warlike courage and nimbleness expert at Service, from whence they took their Name, as being stout, valiant and hardy, and renowned above all others for Piracy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They were tall of stature, and for feature and good proportion of limbs conspicuous. <hi>Witichindus</hi> the Monk thus sets them out: <q>The <hi>Franks</hi> admired these Men for their excellency, as well in Body as Mind; they wondered at them for their new and strange Apparel, for their Armour, and the Hair of their heads that covered their shoulders; but most of all for their stedfast and constant Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and Valiant spirits. They were clad in Souldier's Cassocks, and had long Spears for their weapons; they put confidence in their little Bucklers, and wore great Knives at their backs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>However it may seem, that in former time they shaved their head close, after the <hi>Asian</hi> fashion, from whence they proceeded, leaving only a tuft of hair on their Crown, wearing a Plate about their temples. And this appears out of the Verses of <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris:</hi>

                     <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> gives us an account of their Habits in these words: <hi>Their Garments</hi> (saith he) <hi>were large, loose, and for the most part made of Linnen, after the manner of the</hi> English Saxons, <hi>Trimmed and set out with very broad gards or welts purflet, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with sundry Colours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Long living in Piracy it was not strange to find them expert Sea-men, insomuch as being so long acquainted with the Sea they were fearful of the Land. They wrought so much mischief upon the Coasts of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> extending their Piracy as far as <hi>Spain,</hi> that particular Orders were taken by the command of both Countries for providing Captains and Sea-men to restrain their Insolencies and depredations, who thereupon were stiled Counts and Earls of the <hi>Saxon</hi> shore along <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> which gave the occasion of <hi>Sidonius Apollinaris</hi> to write thus of them,</p>

There is no Enemy so cruel as this, he setteth upon others unawares, and to save himself slips a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as warily, he sets at nought all that did encounter with him, he ruins all that take no heed of him, whomsoever he follows are certainly overtaken; but when he flyeth he is sure to make his escape: To this Service ship-wracks inure him, and so affrighten him not, and they are not only skilful in the dangers of Sea, but famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly acquainted with them. If a Tempest ariseth, the same of one side serveth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, were they in Jeopardy to be taken, on the other side, if they assail others, it hindereth them from being perceived, or discovered at a distance: In waves and craggy rocks, they venture their Lives in the hopes to be rewarded by fortunate success, and besides this, before they take shipping into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and weigh their flowked Anchors from the Enemies shore, upon the point of return, their way and custom is to kill every tenth Captain with equal and dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous torment (a Custom the more deplorable, because of its Superstition) and among the number of such as are designed for death, for to disperse the equity of Lot, mixt with the iniquity of Death. With such Vows they bind themselves, and with such Sacrifices they pay their Vows, and not so much purified and cleansed by such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as defiled with Sacrileges, the bloody and detestable Murderers esteem it a religious Act, rather to torment a poor Prisoner to death, than to excuse his misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Punishment by receiving a Ransom.</q>

                  <p>So that I believe the <hi>Saxons</hi> learnt Chastity of the <hi>Germans</hi> after their coming into their Country, for <hi>Caesar</hi> in his description of the Manners of the <hi>Germans</hi> highly commendeth them for that particular vertue, and saith, that they who longest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unmarried were most honoured among them. By this means they thought their stature and strength increased, and their Nerves grew firmer; but to know a Woman before the age of Twenty, was esteemed the most Reproachful thing in the World.</p>
                  <p>So firm and resolute they were, that they chose rather to be their own murtherers, and so die wilfully, than to be a mock and laughter to their Enemies. For this cause it was, that, when <hi>Symmachus</hi> had provided a band of them against the Publick <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Epist. 46.</note> shews which were to be exhibited, the very day on which they should have been brought forth into the Theatre, for Sword-play, to kill one another, by strangling themselves they disappointed all hopes of shewing bloody sport and pastime to the Spectators. And <hi>Symmachus</hi> himself writeth thus further of them: <hi>The Band or Company of</hi> Saxons (saith he) <hi>is lessened by death, for when as the private Guard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained not the liberty of the impious hands of those desperate People, the first day of the Sword-fight-shew saw nine and twenty of their necks broken without an halter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the <hi>Saxons, Angles</hi> and <hi>Jutes,</hi> which are particularly mentioned by <hi>Bede,</hi> the <hi>FRISONES</hi> also about the same time came into <hi>Britain,</hi> as is gathered out of <hi>Procopius,</hi> who is cited by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Island</hi> BRITAIN <hi>three most populous Nations do inhabit, which have every one their several King to rule them; And those Nations be called</hi>
                     <pb n="466" facs="tcp:58825:241"/>
Angili FRISONES, <hi>and after the name of the very Island,</hi> Britones. <hi>Now they seem to be so great a multitude of People, that every year a mighty number of them with their Wives and Children go from thence unto the</hi> Frankes, <hi>and they give them entertainment in that part of their Land, which seemeth most desert above the rest, and hereupon Men say, they challenge unto themselves the very Land. And verily, not long since, when the King of the</hi> Frankes <hi>sent certain of his People in Embassage to</hi> Constantinople <hi>unto the Emperor</hi> Justinian, <hi>he sent withal some</hi> English, <hi>pretending ambitiously, that this Island was under his Deminion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, besides the testimony of <hi>Procopius,</hi> it may be gathered out of <hi>Bede</hi> himself, that such a People did seat themselves in this Island; For when he writes of <hi>Wilsrid, Wicbert,</hi> and <hi>Willibrord,</hi> who were sent out of <hi>England</hi> to preach the Gospel, he saith, they taught the <hi>Frisians</hi> with their own voice the Gospel of <hi>Christ,</hi> which they could not have done, had the Language of the <hi>Frisians</hi> been different from what they had learned in their own Country. And the same Author, speaking of <hi>Egbert</hi> and <hi>English Saxon Anachoret,</hi> in his first Book and tenth Chapter useth these very words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Idem, opere inito Apostolico, verbum Dei aliquibus eorum, qui nondum audiêrunt, genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Evangilando committere proposuit; quorum in</hi> Germaniâ <hi>plurimas noverat esse Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones, à quibus</hi> Angli &amp; Saxones, <hi>qui nunc</hi> Britanniam <hi>incolunt, genus &amp; originem duxisse noscuntur. Sunt autem</hi> FRISONES, Rugii, Dani, Huni, <hi>Antiqui</hi> Saxones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Having undertaken the work of an Apostle, he resolved to preach the word of God to some that had not yet heard of it, of which sort he knew many Nations in</hi> Germany, <hi>from whom the</hi> Angles <hi>and</hi> Saxons, <hi>which now inhabit</hi> Britain, <hi>are known to derive their descent and Original. These are the</hi> FRISONS, <note n="*" place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania.</hi>
                     </note> Rugians, Danes, Huns, <hi>and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Saxons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marcellinus</hi> co-temporary with <hi>Bede</hi> (who being sent with <hi>Willibrord</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> preached the Gospel in <hi>Frisia,</hi> and is highly commended by <hi>Ludger</hi> the Evangelist of the <hi>Frisons</hi>) in the Life of <hi>Suidbert</hi> (his Country-man and Companion in Travels, and first Bishop of <hi>Utrecht</hi>) which he wrote to <hi>Gregory,</hi> the third Bishop of the same place, saith thus: <hi>This</hi> Suidbert <hi>thirsted after the Salvation of all Men; but especially of the Pagan</hi> Frisians <hi>and</hi> Saxons, <hi>because the</hi> English <hi>sprang from them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the same place, speaking of <hi>Willibrord</hi> and <hi>Suidbert,</hi> and others of their Associates sent out of England, among which he was one, he hath these words: <hi>Because,</hi> saies he, <hi>the holy Doctors were born in</hi> England <hi>of the Race of</hi> Frisions <hi>and</hi> Saxons, <hi>therefore could they conveniently preach unto them the Gospel of</hi> Christ <hi>in the</hi> German <hi>Tongue.</hi> And the Annals of <hi>Leiden</hi> say, that <hi>Willibrord</hi> preached to the <hi>Frisians</hi> in the <hi>Frisian</hi> Tongue.</p>
                  <p>By comparing these Testimonies together, we may undoubtedly conclude, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Frisians</hi> came into <hi>Britain</hi> with other <hi>Saxon</hi> Nations, and that the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage spoken in <hi>Britain</hi> in the daies of <hi>Bede</hi> differed very little from what was spoke on the Continent, from the mouth of the <hi>Rhine</hi> round to <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and through all those Inland Countries of <hi>Saxony, Alsatia, Westphalia;</hi> and indeed all those Territories were possest by the same Nation of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> though called by different Names. And the very Coasts lying upon the <hi>British</hi> Sea, even to <hi>Frisia, Batavia,</hi> and the River <hi>Scaldis,</hi> even to the shore of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was Anciently called by the name of Lower <hi>Saxony,</hi> as may be gathered out of an old Chronicle writ about three hundred years ago in old <hi>Teutonick</hi> Verses.</p>

                  <p>TO <note n="*" place="margin">Page 352.</note> resume the History where it broke off, <hi>HENGIST</hi> having given his Daughter to <hi>VORTIGERN</hi> King of <hi>Britain,</hi> and in Reward for her received the whole Country of <hi>Kent</hi> by donation, began now to lay the foundation of a <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchy in that part of the <note place="margin">An. Dom. 455.</note> Island: By gaining so fair and large Possessions, as <hi>Kent,</hi> so opportune for Navigation, lying nearest to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and open in its Ports, he had means to receive, and room to encourage any new Adventurers he should have occasion to invite over.</p>
                  <p>Besides these great advantages of Territory by near alliance to the Crown, he gained these main points, namely, a trust and confidence in the King, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a certain dependance of the <hi>British</hi> Nobility upon him; He had now a kind of Authority at Court, and carried a stroke in their choicest Councels; if at any time jealousies of him arose, they were either stifled by a temporizing remembrance of his good Services, or over-awed by his alliance and interest with the King. Such who had the wit to disern, or the honesty to give warning of his growing Ambition, were looked upon as disaffected to the Government, and Persons dissatisfied with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent management of Affairs; And what added fewel to these Jealousies, was, that <hi>Vortigern</hi> himself was but an Usurper, and <hi>Ambrose</hi> the Lawful Prince kept out by violence, so that continually looking on that side from whence he expected most danger, he was blind to the designs and contrivances of <hi>Hengist,</hi> and lay open to all his encroachments. Add to this, that <hi>Vortigern,</hi> whether by Nature so framed, or by Custome changed after his advancement to the license of a Scepter, was a slothful and amorous Prince, uneasie to business, and restless, saving only in his delightful pleasures.</p>
                  <pb n="472" facs="tcp:58825:244"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hengist</hi> on the other hand, watchful and contriving, and one who well knew how to make the best use of those fair opportunities which were given him; so that the one continually losing, the other insensibly gaining; the one never failing in his demands, the other not daring to deny any thing, the <hi>Saxons</hi> got such firm rooting at last, that the hands that planted them were not able to pluck them up, when they most desired it. And now <hi>Hengist</hi> being well warm in his Principality of <hi>Kent,</hi> obtains leave of the King to call over <hi>Octa</hi> and <hi>Ebissa,</hi> his own, and Brother's Son, alledging, that if Lands were given them in the North, they might be as a Bulwark and Fence against the incursions of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> They therefore sayling as far as the <hi>Orcades,</hi> as some write, with five thousand Men, and all along curbing the insolencies of those Nations, at last seated themselves on that part of the Island which is now called <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Affairs stated in this posture, and the Island lying open at both ends to receive fresh supplies of <hi>Saxons, Hengist</hi> thought it now or never high time to strike for the whole Empire; he wanted not pretences for a quarrel, alledging first, that his Souldiers pay was run much in arrear, which being advanced to them, he then saies plainly, that their wages was not proportionable to their service, and requires an augmentation, otherwise threatens open War.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the <hi>British</hi> Councels pause what Answer to return to these sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, He who desired not so much to be satisfied in that point, as to gain occasion of quarrelling, immediately takes hold of their deliberating for a positive denial, and entring into League with the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> issuing out of <hi>Kent</hi> before any opposition could be made, he laies waste the whole Country as far as the Western Sea.</p>
                  <p>Now begun the <hi>Britains</hi> to feel the dismal effects of forreign Succours; they had not now their old Enemies alone to deal with, but a Nation far more experienced in War; and what was more Pagan and Barbarous, whole Towns and Colonies were overturned, not as in fair War, where the Conqueror is contented with confession of Victory, but as it were to the utter extirpating of the Inhabitants, desolation was heapt upon desolation, Temples and Palaces, Priest and People lay buried in the wide Ruines of their Country. And yet these heavy Judgments, to the shame be it spoken of a stupid and sinful Nation, were not more deplorable, saith <hi>Gildas,</hi> than justly deserved. As for <hi>Vortigern</hi> himself, he was so far from being wakened by these Calamities, that to the scandal of his Christian Profession he committed Incest with his own Daughter, a sin scarcely named among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for which being censured in a Councel by the advice of the Peers, he retired to a strong Castle which he had built in <hi>Radnorshire,</hi> leaving the management of Affairs to his Son <hi>Vortimer,</hi> whom for his active courage and vertuous behaviour the <hi>Britains</hi> generally chose for their Leader.</p>
                  <p>This Prince in all likelyhood, we may gather, had already given good proofs of his Conduct, in repulsing the <hi>Saxons</hi> during the Government of his Father; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Hengist</hi> at first had made a sudden inroad, and entred the Country as far as the western Coasts; yet we find that not long after, even in <hi>Vortigern's</hi> time, he was fought with in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Tanet,</hi> his old Possessions; and forced to dispute his ground upon the edge of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Annals</hi> of the <hi>Saxons</hi> write thus: <q>
                        <hi>Hengist</hi> and <hi>Horsa,</hi> in the year 455, fought against <hi>Vortigern</hi> at <hi>Eglesthrip</hi> now <hi>Aylsford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where <hi>Horsa</hi> was <note place="margin">Bede, Ethelwerd, Florent, Annal. Sax.</note> slain, leaving his name to <hi>Horsted,</hi> the place of his Burial.</q> But it seems in this Battel the <hi>Saxons</hi> had a clear Victory, though much allayed by the death of that Prince. For now <hi>Hengist,</hi> saith the same <hi>Annals,</hi> assumed the Title of King, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled <hi>Kent</hi> with <hi>Jutes,</hi> who about that time held the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and part of <hi>Hampshire</hi> adjoyning to it: here the <hi>Jutes</hi> are mistaken for <hi>Vites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two years after, <hi>Hengist</hi> and his Son at a place called <hi>Creganford,</hi> or <hi>Craford,</hi> slew four thousand of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and four of their chief Commanders, forcing the rest to quit <hi>Kent,</hi> and flie in great disorder to <hi>London:</hi> And although this blow seemed <note place="margin">Anno 465.</note> the total loss of that Country, yet eight years afterwards we find the <hi>Britains</hi> again pressing hard upon them, giving them Battel as far as the Isle of <hi>Tanet,</hi> at a place called <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Now</hi> Elfler, Camb.</note> 
                     <hi>Wippeds fleet;</hi> but success was not answerable to their Spirit, for though they fought it to the death of twelve of their Princes, yet the <hi>Saxons</hi> carried the day, losing <hi>Wepped</hi> only an Earl of theirs who left his Name to the field he fell in.</p>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:58825:244"/>
                  <p>Another Battel was fought, but the place not mentioned, wherein the <hi>Britains</hi> are said to be so totally routed, that flying in great confusion they left their whole Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to the spoil of their Enemies. These, and many other Skirmishes happened in the space of twenty years, saith <hi>Malmesbury;</hi> in which may be observed, that the <hi>Britains</hi> though worsted, according to these <hi>Saxon</hi> Relations, yet seem to have been alwaies the Aggressors, seeking out their Enemy rather than sought for, as appears from the places wherein they fought, being either in the heart of <hi>Kent,</hi> or further in the Isle of <hi>Tanet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These vigorous Attempts to redeem the liberty of a sinking Nation, though performed before the Resignation of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> yet seem to derive nothing from him saving the ill success alone; The life and spirit by which they were acted seemed to flow from <hi>Vortimer,</hi> the miscarrlages from that secret, but resistless influence which inseparably attends an Impotent Government. And the event proved accordingly, for instead of <hi>Vortigern,</hi> a lustful and giddy Prince, whom neither years, or the neglect of Subjects could make apprehensive, <hi>Vortimer</hi> being advanced to the Crown a, new scene of things immediately appeared. Thrice he drove the <hi>Saxons</hi> and besieged them in the Isle of <hi>Tanet,</hi> and though they were continually relieved with fresh supplies from the Continent, yet as often as they broke in he repulsed them with loss.</p>
                  <p>In four Battels, whereof three are named, he utterly defeated them; the first on the River <hi>Darwent,</hi> the second at <hi>Episford,</hi> where, <hi>Ninnius</hi> saith, <hi>Horsa</hi> was slain; and on <hi>Vortimer's</hi> side, his Brothern <hi>Catigern:</hi> The third in a field by <hi>Stonar,</hi> then called <hi>Lapis Tituli</hi> in <hi>Tanet,</hi> where he beat them into their Ships, glad to have so escaped, and not venturing to return for five years after; thus <hi>Ninnius.</hi> And indeed <hi>Gildas</hi> writes of the departure of the <hi>Saxons</hi> much about this time, during which space <hi>Vortimer</hi> dying poysoned, as some write, by the contrivance of <hi>Rowena,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded they should lay his Body in the Port of <hi>Stonar,</hi> perswaded that his Bones lying there, would be a sufficient terrour to his Enemies for ever landing in that place, imitating herein (if not the Author for him) the like conceit of <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> who would have his Tomb set against <hi>Africa,</hi> to fright the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> from so much as looking towards the <hi>Italian</hi> shores. <hi>The</hi> Britains, saith <hi>Ninnius,</hi> (who makes a serious business of it) <hi>neglecting his Orders, buried him at</hi> Lincoln.</p>
                  <p>The Son being dead, the Father is again restored to the Crown, whether by the interest and prevalency of his Party is uncertain, or upon promises of amendment, by Publick Election, there being none remaining of that Family since the death of his two Sons, <hi>Vortimer</hi> and <hi>Catigern,</hi> on whom to confirm the Royal dignity. It should seem that the <hi>British</hi> Nobility were too deeply engaged in the guilt of <hi>Vortigern's</hi> usurpation, for to think of restoring their lawful Prince; it usually happening in publick Rebellions generally countenanced, that they who are involved in the Treason, choose rather to hazard the lust and tyranny of an Usurper, than by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Error to rely on the mercy and clemency of the Injured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hengist</hi> advised of this sudden change of affairs in <hi>Britain,</hi> not to slip so favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an occasion of recovering his lost fortunes, with all speed raises new Forces and returns. But it seems the <hi>Britains,</hi> during his absence, as may be gathered, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged themselves on those he left behind him, and we read of many Skirmishes, and one set Battel fought between them, wherein the <hi>Saxons</hi> alwaies came by the worst. <hi>Hengist</hi> therefore at his landing, finding his affairs upon the Island in a lower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condition than he expected, and not so able to make open War, hath recourse to his old tricks of Treaty and Friendship; rid of his grand Opposer, he knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how to manage his Interest with <hi>Vortigern,</hi> whom he had obnoxious to him by ancient Leagues and long Affinity; Proposing therefore nothing but terms of Kindness and Amity, and pretending that former Breaches sprung from the Ambition of <hi>Vortimer</hi> and a Court-faction, he easily works with the King, especially instigated by his Wife, and not discouraged by his Peers, to give him a Personal treaty, not doubting but by such an Interview, all jealousies might be removed, differences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and a better understanding for the future settled between them. The place of meeting was appointed upon <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> whither both Parties were to repair unarmed. But <hi>Hengist</hi> who meant nothing less than Peace, and yet had plotted a general Massacre, commanded his Followers to carry privately under their Vestures a Ihort Dagger or Seax, acquainting them before hand with his designs.</p>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:58825:245"/>
                  <p>When the <hi>Britains</hi> were in the midst of their Cups, the <hi>Saxons</hi> cavilling at words, and picking small occasions of quarrel, provoking or provoked; at last at the watch-word given, <hi>Nienet cour Seares,</hi> at once drew their Daggers and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched three hundred of the Assembly. The King they kept in custody, for whose ransom <hi>Hengist</hi> received a confirmation of the Kingdom of <hi>Kent,</hi> and a new addition of three Provinces afterwards, called <hi>Essex, Sussex,</hi> and <hi>Middlesex. Vortigern</hi> set at liberty upon these terms, retires to his solitary abode in the County of <hi>Guorthigir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaun,</hi> so called by his name, thence to a Castle of his own building in <hi>North-Wales</hi> upon the River <hi>Tirby,</hi> where he perished at last by fire from heaven, as some write; others, by <hi>Ambrostus Aurelian,</hi> whose right he had usurped.</p>
                  <p>After this Massacre few or none being left in <hi>Britain,</hi> whose wisdom in Councel, or policy in War was able to do much for their Country, <hi>Hengist</hi> had the leasure to establish his new Dominions. And although we read of some few bickerings between him and the <hi>Britains</hi> afterwards, yet by the consequences we shall find that these last were alwaies the loosers, and the <hi>Saxons</hi> the only gainers. And now, about the year 477, <hi>Ella</hi> another <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince with his three Sons, <hi>Cymen, Pletig</hi> and <hi>Cissa,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">An. Dom. 477.</note> entered the Island at a place in <hi>Sussex</hi> called <hi>Cymenshore,</hi> and made great slaughter of the <hi>Britains;</hi> but of his actions, as being the founder of the Kingdom of the South-<hi>Saxons,</hi> there will be occasion to speak in that History. It is sufficient here to be hinted, that so fair a gap being laid open by <hi>Hengist,</hi> not long after, as if <hi>Britain</hi> was the field of Fortune, many other Princes out of <hi>Saxony</hi> and those parts came flocking into the Island, and soon after one another settled Seven distinct Kingdoms, leaving to the Poor <hi>Britains</hi> no more than what nature seemed to provide for them, namely, inaccessible Mountains, and Rocks scarcely passable, where defending themselves, and enjoying the use of their Religion, they sometimes to little purpose, as in the main appears, made sallies upon the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who not withstanding all resistance still more and more increased. Some of them fled over to their Brethren in <hi>Armorica,</hi> others into <hi>Holland,</hi> where yet remains the Ruines of <hi>Brittenburg</hi> not far from <hi>Leyden,</hi> to be seen at Low-water, either built, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Writers affirm, or seized by the <hi>Britains</hi> in their flight from <hi>Hengist.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hengist</hi> reigned thirty four years, and then, as <hi>Marianus Scotus</hi> reports, died ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably; but <hi>Peter de Ikam, Polydore</hi> and others, say, he was slain in Battel, or taken by <hi>Edol</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and beheaded at <hi>Conesborow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a Prince of the chief Blood of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> by birth of <hi>Angria</hi> in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia,</hi> and supposed Lord of that Territory, called at this day <hi>Hengster-holt.</hi> He is thus derived from the deified <hi>Woden; Hengist</hi> the Son of <hi>Wetgisse,</hi> the Son of <hi>Wecta,</hi> the Son of <hi>Woden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>When <hi>Hengist</hi> came first into <hi>Britain,</hi> he is said to have built <hi>Thong-Castle</hi> near <hi>Sydingborn</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> so called because he had begged as much ground of the King <note place="margin">Verstegan.</note> to build it on, as he could compass about with an Ox-hide; Here he feasted <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigern,</hi> and here the fair <hi>Rowena</hi> in broken language drunk to him that fatal <hi>Wassal,</hi> that for ever after like a strong, yet lingring poyson, stuck close to his side. Thus <hi>Hengist</hi> obtained the Kingdom by Craft as much as Courage, and established it in blood by Treachery; yet there are who excuse that Massacre of the <hi>British</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and lay it upon chance, not design, alledging, that in <hi>Saxony,</hi> not long before, there had been a meeting of <hi>Thuringers</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> where, if the <hi>Saxons</hi> suspecting fraud had not come privily armed, the <hi>Thuringers</hi> had dispatched them all, fearing the like Treachery from the <hi>Britains,</hi> they prepared for the worst in this Treaty; and in the midst of their Cups, as drink is quarrelsom, they were provoked beyond the measure Wine is able to bear.</q> 
                     <hi>Thus Verstegan.</hi>

                     <hi>OERIC</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Oisc,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hengiss,</hi> succeeded in the Kingdom; At <note place="margin">An Dom. 489.</note> the Battel of <hi>Creganford,</hi> or <hi>Craford,</hi> he gave signal proof of his Valour in assisting his Father in gaining that most remarkable Victory, not long before he had been taken prisoner by the <hi>Britains,</hi> and was held in custody at <hi>York,</hi> but by secret workings he made his escape, and came up to his Father before the fight began. Being seated in the Throne, like a wise Prince, he set himself to the establishing his Kingdom by good Laws, contracting his Dominions within the Province of <hi>Kent,</hi> as most tenable, and neglecting those Out-skirts of <hi>Essex, Sussex,</hi> and <hi>Middlesex,</hi> left him by <hi>Hengist,</hi> as not well bounded nor throughly subdued. <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> which touched him on the West, he gave up to the Conquest of <hi>Ella</hi> the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Middlesex</hi> on the North, he left free for <hi>Enchinwine,</hi> another <hi>Saxon</hi> Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer, to exercise his Valourin.</p>
                  <p>Thus whilst on all sides of his Kingdom the <hi>Britains</hi> were kept off by other hands, he had leasure to follow the Arts and Methods of Peace, like <hi>Numa,</hi> to settle the Kingdom left him by his warlike-Predecessor.

                  <p>We read that <hi>Hengist</hi> by leave of <hi>Vortigern</hi> had placed <hi>Octa</hi> and <hi>Ebissa</hi> in the North to keep off the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> from molesting the Southern borders they and their Successors settling there a kind of Principality, had held it for one hundred and eighty

years, yet as in subjection to <hi>Kent</hi> the elder Family, and owning its Protection though far distant; But <hi>Ida</hi> coming to govern in those parts about the year five hundred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty seven, in the daies of <hi>Ermiric,</hi> cast off all manner of obedience to that Crown, and assumed an Absolute Royalty to himself, which Indignity <hi>Ermeric,</hi> as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be guessed, resenting by making strong Alliances, intended to revenge, but being snatched away by untimely death, the quarrel was left intire to young <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> his Son, who partly instigated by this affront, whereby the honour of his Kingdom seemed to be lessened; and judging withal, that Superiority was due to him not only from that but other Kingdoms, from the priority of time wherein <hi>Kent</hi> was settled, taking up Arms began to invade his Neighbours, and by open claim to assert the Right of an universal Monarchy. But not well weighing the strength of his Neighbours, and measuring his own Power rather by the number of his Levies, than the goodness of his Men by long peace unaccustomed to War, he was misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly baffled by <hi>Keaulin</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> an old experienced Souldier, who with <hi>Cutha</hi> his Son leading an Army, trained up in Wars and well fledged with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories obtained against the <hi>Britains,</hi> twice defeated him, and at last drove him into his own Territories. The first place of Battel is not mentioned, that which seemeth to be the last was at <hi>Wiphandun,</hi> wherein two <hi>Kentish</hi> Earls, <hi>Oslave</hi> and <hi>Cnebban,</hi> lost their lives. And this is the first War the <hi>Saxons</hi> had among themselves since their entring the Island.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ethelbert</hi> taught by these defeats, that the success of War depends not on the eagerness of desire to conquer, but the steady management of the means, referred the repairing of his losses to a more convenient time, and the event proved accordingly; for being come to riper years, and <hi>Keaulin</hi> his grand Opposer removed by death, in a short time he stretched his Empire over the most considerable parts of the Island, all the Kingdoms on this side <hi>Humber</hi> either by force or composition being brought entire under his obedience; And he is worthily reckoned the sixth Monarch of the <hi>English</hi> men.</p>
                  <p>Thus grown great, he takes to wife <hi>Bertha</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Chilperick's</hi> Daughter, whom St. <hi>Gregory</hi> (as will appear in his Epistle writ to her) calls <hi>Adelberga,</hi> she was a Christian, and by Covenant of Marriage was to enjoy the exercise of her Religion; to that end she brought over with her <hi>Letard</hi> a Bishop, under whose care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, he daily exercised the Christian Profession. The King as yet, and all his People, continued in the worship of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Idolatry, and whether by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of <hi>Letard,</hi> who perhaps contented himself in the freedom of private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or that the King taken up in Wars had not the leasure to examine into their Faith, or lastly, that God in his infinite wisdom reserved the Conversion of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to other hands, certain it is, that neither the example of the Queen, nor the preaching of <hi>Letard,</hi> have left any tokens or Records of effects proportionable to such advantages, as might be expected from an open and sincere Profession. St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> in one of his Epistles following, highly taxes the negligence of the <hi>French</hi> Clergy in not taking care of the <hi>Saxons</hi> Cenversion; and <hi>Bede</hi> out of <hi>Gildas,</hi> laies it to the charge of the <hi>British;</hi> But in what capacity, as to Life and Manners they were in to perform so charitable an office, take out of <hi>Gildas</hi> himself, as it is most elegantly translated by Mr. <hi>Milton.</hi>

Yet, lest they should be thought things of no use in their eminent places, they have their nicities and trivial points to keep in awe the superstitious
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:58825:246"/>
Multitude: But in true saving knowledge leave them still as gross and stupid as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, bunglers at the Scripture, nay forbidding and silencing them that know, but in Worldly matters practiced Cunning jhisters; in that only art and symony Great Clerks and Masters, bearing their heads high, but their thoughts object and low. He taxes them also as gluttonous, incontinent, and daily drunkards: And what shouldst thou expect from these poor Laity?</hi> So he goes on, <hi>These beasts, all belly, shall these amend thee, who are themselves laborious in evil doings? shalt thou see with their eyes, who see right for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nothing but gain? leave them rather, as bids our Saviour, left ye fall both blindfold into the same perdition. Are all thus? Perhaps not all, or not so grossly. But what availed it</hi> Eli <hi>to be himself blameless, while he connived at others that were abominable? Who of them hath been envied for his better life? who of them hath hated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort with these, or withstood their entring the Ministery, or endeavoured zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously their casting out? Yet some of these perhaps by others are legended for great Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the state of the Church among the <hi>Britains,</hi> scarce likely to convert others, who were so much perverted among themselves; but whether or no they were in a condition among so much hostility to preach the Gospel of Peace, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing they had men well-meaning thereunto amongst them, in a thing so far distant is not easily determinable; Certain it is, that the Conqueror with less prejudice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Religion from any, than the persons conquered: And this might be the cause that notwithstanding the Christian Faith shone round about, yet the intire Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Saxons</hi> is owing to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which at that time was possessed by <hi>GREGORY,</hi> afterwards Sirnamed the Great; and for his upright behaviour in this and other like occasions, worthily Cannoniz'd for a Saint.</p>
                  <p>Now the first occasions of this great work, and the methods by which it proceeded, because it hath been of so high concern to our Nation, as which still bears influence among us, I shall not stick more particularly to relate out of faithful Historians, and Ancient Records yet extant.</p>
                  <p>The Original motives, which induced <hi>Gregory</hi> to this great undertaking, Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> thus relates, as he received it down by tradition.</p>
                  <q>The Report goeth, that on a certain day, when upon the coming of Merchants lately arrived, great store of Wares was brought together into the Market-place (at <hi>Rome</hi>) for to be sold, and many Chapinen flocked together for to buy, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> also himself among others came thither, and saw with other things, Boyes, set to sale, for Bodies fair and white, of Countenance sweet and amiable, having the Hair also of their head as lovely and beautiful, whom when he wistly beheld, he demanded (as they say) from what Country or Land they were brought? Answer was made, that they came out of the Isle of <hi>Britain,</hi> the People whereof were as well-favoured to see unto. Then he asked again, whether those Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were Christians, or enshared still with the Errors of Paganisin? To which it was answered, they were <hi>Painims,</hi> but he fetching a long deep sigh from his very heart root, Alas for pity, quoth he, that the foul Fiend and Father of Darkness should be Lord of so bright and lightsom faces, and that they who carried such grace in their Countenances, should be void of the inward Grace in their hearts and souls. Once again he desired to understand by what name their Nation was known? They made answer, that they were called <hi>Angli.</hi> And well may they be so named, quoth he, for <hi>Angel-like</hi> faces they have, and meet it is that such should be fellow-heirs with Angels in Heaven. But what is the name of that Province from whence these were brought? Answer was made, that the Inhabitants of the said Province were called <hi>DEIRI. Deiri,</hi> quoth he, they are indeed <hi>De irâ eruti,</hi> that is, delivered from anger and wrath, and called to the mercy of Christ. How call you the King of that Province, saith he? Answer was made, that his name was <hi>Aelle.</hi> Then he alluding to the name, said, that <hi>Allelu-jah</hi> should be sung in those Parts to the praise of GOD the Creator. Coming therefore to the Bishop of the <hi>Roman</hi> and Apostolical See (for himself as yet was not made Bishop) he intreated that some Ministers of the Word should be sent into the <hi>English</hi> Nation, by whose means it might be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Christ, and even himself was ready to undertake the performance of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:58825:247"/>
this work with the help of God, in case it would please the Apostolical Pope that it should be so.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BENEDICT,</hi> who then sate in the Chair of: <hi>Rome,</hi> readily heard and joyfully embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced so charitable a motion, and <hi>Gregory</hi> encouraged by the leave of that Pope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes the Journey himself; but he was not gone far, but the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, who for his holiness of Life, and sincerity of Doctrine, looked on him as their chiefest stay and comfort, by earnest supplications and passionate requests obtained his Revocation, who thus put by his so much desired enterprize, nevertheless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his ardent endeavors for this great work of Conversion, which he had means to perfect afterwards, when for his great Merit he was advanced to a higher capacity of acting; For after the death of <hi>BONIFACE,</hi> being chosen his Successor, he pitcht upon <hi>Augustine</hi> for his chief Instrument in this work, a Man of whose endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for such a Ministry he was sufficiently satisfied, as having, together with an Austere sanctity of life, the spirit and courage of an Apostle, and whom by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment he had nearly engaged to himself, having made him Provost of his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> thus qualified sets on for his Journey, but the Monks who were to attend him, and over whom he was created Abbot, whether by the disswasions of others who represented the danger of their Journey, or discouraged by their own Fears, draw off from the enterprize, and send back <hi>Augustine</hi> in the name of all, to desire <hi>Gregory</hi> to release them from a Mission which was likely to be not only dangerous, but ineffectual, as to a Nation fierce and barbarous, and a Language they understood not. And this is the occasion of the following Epistle, wherein <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> encourages them to proceed in the work of Conversion, which I have set down, and many others, because they shew the unwearied diligence, and vigilant care of that great Pastor, to remove all Obstacles that might hinder, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove all Advantages to help on so necessary and charitable an undertaking.</p>

                     <p>OUR Common Son the Bearer of these presents, when he brought <note place="margin">Lib. 7. Ep. 30.</note> the Letters from your Holiness, found me sick, and left me so, which was the occasion that in answer to the large fountain of your Beatitude so small streams have been made you in return. It was surely, the gift of Heaven, when I was so much indisposed in Body, to afford me the benefit of your Holiness's writings, which, by the information they gave me of the Doctrine of the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of Hereticks, and of the Unity of the Faithful, rejoyced me so exceedingly, that the extremity of my pain was in some measure allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the refreshing of my mind: And, indeed, we alwaies rejoyce with new joy at your good, but that you should act so perfectly we think it not new at all; for that the number of the Holy Church increases, that spiritual Corn for the Heavenly Barn is multiplied, we never doubted the grace of Almighty God which so largely flows upon your Holiness. We therefore give Almighty God thanks, because we see that fulfilled in you which is written: Where is much Corn, there is manifest the strength of the Oxen; for if a strong Ox had not drawn the plough of the tongue over the land of the heart of the Hearers, so great an Harvest of the Faithful had never sprung up. But because from the good you do, there ariseth something which enforces you to communicate your joy to others, we also this way will repay your courtesie, and tell you of things not altogether different from those you have related. The <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:58825:250"/>
placed in an obscure corner of the World, has hitherto been wholly taken up in the adoration of Wood and Stones, but by the advice and light I received from your Epistle, I have taken care to send thither (as I ought) a Monk of our Monastery set apart for preaching to that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who having before License from me, is made Bishop by the Bishops of <hi>Germany,</hi> with whose prayers and fatherly consolations he is gone to the aforesaid Nation placed at the end of the World. And there came unto us lately Letters concerning his welfare and proceedings, who either he himself, or those that were sent over with him are grown so famous in that Nation, for the great wonders they have wrought, that they seem to equal the vertues of the Apostles in the Miracles they have performed. At the solemnity of the birth of our LORD, which was celebrated at this first Indiction, above 10000 <hi>English</hi> are reported to have been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by this our Brother and Fellow Bishop; all which I have related to this purpose, that you might know vvhat you do by your speaking amongst the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> and vvhat by your prayers in the uttermost parts of the World; your prayers are in that place where you are not, whose holy operations and effects are shewn in that place where you are.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, concerning the Person of <hi>Eudoxius</hi> the heretick, of whose Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror I can find nothing in the <hi>Latin</hi> tongue, I rejoyce that I am sufficiently satisfied by your Holiness, for you brought against him the judgments of the ablest Men, <hi>Basil, Gregory, Epiphanius,</hi> so that we must needs conclude him killed, against whom so many Champions have cast their Darts.</p>
                     <p>Concerning those Errors which are grown up in the Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> you have learnedly considered all things, and as became the Judgment of so great a Cheyer; wherefore we render Almighty God thanks, because the Tables of the Testament are yet in the Ark of God; For what is the Heart of the Priest, but the Ark of the Testament? in which (because spiritual Doctrine abounds) without doubt, the Tables of the Law lie. Your Holiness also endeavoured to shew, that you don't now write high Titles to any one, which proceed from the root of vanity, and yet in different Character you speak to me thus, <hi>As ye Commanded,</hi> which word of Command I desire you would for ever take from my hearing since I know who I am, and who ye are; by your place yee are Brothers to me, by your gravity Fathers, therefore I did not command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but carefully intimated what I thought profitable, yet I find that your Holiness would not perfectly retain what I hinted to your Memory. For I said that ye ought not to write thus to me, or any body else, and yet in the very Preface of your Epistle directed to me who forbad it, you have taken care to inscribe to me <hi>UNIVERSAL BISHOP,</hi> a Title of too proud a signification, which I beg your good Holiness would do no more;
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:58825:251"/>
For from you is taken whatever beyond reason is given to another, for I don't desire to be honoured by words but by actions, neither do I think it honour, where I know my Brethren lose their Honour; for my Honour is the same honour of the whole Church, my Honour is the full vigor of my Brethren; then therefore I am truly honoured, when no body is denied the honour due to him. For if your Holiness calls me <hi>Universal Bishop,</hi> it denies it self, to be at all, what it confesses me to be only, that is, <hi>Universal;</hi> but God forbid this. Away with those words stir up Pride and wound charity, and, indeed, your Holiness well knows that this Title was offered my Predecessor in the holy Counsel of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> and afterwards by succeeding Fathers, but none of them would ever accept of this Title, that whilst carefully in this World they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected the honour of all the Clergy in general, they might preserve their own entire with God Almighty. Wherefore (paying you due custome of Greeting) I desire you would be pleased to be mindful of us in your Prayers, that from the chains of my sins, because of mine own merits I am not able, through your intercession God would deliver me.</p>

Who is able to relate how great the joy is that is arose in the hearts of the Faithful, that, through the Grace of Almighty God cooperating, and your Brotherhood labouring, the darkness of Errors being driven away, the <hi>English</hi> Nation is covered over with the glorious light of holy Faith, that now out of a sincere mind and pious devotion it tramples on those Idols to which before it madly croucht to, that it prostrates it self before God with a pure heart, that it is restrained from relapsing into sin by the rules and instructions
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:58825:252"/>
of holy Preaching, that it submits in mind to the Divine precepts, but raised in understanding humbles it self in prayer on the ground, lest in affections it should grovel in the earth? Whose working is this, but His that saies, <hi>My Father hitherto works, and I work?</hi> Who, that he might make it manifest to the World, that he converts not by the wisdom of Men, but by his own vertue and power, The Preachers whom he sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World he made choice of without learning, using the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod here also, for in the <hi>English</hi> Nation he has wrought mighty things by the hands of weak Persons.</p>
                     <p>But there is, my Dearest Brother, something in this celestial gift, which you ought extremely both to fear and rejoyce at. † I know that Almighty God has shewn great Miracles by you in the Nation he would should be chosen, from whence it is necessary, that concerning the same heavenly gift, you with fear rejoyce, and with joy be afraid. You may rejoyce that the Souls of the <hi>English</hi> through outward Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are drawn to an inward grace; you ought to be afraid lest among the Miracles that are wrought your frail mind be puffed up too much by presumption and self-confidence, so that outwardly raised in honour, it inwardly falls through such vainglory. Moreover, we ought to remember, that when the Disciples returning from preaching with joy said to their Heavenly Master, <hi>Lord, in thy name Devils are subject unto us,</hi> they presently heard, <hi>Rejoyce not for this, but rather rejoyce that your names are written in Heaven.</hi> They had placed their mind in a temporal and private joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they rejoyced in Miracles; but they are streight recalled from a private to a publick, from a temporal to an eternal joy, to whom it is said, In this rejoyce because your Names are written in Heaven: For all the Elect don't work Miracles, but the Names of them all are registred in Heaven; to the Disciples of truth there ought to be no joy, unless in that good which they have common with all, and in which they have no end of their joy.</p>
                     <p>It remains therefore (My Dear Brother) that among those things which with the help of God you outwardly perform, you alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly strictly judge your self, and particularly examine your self, who you are, and how great Grace there may be in that Nation for whose Conversion you have received the gift of performing Miracles; and if ever you remember that you have offended our Creator either by word or deed, alwaies bear it in mind, that the remembrance of the guilt may suppress the rising glory of the heart; and what power soever of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles you shall receive, or have received, alwaies think it given, not for your sake, but for those for whose salvation 'twas conferred upon you. †</p>

                     <p>There comes into my mind, thinking of these things, what became of one Servant of God even extraordinarily elected. Certainly <hi>Moses,</hi> whilst he brought the People of God out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> wrought wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miracles (as your Brotherhood knows) in the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> after he had fasted fourty daies and nights, he received the Tables of the Law amongst dreadful Thunderings, all the People being afraid. In the service of Almighty God he alone enjoyed a familiar conference with Him, the Red-Sea he divided, in his Journey his guide was a Pillar of Cloud; When the People were hungry he gave them Manna from heaven, he miraculously gave them Flesh, when they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the Wilderness till they were cloyed; but when in the time of Thirst they came to the Rock, he mistrusted, and doubted whether he could bring water from it, which, the Lord commanding, he struck and opened a passage for the running water. How great Miracles after this did he persorm in the Wilderness for the space of thirty eight years? who can reckon them? who can trace them? as often as he doubted of any thing, having recourse to the Tabernacle, he secretly inquired of the Lord, and was presently informed by the word of the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that thing. By the interposition of his prayers he appeased the Anger of the Lord towards his people, when they were puffed up with pride, or rebelled against him. He caused the earth to open and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them up, he foyled the Enemy with victories, and shewed signs to his own People; but when they came to the land of Promise, he was called into the Mountain, and heard of his fault that he had committed thirty eight years before, because he despaired of bringing out water, and he acknowledged, that for this thing he could not enter into the land of Promise; wherefore we ought to consider, what a dreadful thing the judgment of Almighty God is, who had done so many signal Wonders by this his Servant, and yet kept his fault committed so long ago still in remembrance. Therefore (most Dearest Brother) if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him dead after so many Miracles for his fault, whom we know to have been in a more especial manner elected by God Almighty, with how great fear ought we to tremble, who know not whether as yet we are elected?</p>
                     <p>What should I speak of the Miracles of Reprobates, since your Brotherhood knows very well vvhat Truth it felf hath said in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? <hi>Many shall come in that day, saying unto me, Lord, in thy name we have Prophesied, and in thy name we have cast out Devils, and in thy name we have done wonders. But I will say unto them, I know ye not, depart from me all you workers of Iniquity.</hi> Therefore the mind is very much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and kept under amongst Signs and Miracles, lest in those things

it should seek its own glory, and rejoyce in the joy of self exaltation. In Miracles we ought to have respect to the gain of Souls, and to his glory by whose power those Miracles are wrought; but our Lord has given us one sign concerning which we ought extremely to rejoyce, and by which we may acknowledge the glory of Election in us, <hi>By this it shall be known whether you are my Disoiples, if you love one another;</hi> which sign the Prophet desired, when he said, <hi>Grant some token unto me, O Lord, for good, that they that hate me may see and be confounded.</hi> I speak these things that my Hearer's mind might be laid prostrate in humility; but let this your humility have its confidence too, for I a Sinner have most certain hope that your sins are forgiven, through the grace of our Omnipotent Creator, and God our Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ. And to this end you were Elected, that others sins might be forgiven through you; Neither shall you hereafter find sorrow for any guilt, because you endeavour to make joy in Heaven by the conversion of so many; the same our Creator and Redeemer, when he speaks of the repentance of Man, saies, I say thus unto you, There shall be greater joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repents, than over ninety nine Just persons that need no repentanca. Now, if over one Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent there is made great joy in Heaven what great rejoyceing do we think there was at the conversion of such a number of People from their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who coming to the faith by repentance has condemned the evil it had done? Amidst therefore the joy of Heaven and the Angels, let us repeat those words of the Angels which we said before; let us say therefore, <hi>Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi>

For as by <hi>Helen</hi> of Blessed memory, the Mother of the most pious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Constantine,</hi> he inflamed the hearts of the <hi>Romans</hi> towards the Christian Faith: So in regard of the frequent Zeal of your Majesty, we hope his mercy will effectually work upon the <hi>English</hi> Nation. And, indeed, you ought also long since by your good prudence, which is purely Christian, to have inclined the mind of our most glorious Son your Husband, that, for the good of his Kingdom, and of his own Soul, he should follow that Faith which you profess; forasmuch as by him and through him, in the Conversion of the whole Nation, a reward worthy of you would spring up in the joyes of heaven. Since (as we have said) your Highness hath been confirmed in the right Faith, and taught the Scriptures, this thing ought not to have been difficult or tedious to you. And because by God's appointment a fit time is now offered, strive (the Divine grace assisting you) to repair with gain what has hitherto been neglected, therefore by daily exhortations strengthen the mind of your most Glorious Husband in the love of the Christian Faith. Let your care and example increase in him a love towards God, and let it so stir up his mind, especially for a through Conversion of the whole Nation under yee, that from the servency of his devotion yee may offer up to Almighty God an acceptable sacrifice, that those things which are reported of you may increase, and in all respects be found true concerning you. Your excellent vertues are not only known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who more particularly pray for your life, but also in divers places, even as far as <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to the most excellent Emperour, that as we have joy in the consolation of your Christianity, so also in the Heavens the Angels may rejoyce at your further perfection. So therefore with all diligence and devotion, apply your selves to the assistance of our above-named Reverend Brother and Fellow Bishop, and of the rest of the Servants of God, whom we sent thither for the conversion of of your Nation, that with our Most glorious Son, and your Husband, you may reign with happiness here, and after a long time of years, attain to the endless joyes of the life to come. We beseech Almighty God, that he would inflame the heart of your Majesty with the fire of his Grace, to a performance of these things we have spoken of, and of his good pleasure grant you the fruit of an eternal Reward.</p>

                        <p>It may be doubted what Queen of <hi>England</hi> this <hi>Adilberga</hi> was, for the Wife of King <hi>Edilbert</hi> was called <hi>Bertha,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> affirms, <hi>lib. 1. cap.</hi> 25. but I think them both the same; but as it commonly happens, strange words are ill rendred by Forreigners, as hero <hi>Bdrga</hi> for <hi>Bertha,</hi> for <hi>Ald</hi> and <hi>Aldi</hi> are sometimes corruptly added in proper names for <hi>Edil</hi> and <hi>Athel,</hi> signlfying in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language, Noble or Honourable, which may be seen in the Title of the following Epistle, where <hi>Gregory</hi> calls the King <hi>Aldibert,</hi> whom <hi>Bede</hi> every where calls <hi>Edilberth,</hi> others for the most part, <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, Ald</hi> also, because it properly signifies <hi>Old,</hi> may by Translation denote Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and may seem to be added to the name of <hi>Berga</hi> or <hi>Bertha</hi> as an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Attribute, so that <hi>Aldi-berga,</hi> signifies the same with Noble and Honourable <hi>Berga</hi> or <hi>Bertha.</hi>

                     <p>FOR this reason Almighty God commonly advances the best Men <note place="margin">Regist. lib. 9. Epist. 60.</note> to the government of Nations, that by them the gifts of his Grace might be dispersed among all those whom they are set over, which thing we know has been done in the <hi>English</hi> Nation, over which Your Majesty was therefore made chief, that by the good qualities that are given you, You might the better convey those Heavenly comforts to the Nation under your subjection; And therefore, Most Renowned Son, carefully preserve that Grace which you have received by the especial providence of God, make haste to propagate the Christian Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your Subjects, increase the servency of your own Faith in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering their Convension. Destroy the worship of Idols, raze their Temples, establish the Manners of your Subjects in the great Purity of good living by exhorting, terrifying, encouraging, correcting, and by showing the Examples of Good works, that you may find him your Rewarder in Heaven, whose name and knowledg you shall extend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, for he shall make your Name more glorious to Posterity, whose Honour you endeavour to advance and preserve in your Nation. So formerly, <hi>Constantine</hi> a most Pious Emperour, freeing the <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth from the preverse worship of Idols, submitted himself, and It to our Almighty LORD Jesus Christ, and applied himself and his Subjects with his whole mind unto GOD, from whence it came to pass, that he transcended his Predecessours as much in Fame, as he exceeded them in good works. And now therefore let your Majesty make all possible haste to disperse the knowledg of one GOD, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to Kings and their Subjects, that you may in commendation and merit pass the Ancient Kings of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, And by how much you endeavour to wipe away the sins of others,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:58825:255"/>
by so much you may rest more secure of your own offences before the dreadful examination of Almighty God.</p>
                     <p>Our most Reverend Brother <hi>Augustine,</hi> Bishop, well taught in the rules of Monastick life, filled with the knowledg of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and endued (through God's grace) with good works, whatsoever he shall advise you, willingly hear, devoutly perform, and carefully lay up in your memory, because if you shall hear him in that which he speaks for God Almighty, the same Almighty God will the sooner hear him intreating for you; But if, which God forbid, you should neglect his words, when do you think Almighty God will hear him for you, whom you neglected to hear for God? With all your mind therefore, joyn your self with him in the fervency of Faith, and assist him, relying on that power which God has given you, that he may make you partakers of his Kingdom, whose Faith you have received and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to preserve in your Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore we would that your Majesty should understand, that as we know in Sacred Writ, out of the words of our Almighty Lord, that the end of this present World is at hand, and that the Kingdom of the Saints shall come, of which there shall be no end. But the end of the World drawing near, many things shall happen which before were not, <hi>viz.</hi> alterations of the Air, terrours from Heaven, and contrary to the course of Seasons, Tempest, Wars, Famine, Pestilences, Earth-quakes in divers places, all which shall not come to pass in our daies, but all of them shall certainly follow our daies. If therefore you shall find any of these things happen in your Land, let your mind in no sort be disturbed because these signs concerning the end of the World are therefore sent before, that we should be careful of our Souls, mistrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the hour of death, that we may be found in good works pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Judg at his coming.</p>
                     <p>These things I have spoken to you in short, Most Excellent Son, that when the Christian Faith shall be increased in your Kingdom, my discourse also may be inlarged towards you; then 'twill be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to speak more, when the joyes for the perfect conversion of the whole Nation shall be multiplied in your breast. We have sent you also some small Presents, which will not be small unto you, when you shall receive them from us with the benediction of the blessed Apostle <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Almighty God preserve and perfect in you that Grace he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and extend your life to the course of many years, and after long time receive you into the Congregation of his Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

Let holy water be provided and sprinkled about those Temples, let Altars be built and Reliques kept in them; For if those Churches
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:58825:256"/>
are Elegantly built, it is necessary they should be taken from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Devils, and appropriated to the service of the true God, that whilst the people see their Churches are not destroyed, they may put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Errors from their hearts, and knowing and worshipping the True God, may more familiarly resort to those places they were wont to frequent. And because many Oxen were wont to be slain in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Devils, some other solemnity ought to be introduced instead of it, that on the day of Dedication, or Birth-day of the Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, whose Reliques are there laid up, let them make Arbors to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Branches of Trees about those Churches that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Temples, and let them celebrate the solemnity with Religious Banquets; Neither let them any longer sacrifice Beasts to the Devil, but to the praise of God let them kill those Creatures for their own eating, and in their fulness give thankes to the Giver of all things, that whilst there are left them some inward tokens of Rejoycing, they may the easier be brought to the inward Joyes of the Spirit. For to wean ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate minds from all things on a sudden, without doubt is impossible. He that endeavours to climb on high, it is necessary he should rise by degrees and paces, not by leaps; so the Lord made himself known to the children os. <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the customary Sacrifices which they were wont to offer to the Devil, he reserved in his own worship, that, by his command, they should offer living creatures in his sacrifice; Forasmuch as their hearts being changed, they lost somethings of the sacrifice, and retained others, so that although they were the same creatures they were wont to offer, nevertheless offering them to God and not to Idols, they were not the same Sacrifices. These things I would have your charity to declare to our aforesaid Brother, that he, for the present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed there, may consider how all things ought to be ordered.

                  <p>IT would be needless to use many words concerning this <hi>Augustine;</hi> his Life and Actions, after he was sent by <hi>GREGORY</hi> to convert the <hi>English,</hi> plainly appear in the following discourse; But what, and who he was before, little concerns us. He was a <hi>Roman,</hi> I think, by Birth, and a Monk of the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine</hi> Order, and was afterwards made Provost of St. <hi>Gregory's</hi> Monastery at <hi>Rome,</hi> as you may understand from the Epistle of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> himself to <hi>Syagrius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Augustodunum;</hi> Called forth from thence by <hi>Gregory,</hi> he is sent into <hi>Britain</hi> with sourty Monks his Companions, and others of the Clergy (over whom he made him Abbot) in the year of our Lord 596, and in the year 597 arriving in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> he converted to the Faith <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the greatest part of his People, whom, on the day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> he Baptized in the Church of St. <hi>Martin</hi> at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which had continued from the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> till then; The same year afterwards he went to <hi>Arles,</hi> where he was by <hi>Etherius</hi> Arch-Bishop of that City, who was so commanded by <hi>Gregory,</hi> ordained the Arch-Bishop of the <hi>English</hi> the sixteenth of the Kalends of <hi>December</hi> in the City of <hi>Arles;</hi> Returning to <hi>Fng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he was received by both King and People with all imaginable Joy and soleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity besttting his Quality, and had the Royal City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> bestowed upon him by the King for an Episcopal See, and the Kings Palace for a Cathedral Church to be erected unto Christ; so that the King seemed to imitate what is reported to have been done by the Emperour, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great; Being ordained Bishop, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted St. <hi>Gregory</hi> by Messengers and Questions, of the form of Government to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on the Church he had lately established amongst the <hi>English</hi> Saxons; The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers he received we will set down a little below. Soon after he was honoured by the same <hi>Gregory</hi> with the Pall (by which the fulness of Power is signisted) in the year, <hi>viz.</hi> of Christ, 601. Being then Metropolitan of <hi>Britain,</hi> he summons a Councel in the borders of <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> that he might be something nigher the <hi>British</hi> Clergy and Bishops, at that time residing in <hi>Wales,</hi> to which he warned them to appear; the place of Session appointed was <hi>Augustine's Ac,</hi> that is, <hi>Augustine's Oaks,</hi> where being assembled, <hi>Augustine</hi> demands from them Obedience to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Reception of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ceremonies into the <hi>British</hi> Church. The <hi>Britains</hi> stiffly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed this, and after the business had been a long time controverted on both sides,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:58825:257"/>
another Synod or Session was agreed on, where a greater number of the <hi>British</hi> Clergy were present; amongst them seven Bishops. The old Controversie is again renewed, but when <hi>Augustine</hi> found that he was likely to gain no further he desired they would but conform to him and the <hi>Romans</hi> in three things only:
<list>
                        <item>1. In the observation of Easter.</item>
                        <item>2. In the administration of Baptism.</item>
                        <item>3. In assisting him with their preaching to the <hi>English Saxons.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But they suspecting the pride of <hi>Augustine</hi> would not bondescend to him in these things neither. Lamentable was the event of this Assembly, which shall be related when we come in order to the place; for the <hi>British</hi> Church differed in many things from the <hi>Roman,</hi> as appears out of <hi>Gildar</hi> and <hi>Bede,</hi> and this following discourse.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Manners of <hi>Augustine</hi> I shall determine nothing, he is blamed by our Age, and extolled by Antiquity. They report him to have been learned, pious, and an Imitator of Primitive holiness, the Apostle of the <hi>English,</hi> often in watchings, fastings, prayers, and alms zealous in propagating the Church of his Age, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and earnest in rooting out Paganism. The first Introducer of <hi>Roman</hi> Monks, and other Rites and Ceremonles, in repairing and building Churches diligent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and for working Miracles extraordinary famous. From hence, by reason of humane frailty his mind perhaps grew more lofty and proud, which thing St. <hi>Gregory</hi> himself seemed to take notice of, who admonished him by an Epistle, that he should not be puffed up with the greatness of his Miracles. He is ill spoken of for the Massacre of the Priest of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and not without a cause, if (as is reported) he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited King <hi>Edilfrid</hi> to that horrid slaughter.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the time when he died the opinions of Authors are many, so that which to fix on is uncertain; <hi>Stow,</hi> makes it the 29 of <hi>May,</hi> in the year of Grace 603; <hi>Bede</hi> in the year 604; <hi>Augustine</hi> himself in his <hi>Leaden Bull,</hi> if it be truly his, cites a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> dated the year of our Lord 605, from which 'tis manifest that he was then living; <hi>Thomas Sprot</hi> relates, that he held a Councel at <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the year 605; <hi>Matthew  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>AUgustine</hi> being strengthned by the encouragement of Blessed Father <hi>Gregory,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with the rest of the Servants of Christ that were with him to the work of the Word, and comes into <hi>Britain; Edilberth</hi> at that time was the most powerful King of <hi>Kent,</hi> who had extended the bounds of his Empire to the Banks of the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Humber,</hi> by which the Southern and Northern people of <hi>England</hi> are separated. There is towards the Eastern part of <hi>Kent</hi> the Isle of <hi>Tanet,</hi> of indifferent bigness, the compass of it, according to the usual computation of the <hi>English,</hi> is six hundred Families, which the River <hi>Vantsum</hi> parts from the Continent; in breadth about three surlongs, and in two places omy fordable, for it runs its head both waies into the Sea. Here landed <hi>Augustine</hi> the Servant of the Lord with his Companions, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported about fourty in number, they had taken along with them Interpreters of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, as Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> had commanded them. Being arrived, he sends to <hi>Edilberth,</hi> giving him to understand that he came from <hi>Rome,</hi> and had brought good tidings, with the proffets of Eternal happiness to them that would receive them, and an Everlasting kingdom after this life with the true and living God. The King hearing this, commanded that they should tarry in the Island they had landed in, and that all necessaries should be afforded them, till he had determined what to do with them; for he had heard of the Christian Religion before, having married a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Wise of the Royal Family of the <hi>French,</hi> by name <hi>Bertha,</hi> whom he had received from her Parents on this condition, that she should have free exercise of Religion, and liberty to have a Bishop, by name <hi>Luidhard,</hi> whom they had given her as an assistant and strengthner of her faith.</p>
                  <p>The King after some daies past came to the Island, and sitting down in the open Air, commanded that <hi>Augustine</hi> and his Companions should be brought into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence thither; for he feared to admit them into any House, being perswaded by his old Superstition, that if they brought with them any Charms or Incantations, they could not so easily work upon him. But they armed with the power of God, and not the Devil, bearing a Silver cross before them for their Banner, and the Image of our Lord and Saviour painted on a Table, and singing Litanies, prayed unto the Lord for the eternal salvation of themselves, and of those for whose sakes and to whom they were come. But when with the Kings leave, sitting down, they had preached the Word of life to him and to all his Nobles that were with him, the King made Answer,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:58825:258"/>
saying, <hi>The words and promises which Ye have made are indeed fair; but unto which, as being new and uncertain, I cannot suddenly yield my assent; laying aside the Religion I have so long maintained with all the</hi> English <hi>Nation. But because ye are strangers, and come a great way, and, as it seems to me, would impart to us the knowledge of things you believe the truest and best, we will not in the least give you any molestation, but rather courteously receive you, and take care that all things necessary shall be provided for your maintenance, neither do we prohibit, but that ye may gain all ye can to the Faith of your Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And accordingly he alotted them their residence in the City of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (which was the Metropolis of all his Kingdom) neither did he abridge them of the freedom of meeting, of preaching, or neglect their temporal provision. It is reported, that when they came nigh to the City, after their manner with the holy Cross, and the Image of the great King our Lord Jesus Christ, with an agreeable-voice they sang this Litany. <hi>We pray thee, O Lord, in thy mercy, that thy sury may be turned away, and thy Anger from this City, and thy holy House, because we have sinned.</hi> Allelujah.</p>
                  <p>But when they came to the Dwellings provided for them, they began to imitate the Apostolical life of the Primitive Church, by applying themselves to continual prayers, watchings, and fastings, to the preaching the Word of God to all that would hear them, by despising all things of this World as superfluous, and receiving only those things that were necessary for those they taught for their sustenance, living ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the Rules they taught others, having a mind ready to suffer any Adversity, even to die for the truth that they preached. The success of which was, some believed and were baptized, admiting the simplicity of their innocent lives, and the sweetness of their heavenly doctrine.</p>
                  <p>There was near this City towards the East a Church anciently built in honour of St. <hi>Martyn,</hi> whilst the <hi>Romans</hi> inhabited <hi>Britain,</hi> in which the Queen, whom above we declared to have been a Christian, was wont to pray. In this therefore first they begun to assemble, sing, pray, perform Mass; preach and baptize, until the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted to the Faith, they obtained a greater liberty of Preaching every where, and of building and repairing Churches. But when he among the rest, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the pure life of these Saints, and their sweet Promises, the truth of which they confirmed by shewing many Miracles, believing was baptized; many flocked in from all parts to hear the word, and leaving the Rites of Heathenism, joyned themselves to the unity of the holy Church of Christ; at whose Faith and Conversion the King is reported so far to have congratulated, as nevertheless not compels any to receive Christianity, only those that believed he embraced with a nearer affection, as fellow-Citizens with him of the heavenly Kingdom; For he had learnt from the Teachers and Authors of his salvation, that the service of Christ ought to be voluntary, not constrained, neither did he deser long, but gave his Teachers places befitting their Degrees in his Metropolis of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them Possessions necessary in several kinds, in the year of Christ 601.</p>

                  <p>IN the mean while <hi>Augustine</hi> the Man of God came to <hi>Arles,</hi> and by <hi>Etherius</hi> Archbishop of the same City (according to the Commands he received from the holy Father <hi>Gregory</hi>) was ordained Archbishop of the <hi>English.</hi> Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore into <hi>Britain,</hi> he sent immediately to <hi>Rome, Lawrence</hi> the Priest and <hi>Peter</hi> the Monk, to certifie Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> that the Christian Faith was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>English,</hi> and that he himself was made Bishop; desiring also his opinion in certain Questions he thought necessary to be resolved in, to all which he speedily received Answers proper to the Questions proposed, which we thought fit here to insert into our History.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>How Bishops ought to act in the Church, the Holy Scripture witnesses, which you understand very well no doubt, and especially the Epistles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in which he endeavors to teach him, how he ought to behave himself in the House of God. And it was ever the custome of the Apostolick See, to deliver Instructions to Bishops that were ordained; that out of every thing that came to the Altar there ought to be made four divisions, <hi>viz.</hi> One for the Bishop and his family, for hospitality and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments the second for the Clergy, the third for the Poor, and the fourth for repairing Churches: But because your Brotherhood is well skilled in the Orders of a Monastery, you know nothing ought to be possest by the Clergy apart in your <hi>English</hi> Church, which lately by God's grace is brought to the Faith; it ought to imitate the Conversion which was used by our Fathers in the beginning of the Church, among whom, none said any thing was his of those things he possessed, but all things were in common among them.</p>

                  <p>This Question <hi>Bede</hi> hath not, but joyne the following Answer to the first Question; Sr. Hen. Spelman  hath added in out of the Bath Edition, An. 1518.</p>
                  <p>The Answer of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be any of the Clergy out of holy Orders that cannot contain they ought to provide themselves Wives and to receive their stipends from without, because concerning those portions which we have spoken of before, we know 'tis written, that <hi>'twas divided to every one, as every one had need,</hi> And, indeed, there ought some consideration and care to be had of their Stipends, that they may be kept under Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Rules, that they shew good Manners in their lives, that they may be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in singing Psalms, and that they keep, by God's assistance, their hearts, tongues and bodies pure from all unlawful things. What necessity is there of making a long discourse of dividing Portions, of shewing Hospitality, and of doing Mercy to those that live a Common life when all that is  overplus is to be bestowed upon Pious and Religious uses? the Lord our Master teaching us all what remains, <hi>bestow in Alms, and hold all things are clean unto you, Luke the 11th.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Question of <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since there is but one Faith, why are there divers customes of Churches? One custome of Mass in the holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and another in those of <hi>Gaul?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Brotherhood knows the Custome of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in which you may remember you were bred; but it is my pleasure, that if you can find either in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or those of <hi>Gaul,</hi> or in any other Church any thing more pleasing to God, carefully choose it, and what things soever you can gather from many Churches of honest Institution, introduce them into the <hi>English</hi> Church, which as yet is young in the Faith; for things are not to be beloved for the places, but places for the good things in them. Out of every Church therefore choose what is Pious, Religious, and Right, and gather them together, as it were in a bundle, and by practice infuse them into the minds of the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Question of <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I beseech you, what punishment ought to be inflicted on him that commits Sacriledge?</p>
                  <p>The Answer of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This your Brotherhood may understand from the person of the Thief, how he ought to be corrected; for there are some that have found ways to commit thest, and there are others that offend in this nature out of necessity; From whence it follows, that, some are to be punished with fines, others with stripes, some more severely, others more gentily; and when you proceed against any with more rigour than ordinary, you must do it out of charity, not fury; because 'tis done to him that is punished with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that he might not be committed to Holl fire. For we ought to instruct the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful so, as good Fathers are wont their carnal Children, whom, for their faults, they whip, and yet they desire that those whom they thus afflict should be their heirs, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully keep for them whatsoever they possess, whom angrily they thus seem to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Alwales therefore keep in your mind this charity which suggests a mean in chastizing, so that the mind can do nothing without the rule of Reason. Perhaps you way ask, How these things that are taken by stealth from the Church may be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? but God forbid that the Church should receive with increase for the loss of Earthly things, or go about to make advantage of vain trifles,</p>

                  <p>The Answer of <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is certainly lawful, for we find nothing in inholy Writ that seems to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this point in the least.</p>

                     <hi>To what degree the Faithful may marry with their kindred? and,</hi>

                     <hi>whether it be lawful for Stepmothers and their kindred in Law to be joyned in wedlock &amp;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gregory's <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A certain Secular law in the <hi>Roman</hi> Common wealth permits, that whether Brother and Sister, or the son and daughter of two own Brothers, or two own Sisters may mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but we haue learnt by experience, that from such kind of Marriages no issue can be produced, and holy Writ forbids the uncovering of the Nakedness of our near kindred, from whence it follows, that the third and fourth generation of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful may lawfully marry. To be joyned in marriage with ones Mother-in-law is a great sin, for 'tis written in the Law, <hi>Thou shalt not uncover thy Father's nakedness,</hi> neither indeed may a Son discover the nakedness of his Father; but because 'tis written, <hi>they shall be two in one flesh,</hi> he that shall presume to uncover the nakedness of his Stepmother, which was one flesh with his Father, hath certainly uncovered his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's nakedness.</p>
                  <p>'Tis forbidden also to marry a near Relation-in-law, because by the former it was made as the flesh of the Brother, for which thing <hi>John the Baptist</hi> was beheaded, and ended his life in holy Martyrdom, on whom it was not imposed to deny Christ, and yet he was slain for confessing Christ; but because our Lord Jesus Christ had said, <hi>I am the Truth,</hi> and because <hi>John</hi> was killed for the truth, he poured out his blood for Christ.</p>
                  <p>The seventh Interrogation of <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I desire to know, whether a Divorce may be issued out against those that are married unlawfully? and, whether they may be denied the benefit of the Communion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Answer of</hi> Gregory.</p>
                  <p>Because there are many in <hi>England</hi> which still remain in Infidelity, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be joyned in wicked and unlawful Matrimony, when they shall come to the Faith, they are to be admonished that they abstain, and made to understand that it is a grievous sin. Let them stand in fear of the terrible Judgment of God, lest for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle carnal pleasure they incur eternal torments; nevertheless they are not for this thing to be deprived of the Communion of the body and blood of our Lord, lest we should seem to punish those things in them, in which they had bound themselves through ignorance before the Laver of Baptism. For in these times the holy Church corrects some things with rigour, some things out of mildness it tolerates, and other things it wisely dissembles, and so bears with some faults, and winks at them, as at last what it disliketh, by forbearances and seeming connivance it overcometh; and all that are brought to the Faith are to be admonished, that they commit no such thing, and if any shall, they are to be deprived of the Communion of the body and blood of our Lord; because as in those things which they did through ignorance, the fault in some measure is to be born withal, so it ought resolutely to be prosecuted in those that are most afraid knowingly to offend.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>If for the great distance of places Bishops cannot easily meet, whether a Bishop may be ordained without the presence of other Bishops?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Answer of</hi> Gregory.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is in the Church of the <hi>English,</hi> in which as yet there is no other Bishop but your self, you can ordain a Bishop no other way than without Bishops, for when can Bishops come from <hi>Gaul,</hi> that may assist, as witnesses at the ordination of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop? But we would that your Brotherhood should so ordain Bishops, that they be not too far disjoyned from one another, that there may be no hindrance, but that at the ordination of a Bishop others may be present, other Pastors also whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is very requisit, ought to have easie means of access. When therefore Bishops shall be so ordained in places near one another, the ordination of a Bishop ought never to be without three or four Bishops assisting; For in Spiritual things, that they may be wisely and maturely managed, we may draw an example from carnal things. When Marriages are to be celebrated in the World, married people are invited, that they which are gone in the path of Matrimony before, may be partakers in the joys
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:58825:260"/>
of the subsequent wedding. Why therefore in this Spiritual Ordination, by which, man through the holy Mystery is joyned unto God, ought not such to meet, who may either rejoyce at the advancement of the Bishop that is to be Ordained, or pour out their prayers equally to Almighty God for his protection.</p>

                  <p>Gregory's <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We allow you no Authority over the Bishops of <hi>Gaul,</hi> because in the ancient times of my Predecessors the Bishop of <hi>Arles</hi> received the Pall, of which Authority we ought in no wise to deprive him. If therefore it should so fall out, that your Brotherhood should make a journey into the Provinces of <hi>Gaul,</hi> you ought to treat with the same Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> how (if there be any misdemeanors among the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops) they may be corrected, who if he be cold in inflicting Discipline, he is to be stirred up with the zeal of your Brotherhood, to whom also we have wrote Letters, that when your Holiness should come into <hi>Gaul,</hi> he would assist you with all his heart, and quell those things that are contrary to the Commandment of our Creatour, in the life and manners of Bishops. But you cannot judge any of the Bishops of <hi>Gaul</hi> by your own Authority; but by perswasions and fair speednes, and by proposing good works to their imitation, you may reduce the minds of the wicked to the study of Holiness, for it's written in the Law, <hi>When thou commest into the standing Corn of thy neighbour, thou shalt not put a sickle unto it, but thou maist pluck the Ears with thy hand and eat,</hi> Deut. 23. 25. For you cannot put the sickle of Authority into that Corn, which seems committed to the charge of another, but by the effects of good works you may take from the Corn of the Lord the chaff of its Vices, and you may by admonishing and perswading, as it were by eating, convert to the body of the Church. But whatsoever is to be done by Authority, you must consult, about it, the aforesaid Bishop of <hi>Arles,</hi> left that be omitted, which the Ancient wisdom of our Fathers invented. But all the Bishops of <hi>Britain</hi> we commit to your Brotherhood, that the ignorant may be taught, the weak, by perswasions, strengthned, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse corrected by Authority.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>If a Woman with child may be Baptized? or after she hath brought forth, after how long time may she enter into the Church? or lest what she has brought forth be prevented by death, after how many daies may it lawfully receive the Sacrament of holy Baptism? or, after how long time may her Husband be joyned with her in Carnal copulation? or whether, if she be troubled with her terms, it be lawful for her to come to Church, or to receive the Sacrament of the holy Communion? or, whether a man that has lain with his wife, may enter into the Church before he is washed with water? or, whether he may come to the ministery of the holy Communion? In all which things the rude Nation of the</hi> English <hi>ought to be satisfied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gregory's <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doubt not but your Brotherhood by this time is satisfied in what I have just now given Answer, but I suppose, you urge whatever you can say or think, that you may be confirmed by my Answer.</p>
                  <p>Why should not a Woman with child be baptized, since the fruitfulness of the flesh is no offence to Almighty God? For when our First Parents had sinned in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, they forfeited the Immortality they had received by the just judgment of God; because therefore Almighty God would not utterly extinguish in them all Mankind for their fault, he deprived man of Immortality for their offence, and yet out of the goodness of his grace, he left him the fruitfulness of his Issue. What therefore is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for Human Nature by the gift of Almighty God, by what reason can it be prohibited the favour of holy Baptism? For in that mystery in which all our sins are utterly swallowed up, 'tis very foolish to think that the gift of Grace should any waies seem to contradict it. When a Woman shall have brought forth, after how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies may she enter the Church, is manifest, from a Precept of the Old Testament, which runs thus: <hi>If a Woman have conceived seed, and born a child, she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty daies; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:58825:261"/>
come into the Sanctuary until the daies of her purifying be fulfilled; but if she bear a Maid-child, she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three score and six daies,</hi> which ought to be understood and taken mystically; For if in the same hour she brought forth she should enter into the Church to give Thanks, she cannot be charged with any offence, for the pleasure of the flesh, not the pain, is in fault; For in the joyning of the flesh is pleasure, but in the delivery of Children, pain, whence that was said to the first Mother of us all that had transgressed the Commandment of God. <hi>I will greatly multiply thy sorrow, and thy conception, in sorrow shalt thou bring forth Children;</hi> if therefore we forbid a Woman, that has brought forth, to enter into the Church, we esteem her punishment her fault.</p>
                  <p>It is by no means forbidden to baptize a Woman newly delivered, or the Infant newly born, if there be danger of death, no not in the very instant of the delivery, or the first birth of the Child, because as the grace of the holy Mystery is to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the living with great discretion, so it ought to be offered without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to those that are at the point of death, lest that whilst we take too much time for the offering the mystery of Redemption, through a little delay we are not able to find him that should be redeemed.</p>
                  <p>The husband ought not to go in to his wife, until such time as the child which is brought forth is weaned. And it is a bad custome that has prevailed in the manners of married people, that women neglect to nurse their own children, and deliver them to other women to be nursed which thing seems to have been invented merely on the score of incontinence, because, whilst they will not contain themselves, they despise to suckle those they bring forth. These therefore, that out of a wicked custom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their children to others to be nursed, ought not to lie with their husbands before the time of their purgation be over.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when Women, that have not brought forth, suffer their Monthly Terms, they ought to be prohibited the use of their husbands; so that the holy Law pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes with death, if any man lye with a menstruous Woman, which Woman never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, whilst she suffers her monthly Terms, ought not to be forbidden entrance into the Church, because the superfluity of Nature ought not to be accounted a fault in her, and for what she unwillingly suffers, it is not just to debar her coming into the Church. For we know, that the Woman, which was troubled with a flux of Blood, coming humbly behind our Lord, touched the hem of his Garment, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently her infirmity departed from her. If therefore she, having a Flux of blood upon her, might praise-worthy, touch the garment of our Lord, why should it not be lawful for her, that suffers her menstruous Terms, to enter into the Church of God? But you may say that infirmity compelled her, so also those, whom we speak of, are compelled by their Terms: Consider therefore (my dear Brother) because whatever we suffer in this frail flesh, out of the infirmity of nature, was by the judgment of God appointed after the fall. For to be an hungry, to thirst, to be hot, to be cold, to be a weary, is from the infirmity of nature, and what is it otherwise to provide food against hunger, drink against thirst, air against heat, rayment against cold, rest against weariness, than to find out some Medicine against our Diseases?</p>
                  <p>Women therefore and their menstruous issues are Diseases, if therefore she did well, that in her grief touched the garment of our Lord, which was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one infirm person, why should it not be granted to all Women, which are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered infirm by the corruption of Nature?</p>
                  <p>Therefore the receiving of the Mystery of the holy Communion at these times ought not to be prohibited, but if out of a reverent fear, she shall not presume to receive, she is to be commended; But if she shall receive, not to be censured, for 'tis the sign of a good mind, even there after a manner to acknowledg a fault, where there is none, because we many times do things in themselves without a fault, which proceeded from a fault. We are an hungry without fault, by eating proceeds from a fault. It proceeds from the first Man that we are an hungry, for the Menstruous terms are faults in women, because they come naturally, but nevertheless, because nature it self is so corrupted, that it may seem to be polluted without the bent of the evil. From offence came corruption, by which human Nature may know what through the judgment of God 'tis come to, and the man, which of his own accord committed the fault, bore the guilt of it unwillingly. And therefore women when
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:58825:261"/>
they consider their condition, if they shall not presume, during their Menstruous terms to come to the Sacrament of the Lord's body and blood, they are to be praised for this their honest consideration. But if out of a custome of a Religious life, by receiving they are transported with the love of the same mystery, they are not, as we said before, to be restrained from it; For as in the Old Testament, the outward works were to be observed: so in the New Testament, not that so much as is done outwardly, as that which is inwardly thought on is carefully to be lookt after, that it may be kept under by strict examination. For when the Law forbids many things to be eaten, as unclean, in the Gospel the Lord saies, <hi>Not that, that enters into the mouth defiles a man, but those things that come out of the mouth defile him,</hi> Matt. 15. 17. And a little after he adds by the way of exposition, <hi>from the heart proceed all evil thoughts,</hi> where 'tis largely shewn, that that appears polluted to Almighty God indeed, which proceeds from the root of corrupt Cogitation. Whence <hi>Paul</hi> also the Apostle saies, <hi>To the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is pure;</hi> And a little after shewing the cause of this defiling, he adds, <hi>but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</hi> If therefore his meat is not unclean to him whose mind is not unclean, why should that which a Woman endued with a pure heart suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from nature, be accounted in her uncleanness? And a man sleeping with his own wife, unless he is washed with water ought not to enter into the Church, neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after his washing may he enter, for the Law commanded the ancient People, that a man that had lain with a woman ought to be washed with water, and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Church before Sun-set, which nevertheless may be understood in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sense, because, unless the fire of Concupiscence be before allayed in the mind, he ought not to look upon himself as worthy the Congregation of his Brethren, who seems loaded with the wickedness of a depraved will. Although many Nations think diversly of this thing, and seem to retain different customes, yet this was alwaies the use of the <hi>Romans</hi> from the eldest times, that after a man had lain with his wife, he was to endeavour his cleansing by the Laver, and to abstain somewhat reverently from entring into the Church. Neither by saying these things do we make Marriage a fault, but because the very lawful copulation it self cannot be done without the pleasure of the flesh, we ought to abstain from coming into an Holy place, because the pleasure it self can no wales be free from fault, for he was not born in adultery or fornication, but in lawful wedlock, that said, <hi>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in fiu did my mother conceive me;</hi> For he that knew himself to be conceived in iniquity, bewailed himself that he was born of sin, for the tree bears the same vicious humour in its branches, which it drew from the root. In which words, he does not call the copulation of married people Iniquity, but the pleasure that results from that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion; For there are many things that are lawful and right, by which in their acts we are defiled, as oftentimes we angrily prosecute enormities, and disturb the peace of our minds within us, when indeed, what we did was right, but no wales approvable, for that our mind was thereby disturbed; for 'twas against the wickedness of Male-factor she was angry that said, <hi>Mine tye is troubled for very Anger,</hi> because nothing but a calm mind is able to continue in the brightness of Contemplation, he was sorry that his eye was troubled through anger, for whilst he persecuted wicked actions below, he was confounded and forced from the contemplation of the highest things. Therefore Anger is commendable against Vice, yet troublesome, because he that is disturbed by it, thinks himself in some sort guilty.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the lawful copulation of the flesh ought to be, for Issues sake, not for pleasure; and joyning of the flesh ought to be for the procreation of Children, not for the satisfaction of our vices. If therefore any man makes use of his wife, not hurried there unto by the transport of pleasure, but only for procreation sake, he surely, whether it be concerning entrance into the Church, or the receiving the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the body and blood of our Lord, ought to be left to his own judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot be prohibited receiving by us, who being in the midst of fire knows not how to burn, but when no desire of procreation, but pleasure predominates, there results from such a conjunction what husbands ought to bewail; For this the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preacher allows them, yet by that very grant their mind is disturbed by fear, for the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> saies, <hi>He that cannot contain himself let him take to him a wife,</hi> and presently he took care to add, <hi>but I speak this by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:58825:262"/>
and not of Commandement,</hi> for that is not permitted which is lawful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is just, therefore because he said by permission, he made it manifest to be a fault; but we ought to weigh with a careful mind, that the Lord when he was about to speak to the people on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> commanded the same people, first to abstain from Women; and if, where the Lord spoke by a Creature subject to men, the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the flesh with so much care was requisite, that they which heard the words of the Lord were not to meddle with Women; by how much more ought Women, which receive the body of our Almighty Lord, to observe the cleaness of their flesh, lest they be overwhelmed by the very greatness of that inestimable Mystery? Hence also't was spoke to <hi>David</hi> by the priest concerning his young men, That if they were clean from Women they might receive the shew-bread, which they could never have done, unless <hi>David</hi> before had acknowledged, that they were clean from Women; Then a man after the lying with his Wife, if he shall be washed with water, may be capable of receiving the mystery of the Holy Communion, when, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the determined Sentence, he may lawfully enter the Church.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>If after Illusion, which commonly happens, in Dreams one may receive the body of our Lord, or, if he be a Priest, celebrate the Holy Mysteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Gregory's <hi>Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such a one the Testament of the old, as we have said in the Chapter above, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be polluted, and does not allow him, unless washed with water, to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Congregation till the Evening, which not withstanding a spiritual people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding it otherwise will take in the same sense, we have spoke of above, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is deceived, as it were in a dream. He that is tempted through uncleanness, by real appearances, is defiled in his thoughts, but he is to be cleansed by water, that he may wash away with tears the impurity of his Cogitations, and unless the fire of Temptation first be allayed, he ought to acknowledg himself guilty, as it were, till evening. But there is a distinction in this kind of Illusion very necessary, which ought carefully to be weighed, from what cause it happens to him that sleeps; For sometimes it proceeds from surfeiting, sometimes from the superfluity or infirmity of nature, and sometimes from thought, so that when it shall happen from the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity and infirmity of Nature, such an illusion is no way to be feared, because the mind being unsensible of it, is rather to be lamented that it suffered it, than that it did it. When also the appetite is carried away beyond reason in taking in its nourishment, and on that account the receptacles of humours are overcharged, the mind thereby has contracted some guilt, but not so far that it should be forbid the receiving the holy mystery, or of celebrating the solemnity of the Mass. For if perchance an Holy day, or an Administration of the mystery require his presence (for that there is never another Priest in the place) necessity it self enforces it. For if there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers present, that can lawfully administer that mystery, the Illusion which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened through overcharging ought not to hinder him from receiving the holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery; But he ought, in my mind, humbly to abstain from the Immolation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mystery, although it disturbed not his mind, when he was sleeping, with any fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Imagination. For there are those to whom Illusions oftentimes happen, whose minds though engaged in the sleep of the body, are not defiled by filthy Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>From hence there is one thing manifest, that the mind it self is guilty, neither is it free in it's own Judgment; for although it remembers it saw nothing in the body sleeping, yet it may remember, when the body was awake, that it fell into Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. If therefore Illusions in sleep arise from our filthy thoughts, when we are awake, the mind is apparently guilty; for it sees from what root that pollution proceeded, because, what it knowingly thought on, it ignorantly brought forth. But we ought to consider whether such thoughts arise from suggestion, delectation, or what is worse, from consent of sin, for all sin is perfected three kind of ways. 1. By sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. 2. Delectation. 3. Consent. Suggestion proceeds from the Devil, Delectation from the flesh, and Consent from the spirit. For the first fault the Serpent suggested, <hi>Eve</hi> as flesh was delighted, and <hi>Adam</hi> as spirit consented.</p>
                  <p>And certainly great distinction is necessary, that the mind which is its own Judge,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:58825:262"/>
might distinguish between suggestion and delectation, and between delectation and consent. For when an evil Spirit puts sin into the mind, if no pleasure from the sin follow, that sin is not at all committed, but when the flesh begins to be delighted, then the sin begins to commence, and if afterwards upon mature deliberation it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, then the sin is known to be perfected. In suggestion therefore is the beginning of the sin, in delectation the nourishment, and in consent the perfection of it. And it often falls out, that what an evil spirit suggests to the mind, the flesh turns into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation, and yet the mind consents not to that delectation; and since the flesh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleased without the mind, the mind strugling against the pleasures of the flesh, is, as it were, against its own Will obliged by the pleasures of the flesh, so that from reason it resists it, neither does it at all consent, and yet it is so fettered by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation, that it earnestly bewails its bonds: from whence that great Souldier of the Heavenly army cried out, saying, Rom. 7. 23. <hi>But I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</hi> But if he was a Captive he did not fight; and if he did fight why was he a Captive? He warred therefore against the law of his mind, which the law in his members resisted; but if he fought he was no captive. Behold therefore a man (as I may say) both captive and free, free by the righteousness he loved, and captive from the delectation he bore about him unwillingly.</p>

                     <hi>AUgustine</hi> by the power of King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> called to a Conference the Bishops or Doctors of the greatest and next adjoyning Province of the <hi>Britains,</hi> to a place at this very day in the <hi>English</hi> tongue called <hi>Augustineizac</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Augustine's Oak,</hi> in the confines of the <hi>Wiccians</hi> and <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> where he began to perswade them with a Brotherly admonition, that regarding the peace of the Catholick Church, they would unite their endeavours to his in the common Preaching to the Nations, for they did not keep the Lord's day of Easter at its due season, but from the fourteenth to the twentieth day of the Moon, which computation is contained in the circle of eighty four years. Moreover they observed many things contrary to the unity of the Church; who, when after a long disputation, could not be brought either by the prayers, exhortations or threats of <hi>Augustine</hi> and his Companions to yield their assent, but rather valued their own Traditions above all the Churches In the World, under Christ. Holy Father <hi>Augustine</hi> put an end to this long and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Controversie, saying, <hi>We beseeth God, which makes us to dwell in the house of his Father with one accord, that he would be pleased to inspire us with his heavenly gifts, that we may know what Traditions are to be followed, which waies we ought to take to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his kingdom.

Neither was it long before the Blind was enlightned, and <hi>Augustine</hi> cried up by all the true preachers of heavenly light; Then the <hi>Britains</hi> confessed, that they themselves indeed thought that to be the'true way of Righteousness which <hi>Augustine</hi> preached, but that they could not lay aside their Ancient customes, without the consent and free leave of their whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>Whence they desired that there might be another Synod called to which more might come, which when it was agreed on, there came (as is reported) seven <hi>British</hi> Bishops, and many Learned men from their famous Monastery, which in the <hi>English</hi> tongue is called <hi>Bancornaburg,</hi> over which at that time Abbot <hi>Dinoth</hi> is said to have presided, who a little before their going to the aforesaid Councel, went first to a certain Man both holy and wise, who led an Anchorite's life among them; They asked him, whether they should lay aside their Traditions at the preaching of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine?</hi> who made answer; <hi>If he is a man of God follow him;</hi> they said, how shall we know this? he replied, <hi>The Lord saies, take my yoke upon you, for I am meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in heart; if therefore</hi> Angustine <hi>be meek and humble in heart, it is credible that he himself beareth the yoke of Christ, and offereth the same to be born of you; But if he be cruel and proud, it appeareth that he is not of God, neither ought ye to take care what he saith.</hi> They said again, but how shall we make a discovery of that? he said, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it so, that he and his come first into the place of the Synod, and if he shall rise up to you as you come near, know ye that he is the Servant of Christ, and obediently hear him; but if he shall despise you, nor rise up to you, when ye are more in number, let him be slighted by you also.</hi> They did as he had said, and it sell out that <hi>Augustine,</hi> as they drew near, sate still in his Chair, which when they saw, they grew presently angry, accusing him of pride, and endeavoured in all things he said to contradict him.</p>
                  <p>He said unto them, <hi>Ye do many things contrary to our custome, and that of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, nevertheless if ye will obey me in these three things; That ye celebrate Easter in its proper time; That ye perform the ministery of Baptism, by which we are born again to God, according to the custome of the holy</hi> Roman <hi>and Apostolick Church; That ye preach the Word of God together with, us to the</hi> English <hi>Nation; as for the other things which ye do, although contrary to our customes, we will quietly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate them all;</hi> But they made answer, that they would do none of those things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they acknowledge him for an Archbishop; discoursing therefore among themselves, they said, <hi>If he would not just now rise up unto us, how much more, when we are subject to him, will be then condemn us as nothing?</hi> To whom <hi>Augustine</hi> the Man of God is reported thus threatningly to have Prophesied, <hi>If ye will not accept of peace with your Brethren, ye are like to accept of war from your Enemies; and because ye would not preach the way of life to the Nation of the</hi> English, <hi>ye shall suffer by their hands the punishment of death;</hi> which in every thing, the divine Judgment concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, was performed as he had foretold, for a little after, <hi>Edilfrid</hi> the strongest King of the <hi>English,</hi> having gathered together a great Army about the City of <hi>Chester,</hi> which by the <hi>English</hi> is called <hi>Legacester,</hi> but truer by the <hi>Britains, Carlegion,</hi> he made a great slaughter of that Nation, but when he was going to give the Onset, he espied Priests of theirs, who were come thither to intreat God for the success of the Army, standing apart on a place of advantage, he asked, who they were, and for what business they had met there? Most of them were of the Monastery of <hi>Bangor,</hi> in which there is reported to have been such a number of Monks, that when the whole Monastery was divided into seven parts, with their Rulers that were set over them, no part contained less than three hundred Men, all which got their living by the labour of their hands. Many of these therefore after a Fast of three daies came with some others merely on the account of Prayer, to the aforesaid Army, having one <hi>Brocmale</hi> by name their Captain, who was to defend them, being intent at their
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:58825:263"/>
Prayers, from the Swords of the Barbarians. But when <hi>Edilfrid</hi> had understood the cause of their coming, he said, <hi>If therefore they cry unto their God against us, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they, although they bear no Arms, fight against us, who prosecute us by their Prayers;</hi> therefore he commanded the first slaughter to be made upon them, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he utterly overthrew the rest of the Forces of that wicked Army, yet not without great loss of his own. They report that there were killed in this fight, of those that came to pray, about twelve hundred Men, only fifty escaping by flight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brocmale</hi> upon the first coming of the Enemy fled away with his Company, leaving those unarmed, and whom he ought to have defended, naked to the hacking Swords of their Enemies. So was fulfilled the Prophecy of the holy Bishop <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> although he went to Heaven long before it, that such perfidious people might feel the revenge of a temporal death, who despised the advice offered them of eternal salvation.</p>

                  <p>The Abbot of <hi>Bangor,</hi> which gave <hi>Augustine</hi> this Answer was, without doubt, the renowned <hi>Dinoth,</hi> as will appear afterwards in a <hi>Norman</hi> Manuscript: 'Tis manifest also as well from his Answer as from those that are related above by <hi>Bede,</hi> that the <hi>British</hi> Church at that time acknowledged no Subjection either to the Roman Bishop or any other forraign Patriarch; neither had it any Communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but 'twas subject as from the days of <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> to a Metropolitan of its own (as to the Pope or Patriarch of another World) the Archbishop of <hi>Kaerleon,</hi> who, as 'tis reported, acknowledged no superior in dignity, but <hi>yn obligar Dan Dum,</hi> under God governed the Church and People committed to his Charge without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sharer in his Authority; they had received the Eastern-Customs, and the <hi>Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tich</hi> rather than the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who will not judge, that <hi>Augustine</hi> behaved himself towards these poor <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> very uncharitably, by taking away on a sudden their old Customs, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing as suddenly new? especially when his great Master <hi>Gregory</hi> had advised him to proceed in that business with more moderation, in several Churches bore with several Customs, neither would he that the <hi>Roman</hi> Rites themselves should every where be imposed, but wisely considered the Custom of the place, the circumstance of time, and the Constitution of Believers. For he said, things are not to be loved for the places sake, but places to be beloved for the good things in them, see his Answer to the third Question of <hi>Augustine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst these things I desire to know, how came it to pass that the Bishops of <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erleon,</hi> otherwise of <hi>Menew,</hi> and their Successors, (who from the age of King <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to the very days of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that is almost 400 years, enjoyed the priviledges of a Metropolitan, and were called Archbishops, being by no Synod, as I know of, driven out) could, without any Crime, be deprived of their Province and ancient Jurisdiction? But it is enough that it was dorse by <hi>Augustine,</hi> for his Party defend all their own actions stifly, together with that horrible Massacre he contrived for the <hi>British</hi> Clergy. For they say 'twas sent from God for the better confirmation of their Traditions, and Doctrine, whilst others urge, that <hi>Augustine</hi> himself was the greatest setter forward of this action, and encouraged King <hi>Edilfred</hi> to the same. But if a true discovery of this business (as many would have it) may be had from the event, we are to think otherwise of this Butchery than they have delivered, and that God himself abhorred such cruelty. For when <hi>Edilfred,</hi> King of the <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of <hi>Augustine's</hi> wrath, had committed so great a slaughter upon the innocent Monks of <hi>Bangor</hi> at <hi>Leicester,</hi> and was triumphally making haste to destroy their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with their famous Monastery, there met him three <hi>British</hi> Princes, the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God's anger, who confounded the <hi>Northumbrian</hi> King with his whole Army, reeking in the blood of those poor Innocents, they killed ten thousand and threescore, and put the wounded King with some others to flight, as God seemed to come down into the Army against those <hi>Augustians</hi> in behalf of those innocent Monks of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and to have taken vengeance for their blood.</p>
                  <p>To excuse <hi>Augustine</hi> of this Blood-shed, <hi>Bede</hi> is cited, who saith that he was dead many years before; but if the time of his sitting Arch-bishop be truly computed 16 years, he must survive this Action, and in the Book <hi>de Antiquitate Ecclesiae Anglica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> printed at <hi>London</hi> in the year 1572. it is said, that those words of <hi>Bede,</hi> wherein <hi>Augustine</hi> is mentioned to have been dead long before, were foisted into the printed Copy of <hi>Bede;</hi> by the <hi>Romanists,</hi> contrary to the current of all <hi>Saxon</hi> Manuscripts. But the general opinion grounded on Charity, and the good Life and Miracles of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> however in some things he might be blameable, hath acquitted him of acting in so bloody a Murder. Neither do all the <hi>Romanists</hi> attribute the slaughter of those Monks to the Judgment of God inflicted on them for their rejecting the Rites and Customs of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church. A Testimony hereof may be evidently shewn out of an old Manuscript, written about four hundred years agoe, in the ancient Dialect of the <hi>Normans</hi> by <hi>Nicholaus Trevet,</hi> a Dominican Fryar, who thus telleth the story.</p>

                  <p>These are the chief Records extant concerning the foundation of the first Christian Church among the <hi>English-Saxons,</hi> which was begun in <hi>Kent</hi> under King <hi>Ethelbert.</hi> But the long Catalogue of Bulls, Charters, and Grants of Lands given by this King, or by Popes, and Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> during his reign, to particular places, Churches, and Societies of Men I have purposely omitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they tend not to the substance of Religion, and being most of them forged, all suspected, shew rather the cunning of later Ages in contriving, than the possible magnificence of these times they are fixed to; when perhaps the simplicity of the Christian Religion, and the poverty of them who first propagated it in the Island, gave no pretence for such large Possessions and Immunities to flow in of a sudden upon them. But it was not long before pomp and state grew up in our Church by the continual influence of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that most excellent Religion which was ever observed to gain most ground by the meekness and humility of those who professed it, those vertues being spent, and pride and luxury succeeding, was fain to be propped up with Secular advantages; and the life and substance gone, shadows and forms introduced, and Secular liberties being preached up as the interest of Christ, which were ever found to be the most destructive to his Gospel.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>EADBALD,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> by his first Wife <hi>Birtha,</hi> succeeded his <note place="margin">An. Dom. 617.</note> Father in the Kingdom of <hi>Kent.</hi> Being young at his entrance, he was no sooner freed from the awe of his Father, saith <hi>Bede,</hi> but he renounced the Christian Profession, whose severity was not agreeable with the licence of a Crown, and was likely to prove too great a curb to his exorbitant lusts and unnatural passions. For whether tempting for Lust, or tempted out of an ambition of Rule, he took to wife his Father's second wife, whose Name hath not had the honour of being recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; And being actually engaged in a sin, which Heathenism it self did alwaies abhor, he made it his business so much the more to discourage Christianity, by how much he knew its Doctrine condemned such Incestuous practices. And now might be seen what influence the Religion of the Prince had upon the lives of the People, for they who had embraced Christianity only, as the Religion most fashionable in the daies of the old King, now thought it as high a piece of Courtship to conform to the present way of worship, their old Idolatry, and now again revived Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In vain did <hi>Lawrence,</hi> Successor to <hi>Augustine</hi> in the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by diligent preaching to stop the tide of this Apostasie, for preferment at Court, and the Countenance of the Prince, drew more Proselites to Heathenisin, than the good lives and examples of constant Professours could keep true and sincere in the maintenance of the Gospel. But he was not long unpunished, for whether workt by the strength of Education, which suffereth, not without violence princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples well grounded to be rooted up, or whether indeed, as is related, possessed with an evil Spirit, he fell into soul fits of phrenzy and distraction, the convulsions of the mind, and often torments of an evil Conscience.</p>
                  <p>And now, whilst in human appearance there seemed no hopes of amendment, it so fell out, that by extraordinary means he became penitent. The story goes, that <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> finding his labours ineffectual, was resolved to retire into <hi>France,</hi> and follow <hi>Justus</hi> and <hi>Melitus,</hi> the one expelled <hi>London,</hi> the other <hi>Rochester,</hi> (for the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie was now spread wide into the Country of the <hi>East-Saxons</hi> also) being at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the night before his intended departure, in the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that Saint appeared to him, and to make the Vision more sensible, gave him many stripes for offering to desert his Charge, the marks of which the next morning being shewn to the King, with the cause why, and the person from whom they were received, so wrought upon his fancy already prepared, that immediately forsaking his Incestuous life, he embraced again the Christian Religion, and became as zealous a Professour, as he had been a violent Persecutor. Though it should seem by the following Epistle of Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> that <hi>Justus,</hi> not <hi>Laurentius,</hi> was his Converter.</p>

reward, and the assistance of his goodness, he hath illustrated the delightful course of your proceedings, whilst of the Talents committed unto you by a faithful improvement rendring him a plentiful increase, he hath prepared for you to lay up by multiplying the kind. And this also is conferred on you by that retribution, who constantly persisting in the ministry laid upon you with a commendable patience wait for the redemption of that Nation; and that they might be profitable to yours, their salvation is begun. The Lord saying,</hi> Whosoever shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved. <hi>Ye are saved therefore by a patient hope, and the strength of forbearance, that the hearts of unbelievers being purged from the natural disease of Superstition, might obain the mercy of their Saviour. For having received an express from King</hi> Eadbald <hi>our Son, we find with how great knowledge in holy teaching your Brotherhood hath brought his mind to a true conversion, and the belief of our undoubted faith. Upon which occasion, having a certain assurance of the continuance of the divine Clemency, we believe that by the ministry of their preaching will follow not only the full conversion of those under his command, but of the neighbouring Nations also; Since, as it is written, The recompence of your works accomplished, shall be given by the Lord, the Rewarder of all good things. And it may truly be effected, that the sound of them hath gone throughout the whole earth, and their words to the ends of the earth by an universal confession of Nations professing the Christian Faith.</hi>

                     <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> relates that hereupon he was Baptized, but it seemeth strange that <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> so Religious a Prince, had neglected that pious office to his Son; and as for re-baptizing, in case of Heresie or Apostasie, it had been long before condemned in the Church.</p>
                  <p>After his conversion he re-called <hi>Melitus</hi> and <hi>Justus</hi> from banishment, and built a Chappel within the Monastery of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Canterbury.</hi> He reigned twenty four years, and by <hi>Emma</hi> daughter of <hi>Theodebert,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Prince, had two Sons, <hi>Ermenred</hi> and <hi>Ercombert.

                     <hi>SLEDDA,</hi> the tenth from <hi>Woden,</hi> is generally esteemed the first founder of the <hi>East-Saxon</hi> Kingdom, though some following <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> give the honour to <hi>Erchenwine</hi> his Father, of whom ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless they tell us nothing, saving his Name and Pedigree, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating neither the number of his Forces, the place of his landing, or so much as the least encounter with the <hi>Britains.</hi> In the same obscurity we might have passed over <hi>Sledda</hi> his Son, had he not ennobled himself by the marriagt of <hi>Ricula,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Emerick</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> and Sister to <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the first Christian Prince, and Great Monarch of the English-men. And indeed the whole transactions of this Province seem all along to have been redeemed from oblivion, not by the glory or worth of its Princes, or the greatness of its own proper atchievments, but by the conjunction is had with other Kingdoms more powerful, and the lustre it borrowed from neighbouring Princes, with whom it was often linked in action. In its beginning it was tributary to <hi>Kent,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its Protection from thence, and this is the reason I have placed it next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and though afterwards it came to be in a manner absolute, yet it never rose to that height, as to have one Monarch that could pretend to give Laws to other Kingdoms of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> as all the rest at one time or another did. It was bounded on the East with the Sea, on the South with the <hi>Thames,</hi> on the West with the <hi>Colne,</hi> on the North with the River <hi>Stour;</hi> But these two latter limits often varied, according to the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Mercians</hi> made upon them in the West, and the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> and those of <hi>Northumberland</hi> on the North. Neither is the time of the beginning of this Kingdom more certain; some place it as high as the year 516 under <hi>Erchinwin,</hi> others eleven years after, in the year 527, and the fifteenth of <hi>Oisc</hi> second King of <hi>Kent.</hi> Some

He was converted at the perswasions of his Uncle <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> and the preaching of <hi>Melitus,</hi> afterwards Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and received Baptism at his hands in his chief City of <hi>London,</hi> where, by the assistance of King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> then chief Monarch of the English-men, he founded a stately Church, or rather repaired and enlarged the old Structure, dedicating it to the honour of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> constituting it the Cuthedral of the See of <hi>London.</hi> This Church, <hi>Ethelbert</hi> then present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with good possessions, as in his Grant to <hi>Melitus</hi> is evident by this following Record.</p>

                  <p>Afterwards these two Princes founded the Church of St. <hi>Peters</hi> on the west of <hi>London,</hi> at a place called <hi>Thorney,</hi> where there stood a Ruinous structure, built, as the report goes, by King <hi>Lucius</hi> upon the foundations of a Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> Here <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> after thirteen years Reign was interred, as likewise his Wife <hi>Anthelgoda,</hi> more to be commended, if he had laid the foundation of Christian Religion in the hearts of his Children, as he had done in sticks and stones; but dying, his three Sons</p>

But nevertheless, though the Authors of this Apostacy were taken away, yet the people could not for some time be brought to embrace the Christian Religion. <hi>Seward</hi> left Issue <hi>Sigibert.</hi>

                  <p>Being to return into his own Country, he desired that some Preacher might be sent with him to instruct his People in the Religion which he himself had received. <hi>Oswy,</hi> to satisfie his just Requests chooseth one <hi>Gedda</hi> a laborious Pastor, then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Country of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> to go along with him, who coming into the Country of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> by the help of others joyned with him in the Ministry, so wrought upon the People committed to his charge, that the Gospel of Christ daily increased more and more throughout the whole Province.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gedda,</hi> as a reward of his labours, and to gain more Authority to his preaching, was afterwards by <hi>Finnan</hi> at <hi>Lindesfern</hi> created Bishop of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> which office he executed with great commendation for the space of many years, ordaining Priests and Deacons for his assistance, and Baptizing in all parts, but especially at <hi>Ithancester</hi> and <hi>Tilbury;</hi> Whilst these things were doing, <hi>Sigibert,</hi> who still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued stedfast in Religion, was almost barbarously slain by the conspiracy of two of his Kinsmen who were attending of his person. Being demanded after the Murther, what it was that moved them to an act so foul and treasonable, it is reported they returned this savage Answer, <hi>That they had killed him for his easiness of Temper, in forgiving Injuries, and pardoning his enemies whenever they askt it.</hi> Some have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted his death to the judgment of God upon him for his disregarding the Censures of the Church, and they give us this Relation.</p>
                  <p>One of these Earls that flew him had unlawfully married a Wife, and being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht thereof refused notwithstanding to put her away, for which sin being excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, but still continuing obstinate, it was strictly forbidden under pain of the same Censure for any one to come under his Roof, much less to eat or drink with him. Notwithstanding this Sentence, the King invited to a Banquet goes to his House, but in his return meeting the Bishop, he was struck with remorse, and lighting from his Horse fell at his feet, begging pardon for his offence. It is said, that the Bishop also alighting came up to the King, and touching his head with his rod, spake these words in the Authority of a Bishop, <hi>Because thou wouldst not refrain from entring the House of the accursed, in the same House shalt thou die.</hi> And so indeed it came to pass; This <hi>Gedda</hi> going afterwards to visit his Native Country of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> upon the motion of King <hi>Ediswald</hi> there Reigning, founded the Monastery of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinghem,</hi> which he consecrated with Fasting and Prayer.</p>

                     <hi>Sigibert</hi> is said to have Reigned fourteen years, he left behind him a Son named, <hi>Selred,</hi> but the Crown fell not to him immediately after his Father's death, but he followed many others who wore it before him.</p>

They divided the Province into two Governments, each of which they ruled distinctly. In the beginning of their Reign there was seen an Eclipse of the Sun on the third of <hi>May,</hi> which was followed by a grievous Dearth and Pestilence, beginning in the south parts, but spreading to the north, and over all <hi>Ireland</hi> with great Mortality. <hi>Sighere</hi> and his People unsteady in faith, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted this Plague to the displeasure of their old Gods, and returned again to their Superstition, building up their Altar, and erecting their Images which had been cast down. Which when <hi>Wulfur</hi> the <hi>Mercian</hi> came to understand, he sent <hi>Jaruman</hi> a godly Bishop, who by faithful endeavours in that kind soon recovered them of this second Apostasie. But <hi>Sebba</hi> with those under his command, held stedfast in the Faith, and after the death of <hi>Sighere</hi> reigned many years, until weary of the troubles of this World, he resigned his Crown, and took upon him the habit of a Monk in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of St.<hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> which habit he received at the hands of <hi>Waldhere,</hi> or <hi>Walthere</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> to whom he brought a great sum of mony to be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted in Charitable uses, reserving nothing for himself, that he might (faith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) be as well poor in substance, as in mind, and all to gain the Treasure of the Kingdom of Heaven; where he died and was buried, and his Tomb to our daies stood in the North-wall of the Chancel of that Church, being thither translated in the year 1148.</p>
                  <p>He had two Sons, the eldest of which named <hi>Sigherd,</hi> was a Monk with his Father, as <hi>Bede</hi> saies, and of the youngest named <hi>Seofrid,</hi> there is nothing recorded, though some make him to reign seven years after his Father. <hi>Sighere</hi> married <hi>Oswith</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Edilfrith</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who, in the daies of her Husband, is said to be the Abbess of <hi>Barking,</hi> and was afterwards reputed a Saint.

And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might be the true Reason, that of all the rest it was the most Inglorious, being Tributary throughout to one Prince or other, and never able to stand upon its own feet, by the just judgment of God who visited their sins upon them, that they who could stoop to stocks and stones, should also be servants to their Neighbours. For if we consider the outward advantages it enjoyed in the beginning of its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, we should sooner judge it would be able to give Laws to its Neighbours, than receive from them. It was excellently bounded on the East and South by the Ocean and River <hi>Thames,</hi> which at once enriched and secured it. It had under its command the City of <hi>London,</hi> which <hi>Bede</hi> in these daies writes, was a Princely Mart for all Comers both by Sea and Land. On the other side it had no bordering settlements of <hi>Saxons</hi> in its first infancy, to share in its Conquests, or strengthen its ground, an inconvenience which many other Provinces were forced to struggle with. The lands were seated very pleasant and fruitful, and the Countries adjoyning lay open to their farther progress; yet notwithstanding all these admirable advantages it was continually in a pining condition, scarce able to bear up the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, much less the dignity of a Kingdom. And in its final surrender to <hi>Egbert,</hi> hardly afforded a good morsel to that Conquerour; For <hi>London</hi> obeying the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> went not along with it, but holding out with the Countries near adjacent, it cost some more time in the gaining of it.</p>

                  <p>THE Kingdom of the <hi>South-Saxons</hi> was precedent to the former in time, and the glory of its Actions, but not continuance of its <note place="margin">An.

                  </p>
                  <p>At his first landing he set upon the <hi>Britains,</hi> and with great slaughter drove them into the Wood <hi>Andreds-league,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> calls <hi>Andreds-wald,</hi> so named from <hi>Caer-Andred</hi> adjoyning, which in the Book <hi>Notitia Provinciarum</hi> is termed <hi>Ande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida,</hi> with a Haven hard by of the same name. But the <hi>Britains</hi> thus driven back, suffered not <hi>Ella</hi> to enjoy his ground in quiet, for continually sallying out upon him from the neighbouring Woods and Forrests, and their chief Garrison at <hi>Caer-Andred,</hi> called by the <hi>Saxons</hi> afterwards <hi>Andreds-cester,</hi> now <hi>Newenden</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> they often-times repelled him with great dammage, and as is thought, with the death of his two eldest Sons, <hi>Kymen</hi> and <hi>Pletting.

And it appears, that after this engagement new Forces were sent for into <hi>Germany,</hi> but whether a second time, or that the last supplies are to be placed after this battel, is left uncertain. But an Argument of <hi>Victory</hi> on the <hi>Saxons</hi> side is, that now it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

reported that <hi>Ella</hi> took upon him Kingly Dignity, namely, three years after the death of <hi>Hengist,</hi> in the year of our Lord 492; for the difference of computations herein is not great, unless we follow them who confound the time of his Entrance with that wherein he assumed Power.</p>

Sometimes the Inhabitants sallied out, whilst others from the Woods and natural Fastnesses, fell upon the Enemy in the Reer. But <hi>Ella</hi> dividing his Army, ordering one half to attend the motions of the Scouting <hi>Britains,</hi> and with the other part plying the Siege, at last won the Town by Assault, and, as some report, put all to the Sword, sparing neither Sex nor Age. The City it self he utterly demolished, and with so through a Ruine, that it never after could be rebuilt. And at this day the ground whereon it stood beareth a little Village so small, that it scarce sufficeth to point out the foundations of the Ancient City.</p>

                     <hi>Ella</hi> by destroying this great Fortress had opened the whole Southern quarters of the Island, whereby all that part of the Country lay at his devotion.

But under his Successors, who were but few, and of no great fame, the Kingdom was contracted into a lesser compass, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining only <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> and them not entire; For the Kingdom of <hi>Kent</hi> on one side, and the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> on the other, both well settled Governments, pressing hard upon it, so daily wore it out, that losing strength by degrees, what remained of it was quickly swallowed up by <hi>Ceadwald</hi> the <hi>West-Saxon,</hi> and afterwards by King <hi>Ine</hi> his Successour, wholly annext to that Kingdom; Insomuch that continuing so short a while, not beyond the year 1601, having so few Princes, and those in so great obscurity, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> among other Writers, have taken no notice of it at all.</p>

Moreover Queen <hi>Ebba</hi> received Baptism in her own Island of <hi>Wight,</hi> she was the Daughter of <hi>Eanfrid,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Eanher,</hi> who both, with their people were Christians; but the whole Province of the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> was for the most part ignorant of the Word of God and Faith.

But on the very same day that Nation received Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, gentle and plentiful showers fell from heaven, the Earth flourished, and to the green Fields succeeded a glad and fruitful year. So that casting off their ancient

Superstition, and hating their Idolatry, the hearts and flesh of all rejoyced in the living God, who by his heavenly Grace had not only enriched them with internal, but external blessings also.</p>
                  <p>This Prelate at his first coming into the Province, seeing the plague of Famine so great, had taught them to get sustenance by fishing, for the Sea and Rivers abounded with all sort of fish, but their skill extended only to the catching of Eeles. Having therefore gathered together many Eele-Nets, they cast them into the Sea, and by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine assistance presently caught three hundred fish of divers kinds, which dividing into three parts, they gave a hundred to the Poor, a hundred to them of whom they had borrowed the Nets, and a hundred they reserved for their own use; By which benefit this Prelate gained the affections of every one towards him, and they were easier brought by his Preaching to hope for eternal things, by whose Ministry they had received temporal.</p>
                  <p>At which time King <hi>Edilwalch</hi> gave by donation to the most Reverend Father <hi>Wilfrid</hi> Land of eighty seven Families, where he might receive his own People who wandered about in Exile, that is to say, <hi>Seolesu,</hi> which in Latin is called, <hi>Insula vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuli marini,</hi> the place is every where surrounded with the Sea, saving on the West, <note place="margin">Selsey <hi>in</hi> Sussex.</note> where it hath a passage of about a stones cast wide.

For he lived in those parts five years (<hi>i. e.</hi>) till the death of King <hi>Elfrid,</hi> worthily honoured by all, exercising the office of a Bishop both in word and deed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the King, together with the possession of the same place, had granted him all the Demesne with the Lands and Tenants, he baptized them all into the Christian Faith, among which many men and maid Servants, to the number of one hundred and fifty, he not only by Baptism delivered from the slavery of Satan, but by giving them freedom released them from the yoke of human bondage.</p>

                  <p>The measure of the Island, according to the account of the <hi>English,</hi> is a thousand two hundred Families, out of which was given to the Bishop the possession of three hundred. But that part which he received, he bestowed on one of his clergy, by name <hi>Bernuvin</hi> his Sisters son, assigning him a Priest called <hi>Hildila,</hi> who should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Word and Sacrament to all such as desired salvation, where I think it ought not to be passed by in silence, how that for the first fruits of them who of the Island by believing were saved, two young Princes, Brothers of <hi>Arwald</hi> King of the Island, by the special favour of God were first crowned. For the Enemy approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they got out of the Island, and were carried into the next Province of the <hi>Vites,</hi> where being brought to a place called <note n="*" place="margin">Stoneham.</note> 
                     <hi>Ad lapidem,</hi> and thinking themselves hid <note place="margin">Cambden.</note> from the fury of the Conquerour, they were betrayed and commanded to be stain, which when a Priest, and Abbot by name <hi>Cimbreth</hi> came to understand, having not far off a Monastery in a place called <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Now</hi> Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg. Cambden.</note> 
                     <hi>Reodford,</hi> he came to the King, who then lay in those parts Incognito under the cure of his wounds, which he had received in fight in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and desired of him, that if of necessity the Youths must die, they might first be baptized with the Sacrament of Christian Faith. The King granted it, and he instructing them in the words of truthi, and washing them in the fountain of life, gave them certain assurance of their entrance into the eternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:58825:273"/>
Which done, they joyfully received at the Executioner's hands a temporal death, by which they doubted not but to pass to life everlasting.</p>
                  <p>In this order therefore, after all the Provinces of <hi>Britain</hi> had embraced the Faith of Christ, the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> also received it; in which Island not withstanding (by reason of the inconvenience of external subjection) none ever took the dignity of an Episcopal See and Jurisdiction, before <hi>Daniel</hi> the present Bishop of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> and <hi>Geuisses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this last Relation of <hi>Bede,</hi> the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> had not received the Faith till after the death of this King <hi>Edilwalch,</hi> and the arrival of <hi>Ceadwalla,</hi> though others relate otherwise, as hath been shewn before. For <hi>Edilwalch</hi> assisting the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> was slain by him before he the said <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> had invaded the <hi>South-Saxons,</hi> and in this Prince ended the Royal stem of the <hi>South-Saxon</hi> Kings; but after his death, two Dukes of this Province <hi>Berthun</hi> and <hi>Authun</hi> assumed the Power to themselves, and in some Conflicts repelled <hi>Ceadwald</hi> with loss; but he having united his Subjects, and gathered more Forces, returned upon them, and with the slaughter of <hi>Berthun</hi> totally subdued the whole Country, which (with the uttermost violence of a Conquerour) he brought into miserable Thraldom.</p>
                  <p>Thus they who received the Faith last, were the first who were brought to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, long before hand leading the dance to other Kingdoms, who were to follow in the universal Obedience to the Western-Monarchy.</p>

Paulinus</hi> was not wanting to encourage this Vow, and the King, to shew his sincerity, gives his Daughter <hi>Eanfled</hi> to be bred up in Religion, who with twelve others of his Family, were baptized by <hi>Paulinus</hi> on the day of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> The King not long after recovering, raises an Army, and invades the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Province, and with such wonderful success, that in a short space, he not only laid the Country desolate, but had means to bring the chief Actors of that bloody contrivance to punishment, they all by one means or other falling miraculonsly into his hands; Loaded with Victory he returns home, and from that time worshipped no more his Idols. But the open profession of the Christian Faith he could not yet be brought to own, but stood wavering between the prejudices of Education on one side, and the Evidences he had received on the other, from the power of that God whom <hi>Paulinus</hi> had taught him, and who plainly seemed to be his Deliverer.</p>

Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Copies of which are yet extant, containing ardent exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not to delay his Promise, but to embrace the Faith which he had vowed; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Bishop wanting by Letters to his Queen, to stir up and quicken her endeavours towards the conversion of her Husband; But all was in vain, for the King tossed between two great Seas, inclined neither to the one side or other, until <hi>Paulinus</hi> by divine Revelation coming to the knowledg of a Secret, One day when the King was private in his Chamber, comes boldly in, and laying his hand on his head, asked him, if he remember what that sign meant? <hi>Edwin</hi> all in a maze, as whose memory had newly recovered some former impressions, rose up, and fell prostrate at the Bishop's feet. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith <hi>Paulinus,</hi> taking him up by the hand, <hi>God hath delivered thee from thy enemies thou fearedst, and hath granted the Kingdom thou desiredst; Forget not therefore the third promise, in receiving his Faith and keeping his Commandments, for if from henceforth thou obey his will, which by my mouth he declareth, to thy temporal Kingdom he will after this life add a Crown eternal.</hi> What this third Promise was, and upon what occasion made by <hi>Edwin,</hi> is thus related by Venerable <hi>Bede:</hi> When <hi>Edwin</hi> was an Exile in the Court of King <hi>Redwald,</hi> and <hi>Edilfrid</hi> by his Embassadours deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Bede, <hi>Hist.

                     </note> that he should be surrendred unto him, <hi>Redwald,</hi> as hath been related, partly dazled with the Gold, and partly a wed by the threats of that Prince, had at first yielded to deliver him, which wicked determination was brought to <hi>Edwin</hi> by a Friend of his who had all along stuck close to him in his Adversity, and who now promised his assistance to further his escape. <hi>Edwin</hi> uncertain what to do, as loth to distrust the King, who had given him his Royal word, and had hitherto protected him, and yet not questioning his Friend's good will, and the truth of his intelligence, in the dead of night, from them was the news brought him, goes out of the Palace and casts himself upon a cold stone, musing what course was best to be undertaken, when, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, there advances unto him a Person unknown, and in Language full as strange, and thus accosteth him, <hi>Who art thou, who thus in the dead of night, when Mortals are at rest, lyest here without doors cold and benum'd? Edwin,</hi> whom grief suffered not to be very Ceremonious, returns this sharp reply. That he might meddle with his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and that it was nothing to him, whether he lay within or without doors. <hi>Think not,</hi> Edwin, saith the Stranger though nothing moved, <hi>that I am ignorant who thou art, or the cause of thy heaviness, why thou sittest so pensive here alone, sad, and making. But tell me, what wouldst thou give him who could deliver then from the danger that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens thy life, and perswade</hi> Redwald, <hi>neither to do thee hurt, nor to deliver thee to thy enemies?</hi> Any thing, answered <hi>Edwin,</hi> who now began to listen to him. <hi>But what</hi> (said the other) <hi>wouldst thou give, if the same person should give thee a Kingdom, and cause thee to surpass all thy Predecessours in power and glory?</hi> I do not question, said <hi>Edwin,</hi> but that I should make answerable returns of gratitude. <hi>But, what if he that foretels thee these good things to come,</hi> said the unknown, <hi>should also instruct thee in a way to life and happiness, that none of thy Forefathers or kindred ever knew? Wouldst thou obey him, and consent to receive his wholsom admonitions? Edwin,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out stope made answer, That he would in every thing follow the advice of such an one, as not only could deliver him from his enemies, but would also give him a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; At which words the Person advanced to him, and laying his hand on his head, said, <hi>When this sign shall next befal thee, be not forgetful of this time, nor of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and remember what you have promised, you accordingly perform.</hi> Then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearing, left <hi>Edwin</hi> as full of amazement, as joy, to know what this unknown should be. When in comes his Friend, and adviseth him to chear up and not to be daunted, for he brought better news to him than formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> that the King by the perswasions of his Queen was so far from betraying him, that he resolved to defend him with his utmost power. And this is the reason why he fell down before <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> after he had laid his hand upon his head.</p>
                  <p>At last <hi>Edwin,</hi> being throughly convinced of the double Miracle shewn to him in the favourable and speedy promotion of his Conversion, consented to receive the Faith, yet would advise first with his Nobles about it, who being asked what they thought of the Doctrine of <hi>Paulinus?</hi> understanding withal the Kings private incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, generally consented, nay, the eminentest of their Priests, <hi>Coysy</hi> (who, as it appears by his Reasons, measured the truth of all Religions by Worldly success, for he was angry that his Gods had not advanced him to the King's favour above others)
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:58825:276"/>
was the first that gave his consent, offering himself to the King as the fittest Instrument to destroy those Idols, whose worship he himself had so much promoted.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Paulinus</hi> had free liberty openly to preach the Gospel, and the King with his Sons born to him of his first wife <hi>Quenburga,</hi> with a great part of his Nobility and People, renounced their Idolatry and were baptized. The King with his Family in St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church at <hi>York,</hi> which he had hastily erected of Timber, and the People for their number, near the Rivers of <hi>Glevie</hi> in the Province of <hi>Bernicia,</hi> and <hi>Swale</hi> in the Province of <hi>Deira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Conversion of <hi>Northumberland, Paulinus</hi> dispersed the seeds of Faith amongst them of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> a Province in <hi>Lincolnshire.</hi> First he converted <hi>Blecca</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the City of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and his Family, where he built a Church curiously wrought of stone, which was very much decayed in <hi>Bede's</hi> time. Neither was <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> any less careful to set forward the Conversion of the <hi>English;</hi> by assisting <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and by his perswading <hi>Eorpwald</hi> the Son of <hi>Redwald</hi> to embrace the Faith, who soon after was slain by one <hi>Richert,</hi> his own Countryman.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> after he had heard of the Conversion of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> sent to <hi>Paulinus</hi> a Confirmation of his being Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> withal exhortatory Letters to <hi>Edwin,</hi> to perswade him to continue firmly in the Faith he professed, the stile and substance of which Epistle, as much as relates to him, was this.</p>

                  <p>After King <hi>Edwin</hi> had Reigned seventeen years, <hi>Cadwallo</hi> King of the <hi>Britains</hi> rose up against him, who being assisted by <hi>Penda</hi> the <hi>Merolan,</hi> who envied <hi>Edwin's</hi> Greatness, after a terrible battel at <hi>Heithfield,</hi> slew this great King and his Son <hi>Osfrid.</hi>

                  <p>This <hi>Edwin</hi> was renowned for his justice and moderation, and the great care he took to help and ease his poor Subjects; For in his time any one might travel safely all over his Dominions, even from Sea to Sea, and for the benefit of the wayfaring Man, he commanded Iron-dishes should be fastned to every Fountain for conveniency of Travellers to drink.

                  <p>AFter the death of <hi>Edwin</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland</hi> became divided, as <note place="margin">An.

But now these two Kings having each of them a Crown, turned Apostates from the Church, and fell again to their old Religion and Idolatry; But divine Vengeance soon followed at their heels, for in less than the compass of a year they were both destroyed, one by the force, the other by the fraud and treachery of <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallo,</hi> the manner whereof is thus related in <hi>Bede,</hi> as likewise the succeeding Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> caused by the tyranny and oppression of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</p>

After which the Conquerour entring <hi>Northumberland</hi> brought all under his power, using his victory, not with the moderation of a King, but the pride and insolence of a merciless Tyrant, laying wide desolation wherever he came. <hi>EANFRITH</hi> the other King, coming to him to beg his peace, was barbarously put to death. This year, <hi>saith he,</hi> is counted to this day hateful and unfortunate, both for the Apostasie of these <hi>English</hi> Kings, as the fury and tyranny of the <hi>British,</hi> wherefore the Historians of those times have thought convenient, that the memory of these Apostate Kings should be utterly razed, and the same year reckoned the first of King <hi>Oswald,</hi> a man dearly beloved of God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>OSWALD,</hi> after the death of his Brother, was made King of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He was a Prince well grounded in his Religion, and besides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues, had accomplisht himself during his Exile in all Military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, <note place="margin">An. Dom. 634.</note> to which in his youth he had studiously addicted himself. And indeed, the state of the Kingdom at his first entrance upon it, being miserably harassed by <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallo,</hi> required no ordinary man to redeem the glory and honour of it. He had to deal with an enemy used to Conquer, but withal proud and boasting, and who, by often beating the <hi>Northumberlands,</hi> had now little opinion of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Valour in general, and was therefore grown somewhat secure and negligent in his proceeding. Him therefore <hi>Oswald</hi> with a small, but Christian Army, attacks by a little River running into <hi>Tine</hi> near the old <hi>Roman</hi> Wall, the place called <hi>Denisborn,</hi> and after a sharp fight slaies him, with the greatest part of his huge Host, which he boasted was Invincible.</p>
                  <pb n="539" facs="tcp:58825:277"/>
                  <p>It is reported that the first day <hi>Oswald,</hi> though provoked, would not joyn battel, but spent the whole time in prayers and supplications, commanding his Army to do the like; and to shew that his trust was more in the protection of the Almighty, than the arm of flesh, and to profess himself the Souldier os Christ, he erected for his Standard a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the field wherein he encamped, (sustaining the same with his own hands, until the Souldiers with earth filled up the ground it was fixed in from this Cross, and the Victory ensuing, the place was afterwards called <hi>

                        </gap>,</hi> and the Cross it self was long after much frequented for the Miracles said to be wrought by it.</p>
                  <p>Being settled in his Throne by the death of his potent Enemy, like a good Prince, his first care was to have his people again instructed in the Christian Religion, which, by the Apostasie of the former Princes, and devastations of those times, was almost utterly lost among them. To this purpose he sends into <hi>Scotland,</hi> where himself had been bred up, to have some godly and laborious Preachers sent unto him; his desires were readily assented to by the Clergy of that Country, and <hi>Aidan</hi> a Monk and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, with others to assist him, are accordingly dispatched, who coming into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> by their good example and diligent preaching, wonderfully restored the Christian Religion, insomuch that many thousands are said in few daies to have been Baptized by them.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Aidan</hi> had assigned to him from the King for an Episcopal Seat a place then called <hi>Lindesfarn,</hi> now <hi>Holy Island,</hi> but he was not so famous by the dignity of his Sec, as the singular vertues of his mind, being a man above the level of that Age, of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful moderation, and not carried away with the nice and trivial points of Theology, which most desperately infected those, and latter times. And this will more evidently appear by the Testimony of <hi>Bede,</hi> in his preamble to the Councel of <hi>Whitby,</hi> which you may find in the Reign of the following Prince. And this might be the reason that he gained so much on the minds of his Auditors, for whereas others following the example of <hi>Colmar,</hi> a preacher then in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> delighted more to shew their profound skill in points then controverted, than plainly to set forth the grounds of Christianity: <hi>Aidan</hi> on the contrary, by easie Doctrine, and yielding in things Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, made more Christians by far, though fewer Disputants. Neither is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and humility of <hi>Oswald</hi> himself to be passed over, who disdained not to be Interpreter to the Bishop in his first preaching, for whereas <hi>Aidan</hi> at his first coming spoke <hi>Scotch</hi> only, or very broken <hi>English,</hi> the King himself, to secure him from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and to make his words carry more Authority, was, as you have heard, himself the conduit to coveigh them to his People.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this King less celebrated for his exceeding Charity and pity to the poor, feeding them with his own hands at the Gate, and often distributing the plate it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, for which it is said that <hi>Aidan</hi> being once present, taking the King by the right hand, thus said or prophesied, <hi>That it was impossible that hand should parish, which had so often sustained others;</hi> which, report goes, after his death was fulfilled, for that hand remaining uncorrupted, was afterwards shrined in Silver, and preserved entire in St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church in <hi>Bebba,</hi> now <hi>Bamborow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> by the blessing of God, and the good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of King <hi>Oswald,</hi> enjoyed the benefits of peace, during which time Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good Laws and Ordinances were established, Churches erected through the whole Province, and the general State so flourished, that all the neighbouring Countries invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Princely vertues of <hi>Oswald,</hi> especially the moderation of his Government, daily flocked under his obedience, insomuch that he had at command at one time, people of four different languages, <hi>Britains, Picts, Scotch,</hi> and <hi>English.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>By his wife <hi>Kinburg,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Kingils,</hi> he had a Son named <hi>Ethelwald,</hi> who being left young was put by the Kingdom by his base Uncle <hi>Oswy,</hi> but he continually gave him trouble in the keeping of it, and obtained lastly a Principality in <hi>Derra,</hi>

But his greatest eye-sore was <hi>Oswyn</hi> the Son of <hi>Osric, Edwin's</hi> Brother, who had possession of <hi>Deira,</hi> a Prince highly beloved by his People for his good nature, and much admired for zeal in Religion, and humility in the profession of it. Against him <hi>Oswy</hi> raiseth an Army, and <hi>Oswyn</hi> meeteth him, but finding himself far Inferiour in number, he broke up his Camp which was then at <hi>Wilfaresdown,</hi> ten miles west of <hi>Cataracton,</hi> and reserving himself for a better opportunity, with one Attendant named <hi>Condhere</hi> he withdrew to the house of Earl <hi>Hunwald,</hi> on whose fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity he much relied, but contrary to his expectation he was by the said Earl basely betrayed to King <hi>Oswy,</hi> and by his order as basely murthered at <hi>Ingethling.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Aidan</hi> was buried in the Isle of <hi>Lindesfarn,</hi> and <hi>Finan</hi> succeeded him in that See. This fact of King <hi>Oswy</hi> was odious to all, and therefore to explate the guilt, a Monastery was erected upon the place where the murther was committed, and prayers daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the Souls of both Kings, the slayer, and the slain. But notwithstanding <hi>Oswyn</hi> was thus removed, the Kingdom of <hi>Deira,</hi> or part of it, was seized by <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi> the Son of King <hi>Oswald:</hi> But <hi>Oswy</hi> was still infested with the incursions of King <hi>Penda,</hi> and had long endured many sore devastations; Once he had almost lost his strongest City <hi>Bebanburge,</hi> now <hi>Bamborow Castle,</hi> which <hi>Penda</hi> with fire and sword had assaulted. And now weary of continual standing on his defence, he resolves, if possible, by any means to buy his Peace, and to that end sends large gifts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to <hi>Penda,</hi> with humble suit desiring League and Amity. But these being with scorn refused, he prepares for War, and first imploring divine assistance, if God would grant him Victory, he vows his Daughter a Nun, and twelve Lordships for the building of Monasteries, which done, he raises an Army and meets <hi>Penda</hi> at a place called <hi>Loyden,</hi> now <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire.</hi> The Army of <hi>Penda,</hi> as is reported, exceeded <hi>Oswy's</hi> thirty times over, and was commanded by expert Captains, nevertheless they were utterly routed and put to flight, and many of them swallowed up in the River <hi>Winwed,</hi> which at that time was unusually swelled with Rains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Penda</hi> himself was slain in the battel, and <hi>Ethelhere</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> the contriver of the War. <hi>Ethelwald</hi> the Son of <hi>Oswald</hi> was in the field upon the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> side, and is said to have been the cause of their desear, for withdrawing his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the first Onset, and meaning to expect the event, he discouraged the <hi>Mercians,</hi> who misdoubted there was treachery in it. The death of <hi>Penda</hi> was received with great joy through all the neighbouring Provinces, as the Song witnesseth, <hi>At the River</hi> Winwed Anna <hi>was Avenged.</hi>

                     <p>IN these times was startled a common and great question concerning the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Bede, <hi>Eccl. Hist. lib. 3. cap. 25.</hi>
                        </note> of <hi>Easter.</hi> Those that came from <hi>Kent,</hi> or <hi>Gaul,</hi> affirming that the <hi>Scots</hi> keep the Lord's day of <hi>Easter</hi> contrary to the custom of the Catholick Church. Among these was one <hi>Romanus</hi> by name, a stiff defender of the true <hi>Easter,</hi> by Nation a <hi>Scot,</hi> but had learned the true rules Ecclesiastick in <hi>Gaul</hi> or the Confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with one <hi>Finan,</hi> made many sensible of their errour, or at least perswaded them to a deeper search into the truth, but he could not in the least stir <hi>Finan,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a fiery nature was rather made worse by his instructions, and an open enemy to truth; But <hi>James,</hi> formerly Deacon under the worshipful Archbishop <hi>Paulinus,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the true and Catholick <hi>Easter</hi> with those whom he had taught the true and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way. Queen <hi>Eanfeld</hi> also observed it with her houshold, according to what she had seen performed in <hi>Kent,</hi> having with her a Priest from <hi>Kent</hi> named <hi>Romanus</hi> of the Catholick opinion, from whence they report, in those daies, it sometimes happened that <hi>Easter</hi> should be kept twice in one year. For when the King's <hi>Lent</hi> being done, was keeping <hi>Easter,</hi> then the Queen with hers, <hi>Lent</hi> with them not being yet ended, was celebrating <hi>Palm-Sunday.</hi> But this different observancy of <hi>Easter, Aidan</hi> living, was patiently born with by all men, who understood thus much, That though he could not celebrate <hi>Easter</hi> contrary to the custom of those that had sent him, yet he took care that the works of faith, charity, and love, in which all Saints agree, should be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently performed, so that he was deservedly beloved by all men, nay even of those that thought otherwise of <hi>Easter,</hi> and was not only respected by the meaner sort, but by Bishops themselves, <hi>Honorius</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Foelix</hi> of the <hi>East-Angles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Finan</hi> being dead who succeeded <hi>Aidan,</hi> when <hi>Colman</hi> came into the Bishoprick, for he also was sent from <hi>Scotland,</hi> there arose a more solemn controversie concerning the observing of <hi>Easter,</hi> and other Precepts relating to an Ecclesiastical life, so that this question justly moved the hearts of many, lest peradventure the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity being only retained, they should run or had run in vain. It came at last to the ears of the Court, to wit, of King <hi>Oswy</hi> and his Son <hi>Alchfrid,</hi> for <hi>Oswy</hi> was taught and baptized by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and was well skilled in their Language, and esteemed nothing truer than what they had taught him. But <hi>Alchfrid</hi> had for his Instructour in Christianity <hi>Wilfrid</hi> a right learned man, who had made a Journy to <hi>Rome</hi> on purpose to learn of the Law Ecclesiastick, and had lived many years with <hi>Dalphin</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> from whom he had received the right custom of Church-shaving. He therefore thought this Man's Doctrine to be preferred before all the Traditions of the <hi>Scots,</hi> for which reason he had lately given him a Monastery of fourty Families in the place which is called <hi>Humpum,</hi> which place he had given a little before for a Monastery to those of the <hi>Scottish</hi> perswasion. But because, they afterward of their
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:58825:279"/>
own accord chose rather to relinquish the place than alter their Customs, he gave it to him, whose Doctrine and Life was worthy of it. About this time came <hi>Agilbert</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> a great friend of King <hi>Alchfrid's</hi> and of Abbot <hi>Wilfrid</hi> to a Province of the <hi>Northnmbers,</hi> and continued sometime among them, who made <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frid,</hi> at the request of <hi>Alchfrid,</hi> Presbyter in his said Monastery, but he had with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Presbyter named <hi>Agatho.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The question therefore of Easter, Shaving, or other Ecclestastical Rites being there moved, it was ordered that in the Monastery which is called <hi>Strensalth,</hi> which is interpreted <hi>Sinus fari,</hi> over which at that time <hi>Hilda</hi> the Abbess, a Woman devoted to God, was Governess, a Synod should be called, and this question determined. Both Kings came thither, <hi>viz.</hi> Father and Son; Bishops, <hi>Colman</hi> with his Clergy of <hi>Scotland, Agilbert</hi> with the Presbyters, <hi>Agatho</hi> and <hi>Wilfrid: James</hi> and <hi>Romanus</hi> were on this side, Abbess <hi>Hilda</hi> with hers on the <hi>Scotish</hi> Party, on which side also was the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bishop <hi>Chad,</hi> not long before ordained Bishop of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who also was a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Interpeter on both sides in that Councel.</p>
                     <p>First King <hi>Oswy</hi> by a short Speech opened the Assembly, saying, that they which served one God ought to observe but one Rule of Living, neither to differ in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the heavenly Sacraments, who all expected but one Kingdom in the Heavens, they ought more especially to enquire which was the truest Tradition, and all with one consent to follow that. He commanded his Bishop <hi>Colman</hi> to speak first what had been the Custom, and from whence that had its Original, which he followed. Then <hi>Colman, The Easter,</hi> said he, <hi>which I am wont to keep, I received from my Ancestors, who sent me Bishop hither, which all our Fathers, men beloved of God, are well known to have celebrated the same way, which that it may not be contemned and rejected by any, 'tis the very same, which the blessed Evangelist</hi> John, <hi>a Disciple particularly beloved by our Lord, is said to have celebrated in all Churches which he governed.</hi> After he had said this, and more to the same purpose, the King commanded <hi>Agilbert</hi> to relate and set forth from whence the Custom he observed had its beginning, and by what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he followed it. <hi>Agilbert</hi> made Answer, I desire that my Disciple <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter may speak in my stead, because we both have the same Sentiments with the other followers of Ecclesiastical Tradition, that are here present; for he can explain it more clearly and better in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, than I by an Interpreter.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> the King commanding him to speak, began thus. The Easter which we follow, said he, we have seen celebrated by every body at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> lived, taught, suffered, and were buried. This we have seen ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in <hi>Gaul,</hi> most of which we have travelled through, either teaching or praying. This we know is performed in <hi>Africa, Asia, Egypt, Greece</hi> and in all the World, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Church of Christ is spread, through divers Nations and Languages at one and the same, and not distinct order of time, except these only and their Accomplices in their obstinacy, I mean the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> lying in the utmost Islands of the Ocean, nor all those neither, who by foolish endeavours strive against all the World.</p>
                     <p>As he spake this, <hi>Coleman</hi> answered, I wonder why you should style our endeavours vain and foolish, in which we follow the Example of so great an Apostle, who was found worthy to lye in the bosom of our Saviour, and since it is well known, that the whole World is satisfied in his Wisdom.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Wilfrid.</hi> God forbid, that we should accuse St. <hi>John</hi> of folly, when he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the precepts of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law according to the Letter, the Church as yet Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing in many things: Neither were the Apostles on a sudden able to abolish all Observances of the Law, which was instituted by God, as it was necessary that all which come to the Faith should reject Images, which was an invention of Divels, <hi>viz.</hi> lest they might offend those Jews which were dispersed among the Gentiles. On this account it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he offered Sacrifices in the Temple, that with <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> he shore the head of <hi>Chorinthus</hi> profitable to no other end, but avoiding the offending the Jews. You see, Brother, how many thousands there were among the Jews, which believed all, which were followers of the Law; neither to this very day, the Gospel beginning to shine all over the World, is it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary or lawful for the faithful to be circumcised, or to offer up fleshly sacrifices to God. Therefore <hi>John</hi> according to the manner of the Law began the celebration of the Paschal Feast about Evening on the fourteenth day of the first Month, not valuing,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:58825:279"/>
whether it fell out on the Sabbath or any other Festival. But <hi>Peter,</hi> when he preached at <hi>Rome,</hi> mindsul that the Lord rose from the dead on the first day of the Sabbath, and gave to the World hopes of a Resurrection, understood it so to be celebrated, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custom and Precept of the Law, he should always expect the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Moon of the first Month, even as St. <hi>John,</hi> rising at Evening, and that being ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, if the Lord's day (which then was called the first of the Sabbath) should happen in the Morning, he began to celebrate the Lord's Easter that very Evening, as we all do at this day. But if the Lord's day happen not on the next Morning after the fourteenth Moon, but the sixteenth, seventeenth, or any other Moon take the twenty first, He wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it, and the preceding Sabbath, in the Evening he began the Holy Solemnities of Easter, so it came to pass, that the Lord's day of Easter was not kept, unless from the fifteenth day to the twenty first. Neither does this Evangelical and Apostolical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition diminish from the Law, but rather fulfils it, in which 'tis observable, that Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was commanded from the fourteenth of the first Month at Evening, to the twenty first Moon of the same Month at Evening, which observation all St. <hi>John's</hi> Successors in <hi>Asia</hi> after his death, and the whole Church throughout the World were inclined to follow. And that this is the true Easter, and that this ought only to be celebrated by the faithful is confirmed by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel, not lately established, as Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal History informs us; whence it plainly appears, <hi>O Colman,</hi> that ye do not follow the Example of <hi>John</hi> (as ye think) neither in the Observation of your Easter do you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Tradition of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which wittingly you contradict, nor with the Law, nor with the Gospel, for <hi>John</hi> keeping Easter time, according to the Decrees of the Mosaick Law, observed not the first day of the Sabbath which ye do, who will not celebrate it upon the first day of the Sabbath. <hi>Peter</hi> solemnized the Lord's day of Easter from the sisteenth Moon till the twenty first which ye do not, who observe the Lords day of Easter from the fourteenth to the twentieth Moon, so that on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Moon at Evening ye often begin Easter. Neither did our Lord the Author and giver of the Gospel, eat the old passover on that day, but on the fourteenth Moon at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, or deliver the Sacraments of the New Testament to be celebrated in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of his Passion; also the twenty first Moon, which the Law especially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to our Observation, ye utterly reject in the celebration of your Easter; so that, as I said before, ye neither agree with <hi>John</hi> nor <hi>Peter,</hi> Law or Gospel, in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing the great Festival.</p>
                     <p>To these things <hi>Colman</hi> answered, Did <hi>Anatholius</hi> a holy man, and much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the sore-mentioned Church History, think contrary to either Law or Gospel, who writ that Easter was to be kept from the fourteenth to the twentieth? Is it to be imagined, that our most reverend Father <hi>Columba</hi> and his Successors, men beloved of God, either thought or acted any thing contrary to Holy Writ, When there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny amongst them, of whose heavenly Holiness the wonders and powerful Miracles they wrought, have given sufficient Testimony? who, as I ever thought them to be Holy men, so I will never desist from following their times, manners and discipline.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> 'Tis evident, said he, that <hi>Anatholius</hi> was a man very holy, learned and praise-worthy, but what does that concern ye, when ve do not observe his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees? for he in his Easter, following the Rule of Truth, set forth a Circle of nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, which ye are either ignorant of, or else utterly contemn, if ve acknowledg it to be kept by the whole Church of Christ. He in the Lord's Easter so reckoned the fourteenth Moon, that he acknowledged, that on the same day, after the manner of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> to be the fifteenth Moon at evening, so he observed the twentieth day for the Lord's Easter, but so, that he believed that the day being done to be the one and twentieth, of which rule of distinction he proves thee ignorant, because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ye plainly keep your Easter before the full Moon, that is, on the thirteenth Month. As concerning your Father <hi>Columba,</hi> and his Followers, whose sanctity ye say ye will imitate, and whose rules and precepts confirmed by heavenly signs ye are resolved to follow; I might Answer, when many at Judgment shall say to the Lord, that they have prophesied in his Name, and cast out Devils, and wrought many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Lord will answer, that he never knew them; But far be it from me that I should speak this of your Fathers, since 'tis more reasonable of uncertain things to entertain good thoughts, than bad; for which reason therefore, I do not deny them to be the Servants of God, and beloved by God, who out of an innocent simplicity,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:58825:280"/>
and a pious intention love God. Neither do I think such an observation of Easter to be much prejudicial to them, as long as no body comes among them that can shew decrees of a better institution which they may follow, who nevertheless, I believe, had some Catholick Calculator better instructed them, would have followed those things which they knew, and had learned to be the Commands of God.</p>
                     <p>You therefore, and your Associates, if you despise to follow the decrees of the Apostolick See when you have heard them, nay, of the Universal Church, and those confirmed by Holy writ, without doubt ye sin. What though your Fathers were holy, are the paucity of these in a corner of the farthest Island to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Universal Church of Christ over the World? What if this your <hi>Columba,</hi> and ours too, if he be Christ's, was holy and powerful in Miracles? ought he to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the blessed Prince of the Apostles, to whom the Lord said, thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and upon this Rock will I build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it, and to thee will I give the Keys of the kingdom of Heaven?</p>
                     <p>After <hi>Wilfrid</hi> had thus spoken, the King said, <hi>Colman,</hi> is it true that these words were spoken by the Lord to <hi>Peter?</hi> Who answered, <hi>True, O King:</hi> Then said he, Have you any thing that you can bring to prove so great power was given to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumba?</hi> but he said, <hi>No, we have not.</hi> The King again said, Do both you agree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any controversie on this, that these words were principally spoken to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Keys of the kingdom of Heaven were given him by the Lord? They both answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Yes.</hi> Then the King thus concluded; And I say unto you, because he is the Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, I will not contradict him, but as far as I know and am able I desire to obey his commands in all things, lest perchance, I coming to the Gates of the Kingdom of Heaven, there be no body to open, he being turned aside whom you have proved to hold the Keys. After the King had said thus, both those that sate down, and those that stood, great and small, assented; so that the less perfect Institution being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, every one made haste to apply themselves to those things they thought better.</p>
                     <p>The Dispute being ended, and the Assembly dismist, <hi>Agilbert</hi> returned home. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> seeing his Doctrine slighted, and his Party despised, taking along with him those that were resolved to be of his sect (i. e.) they that would not admit of the Catholick Easter, and shaving of the Crown (for there was no little question about that) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Scotland</hi> to treat with his Party what he should do in the business. <hi>Chad</hi> leaving the tract of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Doctrine, returned to his See, as acknowledging the observation of the Catholick Easter. This Disputation fell out in the year of the Incarnation of our Lord 664, the twenty second year of King <hi>Oswy,</hi> and the 30th. year of the Bishoprick of the <hi>Scots,</hi> which they had born in the Province of the <hi>English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The wife of <hi>Oswy</hi> was <hi>Eanfled</hi> Daughter of <hi>Edwin</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of her husband, she spent her daies in the Monastery of <hi>Streanshalch,</hi> where she deceased, and was interred in the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the same Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
                     <p>The Issue of King <hi>Oswy</hi> by <hi>Eanfled</hi> was this; <hi>Elwin</hi> was slain in a battel against <hi>Ethelred</hi> King of the <hi>Mercians.

The <hi>Irish,</hi> on the other side, used no other weapons but Prayers, and, as my Author has it, bitter Imprecations, which may be supposed at last to have reached Heaven it self; for the next year, against the counsel and earnest perswasion of his sagest Friends, and especially <hi>Cudbert</hi> the Bishop, going to wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Picts,</hi> he was trained into narrow straits by the Enemy, and there cut off with most part of his Army. This was so great a blow to the <hi>English;</hi> that not only the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> who before durst not look beyond their own Country, but the <hi>Britains</hi> also began to bear up for Liberty, and yearly to gain upon their old e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
                  <p>This King took to wife <hi>Ethildrith</hi> Daughter of <hi>Anna</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> she had been wife to <hi>Eunbert</hi> Prince of the <hi>Gervii,</hi> a Nation lying in the Fens, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding marriage, had kept her Virginity. Nor did her second Nuptials with a King make her in the least alter her resolution, and though invited to his Bed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by passionate entreaties, otherwhiles by perswasions of her friends, who were made privy to it; yet she continued obstinate, contrary to the Apostle's Rule, the dictates of Nature it self, which at one time abhors communion and separation, and against the Laws of common prudence and civility; And all this to pursue an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant chastity, and a purity of living against all other obligations whatsoever, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she be cannonized St. <hi>Andrey</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> where, it seems, leaving her Husband, she ended her daies.</p>

The first time of their fixing in these parts is uncertainly guessed at, but with most probability supposed about the year 500, when coming over in several parcels (saith <hi>Bede</hi>) they were divided into as many Principalities and petty Governments, continually striving among themselves as they had leasure and rest from the Common enemy.</p>
                  <p>But about the year 575, <hi>UFFA</hi> the eighth from <hi>Woden,</hi> in strength and policy overpowered the rest, and either quelling or uniting different factions, moulded the <note place="margin">An.

The great Scene of his life, which raised him to extent of dominion and reputation in the World was, his encounter with <hi>Edilfrid the Wild,</hi> a mighty Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, and who had stretched his Dominions from Sea to Sea. Him <hi>Redwald</hi> in the height of his glory and the pride of Victory undertakes in the quarrel of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> as hath been related in the life of that Prince, and overthrows with his whole Host at the River <hi>Idle</hi> near <hi>Nottingham,</hi> after which he marched into <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where having established <hi>Edwin</hi> in his Throne he returns into his own Country loaden with Honour, leaving the World to admire his Moderation and Justice as well Conduct and Valour.</p>
                  <p>He had formerly been Baptized in <hi>Kent,</hi> but it seems more in compliance to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert,</hi> than that he was really perswaded of the truth of that Religion; For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into his own Country, by the perswasions of his Wife he was easily brought to his old Idolatry, but fearing perhaps that the Christian Faith might prove true he was not willing wholly to reject either, so that to be sure on one side or other he crected in the same Temple an Altar for the service of Christ, and another for burnt Sacrifices to his Idols.</p>
                  <p>This Prince kept his usual Court of residence at <hi>Rendelisham</hi> nigh <hi>Ufford</hi> in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> and as <hi>Bede</hi> interpreteth the word <hi>Rendelisham,</hi> it is nothing but <hi>Rendil's</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion place, that is, saith Mr. <hi>Cambden, Redwald's</hi> Court.</p>

                  <p>THE Kingdom of <hi>Mercia</hi> though of largest extent, yet was in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feriour in point of strength and power to far lesser Provinces, whose Pavilions though not stretched so wide were sure fixed in the earth, and had means by turns to prey upon this great body, not able at once on all sides to secure it self from their several incursions. Thus like a Bull at stake, seated in the midst of the Island, though sometimes it found means to toss and almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn particular Kingdoms, yet staved off by others and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly kept warm by new Assailants, it ever lost behind what it gained forwards, and was not at any time able so to keep all employed, but that one or other taking breath would return afresh upon it. It had on the north the Kingdom of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and its Limits on that side were the <hi>Humber</hi> and <hi>Mersey,</hi> from whence it is supposed to have taken name. On the East it extended to the Sea through <hi>Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire;</hi> and South-east had the <hi>East-Angles</hi> and <hi>East-Saxon</hi> Kingdoms lying upon it. South it reached to the <hi>Thames,</hi> where it was obnoxious to <hi>Kent</hi> the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>West-Saxons;</hi> and on the West it was kept in by the <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Dee,</hi> which gave passage to the <hi>Britains</hi> to break in upon it.</p>

                  <p>The news of his death was joyfully received by all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Princes, glad to be well rid of him, who during his Life had given them so much trouble. He was a Pagan through choice not ignorance, and in several Conjunctions with Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had learnt to despise the Professours of that way, as who owning in words a Faith more excellent, shewed nothing less in their Actions, yet he prohibited not preaching in his Dominions, but giving free liberty to all, he only hated and despised such, who did not obey that God in whom they chose to believe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WULFER</hi> the Brother of King <hi>Peada</hi> succeeded him not only in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince <note place="margin">Ar. Dom. 659</note> of <hi>South-Mercia,</hi> but in the entire Kingdom of his Ancestors: For <hi>Immin, Eaba,</hi> and <hi>Eadbert,</hi> three Potent Earls casting off the Yoke of <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wy,</hi> restored the whole North into his possession, which he maintained during the whole Reign of that Monarch. But <hi>Oswy</hi> dead, <hi>Egfrid</hi> his Son and Successour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to recover what his Father had lost, and invading this <hi>Wulfer,</hi> won from him the Isle of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> and the Countrys adjacent, and content with that revenge returns home with his forces. But <hi>Wulfer</hi> was now employed in War with <hi>Kenwald</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> against whom he had better success; for entering his Country with a powerful Army, he laid it waste from one end to the other, took away from him the Isle of <hi>VVight,</hi> which with some Countrys of the <hi>Meannari</hi> adjoyning, he gave to <hi>Edilwalch</hi> the <hi>South-Saxon,</hi> whom he had made a Christian, and received at the Font. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he fought a Battel with <hi>Escwin</hi> King of the <hi>VVest-Saxons,</hi> at a place called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danhafde,,</hi> but which side won the day is not recorded. He reigned seventeen years, and was buried at <hi>Peterborough,</hi> his Queen <hi>Ermenheld</hi> after his death vailed her self at <hi>Ely.</hi> He is reported to have had three Sons, whereof the eldest named <hi>Kenred</hi> reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after his Brother <hi>Ethelred,</hi> his two younger <hi>Vulfald</hi> and <hi>Rufin,</hi> as the Records of <hi>Peterborough</hi> report, were slain by their Fathers own hands, being found in an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Christians. For this King at first (as is said) was a great Persecutor of that way, and if Fame belye him not after his conversion none of the sincerest Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. For the Bishoprick of <hi>London</hi> he sould to <hi>Wini,</hi> who had been driven out of <hi>Winchester</hi> by <hi>Kenwalch</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King. But however this Simony be blameable in <hi>Wulfer,</hi> yet he afterwards made amends in sending <hi>Jerumannus,</hi> a painful Bishop to recover the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> who had fell from the Christian Religion into open Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>

Thus he dresseth him up, whom he will needs have to be the fourteenth Monarch, but, as his custom is, without the least shew of Authority, nay absolutely against it; For we read in an Epistle of <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> written to his Successor <hi>Ethelbald</hi> and yet extant, that he <note place="margin">Spelm. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Aften the death of King <hi>Ina</hi> the <hi>West-Saxon,</hi> he so managed his affairs that all on this side <hi>Humber</hi> was intire at his Command. He besieged and took the Town of <hi>Somerton</hi> about the year 740.

Afterwards he waged War with <hi>Cuthred</hi> the <hi>West-Saxon,</hi> newly come to his Crown, whom he often engaged with inter change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able success. But at last coming to a Peace, they joyn both their Forces and invade the <hi>Welch,</hi> whom in a great battel they overthrow. But in the year 752 <hi>Cuthred</hi> the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> falling again at variance with him, they sought another battel at <hi>Borford,</hi> now <hi>Burford</hi> in <hi>Shropshire,</hi> and a year after at a place called <hi>Secundune</hi> now <hi>Seckin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> eight miles from <hi>Tamworth</hi> in <hi>Warmickshire.</hi> He was slain, as <hi>Huntington</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, by the same Prince, others say, he was murthered in the night by his own Guards through the Treason of <hi>Beornred,</hi> out of ambition to succeed him.</p>
                  <p>In this King's Reign at a Synod held at <hi>Gloveshow</hi> by <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> it was ordained, among other things, that the Lord's day should be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Spelm.

He proved the Greatest that ever swayed this Scepter, but though he often gave fair strokes for the whole Monarchy of the Island, yet he was never able to compass that design. His first enterprize was against the <hi>Hestings</hi> a neighbouring People, whom he quickly subdued and added to his own Dominions. Next he invades <hi>Kent,</hi> and slaies their King <hi>Alric</hi> at a place called <hi>Ottenford,</hi> then recalled by the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> King he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages with him at <hi>Besington,</hi> where he wins the day and the Town for which they contended. And now to add Treachery to his Conquests, he invites <hi>Egilbert</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles</hi> to his Court with fair promises of his Daughter in marriage, whom no sooner come but he beheads', and then seizeth his Kingdom. But the baseness of this action blunted his Sword, and we never after find him the same man as before, so that the remaining part of his life will be spent in recounting his satisfactions, Pilgrimage and such other deeds. To expiate this murther, he gave the Tenths of all he had to the Church, and great possessions to the Church of <hi>Hereford,</hi> where <hi>Egilbert</hi> was buried; He caused the Reliques of St. <hi>Alban</hi> to be enshrined in a Cask of Gold set with precious Jewels, and to the Martyr himself gives Lands and Tenements the Ancient demesns of his Crown. He took a Journy to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Colledge of <hi>English</hi> there he gave a yearly Pension, and a Tribute to the Pope through all his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, for which he obtained that the Primacy of <hi>England</hi> was translated from <hi>Canterbury</hi> to <hi>Litchfield</hi> in his own Dominions. He obtained of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> that the <hi>English</hi> going to <hi>Rome</hi> should be free from Customes, and other duties. With <hi>Charles the Great</hi> during his whole Reign he had great intercourse, sometimes enmity, otherwhiles friendship, as appears by the kind Letters of that Emperour written to him yet extant, wherein he stiles him the MOST POTENT KING OF THE WEST CHRISTIANS.</p>
                  <p>And now about this time were Images first brought into the <hi>English</hi> Church to be worshipped; for <hi>Charles the Great</hi> sent the decrees of the Synod of <hi>Nice</hi> into <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> of which hear what <hi>Hoveden</hi> writes, wherein saith he, <hi>Alas for pity! by the unanimous consent of three hundred Bishops or more met together in that Councel were decreed many things inconvenient, may quite contrary to the true Faith, as is most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the worshipping of Images, which the Church of God doth absolutely hate. Against which Book</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Alcuinus.</note> Albinus <hi>wrote an Epistle, excellently well strengthned with the Authority of the Holy Scriptures, which, together with the aforesaid Book, himself presented in the name of the Princes and Bishops of this Land unto the aforesaid</hi> Charles <hi>King of</hi> France.</p>
                  <p>Which Book is reported to have so worked with that Emperour, that in the Synod of <hi>Frankford</hi> he caused those Constitutions to be repealed.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Offa</hi> to keep the <hi>Britains</hi> from making inrode into his Country, caused a Ditch or Trench to be made almost an hundred miles in length from Sea to Sea; that is, from the mouth of the River <hi>Wy</hi> unto <hi>Dee,</hi> concerning which in after daies <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in his <hi>Policration</hi> writeth thus, Herald <hi>ordained a Law, that what</hi> Welch-man <hi>soever should be found with a weapon on this side the limit which he had set them, that is to say,</hi> Offa's <hi>Dike, he should have his Right hand cut off by the King's Officers.</hi>

                     <hi>CERDIC,</hi> the Tenth in descent from <hi>Woden</hi> and the Beginner of the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Kingdom, with five ships and <hi>Kenric</hi> his Son <note place="margin">An. Dom. 495.</note> setting forth from <hi>Germany</hi> arrived at <hi>Britain</hi> in the year 495, and landed at a place afterwards called from his name, <hi>Cerdic-Shore.</hi> He was an old experienced Souldier, and long exercised in the Wars of <hi>Saxony.</hi> At his first setting foot on land he gave signal proofs of his Valour by often repelling the <hi>Britains</hi> who endeavoured to hinder this New settlement, and for six years together without any fresh supplies maintained his ground with advantage; about which time, <hi>Porta</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">An.

                     <hi>Saxon,</hi> with his two Sons <hi>Bida</hi> and <hi>Megla</hi> in two ships arrive at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> thence called, and at their first landing slay a <hi>British</hi> Noble man, with many of the Common sort, who disorderly gathered against them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> to redeem these losses, with strong Musters though slowly assemble together under <hi>Natanleod,</hi> or <hi>Nazaleod,</hi> a <hi>British</hi> King, and one of their greatest, saith <note place="margin">An. Dom. 508.</note> 
                     <hi>Huntington</hi> (however he came by so unusual a name) but are miserably defeated, with the death of their Prince and five thousand of his men. In this battel it is said that <hi>Cerdic</hi> was assisted by <hi>Ella</hi> the <hi>South-Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Oisc</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> together with <hi>Porta</hi> who had now been seven years in the Island. From this <hi>British</hi> King the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> write, that a small Region adjoyning to <hi>Cerdicsford</hi> was called <hi>Nazaleod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Six years after <hi>Stuf</hi> and <hi>Withgar, Cerdic's</hi> Nephews, with three ships land at <hi>Cerdics<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> or as others say, <hi>Certic shore,</hi> and in a set battel overthrow the <hi>Britains,</hi> and <note place="margin">An. Dom. 514.</note> five years following, if the former battel be not to be referred to this time, <hi>Cerdic</hi> again with his Son obtained another signal Victory, upon the gaining of which, and the strength of the new supplies, he at last assumed Regal Dignity. After he had
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:58825:289"/>
continued conquering in the Isle twenty four years, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Annals report a third Battel fought at the same place, but with doubcful success, as if this only had been the field of fortune.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his Chronographical Description of these two places, <hi>Cerdic shoar</hi> and <hi>Cerdics-ford</hi> hath much confounded the natural course of this History, by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them at so vast a distance, which if true, can never be reconciled with the truth of these Relations. <hi>Cerdic shoar</hi> be placeth as far as <hi>Yarmouth. Cerdic a warlike Saxon</hi> (saith he) <hi>landed here</hi> (i. e.) <hi>at Yarmouth, whereupon the Inhabitants at this day call the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cambden <hi>in</hi> Icenis.</note> 
                     <hi>place Cerdic-sand, and the writers of Histories Cerdic shoar, and after he had made sore War upon the Icent took Sea, and sayled from hence into the West parts.</hi> But our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians make no mention of his ever changing his design, or sayling into any other parts after his first landing; and I am afraid the Coincidence of like Names, honourably to derive a place, was the cause of this neat invention; for otherwise, what reason could there be that he should forsake a Country, wherein he had good success, and from whence he might easier expect supplies from <hi>Saxony,</hi> to go seek out new Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories further off, and where (for ought we know) he had no reason to expect better quarters or kinder entertainment? Let us see therefore where he placeth <hi>Cerdics-ford,</hi> for by the course of the story, <hi>Cerdic-shoar</hi> is not to be sought far from it, and we shall find them both on the Coasts of <hi>Hantshire. Hard by the Western bounds</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) the River</hi> Aven <hi>carrieth a still stream, and no sooner runneth into this shoar, but it meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

                     <hi>with the Ford of</hi> Cerdicus, <hi>in old time</hi> Cerdics-ford, <hi>afterward</hi> Cerdeford, <hi>and now by Contraction of the word</hi> Chardford, <hi>so named of</hi> Cerdic, <hi>that Warlike</hi> English Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon. <hi>For here the said Cerdic in a set Battel so daunted the</hi> Britains, <hi>that not only he enlarged the bounds of his Empire, but also delivered an easie War unto his Posterity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before time, in the year of our Salvation</hi> 508, <hi>after great Conflicts in his Tract, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish't the most mighty King of the</hi> Britains Natanleod, <hi>called also</hi> Nazaleod <hi>by others, with many of his people. Of whose name likewise a small Region reaching unto this Place was termed</hi> Natanleod, <hi>as we read in the Annals of the</hi> English Saxons, <hi>which I sought very curiously for, but hitherto could not find so much as any small sign or sample of that Name, neither can I guess, who that</hi> Natanleod <hi>should be.</hi> This seemeth naturally to be the place where the foresaid Actions were performed; for, besides the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Name, the place it self lying at a moderate distance from the <hi>South-Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons</hi> new acquests, it is reasonable to think, that <hi>Cerdic</hi> would not go much further, but rather sit down at such a convenient distance, where he might give or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Assistance, as occasion should serve, from his Country-men already set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled.</p>
                  <p>It being therefore granted, that this <hi>Charford</hi> was the ancient <hi>Cerdics-ford,</hi> let us see if we cannot find <hi>Cerdic-shoar</hi> also upon this Coast. For since his Nephews are said to land at <hi>Cerdics-shoar,</hi> and bring him thither new Supplies after his Battel at <hi>Cerdics-ford,</hi> either <hi>Cerdics-shoar</hi> must be nigh this <hi>Cerdics-ford,</hi> or else they must land at <hi>Cerdics shoar</hi> at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and so, through the Enemies Country march to <hi>Cerdics-ford</hi> in <hi>Hantshire,</hi> which is fondness to suppose. Or lastly, the whole action must be laid at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> which will not suit with the foundation of the <hi>Western</hi> Kingdom. I have sought many places on this Coast of <hi>Hantshire,</hi> but can find none that answer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to the name of <hi>Cerdic,</hi> but allowing that <hi>Cerdicford,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> says, makes <hi>Charford,</hi> we find another place of the same name, not far off, upon the Sea-side in the Isle of <hi>Purbek</hi> in <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> and Norwest of <hi>Pool</hi> a Town called <hi>Charborough</hi> as much as <hi>Cherdic-borough;</hi> but herein I desire not to be too fanciful, but certain it is by the consent of all our Historians, where ever <hi>Cerdics-ford</hi> lay, <hi>Cerdics-shoar</hi> was not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, though the name be now worn out, and perhaps the places aforementioned, as likewise <hi>Charmouth</hi> by <hi>Lime</hi> may give some satisfaction that this was the Coast.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Speed</hi> with whom nothing would go down of the <hi>British</hi> History, whilst he followed the Light of Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> now he is left to himself in the <hi>Saxon,</hi> swallows whatever any fabulous <hi>Monk, Trivial Legend,</hi> or his Brother <hi>Stow</hi> imposeth upon him; from them I suppose it is, that he reporteth that the Isle of <hi>VVight,</hi> after the Conquest of it by <hi>Cerdic,</hi> was given to his Nephews, <hi>Stuff</hi> and <hi>VVithgar,</hi> the later of which slew the Iahabitants thereof, and named the place of his Victory <hi>VVithgarbirg,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reigning King there, was after his death buried in his Royal City <hi>VVith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi>

                  <p>This is a reach, I suppose, whoever was Inventor, to derive the name of the Island, for in Authentick story we find no such Relation.</p>

Whereupon, by the command of the same Pope, he received Episcopal Orders at the hands of <hi>Asterius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Genua.</hi> But being arrived at <hi>Britain,</hi> and first setting foot on the Country of the <hi>Guisses,</hi> finding them all Pagans in the highest degree, he thought it more profitable to preach the Word there, than by going further to hunt out those whom he first intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherefore preaching in the aforesaid Province, when the King himself first catechized and instructed together with his People were washing in the fountain of Baptism, it happened that the most holy and victorious King of the <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Oswald,</hi> was then present, and received him at the Font. By a blessed conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction taking him for his Son in the second Birth, whose Son himself was to be by the marriage of his Daughter. Both the Kings thereupon gave to the same Bishop the City of <hi>Dorchester</hi> for an Episcopal Seat, where having built up and dedicated Churches, and by labouring converted many people, He departed this life, and was buried in the same City.</p>
                     <p>This King dying, <hi>Cenwalch</hi> his Son and Successour refused to receive the Faith and Sacraments of the Heavenly kingdom, and not long after lost his Earthly one; For putting away his wife the sister of <hi>Penda</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> he took another, wherefore being invaded by him, he was driven out of his Kingdom, and forced to flie to <hi>Anna</hi> King of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> with whom living in exile three years, he acknowledged the Faith and embraced the truth. For the King with whom he lived in exile was a good man, and happy in a good and holy off-spring. When <hi>Genwalch</hi> was restored to his Kingdom, there came into his Province out of <hi>Ireland</hi> a certain Bishop, by name <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilbert,</hi> by Nation a <hi>Gaul,</hi> but yet who had been in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the reading of the Scriptures not a little while. He joyned himself with the King on his own accord, taking upon him the Ministry of preaching, whose learning and industry when the King perceived, he made motion that he would accept there an Episcopal Seat, and remain Bishop of his Nation, who at his requests, for many years ruled that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince with Sacerdotal Jurisdiction. At last the King, who understood the <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue only, growing weary of a forraign Dialect, underhand brought another Bishop of his own language into the Province, by name <hi>Wini,</hi> who had been ordained in <hi>France,</hi> also dividing the Province into two Diocesses; To him he gave <hi>Winchester</hi> for his Episcopal Seat, at which <hi>Agilbert</hi> being highly offended that the King had done this without his advice, he returned into <hi>France,</hi> and receiving the Bishoprick of <hi>Paris,</hi> he died there an old man and full of daies.

So the Province of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> for no small time was without a Bishop, at which time the forementioned King of that Province, being often afflicted with great losses in his Kingdom received of the enemy, began to call to mind him whom by fraud he had formerly made forsake the Kingdom, and resolved to call him back, considering that the Province destitute of a Governour, was bereft likewise of Divine protection.</p>

But things being settled at home, and <hi>Kenwalch</hi> desirous to enlarge his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, invades the <hi>Britains,</hi> and had a fight with them at a place called <hi>Witgornsborough,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> but without any other circumstances, afterwards at <hi>Pennum</hi> or <hi>Pen</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> the success of which is not left so doubtful, for <note place="margin">Cambd.</note> the Victory was great on the <hi>Saxon</hi> side, who followed the pursuit to a place called <hi>Pedridan</hi> now <hi>Pederton,</hi> afterwards the Royal Seat of King <hi>Ina,</hi> and the <hi>Britains</hi> for a long time after would scarce look the <hi>Saxons</hi> in the face. But <hi>Kenwalch</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at variance with his old enemy <hi>Vulfur</hi> had not the like success, for fighting with him at <hi>Possentesburg,</hi> though <hi>Ethelwerd</hi> relates he took <hi>Vulfur</hi> prisoner, yet the <hi>Saxon Annals</hi> record clear contrary, and the sequel shews that <hi>Vulfur</hi> won the day, for not long after he wasted the Country of the <hi>West-Saxons</hi> as far as <hi>Eskesdun,</hi> and took the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> till then in their possession, with other Provinces of the <hi>Meannuari,</hi> and gave them to <hi>Edilwalch</hi> his Godson, King of the <hi>South-Saxons.</hi>

But the chief of all his works was his stately Church at <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> a place so renowned for its ancient Sanctity, as being the first Seat of Christianity in this Island; that our Ancestors called it, <hi>The first Land of God. The first Land of Saints in</hi> Britain. <hi>The beginning and foundation of all Religion in</hi> Britain. <hi>The Tomb of Saints. The Mother of Saints. The Church founded and built by the Lord's Disciples.</hi> In the first planting of Faith in this Island there had been built, as hath been shewn in the foregoing History, by <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea, Philip,</hi> or some of their Disciples, a little Cell or Chappel for the exercise of Religion by those Primitive Apostles. This being by this time decayed, was afterwards repaired, or rather a new one built in the same ground by <hi>Devi</hi> Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> which also exposed to ruine, was again kept up at the cost and charges of twelve Men coming from the North.</p>
                     <p>But now <hi>NIA</hi> having well settled his Kingdom, demolished that ruinous building, and in the room of it erected a most stately and magnificent Church, dedicating it to CHRIST and his two Apostles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> guilding it throughout with gold and silver after a most sumptuous manner. Upon the highest coping thereof he caused to be written in large Characters and golden Letters these Verses.</p>

Afterwards governing ingloriously by the space of seven years, he at last came to an unfortunate end, which was thus occasioned.</p>
                  <p>In his latter daies growing loose and amorous, and conscious of the want of that Merit by which he formerly held secure, from Self-confidence he grew jealous of his Power, and fearing that <hi>Kineard,</hi> Brother of <hi>Sigibert</hi> the former King (a man of great Spirit, but who hitherto had behaved himself loyal) might at last revenge his Brother's expulsion, or usurp after his death, he commanded him to Banishment. <hi>Kineard</hi> seeming really to obey, yet intending nothing less, with a small retinue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately hides himself in the neighbouring Countries, watching an opportunity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which he wanted not long; For the King resorting, as his custom was with a small Attendance, to a Ladies House of <hi>Merton</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> whom he much admired, he went by night and beset the place. <hi>Kinwulf</hi> first by perswasion from the windows sought to appease the Assailants, but that not doing, he sallies out upon them, and making at <hi>Kineard</hi> wounds him sorely, but overpowred with numbers, he is there fighting amongst them slain.</p>
                  <p>The noise of this great Accident soon came to <hi>Oseric</hi> and <hi>Wivert,</hi> two Earls, who not far off waited the King's return, who with some other Attendants hastning to the place, came up before <hi>Keneard</hi> could quite disengage himself from them, who still fought in their Princes quarrels. At their first approach <hi>Kineard</hi> stood upon his justification, excusing the deed by the injustice of his Banishment, and promising great Rewards if they would acquiess in his proceedings. But they upbraiding his Treason, and rejecting his proffers with disdain, beset him round, who fighting in the midst of them, was there cut in pieces with above an hundred of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p>The Body of King <hi>Kinwulf</hi> was conveyed to <hi>Winchester,</hi> and there buried. He is said to have founded the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> at <hi>Wells.</hi>

By her perswasion, or the King's own jealousie, <hi>Egbert</hi> a Prince of the Royal-Blood, whose Title was thought precedent to <hi>Birthric's,</hi> was constrained to go into Exile, which he was the more willing to do, for that he saw his life continually endangered by secret practices; At first he repaired to the Court of <hi>Offa,</hi> the only Warriour in those daies; but not safe with him, who had given his Daughter to <hi>Birthric,</hi> he went over into <hi>France,</hi> and served three years in the Wars under the victorious Emperour <hi>Charles the Great.</hi> The banishment of this Prince proved the exercise of his Vertues, as if it had been necessary that he who was to unite the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and rise higher than his Ancestours, was first to be laid low in affliction, and run through many hazards. And it is to be observed, that in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of any Nation so high, the grandure is generally performed by men who have undergon the greatest difficulties, and been tried in the severest Fortunes, so that as truly may be said, as to the person of <hi>Egbert,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Nation united by him, what was spoke of the <hi>Roman,</hi>
