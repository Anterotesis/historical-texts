            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For Ieſus pleadeth (by M. <hi>Dorrell</hi>) that his great name, which ought to bee glorious among all Chriſtians is highly diſhonored, by calling into queſtion his mighty power in caſting out Divells at the prayer and faſting of his holy people. On the contrary parte Satan, who long ſince moved the Phariſees (even againſt their own conſciences) to charge Chriſt with caſting out of Diuells by the power of Belzebub, doth eftſoons (by his inſtruments) traduce ſuch diſpoſſeſſion pretending it to bee but very counterfaiting. If then a loyall Iudge will diligently heare whatſoeuer can be ſaid in behalfe of her Maieſtie in a cauſe wherein ſhe is pretended to be a party, much more religiouſly will your Lo. (being a Chriſtian Iudge) heare whatſoeuer can bee ſaid in the behalfe of Ieſus, in a cauſe wherin he is pretended to be a party. And whether the name of Ieſus be more glorified (indeede) by vndoubted diſpoſſeſſion, or pretended counterfaiting, your faithfull hart ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quickly iudge.

For perceiving the people hereby occaſioned to take Ieſus for the Sonne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, he moved the Phariſees to traduce the ſame as before is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contrariwiſe Ieſus conceiving how highly this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle concerned the glorie of his Name, did never take his owne part more earneſtly then in iuſtifying the ſame. From whence wee may learne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Chriſt his people ſhould ſhew forth the vertue of him, by whoſe name they are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in mainteyning his cauſe ſo much the more reſoluſly, as Satan by his inſtruments ſhall oppoſe himſelfe malitiouſly. But ſo it is in this cauſe: For Satan perceiving thouſands of the beſt profeſſors (among whom not a few be honorable, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull, &amp; learned) occaſioned by the diſpoſſeſſion of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and 9. other to glorifie the name of Ieſus, yea ſo, that <hi>Nottingham</hi> (heretofore not ſo forward) became (for a time) very zealous (as I heare) in hearing the worde: Satan (I ſay) perceiving ſuch a conſequent of diſpoſſeſſion, moved ſundry adverſaries to traduce the ſame as Papiſts who deny any ſuch power to be in our Churrh, Atheiſts who ſcorne whatſoever tendeth to prove that there is a God or a Divel, But eſpecially certeine Prelates, who (being groſſer in their conceipt then the Phariſees) by diſcrediting 12. ſufficient Commiſſioners, 6. worſhipfull Gentlemen, and 6. learned Preachers, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing 17. ſufficient depoſitions, by withhoulding M. <hi>Dorr.</hi> from anſwering at large for himſelfe, make it (forſooth) a matter of counterfaiting. And yet I muſt needes ſay that the L.

Theſe thinges well weighed, it followeth that all Chriſtians ought to take this cauſe to heart: and to further the manifeſtation of truth, no leſſe zealouſly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prelats would obſcure it indirectly. If all Chriſtians, then eſpecially it behoveth your L. ſo to do, having authority even in that caſe.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the work of God by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the Devill, who either inwardly poſſeſſed her (which he rather beleeueth) or being without vexed her by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall operation. As may appeare by theſe ſtrange effectes: firſt Her belly was in the middſt as it were divided, and raiſed vp of either ſide. 2. Out of her belly was heard ſenſibly a kinde of whoopping, and alſo a noyſe much like the whurring of a cat. 3.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:13392:14"/>
Her belly ſuddenly ſwelled as if ſhee had bene halfe gone with childe, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with little or no increaſe about a quarter of a yeare. 4. This ſwelling would be ſuddenly gone, &amp; after a while be there againe. 5. Vpon and during this ſwelling ſhe felt ſomething (as it were quicke) ſtirr within her, which from the beginning ſhe ſaid was nothing like the ſtirring ſhee felt when before ſhee was with childe. 6. At laſt ſhee ſeemed to travell 2. or. 3. dayes, &amp; midwife after midwife was ſent for, and many neighbour-women, whereof ſome were of good worſhippe who will teſtifie the rare accidents. 7. In the beginning her belly was of the bignes aforeſaid and ſoft, the next day very bigg and hard as if ſhe had bene with child indeed, and at the point of deliuerance. 8. Sometimes again very big and ſoft, ſometimes very gaunt, and leſſe then any womans ordinarily is. 9. A moving (as of ſome quicke thing (yet no ſubſtance) was ſeene and felt about her ſtomacke: aboue her breaſtes, and in her arme or ſhoulder. 10 She had the paines of a woman in travaile, &amp; in danger of death, ſo as the bell was told for her. 11. There were all the ſignes and forerunners of a child: yea that iſſued from her which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Yet while theſe things were in doing, and preſently after, ſhe roſe out of her bedde and went vp and downe the houſe, &amp; for all this travaill kept ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their bed nor houſe. 14. In her breaſt was ſometimes water, ſometimes milke. 15. And after ſuch travaill M.

matter for a complement of that ſclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſchiſmaticall booke of <hi>Scottizing Genevating Diſcipline,</hi> that (through M.

            <head>To the Christian and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Report</hi> before promiſed (for ſome cauſes not ſent with this treatiſe to the preſſe) was omitted ſo long, as that (in meane while) the booke against M. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as for ſom reaſons it may ſeeme) by one, to wit th'authour of <hi>Scottizing Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevating diſcipline,</hi> is come foorth in deede; but fathered (as a bastard) vpon another, viz. S. H. Whereof I thought good to take knowledge, and to referre ſome fewe things to thy Christian conſideration.</p>
            <p>First concerning the Publiſhing thereof, Jt is to be obſerved, that as copies of Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were denied before hearing, and M. Dorrell not ſuffred to anſwer (as he ſhould) at hearing, So he is traduced in print after hearing, though he be yet in ſure holde, and therefore without conuenient meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in ſuch ſort, as this caſe requireth. Is not this to binde a man, and then to fight with him? Hath not the publiſher of M. Dorrels <hi>apologie</hi> ſome reaſon to call ſuch courſes <hi>exorbitant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:13392:42"/>Secondly, concerning the Matter: It is to be conſidered, That howſoeuer the Diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of M. Dorrels practiſes in teaching ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry to counterfeit poſſeſſion, be only preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet D. Barlowes opinion <hi>That in theſe dayes there is no poſſeſſion</hi> must needes be heere and there maintayned, and yet not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. J call it D. Barlowes opinion, Becauſe in proceſſe of disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the laſt Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Cambridge, he defended the ſame; yea ſo, that he would haue no poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (but obſeſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion) in Christes time. Notwithſtanding that worthy Vniverſity would not ſuffer him at firſt to profeſse ſo groſse an error, but (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting this word Ordinary) compelled him to ſet vp his question to this effect, <hi>In theſe dayes there is no Ordinary poſſeſſion, &amp;c.</hi> Now to what purpoſe is <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply denied? Marry, to cut Mai. Dorrels combe. For, if there be no <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> at all, then Sommers was not poſseſſed, and then M. Dorrels ſuppoſed crowne of glory may proue but a withered garland. Nay verily. If this were ſo, yet they gaine nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, neither is M. Dorrels cauſe the worſe. For what if there be <hi>Obſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>? &amp; ſo if Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were thus affected and tormented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, as he appeared in ſhew, is M. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell then to be condemned as an impostor?
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13392:42"/>
Yea further, admit Sommers to haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaited: why ſhould M. Dorrell deceiued by him, be puniſhed? Was that good man, of reverend memorie (M. Fox) deceyued by <hi>Anne Brigges</hi> &amp; <hi>Rachel Pindar,</hi> called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to question for the ſame? Hee was not.</p>
            <p>But how is this abſolut deniall of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion proved? Firſt, forſooth, by an Induction not vrged as a reaſon, but inſinuated like a fallacy, thus to be collected: <hi>Wil. Sommers, Tho. Darling, Kath. Wright, the ſeauen in Lancaſhire, &amp;c. Martha Broſſier</hi> (whoſe matter is diſcourſed by <hi>Abraham Hartwell</hi> &amp; publiſhed in the very nick with <hi>S. H.</hi> his <hi>Diſcouery) were cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeits: Therfore</hi> (as it is concluded p. <hi>77.) a Magiſtrate ſaide to Mengus, Of 50. exorciſtes 49. are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits. To whom Mengus anſwered: If I were not preſent, you would ſo iudge of me.</hi> O worthy <hi>Induction</hi> from a most ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient enumeration of vndoubted particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. But marke (good Reader) how like a ſquint-eyed man S. H. in his parting blow lookes one way, and ſtrikes another. For in the title he pretendeth to diſcouer Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Dorrells bad practiſing but with <hi>4:</hi> and yet, in ſundry places of the diſcouery, hee laboureth to proue the <hi>7.</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> to be alſo counterfeits, yea, though he confeſſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13392:43"/>
pa. <hi>4.</hi> that, touching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>examinations haue not bene taken.</hi> If the L.B. of London had tryed at first, how his Chaplaine could (by verie witt) without farther examinations haue made th' other <hi>4.</hi> Counterfeits in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all that would beleeue him, his Lp. might haue ſaued great charges, and paines bestowed in hunting after their ſuppoſed counterfeiting. Here is yet another note vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this <hi>Induction</hi> not to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, viz. That S.H. preſuming (belike) to be borne out, doth call into question the ſentences of death gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by her Maiecties Justices of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Determiner</hi> vpon the Witches, that bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the <hi>7.</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and the boy of <hi>Burton,</hi> to the publique and perpetuall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of thoſe her Maiesties Courts of Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Abſolute deniall of poſſeſſion is faced out by a ridiculous and ſlight (not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, but) evading from arguments fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by S.H. him ſelf from the word for poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, &amp;c. the refutation whereof I referre to ſome treatiſe that may be heereafter: alſo from the volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary confeſſions of witches the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; who, at their death haue confeſſed, That they ſent Divels into parties poſſeſſed. Indeed, if witches by deniall would excuſe themſelues, Such deniall for ſundry reaſons
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:13392:43"/>
might bee thought inſufficient. But ſeeing many witches, in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry Kingdomes &amp; ages, haue, by their voluntarie confeſſions, iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evidences and ſentences giuen against them, and when? Euen at their death when they ſee no hope to ſaue them ſelues by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſisting in deniall, what reaſon is there, why they may not bee thought guilty of ſending euill ſpirits into the poſſeſſed, whereof they were conuicted? S. H. auoucheth none, but ſuggesteth (pag. <hi>39.</hi>) that learned men haue ſufficiently confuted this already. But S. H. are you aſhamed of your learned men, or of their reaſons, that you neither quote th'one nor ſet downe th'other? Must J helpe at a pinch? If memory faile me not (as it may be it did S. H.<note place="margin">In his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of witchcraft</note>) M. <hi>Scot</hi> imputeth ſuch confeſſions to a ſtronge imagination ariſing from Melancholy the predominant humor of old women and ſuch like. O ſuperstitious Catholique Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly, that no leſſe ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrongly deludeth ſo many young, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as old, men, aſwell as women, and that at their executions! Tell me S. H. what you thinke <hi>bona fide:</hi> was it Melancholy that cauſed <hi>Hartley</hi> (who bewitched the <hi>7.</hi> in Lancaſhire) ſtifly to deny, both at the barre and gallowes, his diveliſh witchcraft: &amp; yet when he ſaw that breaking an halter would
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13392:44"/>
not deliuer him from ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging (as the Divell had promiſed) then penitently to confeſſe, that all wherewith M. <hi>Starky</hi> (in whoſe houſe the <hi>7.</hi> poſſeſsed were) had charged him, was very true? Yet admit the reaſon. But know withal, that your learned men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend theroby to dispoue not only poſſeſſion, but all witchcraft whatſoever, otherwiſe then by poyſoning. Are you S. H. of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion too? Why ſhould I doubt it? For doe not you hold (pag. <hi>36.</hi>) That Witches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſend Divels into men and women? and, Is it not as eaſie for witches to ſent Divels Into, as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto men? Heere Doctors doubt. But D. <hi>Barlowes</hi> reaſon at <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſtrikes all dead. For (ſaith he) one ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cannot enter into another. Heere is a dead blowe indeede. For, Jf neither ayre (which is a ſubstance) nor meate can enter into our bodyes, what will become of vs? Jf either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, why ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not the Divel, ſith he is a <hi>ſpirite</hi>? But admit that it is an harder matter to ſende the Divell Into, then <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto a man: I meane ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto, as to torment him, yet (me thinkes) S. H. doeth holde the deniall of one, aſwell as of th' other. For, by th'autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the ſame authours, who deny witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft in ſending Divells both <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto &amp; Jnto men,<note place="margin">Lib. 1.6.</note> he likewiſe indefinitly concludeth that

Barlowes reaſon at Cambridge Why in theſe dayes there is no poſſeſſion, was this: <hi>Chriſt came to diſſolue the works of darknes,</hi> &amp; <hi>vpon the Croſſe he triumphed ouer pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and principalities:</hi> Ergo, There is nowe no poſſeſſion. He may conclude aſwel, Ergo, There is now no witchcraft: yea no murder, no pride, no Jdolatry, &amp;c. Moreover, There is reaſon why it is expedient for S. H. inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly and implicatiuely to make witchraft doubtfull. For, If there be no witchcraft at all, then may he conclude, All M. Dorrels poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (which ar ſaid to be by witchcraft) must needes be counterfeitings. Who would looſe ſuch an argument? But conſider (good Reader) whether ſuch a concluſion tend not to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of Atheists.

yet he ſmiled (at no laughing matter, as ſom of the Bench tolde his L.) ſaying, <hi>That hee ſawe nothing that might not be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,</hi> and tolde, how many Counterfeits he had lately diſcouered. Wherevpon Iudge <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and other of the Bench thought it neceſſarie for the ſatisfying of the Iurie to vrge the Scriptures for proofe that there is witchcrafte, and (of their owne knowledge) to tell of ſundry bewitched, yea poſſeſsed out of whom Diuels ſpake: and of a childe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched to death whoſe eyes were fast clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet when the Witch came in preſence they opened, and (as it were) ſtared vpon the Witch. Second: How earnest his L. was to free an Atheiſt then and there arraigned for blasphemie against God. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his L. acknowledged that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist had bene before the high Commiſſion for ſuch blasphemie, yet he pleaded that the ſecular power had nothing to doe with him vntill the ſpiritual iuriſdiction had pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13392:45"/>
to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeit poſſeſſion? To drawe towards an ende. Whereas S.

H. will take in hande directly and ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistically to conclude his negatiue opinion from the Scriptures, ſonne (no doubt) of M.

Ioane was counſelled to burne her ſelfe; and going downe ſtayres to doe ſo, ſhe was violently thrown to the ſtayers foot, there lying (a while) for dead.

            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:13392:48"/>The Shape which they ſawe the Spirite then to haue, was a thick darke ſubſtance about a foote high; like to a ſugar lofe, white on the top. And (being charged) he did ſhoote vp in all their ſightes as high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as he ſhewed himſelfe before.</p>
            <p>As this ſpirit had a ſhape, ſo had he alſo an audible voyce: by which he ſpake and vttered many thinges. This voyce was not the maides, neither from her, nor yet of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſaue of the ſpirit it ſelfe. For; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the maide denyed it,) ſhe &amp; the ſpirit were heard ſpeak both at once; alſo, her lips were ſeene not to moue, when the ſpirit ſpake; and, ſome ſtanding neerer to th'one then to th'other, did ſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and diſtinguiſh both their voyces. Neither was this the voyce of any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait confederate; for, (to put this out of doubt) the houſe was ſearched, the parties in the maides preſence (except Io. Sheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, M. Randall, and Sy. Fox) were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the roomes vnder and adioyning to her, were full of people, and the houſe was beſett with divers who came to ſee and heare theſe ſtrang accidents, which indeed they did; for the voyce was eaſily heard to them all.</p>
            <p>This Spirit being demanded diverſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13392:48"/>
returned anſwers; ſaying, (among diverſe other things,) <hi>Joane, Ioane, I come for thy life; J will haue it, I am a Boy, a Boy; my name is Gyles; an old woman that dwells in the ſtreete gaue mee that name, to witt, Doll Barthram; She ſent me; I haue ſerued her</hi> 10. <hi>yeares, yea</hi> 20. <hi>yeares; She is now in priſon,</hi> (as indeede ſhe was); <hi>Nan Barthram ſent me now; I will kill Ioane to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow night; J will teare her in peeces; She hath giuen her life and ſoule to mee</hi> (which <hi>Ioane</hi> in parte acknowledging, viz. that ſhe had given him her life, hee laughed <hi>Ho, Ho, Ho.</hi>) To this whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>John Sheereman</hi> defying him) replyed, that he ſhould not haue her life, he ſaid, <hi>I wil haue thine then; I come to thee, J come</hi>; &amp; with that, offered towards him, to the great aſtoniſhment &amp; feare of him and the reſt preſent. And yet thus for that time he vaniſhed away.</p>
            <p>But, not long after, he returned againe; in maner as at the firſt (except ſcraping the wals.) When, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion of talke touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one <hi>Cavers</hi> wife, in the preſence of many, he ſaid: <hi>Tom,</hi> (which was another of the Spirites of the ſaid <hi>Doll,) and J, at Doll Barthrams commandement, did hang her. But first I led her into a ditch vp to the chyn and could not drowne her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13392:49"/>
I brought her out againe. Then Tom brought a rope and put it vnder her chaps, and I pulled her vp and hung her.</hi> Which ſeemeth to haue ben ſo, becauſe of the ſtrangnes of it. For, the rope werewithall <hi>Cauers</hi> wife was hanged, was but put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her chaps, not about her neck: and the nooſe was ſo bigge, that three mens heds might haue ſlipt through it at once.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this Spirite then declared, That he, (at <hi>Doll Barthams co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment</hi>) had killed a child, in the womb of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by nipping out the braines; and that hee entred into another partie and killed him, by tearing his heart in peeces. Both which ſeeme to be true alſo: for, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was deliuered of a dead child, &amp; the man did dye in a very ſtrange maner; and both at the ſame time that the Spirit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Then, after many ſpeaches vſed by the ſpirit, as, <hi>that hee would kill Ione, and teare Iohn Sheereman in pieces; that he was their God; and that he would not be content with the life of Ioane only, but would haue alſo the liues of Fox, his wife, children, and cattell, and that by the commaundement of Doll Bartharm,</hi> hee went away for that night.</p>

With this the maide was ſomewhat vnruly, and therefore was bound in a chaire with a long to well, very faſt. But ſhe (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Divell in her) ſtrugled and ſtrained ſo ſore, that it brake in pieces. Being againe bound in the chair, ſixe ſtronge men leaned with their whole ſtrength thereon, each al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſetting one foote on the rounde of the chaire to keepe it down. But ſhe, (though ſo bound) notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all their ſtrength, remoued the chaire round about the houſe, a yard at a time, they hanging thereon.</p>
            <p>After this fit ended, the maide was had to bed: And about eleaven a clock the Spirit came; not after his vſuall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aner, but with a great ſtroke on the bordes, like the fall of a greate ſtone. Wherewith, the people awoke, and the maide cried, <hi>Helpe, Helpe:</hi> &amp; then, a thicke ſhadow was ſeene to goe vp to the maides bed. Shortly after which, the maide was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, &amp; throwne ſo viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly againſt the wall, as if it would haue driven out the

ſide of the chamber. Then ſearch being made for the maid, ſhe was found lying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the ſtanding bed: From whence, it was as much as fower men could doe to pluck her. Neither was this great throw, and heavy waight, the only ſtrange thinges in this her fit: For, her eyes were ſunck into her head an inch. Her head and body were bent backwards, almoſt to her hips. She lay as it were dead. Her teeth were ſo faſt clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that a man could not ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, though with all his ſtrength he aſſayed it with his dagger and a key. And, (that which ſtrang is,) a ſtiffe dry Ruſh being put into her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels, ſo far, as it might touch her braines in the iudgment of them that were preſent, yet ſhe moved nothing thereat; neither at the violent bending of her fingers; nor yet at a great quantity of <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> which was powred into her mouth.</p>
            <p>In which caſe ſhe having lyen halfe an hower, at laſt ſhe opened one of her eyes ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing there with very ſtrangly; then th'other, crying, <hi>ô Barthram, thou hast killed mee.</hi> Then, being layed in her bed, ſhe ſo ſtriued to get out, that all there preſent (which were not a few for ſuch a purpoſe,) could ſcarſe hold her therein.

            <head>Another Report of like Argument.</head>
            <p>IN Caſtle Alley neere Broken wharfe in <hi>London,</hi> there dwelt a witch called <hi>Anne Kerke</hi>; who for her notorious miſchievous witcheries heereafter in brief deſcribed, was arraigned in <hi>London</hi> the 30. of November 1599. before the right honorable the Lorde <hi>Anderſon</hi> &amp; other of her Maieſties Iuſtices, and then condemned, and executed at <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> the 4. of December following.</p>
            <p>To let paſſe the Evidence, that of long time ſhe had ben ſuſpected for a witch; I will ſet downe the ſumme of th'other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences giuen in againſt her.</p>
            <p>Firſt, this witch falling out with a woman in the ſtreete, ſaid ſhe would bee meete with her, or hers. Wherevpon the woman going home and ſitting by the fire with her child in her lap, it gaue a great skreeke, and was ſuddenly changed; and after that continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pined away till it dyed.</p>
            <p>After whoſe death, her other child going vp <hi>Bredstreet Hill,</hi> met with this witch; who asked her how her ſiſter did. But before ſhe could make anſwer, ſhe was ſtricken downe in a very ſtrange maner; her mouth beeing drawne aſide like a purſe, her teeth gnaſhing togeather, her mouth foming, and her eyes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13392:51"/>
ſtaring the reſt of her body being ſtrangely diſfigured. When the witch was gon, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered out of this trau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; howbeit ſhe was ſtill oftimes caſt into the like.

            <p>Againe, at another time, this witch fell out with an Inkeeper; and in revengement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched his only childe ſo ſtrangely, as that by no means of Phyſik which he could get, it could be recouered; but ſtill it was from time to time tormented, till it dyed.
