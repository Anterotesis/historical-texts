            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to which purpose I have used such means and methods. That I might be the better understood by these men, I have endeavoured that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of these discourses (for the most part) might be plain and familiar, the phrase and expressions intelligible. I have made use of two feigned names. (<hi>Firmianus</hi> and <hi>Dubitantius,</hi>) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonate the sound Believer, and the doubting Sceptick Christian, who are brought upon the Stage, disputing by way of Dialogue, which is most suite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to men of short discourse, and most apt to comply with their apprehension. I hope the more learned Reader, (if any such shall give themselves the trouble to peruse this little Manuel) will not Censure the plainness of it, but rather commend the Charity of the Author to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>There is a great cause; I have been so long distracted betwixt diversity of Opinions in point of Religion, that I am now doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Religion at all, or any Supream invisible Deity to be worshipped.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>This is the common result of vain Jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, that they usually end in Atheism and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. But pray tell me, is it possible, that there should be such fierce disputes, and bitter conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about a very nothing? Certainly such sharp disputes about the various manners of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, do strongly argue that Religion is a thing of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40515:5"/>
highest concern, or that all the wisest men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were in the world are Fooles, and madmen, to oppose, hate, malign, persecute one another even unto death, for a groundless fancy, a very nothing.</p>

               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>Your discourse is very Rational, for I suppose wise men would never wrangle about a meer Romance; yet I confess I have had strange irrational thoughts, against the very Being of God, and the truth of any Religion.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>You justly term such thoughts irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Did not I once tell you, that when you had fors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Do you think that all Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, and Separatists from your Church, are Libertines and Atheists?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>I am not so uncharitable: but I must tell you, that causeless separation is a very greive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sin, and punished many times with the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>I fear those judgments have overtaken me: for since I became a Separatist from your Church, I have been very cold at my Devotion, made little conscience of publick, or secret Praier; of Obedience to those powers which God has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; of Love, Charity, Honesty, and Upright dealing towards my neighbours. I have lived an Atheist in practise so long, that I am now ready to

               <p>Truly Sir, you made good your name by your practise, which renders you a right <hi>Dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius.</hi> But pray tell me by what degrees, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, you have stept out of our Church into the borders of Atheism, that I may with the more facility bring you back the same way, by which you have unhappily gone out from us, into the bosome of your dear Mother.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Your Demand is reasonable. 'Tis not unknown to you that I was once a true son of the Church of England, you shall hereafter know for what reasons I left her Communion, and became a Presbyterian: and to be breif I stay'd not long, in that opinion, but presently I proceeded Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then Anabaptist, then Quaker, then Papist, then Antiscripturist, then what you now find me, almost an Atheist.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>

The Sun, Moon, &amp; Stars were made, Men, Beasts and Plants were made.

               <p>'Tis evident, by what you say, that the Sun has not moved from eternity, but how can you prove it did not stand still from eternity, seing there are some that hold it alwaies stood still, and never moved to this day, but that the earth moves and the Sun not at all.</p>

               <p>It hinders not the force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether you hold the earth move, and the Sun stands still, or the contrary; for 'tis but shifting the Scene, and puting the Earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the Sun, and the reason will be altogether the same.</p>

               <p>If the Sun stood still from eternity, then there was an eternal night upon half the face, or Globe of the earth, and an eternal day up on the other half, (or at least many other gross absurditie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No vicissitudes or changes of night and day, summer and winter, spring and autumn, and consequently no productions, or generations of Men, Beasts, Plants, for that half of the earth which was deprived of the light and heat of the Sun, (which as a second cause gives life and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the inferior Creatures, that have life and growth) could bring forth no vegetables, or animals; and the other half, which was alwaies scorched with too much heat, must of necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40515:10"/>Besides if the Sun stood still from eternity, what caused it to move in time? of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture certainly it could never awake out of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal sleep: if any thing else set it in motion, then either it must be somthing that was moved by some superior Cause, and this cause by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so to an infinite number of causes, which is absurd and impossible, or else it must be the first mover and efficient cause of all things, which is God.</p>

               <p>You have abundantly satisfied me, that the Sun had not an eternal being, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that neither men, beasts, or plants, could be from all eternity; however I desire to hear from you some particular arguments against the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man-kind.</p>

               <p>There is no particular man but had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beginning, was made and begotten by his Parents, they by theirs, and so we must ascend from son to father, up to all eternity, <hi>usque ad infinitum,</hi> which is utterly impossible, or else we must come to a first man, who could not make or beget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Now if every particular man be made, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, then the whole kind must be made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the whole kind is nothing else, but the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of all particulars. Every one of them we see by daily experience had a beginning, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten or made; therefore 'tis made by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for <hi>quicquid fit, fit ab alio,</hi> and this of some other, and so forward until we come to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream cause of all things, which is God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40515:11"/>Again, Either all men that are, or ever were in the world, were made; or some were made, and some not made, but had being of themselves: if so, 'tis impossible that these men should be of the same kind, with the men that were made, for that which is made depending upon another, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of the same kind with that which is not made and independent, because a thing that is not made, infinite, independent, is of another kind from what is made, finite, and dependent; and these two (finite and infinite, dependent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent) are opposite members, dividing one and the same most common kind.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a clear demonstration, that every particular man being made, the whole kind must be made; hut pray tell me, might there not be a perpetual successive generation of men up to all eternity, and so a <hi>processus in infinitum,</hi> an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of them without all beginning?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>This is altogether impossible; for in a Catologue, or Series of things, every one of which had a beginning, as 'tis evident that every particular man had (and consequently the whole Series) there cannot possible be a <hi>processus in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum,</hi> up to all eternity, or an infinite succession of causes and effects, without all beginning; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity properly so called, has neither beginning, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Series of men was made, therefore it had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for every particular man had a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore the whole Series, which is nothing else but a collection of all particulars, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be equal or comensurable to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is without beginning.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40515:12"/>
men; the dread of perjury in very heathens, the appearance of evil Spirits, their strange working in witches and wizards; which may be seen more largely treated of in Doctor <hi>Fotherbys Atheoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stix, Doctor Andrews Cattechisme, Du-Plessis truth of Christian Religion, Grotius of the same, Doctor Mores Antidote against Atheism, Parsons Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Doctor Stillingfleets Origines sacrae, Gales Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils Court, Mr. Baxters Christian Religion,</hi> with many others: I shall breifly sum up what these learned men have wrot at large, beginning with that argument which is taken from the Goodly fabrick of the world. 1. Twas excellently said of Tertul. <hi>lib. de Resur. facilius credas Prophetiae si sis discipulus naturae,</hi> if we be conversant in the works of nature, they will lead us to the knowledg and beliefe of Scripture. There is a most sweet harmony, betwixt those two Books, the Book of Nature and the Book of Grace. What is said of the one, <hi>monstrat Quaelibet herba Deum</hi>; every herb or plant does shew there is a God, is most true of the Scripture; <hi>Quaelibet linea Deum refert,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very line in this Book, shews us the power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and wisdome of God.</p>
               <p>And if the Atheist will disdain to read this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Commentary upon the Book of nature, let him seriously peruse the Text, the harmonious beauty and order of the Universe. Plato and some other of the Antients, were used to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the being of a Supream Deity by a Clock; whose hammer when it striketh sheweth the next wheele that moves it, that the next, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40515:13"/>
until you come to the Clockmaker; who made all the wheels, and caused their regular motions.</p>
               <p>Another instance is commonly made use of, If a man should travel into a far Country, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not inhabited, and there should behold some Goodly building, he would presently conclude it grew not out of the Ground, neither did the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Even so he that casts his Eye upon this Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fabrick of the world, must needs acknowledg the great Power and Wisdom of its Maker; He that shall seriously observe the harmonious order, the regular motions of its parts, must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth of that saying, Psal. 19.1. <hi>the heavens declare the Glory of God, and the firmament sheweth his ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A third argument may be drawn from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that there are Devils, evil Spirits, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their wicked Instruments, Witches, Magicians, Sorcerers, Conjurers, which none but a foolish Atheist (who will believe no further then his sight leads him) can doubt of.

What pranks and diabolical feats, have been acted by Witches and Conjurers, may be seen in those learned Authors, that have wrot against them; as Dr. <hi>Moor,</hi> and many others. And albeit the appearances of evil Spirits, Witch-crafts, &amp;c. are not now so frequent in this nation as heretofore, in times of Popery, and darke Ignorance, yet does it not therefore follo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40515:16"/>
but in times of knowledg and Gospel light, the Prince of Darkness uses all his arts to render men Scepticks in Religion, and of no Religion at all, Atheists, Infidels, Prophane: so that his very appearing would pull down his Kingdome, which he exercises over these wretches, who like Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees believe neither Angel, nor Spirit, nor any thing further then they can see.

               <p>Besides all this, there are degrees in good and evil; for of things that are good, some are better then others, of things that are evil some are worse then other. Now these degrees of good and evil, take their rise and fall by their aproaching to, or declination from that which is <hi>summum bonum,</hi> or the chiefest good; so that, if there were no best, or cheifest good, there could be no better or worse, no

good or evil at all, therefore there must be one infinite good.</p>
               <p>To conclude this first discourse; seeing the inclination of all People, to believe a God, the instinct of nature to confess it, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fabrick of the world to declare it, the force of wicked mens consciences to fear it; the Custom of civil nations to adore it, do abundantly prove that God is, yea doubtless that there is a God, that judgeth the earth, what a monstrous Creature is the fool Atheist, that saith in his heart there is no God?</p>

               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>These things being granted; that (not to mention other Creatures) as man had his being, reason, and understanding from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, so is he bound to serve him in that way and manner, which is agreeable to mans excellent nature, which must be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a reasonable service, which all the world, as well Pagans as Jews, and Christians call Religion, which according to all sober people comprehends duties of piety, as praier, praises and sacrifices, duties of temperance, sobriety, and chastity, duties of honesty, justice, righteousness, and all morality.</p>

               <p>There is nothing more evident, then that as there is a most wise and holy God, that made man, endued him with excellent facultys, of reason and understanding, so there is a debt and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty owing from man to God, his maker, which all the world calls Religion, and no people in the world were ever so barbarous, (saies <hi>Cicero</hi>) as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all Religion; yea there is such a tendency in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the nature of man (where tis not utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by brutish sensuality) that rather then he will worship no God at all, he will bow down to a Sock, or a Stone; so that clear it is, if there be a God the Creatour, and man by him created, there must of necessity be a Religion.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> do acknowledg that the Sacrificing of beasts came not from the light of nature; and you seem to make it probable that 'twas from divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and positive institution.</p>

               <p>You will be better satisfied, when you shall consider, That the founders of all Religions in the world, did pretend to Revelations, <hi>Numa, Lycurgus, Mahomet, &amp;c.</hi> which the devil taught them to do in imitation of <hi>Moses</hi> and the rest of the holy Prophets, who spake as they were moved by God. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.</p>
               <p>Now there being but Four Religions in the world, <hi>Iudaism, Christianity, Paganism,</hi> and <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>; If <hi>I</hi> shall prove unto you that <hi>Christianity,</hi> (whose rule and foundation is the holy Scripture) is the only true Religion, and the other Three false, I hope you will grant that the foundation on which it stands is the true Revelation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the Scripture is no invention of man, but given by Inspiration and Revelation from God, which is the summ of my first Argument.</p>

                  </gap>ip; for 'tis repugnant to all right reason, that one Creature should thus worship another, God alone being the proper object of such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, because in him we live, move, and have our being, and he it is that gives us life and breath, and all things; therefore <hi>Deo datori,</hi> to God the Creator, and giver of all good things, all religious worship is only due.</p>
               <p>Besides some of the wiser Heathens, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that there could be but one God;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40515:21"/>
'twas a common saying amongst them, <hi>dicite plures, dicite nullum,</hi> 'tis all one to say there are many Gods, as to say there is no God, for the notion which they had of God, was that he was <hi>ens infinitum,</hi> a being of infinite power and perfection; but natural reason shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that there could be but one infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, because infinite power, and infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, comprehends all power and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore it cannot be communicated to many, or more then one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Their Rites and Ceremonies were so ridiculous, and so filthy, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle stiles them <hi>abominable Idolatries,</hi> 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rules of Christian modesty, either to hear or speak of them. He that desires to see Paganism smartly and solidly confuted, let him peruse the antient Fathers, <hi>Lactanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Arnobius, Minutius felix, Eusebius, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus,</hi> St. <hi>Augustine de Civitate Dei, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I alwaies conceived Paganism, to be a most vain and vile superstition, contrary to the very light of nature, and I am no better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of Mahometism, however I desire to hear your reasons against it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>You may please to receive them thus; my first reason shall be taken from the novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, it being not much above a Thousand years since that false Prophet Mahomet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his rapsody of nonsence, <hi>fabulous fictions,</hi> and damnable Blasphemys to the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40515:22"/>First, From which I thus argue, truth is before falsehood, <hi>Illud verum quod antiquum</hi>; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world is now above 5500 years old, and seeing Religion has been practised in it from the Creation, tis absurd to imagine, there was no true Religion before Mahomet, or that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodness and wisdom of God, should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer gross errors to infect the whole world at least 3000 years before the true worship of his holy name was known unto men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Mahometism is a mixture of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism, Heresy, and Paganism, with some sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Christianity, A bundle of ridiculous fables, prodigious lies, as is evident to any that shall peruse the Alcoran.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, 'Twas propagated by the Sword, and such carnal weapons, by sensual motives, and promises of fleshly pleasures, to be injoyed by all those that should be followers of that grand impostor, which are so unworthy of the rational soul, that they cannot be called the cords of man, but are only proper allurements for those whose reason is sunk down into brutish sensuality.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>These reasons do sufficiently manifest the folly and falseness of this new or rather no Religion, but pray you inform me why you rank Judaism in the number of false religious, seeing tis grounded on the Scripturs of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you beleive to be a divine Revelation.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>When I reckon Judaism amongst false Religions, I mean only that religion which is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40515:22"/>
professed by the modern Jews, under &amp; against the Gospel, not that which their forefathers under the law lived and died in. Since the fall of Adam unto the end of the world there was and shall be but one true Religion, consisting of Repentance from dead works, holy obedience, and faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; so that the fathers before the law, the Israelites under the law, the Christians under the Gospel, were and are of one and the same Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the substance of it; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1.2.3. they did believe in Christ to come, the Christians do believe that he is already come; to them he was vailed in Types and shadows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to us he is revealed, and those shadows are vanished at the rising of the Sun of Righteousness with healing in his wings.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>

                  </gap> all Religions that are and ever were in the world, (except the Jewish under the law and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian under the Gospel, which are for substance the very same) are utterly false, and consequently their pretended Revelations, on which they are built, the inventions of men and Satanical Delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and that the Christian and the antient Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish being the only true Religion, it must follow that the Old and New Testament is the only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and divine Revelation; your Argument ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be very concluding; I pray you proceed.</p>

               <p>My second argument shall be taken from the excellency and reasonableness of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion.</p>
               <p>First. This Religion is most holy and spirituall;

Again it must be acknowledged, that the Pen-men of the Scripture, were very good men, or very bad, (for men of a cold indifferency they could not be.) If they were very good men, they would never have conspired together, to put such a cheat, such a grand imposture upon the world (as Anti-Scripturists would have the word of God to be.) If very bad, they would never have wrot with so much zeal, and earnestness against all manner of wickedness, and especially, against Lying and Hypocrisie. Certainly they would never have exposed themselves, to hazard lives and fortunes for no other reward, then to be esteemed both Knaves and Fools by all prudent men. Add to this that Lyers and Cheats do not usually agree one with the other; but there is such a sweet harmony &amp; consent betwixt the Pen-men of Holy writ, tho they lived at so great a distance from one another, that questionless they were acted by one and the same infallible spirit.</p>

               <p n="2">2. They are under a judiciall blindness; God has given them reason and understanding, eyes that they might see, hearts that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand; but they wilfully shut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that light, and then by the just judgment of Almighty God, this light is taken from them; they are given up to blindness of mind, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart, as were the antient heathens. <hi>Rom:</hi> 1.</p>

            <p>In a word the ancient fathers, who opposed the Eutychian haeresy, did make use of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall union of Bread and Wine, to the body and blood of Christ, shewing that the humane nature of Christ is not more changed into the divine then the Sacramentall Bread and Wine is into the very Body and Blood of Christ, therefore they believed no such thing, as that monstrous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish transubstantiation.</p>
            <p>So that we see the falsity and absurdity of it by Scripture, antiquity, common sence and reason; besides the great danger of Idolatry, in worshipping a piece of bread, if there be no transubstantiation, as some of the papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confesse, and they also acknowledge, that if the Priest, that consecrates were not rightly ordained, or that he did not actually intend to consecrate, or that he omitted any one Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (which they call necessary) at the time of consecration, that the Bread and Wine are not duely Consecrated, and consequently no transubstantiation, and therefore great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that the Papists in worshipping the

               <p>My Reasons are these; drawn</p>
               <p>First from plain Scripture, as <hi>Ierem.</hi> 14.14. and 23.21. where there is a complaint against those Prophets <hi>That Prophesied lyes in Gods name, and he sent them not.</hi> And again the same Prophet, <hi>I have not sent these Prophets, and yet they ran; I have not spoken unto them, and yet they Prophesied, therefore they shall not profit these people at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was this Sending and Calling a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry requisite only under the Law, but also in the time of the Gospel. The first that were ever call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and sent to preach the glad tidings of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, were the Apostles, who were first Disciples to the best of Masters, before they were sent out to Preach.

               <p>'Tis well worth our observation how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle makes the salvation of men to depend or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily upon the Preaching of Sent and Called Ministers; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Whosoever calleth upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis evident by the Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testament: That no man ought to take upon him the Office of a Minister, before he has a lawful Call from the Church, or can by working Miracles make it appear, that he is immediately called from God, which is not now to be expected.</p>

               <p>And 'tis as evident from the practise of the Church from the time of the Apostles, even to this present age; for he that shall peruse her Records shall find that whosoever did presume to take upon himself the office of publick Preaching, or Administation of the Sacraments, without an extraordinary Call, arrested by Miracles, or an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary one from the Governors of the Church, was ever accounted a Theif and a Robber, no true Shephard that entred in at the Church door, but crept in, or climb'd up some other way.</p>

               <p>This at the first sight seems to be a very smart objection: but if we seriously consider the words upon which 'tis grounded, it has no weight at all.

               <p>First, I shall shew you that Cathedrals, Deans and Chapters, (though not under those names) were from the beginning of Christianity. It is clear from the Acts of the Apostles, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church, that the Apostles and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (those spiritual Fishermen) cast in their nets where they were like to make the greatest and most advantegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous draughts. They usually Preached in the most Populous Citys, where they established Churches which anon after were called Mother-Churches, to which the Suburbican, or those that dwelt in the adjacent Villages were subject, and with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Churches made up the Bishops Diocess, which they governed (as St.<hi>Hirome</hi> confesses) by the common councel and assistance of Presbiters, termed at <hi>Rome</hi> in after times <hi>Cardinals,</hi> or chief Presbiters, and in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great (as the <hi>Magdeburgenses</hi> inform us) were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corpated into a Colledge under the name of Dem and Chapter; the Dean by the Canon-law being called <hi>Arch-Presbiter.</hi> Before the sounding of Universsitys, these Cathedrals were the Schools of the Prophets, where young Students were train'd up in the Study of Divinity and other good learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Gerard</hi> gives us a tast of their first institution, their corruption, and how they might be restored to their primitive uses. I could wish that some learned Person who has the advantage of Books, and well Studyed men to consult with, and leisure,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40515:66"/>
(all which we Country Ministers are deprived of) would write in the Vindication of Cathedrals, and manifest to this invidious age, that the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Deans and Chapters is very usefull to the Church, and very Antient, as I before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This was your second exception against Cathedrals, but a very frivelous one, drawn from the worst Topick, from personal abuses, to take a way the true use of the thing it selfe.

               <p>If Bishops, Deans, and Chapters, do not joyn together in the Goverment of the Church, 'tis the fault of their Persons not of their Institution. Deans and Canons ought to be of Councel to the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40515:66"/>
Bishop in a subordinate way; not to have cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power and Authority with him. If they are too much guilty of non-residence, (as it cannot be denyed but that many of them are,) this ought to be reformd by Mulcts and Punishments, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by those that have the power of collating those dignities, that they do not confer them upon any person that lives out of the Diocess, or at too great a distance from the Cathedral, which is a very great abuse and wants Reformation. As for the keeping of Hospitality, the cavil is just the same which the <hi>Egiptyans</hi> had against the <hi>Isralits,</hi> for not fulfilling their tale of Brick, when they deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them straw to make it. Sacrilegious hands have Robbed Cathedrals of many of their rich Mannors, and how should it be possible for Deans and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends to maintain that Hospitality which their Predecessors heretofore have kept. I know a Canon, of one of the most Auntient Cathedrals in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that his necessary expences in his Residence, &amp; journeys, being deducted, did not receive <hi>de claro</hi> five pounds yearly, for seven years in twelve. Now according to the law of God and nature, Families, Wives, and Children must be provided for; and how can such necessary provision and any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hospitality stand together, out of an Hundred Marks or an Hundred Pounds of yeary Income; which is more then some Cathedral Residentaries do receive to my knowledge? I wish that those of the Gentry who have their Thousands of yearly Revenues would forbear their squandring away of their Rich Patrymonies in vanities and very sinful courses, that they would keep Hospitality and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence, upon their own Rich Mannors, amongst

               <p>This is your Fift Exception, and 'tis indeed a very weak one; there being none who frequent this service, but know very well what is sung, (unless it be the full Anthem:) let those

               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>There is one exception yet behind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your Chore service; as the use of Musicall Instruments, in the performance of a great part of it, which are said to be <hi>Levitical,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unlawful under the Gospel, as we have seen in the <hi>Geneva</hi> Notes upon the last <hi>Psalm,</hi> as also in <hi>Aquinas, Quest.</hi> 22.9, 19. and divers other Learned Men.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>This is a very gross mistake; for Musical Instruments are not part of the <hi>Levitical</hi> law, never instituted by <hi>Moses,</hi> who was so faithful a servant in his trust that he would not have omitted to enjoyn them, had they been given him in Charge by All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. They were in use long before <hi>Moses,</hi> presently after the Creation of the world, for <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. we read that the rare gift of playing on Musical Instruments was given to <hi>Iubal.</hi> Can we imagine that such a gift was bestowed on him to Stir up wantonness and lust, by the more artificial singing, of unsavory Sonnets? Or is it not more rational to conceive that this skil in Musick was given to men to Sing forth the Praises of our great Creator in a more excellent manner? <hi>When we Glorify the Lord we ought to exalt him as much as we can</hi>: Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus. 43.30. And surely if Musick has a natural influence upon our affections to Stir up and quicken them in wantoness and daliance, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it may work the same effect, upon them to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40515:70"/>
quicken and enliven them in a more devout and intensive Praising of Almighty God in all those that have a Religious tendency, and a serious disposition to his worship and service; besides seing 'tis a moral and perpetual duty, to shew forth the Praises of God, all rational men will consent that this ought to be performed after the best manner, and consequently with such skil and are that has the greatest influence upon our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rather then after such a manner which renders the service of God mean and contemptible as 'tis rendred in many of our Parochial Churches.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>You have fully satisfied me that Musical Instruments in the service of God are not Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, but are natural means to Stir up the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in these sacred Hyms and Anthems. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless I have heard that many who are much tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with Chore Anthems, are much offended at the manner of reading of Prayers in Cathedrals; when they pray for the Sick, they use the ordinary tone which is used in Parish Churches, at other times they pronounce their Prayers in a middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Reading and Singing. Which seems to be not so grave and sutable to the Solemnity of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>

               <p>I confess this is a common objection, and some that are no enimies to Cathedral service have in this much desired a reformation, but this must be left to the prudence of those that set at the Serne; mean while we ought not to condemn the Quire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service for this seeming indecency, well knowing that the stress of Religious duties does not consist
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40515:70"/>
in the toning and modulation of the voice but in the Musick of the heart and affections, in a serious and devout fixing of the mind upon the things that are Read or Sung, the want of which, in those who Read Prayers or Sing Anthems, is no little sin, and one main reason why some of our Singing-men are not so seriously devout as they ought to be, &amp; real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those that are frequently present, officiating in holy duties unpreparedly, carelessly, formally, and irreverently, by Gods just judgment may be given up to a senceless stupidity, for their prophanation of the holy ordinances of God.</p>

               <p>First, This cannot be denyed, but the reasons are first, negligence in the Musick Masters, whose chiefest care it is to teach them to Sing, and the end why they Sing: namely to set forth the Praises of their Creator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither are they so careful to instruct them how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves reverently and devoutly at the worship and service of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Some of them are not set to the Grammer School, where upon they squander away a great part of their time in vain sports, and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is the Mother of all villany and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednss.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:40515:71"/>Thirdly. But the chiefest reason of all is that our Choristers are commonly the Children o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis a strange peice of nonsence that what is in it self lawfull and laudable should cease to be so, because 'tis commanded by our Superiors. True indeed, that things in themselves lawfull (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own nature but indifferent) if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as necessary and intrinsically holy, are upon that account unlawfull and repugnant to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty; but more of this when we shall di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, That the Spirit is stinted by a set Form; and that Reading of Prayers out of a Book, cannot be praying by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>To this I reply, That if their were any truth in these exceptions, how comes it to pass that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of Prayer more stint the Spirit, then set Forms of <hi>Psalms</hi> for Singing? Yea; does a set Form of Prayer more stint the Spirit then the extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary conceptions of the Minister limit and stint the Spirit of the Congregation, to whom they are upon this account in the nature of set Forms? When these queries shall be rationally answered, I shall through away all set Forms which have been used by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>As to the other part of the other exception that reading of Prayers out of a Book cannot be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit; this to those who understand the true meaning of that Phrase is a most frivilous cavill; for setting aside the extraordnary gift of prayer, to pray in, or by, the Spirit denotes first the making of our prayers according to the mind of the Spirit exprest in the Scripture, as may appear <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. Secondly, to pray by the Spirit, is to pray by that principle of grace wrought in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, and enabling us to every good duty, as well as to prayer. Thirdly to pray by the Spirit is when the Spirit do's stir up our hearts to this Holy duty, working in us good desires, and motions, quickning our faith and fervency, whereby our hearts minds &amp; spirits go along with out Tongues and Words, utterd either in a set Form or by our extemporary expressions, which is usually practized by knowing Christians in their Closset devotions.</p>

               <p>I confess I am not able to shew why set Forms of Prayer should stint the Spirit, more then set forms of Singing, and I am perswaded that praying by the Spirit, signifies no more then the assistance of the holy Spirit quickning and stirring us up to, and in, Prayer; whereby our hearts and spirits are fixed in that holy duty joyning and going along with the Tongue and Voice, but truly I find by experience that my Spirit is more stirred up by a Prayer that is new, which I never heard before, being lively deliver'd, then by a common Form read out of a Book.</p>

               <p>Besides, Set Forms are necessary for uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the publick worship; and upon this account learned and sober men have wished there were but one publick Liturgie in all Christian Churches in the world; which (if it were possible) would be a great means of peace and unity amongst Christians, by preventing the spreading of Schisms and Heresies, that may be as well prayed up as preached up; as also undecent, unscriptural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, tautologies, vain-repetitions, phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical affected words and phrases, utterly abhorrent from the sobriety and gravity of Divine Oratory, which is quite another thing from that of the Stage or Desk.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40515:77"/>

               <p>I do fully acquiess in the pious, prudent, and peaceable determination of this worthy man: and so from the exceptions that are made against the liturgy I desire your discourse may proceed to those which are made against the Ceremonies of the Church; 'tis superfluous to name them all. But only those which are most spoken against, the Surplice, the Ring in Marriage, Bowing at the name of Jesus, Kneeling at the Sacrament, and especially the Cross in Baptisme, which are said to be Popish and superstitions.</p>

               <p>As the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven does not consist in Meats, and Drinks, but in Righteousness and peace, Rom.</hi> 14. so neither does it consist in gestures, vestures, or any thing that is in it self indifferent; when the Church commands us to wear such a vestment, or to use such a gesture for Uniformity sake, and outward decency, not placing any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal Holiness, or absolute necessity in any of those Ceremonies: 'tis our duty and not any su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition at all to be obedient; yea we are guilty of the sin of disobedience, and superstition also if we stand out against lawfull Authority.</p>
               <p>For there is a two fold Superstition, one Positive, as when we ascribe Holiness to any thing that is in its own nature indifferent, morrally neither good nor evil; another Negative, as when we <hi>Dogmatize,</hi> and call that evil which Morally is not so, and in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40515:78"/>
such things, <hi>Weare not, Kneel not,</hi> is as much Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition as <hi>Weare or Kneel</hi> possibly can be.</p>
               <p>What is it to any understanding man, whether he Prayes or Preaches in Black or White or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colour, unless it be for decency and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? the power of the Church limits us to a White <hi>Surplice,</hi> rather then to a Black <hi>Iump,</hi> or short <hi>Cloak.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>But is not this an intrenchment upon our Christian liberty, to be confind to particular Modes and Forms?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>Not at all. So long as our practice only is limited, and our judgment left free as before any such <hi>Canon</hi> was made; 'tis strang that the same men who enjoyned three Ceremonies at the taking of the <hi>Covenant</hi> as to be bare Headed, bare Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the right Hand lifted up, should so much scruple them in our Publick Service.</p>
               <p>But in a word, 'tis plain Scripture, that <hi>every Soul should be subject to the Higher Powers, not onely for wrath but also for Conscience sake.</hi> Now unless the Non-Conformists can bring as plain Scripture against our Ceremonies, to prove them morally evil, they must incurr the sin of Schisme, and disobedience to those powers which God has ordained; and these are far greater sins then the wearing of a Surplice, though we had borrow'd it from the <hi>Pope</hi> himself.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>You mind me now of one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est exceptions against the Surplice, &amp;c. because the <hi>Papists</hi> use it in their superstitious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40515:78"/>
therefore 'tis unlawful for us to wear it in ours.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>If this were a good reason, 'twould follow; whatsoever the <hi>Papists</hi> do use or have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused in their Superstition, 'tis unlawful for us, (who have abandoned such trash and I rumpery to) use, but <hi>Papists</hi> have abused our Churches, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, and other Ornaments in their fals Worship and Services, therefore we may not use them; <hi>but down with them, down with them even to the Ground.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>This indeed will be a very necessary consequent, but a very costly one, I fear the men that make this exception, would not be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Build them up again: if Idolatry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, were a just cause to make us lay aside our Surplices; by the same reason we must pull down our Churches, and upon the same accompt the Primitive Christians ought not to have eaten meat offered to Idols, neither to have made use of the Heathens Tempels, to celebrate the Worship and Service of the true God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>You see then how frivilous the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Surplice is, and so are all those that are offer'd against the Ring in Marriage, bowing at the name of Jesus. Kneeling at the Sacrament, the Crosse after Baptisme, and therefore I shall very briefly pass them over.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Ring 'tis as Antient, at least, as <hi>Turtullian</hi> who lived about two hundred Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ, he makes mention of it more then once, and our Church do's use it as an ancient Ceremony, no ways essential to Matrimony.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:40515:79"/>2. Bowing at the name of Jesus is likewise ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Antient: The reason of it was, 1. To shew our readiness to yield obedience and subjection to him as our Lord and King; <hi>to whom all power both in Heaven and Earth is given, and to whom every Knee must bow.</hi> Phil. 2.10. The Antient Christians rather bowed at the naming of Jesus, then at the name of Christ, in opposition to the unbelieving Jews, who most of all Blasphemed that sweet and saving name of Jesus: which therefore they did indeavour the more highly to exalt. 3. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their certain belief of what the Apostle fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>at the name of Iesus every Knee should bow, of things in Heaven, things in Earth, and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earth, that all things should be subject unto him.</hi> Phil. 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Kneeling at the Sacrament, our Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to be the most humble and reverend posture, and therefore most suitable to so high and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Mistery, especially it being Administred with a Prayer; yet we do not condemn the practise of other Churches, where this holy Sacrament is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived sitting or standing; neither should they condemn us for Kneeling because Christ's Disciples receiv'd it in a Table gesture, to which we are no more bound then to the place, or time, in which they reciv'd it. An upper Room and after Supper as the learned Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> has evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Cross after Baptisme is also a very Antient Ceremony, which the Christians of the first ages, used in a couragious and undaunted oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40515:79"/>
against the Heathens, and Jews, who scoffed and derided them for beleiving in, and Worshiping a Crucified God for their Saviour, who could not save himself. True 'tis in process of time, the Cross was abused, to grose Superstition, and therefore say some, it ought to be laid aside, as <hi>Ezekias</hi> abollished the Brasen Serpent when the people made it an Idol.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dub.</speaker>
               <p>Much more ought the Cross to be taken away being abused to superstition, because 'twas but an humane invention, where as the Brasen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, was set up by Gods own direction and command.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Firm.</speaker>
               <p>Very true, but then let <hi>Ezekias</hi> do it, not the people on their own heads, without the Authority of the King. However the use of an innocent Ceremony ought not to be taken away because of 'its abuse; and here it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, whether it be better to use the Cross to put us in mind of our duty, not to be ashamed of Christ Crusifi'd, as also of the courage and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Primitive Christians, who not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Scoffs and Reproches of Infidels, would make such open profession of their Faith in Christ Crucified, as to use the sign of the Cross, not only in Baptism, but also upon sundry other occasions; or else, whether 'twere better to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the use of it, because it has been so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused to Superstition: let the Suprem power judge which of these is fittest to be done, and determine accordingly either for the Negative or the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative; and I believe every sober and peacable Christian will esteem it his duty to submit unto

               <p>I confess, some moderate men have thought so, especially since we are frustrated of of one main end, for which our first reformers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them, which was to draw over the Papists into the Communion of our Church, which they did adhere unto, for the Ten first years of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> until they were interdicted by the Popes bull, But seeing we are deprived of all hopes of that much desired issue and that by the cunning of Priests and Jesuits, stirring up and animating the Conformists and Non-conformists against each other, about these Ceremonies. Our differences amongst our selves do daily increase and multiply; some wise and peaceable men have desired that the use of certain of those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies might be forborn at least for a time, which not withstanding, they are still continued.

Many well meaning people observing certain abuses in Church and Common-wealth, much desired a reformation of them, and promised to themselves great things from the Long Parliament; whereupon (such is the brutish inclination of earnest desires, and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations in the minds of men, that are of short discourse) that these poor inconsiderable persons, were engaged against King and Country, before they had well weighed, That good Intentions cannot justify unlawful Actions; That God has no <hi>need of the sinner: That we must not do evil, that good may come thereon.</hi> But I am perswaded that these seduced men do see their former errors, and are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
