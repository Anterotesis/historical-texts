            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Our <hi>Laureat</hi> himself cannot escape Calumny, (though I

must confess he too much dar'd it) that Reward of Wit (Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to Poets) he finds could not defend him from the blast of a Criticks Breath. In spight of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s self they will attaque him; some thinking to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Wits for only impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daring to meddle with it.</p>
               <p>Thus was he (for sooth) taken to Task, Post-poned, and there Lash'd on both sides by the two, too unkind Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, <hi>Oxford</hi> first taking him up, while his Mother <hi>Cambridge</hi> Chastised him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely. In the first place, for forgetting his old Grammer Rules. So rigidly strict were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60792:20"/>
they to keep him to the scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Precepts of their (long since <hi>exploded</hi>) Pedantry, <hi>befet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi> his <hi>fugitive</hi> fancy in the Poetick Transport, that he should not hereafter Sore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the near Ken of their slow and short sighted Genius; and next for abusing his Grandsire <hi>Shakespeare,</hi> and Father <hi>Ben,</hi> and being very sawcy with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Elders. But he is hush and done, say they, while they seem to hold a little Rod, made up of a few Stalks of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive sense, they had spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully spoil'd the beautifull Bed of his best Flowers off, &amp; pick'd out to lash him with. And fain would they have confin'd his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60792:20"/>
                  <hi>Licentious</hi> Muse (as they brand her) to her <hi>Nunnery:</hi> But they since may see how briskly she turns up her Vail, and with a modest scorn acquaints them in the words of her <hi>Heroe.</hi>
                  <q>That he hath neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment enough upon him to write any thing in his own Defence; neither will he gratifie the Ambition of two wrethed Scriblers, who desire nothing more than to be answered:</q>
Finding he wanted not Friends, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Strangers, who defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him more strongly, than his contemptible Pedant could Attaque him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60792:21"/>By this becoming scorn you see how he prevents them from further undertaking against him, when (like a Morose or Frumpish odd Fellow, bob'd in the Street with a by-word) had he turned again he would have had half the Town hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at him. Thus he shews more Wit in his slight and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, then possibly he ever would by his Pen when it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms best; though I truly believe that he is able to make those piece-meal Features, which his over curious Criticks examine so illy apart, to appear in their right place and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no less then what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self says, as so many real
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60792:21"/>
                  <hi>Beauties</hi> in the Eye of such as are able to judge and admire the true perfections of a Muse.</p>
               <p>Sir, I speak this because I know you have always had a just value for Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Poems, as well as my self, and I have believed you very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this way; and so he cannot easily be brought low in your esteem; you too well perceiving the Design of his Enemies without more words.</p>
               <p>But to inform you further, having, Sir, lately the leisure of an Afternoon, I took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to go among the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60792:22"/>
to enquire what else there was <hi>newly</hi> extent: I chopt upon an an Adventurous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who had took on him to write <hi>Remarques on the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Conversation of the Town</hi>; which had not been long abroad, but it was seized upon by the sharp Claw of a Critick, and by him Stigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the Name of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques</hi> upon <hi>Remarques.</hi> I was unwilling, and thought it vain to read one without the other, and so thought best to buy neither.</p>
               <p>But the Bookseller would still impose further on me, and presents me with another new piece, called the <hi>Rehearsal
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60792:22"/>
Transpros'd,</hi> &amp;c. a Title I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not I confess: But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a thing that had twice troubled the Press, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Booksellers word that it was worth reading, I took it. But having spent my time and Money upon it, all I could say was, I found my self very <hi>Wittily</hi> beguil'd of <hi>both</hi>: But (believe me) I think I might as well have read <hi>Tom</hi> of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln,</hi> or <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Southampton,</hi> for ought I edified by it, and would pay thanks to boot to any little Boy to change with me.</p>
               <p>Yet truly I must confess, <hi>Wit</hi> there was in it, but like a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60792:23"/>
                  <hi>Iewel</hi> in the <hi>Dunghill</hi> of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, not worth the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Ingenious Mans ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for. But the <hi>Crab-tree</hi> Stock of some Mens Humours will bear no better Fruit; yet methinks they should not then carry their <hi>sower</hi> Sentences to the Press, they seem so little <hi>serviceable</hi> or <hi>seasonable,</hi> and cannot be counted <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Apples. But some Mens petulant Homours incline them still to transpose the Proverb, which says, <hi>'Tis better to be at the latter end of a Feast, than the beginning of a Fray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you must understand <hi>Transprosal</hi> is the little <hi>a la Mode</hi> Word that at present obtains
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60792:23"/>
and has of late made such a deal of Gingle Gangle abroad, by the help of <hi>Transprosing.</hi> The <hi>Rehearsal Transpros'd</hi> (Answer) the <hi>Transproser Rehearsed,</hi> &amp;c. But how extreamly pleasant is it to observe how wittily the Transproser turns Transposer, and finds himself sport at Tick Tack for half a Dozen Pages together, and all with two poor Letters [<hi>I.</hi> and <hi>O.</hi>] I warrant the Man has a most extraordinary fancy at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Anagrams and Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, and is excellent at Wire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing Wit, that can so prit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily play with two Letters so long, and they happened to be lucky ones for his turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:60792:24"/>Every one will have a bob at <hi>Bayes,</hi> though alas he is not likely he get a wreath of it, for the Wit he lays out upon it. And now the yelp is up, 'stoo him <hi>Bayes</hi> Cries one; Hollo <hi>Bayes</hi> Cries a second, <hi>Whoop Bayes</hi> a third, enough to worry one out of his <hi>Wits.</hi> I cannot tell what better to compare it to, than like the clapping and scolding of a ragged-canting Crew of <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingsgate</hi> Rhetoricians, or those of <hi>Rosemary Lane,</hi> where if any will once but give the <hi>Cue</hi> of one Word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocative, he shall presently hear a full Peal of most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Harmony indeed. You
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60792:24"/>
shall not meet with a Term so mild as <hi>Gregory Father Gray Beard</hi>; they could have furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with a Title ten times more Taking, (<hi>ex Tempore</hi>) and possibly more intelligible too. But hang't, let it pass, it comes all to one purpose.</p>
               <p>Having thus given you some hints of this hatefull Humour, I would fain draw to a close with my Discourse, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only a few <hi>Cautionary Remarques</hi> to direct you in your choise of Men. And what your own Judgment will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to you, will render the rest odious enough to your generous mind, without any further reflections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60792:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>If we consider the mischief as well as degenerosity of this <hi>Destructive</hi> Humour among Men, either in <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> we would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shun it with greatest desta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As then you have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect for your own Peace and Quiet, endeavour still to keep your self unconcerned from impertinent listening after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or prying into private or publick Reports of this sort; for that you must either betray, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably bring in question your Friendship if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it; or if perhaps on the other side you impart it, you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60792:25"/>
but kindle Coals of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and beget private grudges and heart-burnings, and make your self in a mannner bound either to accuse or vindicate, and had therefore much better to be deaf and dumb in such concerns in both Offices.</p>
               <p>Be sure therefore to shew no kind of Countenance to such as can find no other means to screw themselves in to your opinion and favour, than by this treacherous way of tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing others to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60792:26"/>Nor would I have you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver apt to lissen to, or trust him that fain would be tickling you with adulatory praise of your parts and qualities; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if the Party be a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to you, and one that you never any ways had obliged before; for 'tis common with some sort of men to put on a fawning familiarity upon the first Acquaintance they have with any one, to make lavish offers of Friendship and service to you. Sir, (I say) take good heed of such a one, least there be (as 'tis odds if there be not) some Sting of Design at the end of their Tail.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60792:26"/>Besides, what can sound more harsh or untunable in the Ear of the generous, wise or modest, than to hear an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiastick Harangue or Elogy of Praise personally addrest to his Face. Musick fit for none but Fools to caper at; alas! they must be but silly <hi>Trouts,</hi> that will be so tickled to death. The saying of <hi>Tully</hi> ought to be every true Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's; <hi>Nolo esse lauditor, ne vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear Adulator.</hi> Now (for ought you know) this great Praise may be but <hi>Ironice prodere Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam</hi>; the Man that speaks so &amp; so, may possibly mean nothing less, but the quite contrary; but be sure he that hath any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60792:27"/>
Sense, will not be imposed on at this rate; but will soon find it out, and know how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort it in the like Language.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, where this kind of Flattery on both sides takes, as said, sadly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and indeed, then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not there be more pleasant Diversion, than to see two Asses bray out Applauses to one another. This is <hi>Mulus mulum scabit,</hi> or <hi>Kee me, and I'le kee thee,</hi> as the old Proverb speaks. But certain it is, none can be flattered of another, till he first flatter himself.</p>
               <p>One may observe a sort of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60792:27"/>
Natural Rhetorick, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Common Professors of the Art of Railling; they have their Figures, Graces, and Ornaments peculiar to their kind of Speech, though they do not distinguish or use them Grammatically, by the Names of <hi>Sarcasmus, Asteismus, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cterismus, Antiphrasis, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entismus,</hi> or <hi>Ironia,</hi> yet have they their Dry <hi>Bobs,</hi> their Broad <hi>Flouts,</hi> Bitter <hi>Taunts,</hi> their Fleering <hi>Frumps,</hi> and Privy <hi>Nips.</hi> Besides the use of their admirable Art of Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they have a cunning way of Jeering, accusing others by justifying themselves, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I never did— or by asking
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60792:28"/>
the Question general, Who did so and so? Why who did you Whore cries 'tother? did I? and so the Game begins; but by this evasive way of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse they will be sure to keep wide off the Law's Tenter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks.</p>
               <p>Thus you see there is none can come out Master of this Art that hath not been brought up at <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> for only there are found the best Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients of this kind, which while some of our Authors are but the bashful Imitators; alas, see how far they fall short of the true force and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy that is to be found in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60792:28"/>
the perfection of this Faculty.</p>
               <p>But I have deviated a while from my first discourse, giving you the fore-going Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I now come again to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the end of Writing, and what is most commendable. The principal end of Reading is I am sure to enrich the Mind; and doubtless that is the best Work where the Graces and the Muses meet. But where every Man thinks what he lists, speaks what he thinks, writes what he speaks, and prints what he writes, from such kind of scribling, carried on by a frantick Figgary, I do not well apprehend what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60792:29"/>
can in the least accrue one way or other to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, either to the enriching their Discourse, or advancing their Knowledg.</p>
               <p>Nor is it easie to conceive the drift or design of this odd fantastick way of writing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of a skilful <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,</hi> they having more need of Notes and a Comment, than the History of Don <hi>Quixot,</hi> without which you shall be no more able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend our Author, than ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to carry off the Intregue of one of our Now-adayes Comedies, so hard it is to force the Poetick Fire out of

               <p>I cannot tell how this way of Writing comes to be now the Mode that so much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, I mean of Detracting and Traducing Persons; for I do not remember the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Author of the Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Reflections upon the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Bar and Pulpit,</hi> so much as once mentions, much less commends this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing or speaking, as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60792:30"/>
either modish, modest, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; but gives this Gentle Lash to the Users of it, That nothing of that kind is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with <hi>effect,</hi> when too <hi>personally</hi> addrest: and that though with <hi>civility</hi> we may glance at, yet may we not without <hi>rudeness</hi> and ill man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, too openly stare upon the faults or imperfections of any Person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Detraction</hi> is an old Vice, although it be but newly come into request among us again: It was the sin of <hi>Haman</hi> against <hi>Mordecai,</hi> of <hi>Saul</hi> against <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> of <hi>Iezabel</hi> against <hi>Naboth</hi>; and there are whole Psalms

of Execration for this Sin.</p>
               <p>I find an old Poet of ours <hi>(Gower)</hi> Declaiming against this Vice in this manner.

               <head>A Worthy Man DESCRIBED.</head>
               <p>A Right <hi>Bred,</hi> or <hi>Worthy Man,</hi> will <hi>scorn</hi> to be so <hi>base</hi> as to <hi>Flatter,</hi> and <hi>hates</hi> to be so <hi>Currish</hi> as to <hi>Bite</hi> any any one; so that even his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs</hi> seem <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>generous,</hi> and his <hi>Wounds</hi> do not want their <hi>Balsome.</hi> You may read his Temper in his Face; he fleers not at a Reproachful Jeer, but shews his dislike in his looks; he stands aloofe when Men Whisper, and is no greedy Listner after Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60792:36"/>
his Tongue never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes his Heart, and Report can find no Eccho in him. When you Lodge in him a Secret, your necessary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion locks it safe up, and your self keeps the Key. It is his Grief to know a Vice of his Friends, and his Charity he shews in concealing it; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver over-Praises nor Underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues any man, for his Prudence instructs, that the one stirs up Envy, and the other procures contempt. He that can be brought so low as Fear or Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, must not presume once to own the Forfeited name of Gentleman or Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60792:37"/>First he cannot lay claim to the Moral Virtues of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Truth, or Civility, so that he is neither fit to be a Friend or an Umpire in any Affair. Fear and a little meanacing makes him Faulty to Both; nor is he to be Trusted with another Mans Reputation, who has not Courage to defend his own, if questioned. A good Poet says,
<q>
                     <l>Defend the Truth, for that who will not die</l>
                     <l>A Coward is, and gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the lye,</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He that hath a Cowardly fear within him can never be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60792:37"/>
a true Christian, but like the After-penetent Apostle, he will be apt in time of Trial to give his own Heart the Lye, and Deny the Lord that <hi>bought</hi> him. He cannot hold the Truth till it wax <hi>hot</hi> in his Hand, or ever endure a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom for it: But like the wretched <hi>Italian,</hi> panting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hasty Threats of a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Enemy, (in hopes to save his Life) Belch'd out (as bidden) Horrid <hi>Blasphemies,</hi> to gratifie the Will of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting Enemy; till in the midst of them he Stabs the Naked Wretch, and then Brag'd how he had <hi>doubled</hi> his Revenge, Destroying <hi>Soul</hi> and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60792:38"/>
                  <hi>Body</hi> at <hi>one</hi> Blow. But this only by way of illustration to clear the last Assertions of the Degenerate <hi>Effects</hi> of such <hi>sure</hi> Symptomes of Cowardice and Unchristianity.</p>
               <p>I have not yet done with our <hi>Detractor,</hi> I must take him a little further to Task be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I give him over; and ask of him, What <hi>Amends</hi> he can make to the Party, whose Fame and Repute he hath Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Traduc'd and Vilified.</p>
               <p>For doubtless if we respect Human Society, there cannot be a more <hi>pernicious</hi> Ill atend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; 'tis a giving up a Mans
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60792:38"/>
Name to <hi>perpetual</hi> Infamy and Reproach; an <hi>irreparable</hi> Wrong, towards which the <hi>best</hi> Amends falls <hi>short</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. A <hi>Blot</hi> never to be <hi>raz'd</hi> out, but by <hi>writing</hi> the whole <hi>fair</hi> over again in way of <hi>Recantation</hi> (Publick <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> being ever due to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Injuries</hi>) and when that's done too, to Retract does not make <hi>full</hi> Compensation, since he that does it cannot be <hi>sure</hi> that he who saw his <hi>first,</hi> shall read his <hi>last</hi> also.</p>
               <p>So that he who offends in this kind, does it not only to his Lifes, but the Worlds end in a Book, which cannot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and therefore Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>I have read a <hi>Fable,</hi> how that <hi>Reputation, Love,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> made a Covenant to travel o're the <hi>World,</hi> but each was to take a several Way.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60792:39"/>
Parts where either <hi>Famine</hi> or <hi>Diseases</hi> are <hi>rise.

They long expected a Direction from <hi>Reputation,</hi> who stood mute; being urg'd to assign them Places where they might find him, he sullenly answered, his Nature was such, that if he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted</hi> from any Man, he never came to him more.
