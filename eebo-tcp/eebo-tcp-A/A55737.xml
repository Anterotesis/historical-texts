            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>To the Right Honorable the LORD MAYOR of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the reſt of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Juſtices of the Peace for this Town and Borough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> ſitting in open Seſſions at the <hi>Bridg-houſe-Hall</hi> in the ſaid Borough, on <date>
                     <hi>Friday</hi> the Twelfth day of <hi>January, Anno Dom.</hi> 1682.</date>
               </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>We the</hi> Grand-Jury, <hi>Summoned and Sworn for this preſent Seſſions of the Peace, holden for this Town and Borough of</hi> Southwark, <hi>do with all Humble Deference to our Superiors, Preſent as followeth,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT what the Wiſe and Learned King <hi>James,</hi> his Majeſties Royal Grandfather of Bleſſed Memory has, from his Own Obſervation, and ſad Experience (among other things) ſo ſolemnly Aſſerted in His Excellent <hi>Book of Inſtructions</hi> to his Eldeſt Son Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> concerning the <hi>Puritans</hi> of that Age, may as truly be affirmed of the generality of the <hi>Separatiſts</hi> of our Times; to wit, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Baſil. Doron,</hi> p. 31.</note> 
               <hi>That they are the very Peſts in the Church and Common-weal, whom no Deſerts can Oblige, neither Oaths or Promiſes Bind; Breathing nothing but Sedition and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, Aſpiring without Meaſure, Railing without Reaſon, and making their own Imaginations (without any Warrant of the Word) the ſquare of their Conſcience; and that ye ſhall never find with any High-land, or Border-Thieves greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and more Lies and vile Perjuries, than with theſe Phanatick Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That Popery and Phanaticiſm being equally groſs Defections from Primitive Chriſtianity, and equally deſtructive of the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government of theſe Kingdoms both in Church and State, equal Zeal and Vigor, as we humbly conceive, ought to be uſed towards the Extirpation of them both: And the rather, for that it is plain from <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Papers, and other unqueſtionable Evidence, that ever ſince his Majeſties happy Reſtauration, both Papiſt and Phanatick, for the compaſſing their end of Subverting the preſent Eſtabliſhment, have been united in their Endeavours to procure a <hi>Toleration,</hi> as the only means to accompliſh it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That all who do leſs than their <hi>utmoſt</hi> towards the Suppreſſing all Conventicles prohibited by Law, and yet ſtile themſelves his Majeſties <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> are meer Uſurpers of that Title. And that all who plead for the Relaxation of the Penal Laws againſt either Popiſh, or Proteſtant Diſſenters, at this time, under what ſpecious Pretext ſoever, are, in our opinion, Enemies to the King and the Proteſtant Religion; and are either ſuch as live in the open Breach of thoſe Laws, or ſuch others as lie under a juſt Suſpicion of being Penſioners to the Pope and the <hi>French</hi> King, and engaged in a Conſpiracy againſt the Government.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And whereas the often repeated Experiments of Lenity and Indulgence towards Diſſenters have been ſo far from rendering them more Modeſt in their Behaviour towards the Government, that on the contrary they are thereby become more Audacious in their lewd Practices againſt it; and thoſe who take upon them to Preach in Conventicles, are generally obſerved to take Occaſion, from the faint Execution of the Laws againſt them and their Followers, moſt blaſphemouſly to entitle God Almighty to an Eſpecial, nay, even to a Miraculous Protection of them in their Diſobedience to his Vice-gerent, and thereby to make more Proſelytes to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than they could do if they were not proſecuted at all: And whereas alſo from the Practices of the generality of the Diſſenters in diſpenſing with Oaths and Sacraments in Matter and Mode repugnant to their commonly avowed Principles, meerly to qualifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for Places of Truſt and Profit, it is undeniably apparent that they daily proſtitute the moſt Sacred Rites of Religion to ſerve their ſecular Intereſts, and thereby have baffled their own pretences to Tenderneſs of Conſcience, and are become a Scandal to the Chriſtian name. Therefore we humbly conceive, that the only way to maintain the Honor of Chriſtianity, to preſerve the Kings Perſon, the Monarchy, the Religion Eſtabliſhed, the publick Peace, the juſt Rights and Liberties of his Majeſties Loyal Subjects, to defeat the Deſigns of that accurſed Mixture of <hi>Atheiſts, Papiſts, Democraticks</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> of which the Faction, which has ſo much annoyed the Government, is compounded, and to faſten a juſt brand of Infamy upon the Impoſtors, and charitably to reſcue and undeceive their deluded Diſciples, is a thorow and impartial Execution of the Penal Laws againſt all Diſſenters whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Moreover, we of this Borough labouring more particularly under this Grievance, that perſons notoriouſly Diſaffected to the Royal Intereſt, are through Arbitrary Incroachments upon the ancient Rules and Uſages of Choice, become the Majority of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of Royal Foundation among us, and ſo effectually the diſpoſers of all Offices and Employments relating thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the managers of a large Revenue belonging to the ſame, and generally abuſe the Power and Reputation they gain thereby to the perverting of thoſe who prefer a ſordid Intereſt before Duty and Allegiance. We offer our humble Opinion that a ſpeedy Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in that matter would be a very ſeaſonable means of relieving us, that ſo the numerous Party of Honeſt Trading men of this vaſt Body may be no longer diſcouraged in their Induſtry, or cramp'd in their Loyalty by the Artifices of thoſe who meditate our Ruine.</p>
            <p>Upon this humble Repreſentation of our ſenſe in the Premiſſes, we pray that this Honorable Court will take ſome effectual courſe for the Suppreſſion of all the Conventicles in this Borough; and exerciſe its utmoſt Authority in order to increaſe the Number, and ſtrengthen the Intereſt of his Majeſties Loyal Subjects among us.</p>
