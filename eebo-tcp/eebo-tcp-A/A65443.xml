         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Great Searcher of hearts has ſeen, neither is it unknown
to ſeveral Chriſtians in and about this City of <hi>London,</hi>
or to the Conſciences of my very Enemies, what Severe
and Cruel perſecutions I have ſuſtained for the ſpace of
Eighteen years, from the unſpeakable Tyrannies of an <hi>Hard-hearted
Yoak-Fellow:</hi> and ſince, from the bitter zeal of ſeveral eminent profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of Religion, commonly call'd <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> VVho have moſt unjuſtly
and unchriſtian-like cauſed all their pretended Church power to wait
upon and ſerve the wrath of my oppreſſors; and who not being
able truly to charge me with any ſin committed againſt God that call'd
for ſuch a proceeding, have declared me an <hi>Heathen,</hi> and a <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
for <hi>matters of Conſcience,</hi> in which I was faithful to the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of God, according to the Scriptures of Truth, and obey'd the
voyce of the Lord, who called me out from amongſt them, that
I might not partake of thoſe Terrible Plagues, and dreadful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which are coming upon all <hi>Formaliſts, Hyppocrites,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Perſons,</hi> who are all of them the Inhabitants of this Earth;
and who (however ſeparated from one another <hi>now,</hi> by outward
forms, and obſervations, or inward notions and opinions, in that <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
and <hi>great day</hi> of the Lord, which is coming upon this Nation,
will be found to be in <hi>one Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>cauſe</hi> in this reſpect, being committed to Almighty God, the
Righteous Judge of all, unto whom I have <hi>appealed,</hi> and who has accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my <hi>appeal,</hi> and is ſpeedily ariſing on my behalf, I will ſay nothing of
<hi>it</hi> here. But only acquaint thee, whoever thou art, that readeſt theſe
few lines, that it has pleaſed my moſt gratious God and Father (<hi>who
abounds towards his Children in all wiſdome and prudence of Love</hi>) to turn
all the fierce wrath of man, which has been againſt me, into his own
praiſe: And to change all the evil mine Enemies have thought
and done againſt me, into a ſweet deſigne for good; making all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35375:3"/>
my <hi>unſpeakable ſufferings</hi> from man, my <hi>wonderful ſupports</hi> and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances
from God,</hi> a <hi>figure</hi> of his <hi>intended diſpenſations</hi> towards his
<hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>people</hi> in this Nation: Revealing to me how <hi>Babilon</hi>
the Mother of Fornications is in her inward principle and
Spirit, as alſo in her outward practices and pollutions, ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the whole face of the Chriſtian world; and every where
found among the litteral and outward Churches: How her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions,
forceries, and fornications are <hi>here</hi> moſt bewitching and
dangerous, becauſe ſhe <hi>here</hi> comes forth as the <hi>myſtery of iniquity,</hi>
dreſſing and adorning her ſelf in all the forms and notions of the
heavenly things, ſitting, and ſhowing her ſelf in the <hi>Temple of God:</hi>
As alſo revealing to me, that the judgments which are determin'd
to come upon her, ſhould begin at the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> the <hi>Formal
Carnal Notional</hi> Chriſtians, the worſhipers in the <hi>outward Court:</hi>
And that the flood of the Divine vengeance having ſwep't away
what is to be deſtroyed <hi>there,</hi> the Rod of Gods anger ſhould be
thrown into unquenchable fire, and the indignation of the Lord
ſhould end in the utter deſolation, Ruine and confuſion of the
<hi>Prophane world</hi> and <hi>groſſer Babylon.</hi> And that theſe things are at the
<hi>very door,</hi> and ready to enter upon us as an <hi>Armed Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe the mouth of iniquity is opened againſt me, and I
bear the reproaches of the <hi>mighty ones</hi> wherewith they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
the foot-ſteps of the Lord and his deallings with me;
repreſenting me as a <hi>Proud, Paſſionate, Revengful, Diſcontented,</hi> and
<hi>Mad</hi> VVoman, and as one that has unduly publiſhed things to the
prejudice and ſcandal of my Husband; and that have wickedly left
him: deſigning (according to the craftineſs and ſubtlety of the
old Serpent in all Ages) by Marring my face, to darken and
diſappoint my Teſtimonie from the Lord, which I am with
all convenient ſpeed making ready for publick view. In great
tenderneſs to all people concern'd in my Teſtimony, and that they
may be the better prepared to receive the ſame when it ſhall be
layd before them; I do in the preſence of the moſt <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>Jealous</hi>
God, who is <hi>our God,</hi> and yet a <hi>conſuming fire;</hi> and in a deep ſence of the
manifold weakneſſes, infirmities, and paſſions I am ſubject too,

That I am not conſcious to my ſelf of any <hi>ſpiritual pride</hi> in this
matter, nor in the leaſt deſirous to have any appearance, or to make
any noiſe in this VVorld. Nor durſt I for ten thouſand worlds
pretend to come in the Name of God, or in the pride and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of my own Spirit put my ſelf into this work, without his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
command concerning it, and his Spirit and preſence with me
in it; having learnt what unprofitable things the <hi>Staff</hi> and <hi>Mantle</hi>
are, without the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Prophets:</hi> how dangerous and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
an attempt it is, to put the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of God
upon the <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Viſions</hi> of my own heart. I am well aſſured,
if ſpiritual pride, the eagerneſs of my own ſpirit, any worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
or any other deluſion whatſoever has engaged me in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Teſtimony, the holy God will diſcover me herein, and take
open vengeance on all my <hi>Inventions,</hi> my <hi>Idols,</hi> and <hi>ſtrange Gods;</hi>
and that this matter will prove unto me like the waters of <hi>Jealouſie</hi>
unto the ſuſpected perſon. And I have alſo through the tender
mercies of God, the riches of an aſſurance, that my <hi>God</hi> who has
been ſo many years <hi>Emptying</hi> me from Veſſel to Veſſel, <hi>breaking</hi>
me all to peices in myſelf, and making me to become as <hi>nothing</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; and who has by many and great Tribulations been <hi>bowing</hi>
my own will, and fitting me for his ſervice, and who having taught
me to tremble at his <hi>word,</hi> has thereby call'd and commanded me
into this work, when I was as a thing that <hi>is not</hi> in my own eyes,
and pleaded with him to be excuſed, I have I ſay, the <hi>riches of an
aſſurance,</hi> that this <hi>God</hi> will be with me; and however the Spirit of
prophecy in a poor weak VVoman ſhall be diſpiſed by the wiſe and
prudent of this world, yet <hi>Wiſdome is juſtified of her Children;</hi> and
that <hi>God</hi> who has commanded me to go forth in his <hi>Name,</hi> will
by a <hi>Divine power</hi> go before me, making way for me, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
the Spirits before me which I am to deal with, and will alſo
by a <hi>Divine preſence,</hi> ſupport me in the midſt of all thoſe ſufferings
his work can bring me into. <hi>Out of the mouth of Babes and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
God has ordained ſtrength, becauſe of his Enemies, that he might
quell the Enemy and the avenger,</hi> Pſal. 8. 2.</p>
            <p>And I declare, I have no wrath, diſcontent or revenge in my
Spirit againſt the perſon of my Husband, or of any of his abettets;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35375:4"/>
but am taught by the forgiveneſs of <hi>God,</hi> freely to forgive all the
Injuries he has done me; and my hearts deſire and prayer to <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
(who can alone change the heart) is, that he may be converted,
and ſaved; and I bow my Soul to the Father of lights, that the
Eyes of all my perſecutors may be opened; ſome of which I judge
to be the Lords People, however acted in this matter by a <hi>Zeal
without knowledg. God is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells in
God, and God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And however I am cenſured and reproached by perſons who
judge onely according to <hi>outward appearance,</hi> but not <hi>Righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
that I have unduly left my Husband; I do for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of all plain hearted ones that may be offended at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
herein, Declare, <hi>firſt,</hi> That it would be very eaſie for me,
from the great Law of <hi>ſelf-preſervation</hi> to juſtifie my preſent ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
from my Earthly Husband to all perſons who have learn't
to judg of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> not onely according to the <hi>outward Act,</hi>
but the <hi>inward Spirit</hi> and <hi>Principle;</hi> and who have <hi>tenderneſs</hi> enough,
duly to weigh the various Tempers of minds, and the different
circumſtances of Bodies: Foraſmuch as the Natural conſtitution
of my mind and Body, being both conſidered, <hi>He</hi> has in his
barbarous actions towards me, a many times over-done ſuch things,
as not only in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of them will be one day judged a murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, but had long ſince <hi>really</hi> proved ſo, if God had not wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſupported, and preſerved me. But my natural life, through the
ſpringing up of a <hi>better,</hi> not being otherwiſe conſiderable, then as it
is my duty to preſerve it in a ſubſerviency to the will and ſervice of
that God, whoſe I am in <hi>Spirit, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> I will not urge any
thing of this nature as my defence upon this occaſion, having learnt
through the mercy of God, not to be affraid of him, who can only
kill the <hi>Body,</hi> but can do no more. I do therefore <hi>ſecondly,</hi> in the
fear of him who can kill both <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> further declare, That I
was forced to fly to preſerve a life more pretious than this natural
one; and that it was neceſſary to the peace of my Soul, to abſent my
ſelf from my earthly Husband, in obedience to my Heavenly Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
who call'd and commanded me (in a way too terrible, too
powerful to be denyed) to undertake and finiſh a work, which my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35375:4"/>
earthly husband in a moſt cruel manner hindered me from perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſeizing, and running away with my Writings. And however
man judges me in this action, yet I am ſatisfied, that I have been
obedient to the <hi>Heavenly Viſion</hi> herein, not <hi>conſulting with fleſh
and blood.</hi> All the clouds of afflictions, troubles, ſorrows; and
deaths, upon the outward man, are nothing, compared with thoſe
of the inward man; when the life of our Souls is angry, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws
himſelf, cutting off the ſweet beams of a ſpiritual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
between himſelf and us. This was my caſe, and I am not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
or aſhamed to ſay my Soul's beloved has abundantly owned me
in this matter: and whilſt men have done all they can to break my
heart, he has bound up my Soul in the bundle of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi>
and he pleads my cauſe, and takes my part, and has ſpoken by his
Word, with power and authority from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>I ſhall abide

                  </gap>th him, and he will abide with me, and come and Supp with me, and
never leave me, nor forſake me:</hi> And he bids me take no thought
what I ſhall eat, what I ſhall drink, or wherewith I ſhall be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but caſt all my care upon him, for he careth for me. And I am
enabled in his power to role my ſelf upon him; and my heart is
fixed, truſting in him; and comforted with his word, in which he
has cauſed me to hope, having no confidence in the Arm of Fleſh,
knowing that the Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof; and
that he knows all my weakneſſes, and wants, and my willingneſs
to work, ſo far as he inables me, that my own hands may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
to my neceſſity, that I may not be burdenſome to any. And
he has aſſured me, that the man of the earth ſhall oppreſs no more;
no more ſhall I return to be under the hands of the hard-hearted
Perſecutors, unleſs he become a new-man, a changed man, a man
ſenſible of the wrong he has done me, with his fierce looks, bitter
words, ſharp tongue, and cruel uſage. And I do further declare,
That in the true reaſon of the caſe, I have not left my Husband, but
he me. That I do own every <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Command</hi> of God in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his word, to be <hi>right</hi> and <hi>true;</hi> and do ſubmit to every <hi>rule</hi>
given forth by the Spirit of God, to govern the relation of Man and
Wife <hi>in the Lord.</hi> And that I always ſtand ready to return to my
Husband, or to welcome him to me: (and have ſignified ſo much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35375:5"/>
to him by ſeveral Chriſtian friends) provided I may have my <hi>juſt</hi>
and <hi>neceſſary</hi> liberty to attend a more then ordinary call and command
of God to publiſh the things which concern the <hi>peace of my own Soul,</hi>
and <hi>of the whole Nation.</hi> In which work, I ſtand not in my own
will, but in the will of him who has <hi>ſent,</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> me; as the <hi>day</hi>
will very quickly declare, and decide this matter between me, and
my Husband, and all his abettors. To which <hi>day</hi> I do here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
for my juſtification, not doubting but that God to whom I
have committed my cauſe will ſpeedily ariſe, and cauſe my <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
to break forth as the <hi>Noon day.</hi> For I do hereby declare in the
preſence of the moſt holy God, that I have no revengful, worldly
or ſiniſter end in this matter, but am againſt my own natural will
obeying God herein: And I do in all tenderneſs admoniſh and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all my Enemies, and all perſons whatſoever to whom theſe
Papers ſhall come, that they take heed leaſt they <hi>hurt themſelves,</hi>
in <hi>reproaching me;</hi> and that they do not ſet themſelves to <hi>juſtifie</hi> by
the <hi>letter</hi> that <hi>Spirit</hi> that is to be <hi>condemned,</hi> or to <hi>condemn</hi> that
<hi>Spirit</hi> which it ownes and allows. And that they take heed leaſt
they urge the <hi>letter</hi> of any command againſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> of it, and
ſo come to condemn <hi>themſelves</hi> in the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>caſe</hi> of another.
The <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>letter</hi> are no where <hi>contrary,</hi> but thou mayſt
think them ſo; and by not duly attending upon the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the
<hi>letter</hi> mayſt unnaturally ſet the <hi>letter</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>Spirit</hi> from
whence it comes, to which it teſtifies, and whither it tends. I beg
of you all that read theſe lines for your <hi>own ſakes,</hi> that you will
remember ſtill how the <hi>Jewes</hi> did of old, vilifie, reproach, condemn,
and execute our Saviour, and juſtified themſelves herein by the <hi>letter</hi>
of the Law of God; with the <hi>breach</hi> of which Law they were
continually charging <hi>him</hi> throughout his whole life, yet was it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
according to their own Law, and in thoſe very caſes about
which they were ſo much offended at him. Nor has it fared other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with the <hi>whole ſeed</hi> of Chriſt and all the ſpiritual manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of him in all ages. The beſt of Men, and Principles, have
ſtill been challeng'd for their <hi>Non-conformity</hi> to the <hi>letter</hi> and <hi>outward
rule,</hi> although they have been moſt agreeable thereunto. As the
Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>not without Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:35375:5"/>
And I do further declare, that the things I have publiſhed and
written, and which are ſuch an offence to my Husband, and indeed
the cauſe of all the Perſecutions I have ſuffered from others, were
written ſorely againſt my own natural <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> That I often
beg'd of God I might rather die, then do it. That I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of God to record them. That my own natural temper was
ſo greatly averſe to it, that for eleven months together I withſtood
the Lord, till by an Angel from Heaven he threatned to <hi>kill me,</hi> and
took away my ſleep from me: And then the <hi>terrors of the Lord</hi> forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to obey the command. And indeed, the writings that man
was ſo diſpleaſed with, were in themſelves very warrantable, if I had
not had any ſuch command of God, for I only wrote the <hi>way</hi> he lead
me in a wilderneſs of affliction for 18 years, to do me good; and
declared my <hi>experiences,</hi> my <hi>great</hi> and <hi>wonderful deliverances,</hi> my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>anſwers</hi> of Prayers in difficult caſes from time to time: but moſt
true it is, I did not ſpeak of theſe things, nor ſet Pen to paper (for
ſeveral reaſons) till the Lord <hi>commanded</hi> and by his word
and Spirit conſtrained me ſo to do at 18 years end, after
I was conſumed with grief, ſorrow, oppreſſion of heart, and
long travail in the wilderneſs, and brought even to the gates of
Death, and when paſt the Cure of all men, was raiſed up by the
immediate and mighty hand of God. And being thus <hi>healed,</hi> I was
commanded to write, and give glory to him who had ſo miraculouſly
raiſed me up from the grave. And I do further declare, the things
I have written are <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>no lye:</hi> and that what is ſo diſtaſteful in
them to man, are ſuch things as I could not leave out, without <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi>
to the Truth, and <hi>diſobedience</hi> to God. And what ever cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
I now undergo from <hi>mans day</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> for this plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in matters which concern ſo near a Relation in the fleſh, I am
well aſſured my faithfulneſs to God herein, will be owned in the <hi>day</hi>
of his <hi>impartial</hi> and <hi>righteous judgment.</hi> And yet I muſt declare, it
would have been much more agreeable to my Spirit, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
the miſcarriages of my Husband, then to have expoſed them,
if I had not been under a <hi>command</hi> herein not to be <hi>diſputed:</hi> and
it was not without great <hi>reſiſtings</hi> that I was at length made <hi>obedient,
having taſted of that love, which both covers, and teaches us to cover a
multitude of ſinnes:</hi> And yet I am fully perſwaded, that my duty
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35375:6"/>
to <hi>God</hi> in this matter, will be found not only moſt <hi>reaſonable</hi> and
<hi>neceſſary</hi> on my part, but <hi>exceeding beautiful in its ſeaſon,</hi> and to have
been mannaged in ſome meaſure of the Spirit of that <hi>God,</hi> who is
ſtill <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>in whom</hi> there is <hi>no fury,</hi> however he <hi>marches againſt,
goes through the Bryars and Thorns, and burns them together when they
are ſet againſt him in Battle.</hi> And whereas my Enemies have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
me as one <hi>diſtracted,</hi> and <hi>beſide my ſelf;</hi> in anſwer to ſuch
wicked proceedings againſt not only <hi>me,</hi> but the <hi>truth,</hi> I do for the
Truths ſake further ſay, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That I judge my <hi>Enemies</hi> who have
raiſed this falſe report of <hi>me,</hi> to be <hi>themſelves</hi> moſt highly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that this their <hi>Report</hi> ſhould be found a <hi>Lie;</hi> for as much as
if it were otherwiſe, the <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>occaſion</hi> of my diſtraction might
juſtly be laid at their own doors; for as the <hi>Preacher</hi> ſays, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.
<hi>Oppreſſion makes a Wiſe man Mad. Secondly,</hi> And yet I alſo judge
it is the <hi>miſtaken</hi> and <hi>rotten Intereſt</hi> of my Adverſaries, not only to
<hi>report,</hi> but to <hi>believe</hi> me a perſon beſide my ſelf: for if I be ſound
in a <hi>right mind,</hi> how <hi>Mad</hi> muſt they be diſcovered to have been,
in their blind rage and fury againſt <hi>me</hi> and <hi>my Teſtimony. Thirdly,</hi>
I do with great chearfulneſs receive the <hi>reproach</hi> of this <hi>report;</hi> and
all the <hi>humiliation</hi> that goes along with it; as a further <hi>meaſure</hi> of
my <hi>conformity</hi> to my <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip with him in his Sufferings.</hi>
For thus has <hi>he</hi> throughout all ages been <hi>blaſphemed</hi> in his <hi>Prophets,</hi>
his <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> and in <hi>himſelf.</hi> Thus when <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſent a <hi>young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
with inſtructions to anoint <hi>Jehu,</hi> his Fellow-ſervants askt him;
<hi>Wherefore came this Mad fellow to thee?</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. Thus we read
in <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. That <hi>the Kindred of our Lord went out to lay hold on him,
for they ſaid, he is beſide himſelf.</hi> And again, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>Many of the
Jews ſaid, he has a Devil, and is mad. Fourthly,</hi> I do with great
pleaſure acknowledg, that in this great work (<hi>in which I am ſet for
a ſign and a wonder</hi>) I have <hi>no wit, no wiſdom, no underſtanding, no
will</hi> of <hi>my own.</hi> And if this be to be <hi>mad,</hi> I confeſs my ſelf to be
<hi>beſide my ſelf to God;</hi> whoſe Love <hi>conſtrains me,</hi> and whoſe Spirit
has in this matter after an irreſiſtable, but ſweeteſt manner, <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated</hi>
my proper underſtanding, will and affections, to his Divine
wiſdom and will. And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I am well aſſured, that it will
<hi>ſpeedily, very ſpeedily</hi> be known, that I am not <hi>mad,</hi> as my Enemies
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35375:6"/>
have reported, but have <hi>ſpoken forth the words of truth and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
I have not <hi>run</hi> before I was <hi>ſent;</hi> but the word of the
Lord is, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit is upon me.</hi> And he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
every <hi>Iota</hi> and <hi>title</hi> of his own word, to overthrow <hi>Babylon</hi>
with ſuch an overturning, as never was, nor never will be again.
The beginnings of this overturning will within a few days be ſeen
upon her more refined parts, and the ſeverity of the wrath ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
come upon her Walls. Although man is ſo confident
I am deceived, and has loaden me and my Teſtimony with all
manner of reproach, yet the God whom I ſerve and obey, and
who has ſpoken by me, will ſpeedily turn the flood of ſcorn,
contempt, bitter railing, falſe accuſations, ſcandalous papers, and
lying Pamphlets upon them, by whom they have been poured out
againſt me. <hi>The Lord fruſtreth the tokens of the Liars, and maketh
Diviners mad; he turneth wiſe men backwards, and maketh their
knowledge fooliſh: but he confirmeth the word of his ſervant, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
the Counſel of his Meſſengers,</hi> Iſa. 44.</p>
            <p>And now in this <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> I do ſhut up this my <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
and <hi>preparitory Teſtimony, Declaring</hi> unto all people whom
it may concern, That it is the Lord has mooved me, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which has ſtirred me up. My heavenly Bridegroom is come,
and has given me courage, with an humble boldneſs, and holy
confidence to ſpeak the truth in all faithfulneſs, and to fear no
man, but God alone, in whoſe ſtrength I ſtand to encounter
with all diſcouragements from my own underſtanding, will, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
former thoughts and principles within; and with all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
from difficulties, dangers, temptations of friends, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies
of enemies without; I am ſenſible any of theſe things
would be too ſtrong for me, a worm of no might or ſtrength; but
I have renounced my ſelf, and laid down my own wiſdom and will
in this work, and am given up to all the will of God herein, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon my watch, and having in his power <hi>put on the whole Armor
of God, the Shield of Faith, the Breſtplate of Righteouſneſs, with my
Loyns girt about with truth, and my feet ſhod with the Preparation of the
Goſpel of peace, having taken the Helmet of Salvation, and the ſword
of the Spirit, which is the word of God, Praying alwaies with all prayer
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35375:7"/>
and ſuplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and ſupplication for all Saints.</hi> In this ſpiritual warfare, and
combate I am called to wreſtle not only againſt <hi>fleſh and blood,
but againſt Principalities, and Powers, againſt the Rulers of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this world, and againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places:</hi> and
muſt have no reſpect of perſons becauſe of advantage, but be
faithful to God and his Word, ſparing neither Friend nor Brother
in matter of Truth, nor calling <hi>good evil,</hi> or <hi>evil good;</hi> nor put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>light</hi> for <hi>darkneſs,</hi> or <hi>darkneſs</hi> for <hi>light;</hi> but obeying God, and
not Man; loving him above all, keeping his Commandments,
and pleaſing him, although the whole world ſhould be diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Man has made my Cup very bitter, and my Croſs very heavy
for obeying <hi>God,</hi> but my <hi>God</hi> has ſweetned my Cup, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it to overflow with draughts of Love; my <hi>God</hi> has made my
Yoak eaſie, and my But then light, becauſe he bears me and them;
he draws me, and <hi>binds me with Cords to the Altar, his left hand is
under my Head, his right Hand doth Embrace me, and his Banner
over me as Love. I muſt not, I will not</hi> be affraid to make my
boaſt of my <hi>God,</hi> by whoſe Almighty Power I have been hitherto
helped, and upheld, or elſe I had periſhed in my afflictions. When
the compaſſion and bowels of man were ſhut up, the tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>God</hi> were opened. When it was come to <hi>Mordecay</hi>'s
pinch, <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s diſtreſs, <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſtreight, God appeared. My ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
was his opportunity; he beheld my affliction, the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
and Agonies of my Soul; my groans, my prayers, my cries,
my appeals aſcended up for a memorial before him, and were had
in remembrance with him. And he will ariſe, and that right
ſpeedily, he will make haſte and not tarry, but ſend relief from
Heaven, and ſave me, and all the poor of his Flock who heat the
voice of their own Shepheard, and follow him, but a ſtranger
they will not follow. He will ſmite the Rocky heart, he will
convince the Conſciences of men, he will bring down all them
that glory in appearance, in face, and not in heart; he will make
a ſpeedy deciſion, he will turn the ſtream and flood of ſcorn and
contempt caſt upon me, and his poor deſpiſed ones in me; <hi>he will
ariſe to our joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed that have hated us without a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35375:7"/>
cauſe, and caſt us out for his Name's ſake,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let the Lord be
glorified.</hi> I have committed my way unto the Lord who judgeth
righteouſly, who will not ſuffer the guilty always to go undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and unpuniſhed. He will take the Cup of trembling out of
my hands, and put it into the hands of them who have afflicted
me, who have ſaid unto my Soul, <hi>Bow down that we may go over:</hi>
and he will make their own <hi>Tongues to fall upon themſelves,</hi> and
<hi>will meaſure out unto them again, the meaſure they have meeted.</hi> The
Lord has ſaid it, and he will perform it. The Lord will plead
my cauſe, and the cauſe of all his meek ones: but his anger is
kindled againſt all <hi>Formality, Hypocriſie, Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
He knows the ſecrets of all hearts, we are all open and
naked in his ſight: there is no diſſembling in his ſight, no mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before him, no outward Form, no empty Opinion can ſhelter
from his wrath. Upon the 13. of the Twelfth Month 1673. The
Lord wonderfully diſcovered to me the unprofitableneſs of the beſt
outward forms of Religion without the Power: and what a great
deal of blindneſs, injuſtice, falſe accuſations, barbarous uſage,
bitter and cruel zeal, with all manner of wickedneſs, has at this
day taken Sanctuary in the exacteſt Forms according to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which are without the Spirit, yea, in enmity againſt it: It
was the time four eminent Profeſſors of the people called <hi>Baptiſts,</hi>
did in a moſt rough and ſevere manner come to deal with me, to
accuſe me falſly, and blindly, and bitterly to rebuke me, although
I was then in a very weak and dangerous condition of body. And I
mention it here, becauſe it is a time in remembrance with the
Lord, and <hi>God</hi> was in that very ſeaſon pleaſed to open mine
eyes, to ſhow me where <hi>Babylon</hi> was, what Spirit ſhe was built
upon, and how the Lord would begin to ſtrike at her, and throw
her down, and then it was he called me out from her, that I might
eſcape the anger I then ſaw was kindled againſt her. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are now juſtifying themſelves, and their proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, and have condemned the Innocent; yet an appeal has
been made to <hi>God,</hi> and accepted by him, and he will ſearch out
this matter, and make a true and manifeſt judgment of it, for there
is nothing <hi>hid</hi> from him, and this matter is now become a <hi>publick
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35375:8"/>
figure.</hi> Yes, I am ſatisfied God will ſpeedily ariſe, and decide this
controverſie, and he has ſhown me when I have been thinking
his Chariot wheels move ſlowly, that then his motion has been
ſwifteſt: And that whatever ſeems to hinder, and work againſt
me, does indeed help on, and work things to a more full and
perfect end. And although I ſhould be ſurrounded, and beſet on
every ſide, and left alone in the midſt of all diſcouragements from
<hi>within,</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> yet can I believingly call to all that fear the
Lord to come and behold the wonders of the Lord for my deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
I cry'd unto him when there was none to help me, and
in a deep ſenſe of my own unworthyneſs and nothingneſs, my Soul
was humbled, and laid low at his foot, and my heart was lifted
up to him. and he raiſed me from the Grave, and took faſt hold
of me at that very time when heſo wonderfully healed me, which
was the 3d of the 11 month, 1670. Then was the full communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between Chriſt and my Soul, the Love knot, the comly bands
of Marriage; then did he eſpouſe me unto himſelf for ever, and
enable me to follow him, and give up my ſelf as a thank-offering
unto him, no more to be my own but the Lords, ſubjecting my
ſelf to all his will as a chaſt Virgin, holy in lip and life, pure
and undefiled in heart. Then did the Lord my God ſay unto me,
<hi>I even, I am he that comforteth thee; who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt
be affraid of a man that ſhall die, and of the Son of Man which ſhall be
made as Graſs.</hi> And again he ſaid, he was come to <hi>Judge the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs
and the opreſſed, that the Man of the earth may no more oppreſs.</hi>
And many more pretious Promiſes did the Lord make to me,
when he firſt called me to write what man has been ſo offended
with; and his word was, and is my ſupport, and he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
me therewith, aſſuring me as ſoon as I had done his will,
I ſhould receive the promiſes. And he afterwards revealed to
me, (what I did not then know) that my <hi>oppreſſions</hi> and <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>
had a <hi>Publick Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> wrapt up in them,
that it muſt be ſeven years before I could perfect that writing,
and the Lord would bring forth his end in all this, and give an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Teſtimony to the world that he had choſen and called me to
write to glorifie him. And now I have done his will, my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35375:8"/>
is come to make good his word, and ſet me free from the
oppreſion of Man, and to bear witneſs againſt him that has
wounded and oppreſſed me for 18 years, and more ſeverely is his
anger kindled againſt them who have ſo deeply wounded me ſince
the time of my healing, and who have made me an Heathen and
a Publican for no other cauſe, but obeying the word of the Lord,
and following him. And as near as <hi>New-Years day is,</hi> before that
day the Lord will begin to caſt a cloud of his anger upon all them
that have done me ſo great wrong, and perſecuted me without a
cauſe; and ſtroak after ſtroak will follow, until all Hypocriſie be
diſcovered and formality thrown down, and whole Babylon ſinck
like a ſtone never to riſe up any more: and let not the minds of
any be lifted up to ſcorn me, becauſe I have ſaid, God will begin
to appear in my behalf within ſo ſhort a time: for my God has a
many times over made that <hi>Seaſon of the year</hi> eminently ſignal to
me in the diſpenſations of his grace and providence towards me.
Then was I enter'd into my aflictions, then was I in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
manner healed, and choſen and call'd to write what has
occaſion'd ſo many perſecutions to me from formal and literal
profeſſors; and now it will be compleatly 7 years ſince my heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and the Lord has made known the end of all his diſpenſations
to me, and has revealed to me, that I ſhall now receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
having done his will, and be made partaker of his bleſſing:
for he will fulfil his word, <hi>to bind up the Broaken hearted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
liberty to the Captive, and open the Priſon doors;</hi> and I ſhall no
more be under the oppreſſion of man; and he has alſo revealed to
me what wrath ſhall fall upon the <hi>ſame ſpirit</hi> throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which every where oppreſſes the true ſeed, as I have been
oppreſſed by it; and the deliverance which is drawing nigh through
terrible things in righteouſneſs, to all his <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>meek ones.</hi> A
more full accompt of which things, and how the Lord has lead me
into this miniſtry and witneſs, I am with all convenient ſpeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for the Preſs, and had before this been made publick, had
not my Enemies hindred, by ſeizing and deſtroying my writings.
And in the mean time I beg of all Perſons to whom this paper ſhall
come, that they will for their own ſakes lay a ſide all prejudice,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35375:9"/>
and try <hi>me, my Spirit</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony</hi> according to the word of God,
and wait patiently upon the Lord to know his mind in this thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in love to themſelves, take heed how they raſhly reproach and
condemn me and my witneſs, leaſt they ſhould in ſo doing run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that <hi>Hiding of power</hi> the Prophet <hi>Habakuk</hi> mentions, <hi>chap</hi> 3.
4. and that they be watchful over themſelves, that they be not found
<hi>diſpiſing Prophecy</hi> and <hi>quenching the Spirit,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi>
of the <hi>meſſenger:</hi> alwaies remembring, that <hi>God will deſtroy
the Wiſdome of the Wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the

things of the World,</hi> yea, and <hi>things which are not, to bring to naught
things that are.</hi> In a word, let all Perſons ſo far take the Alarm,
as to look well to their own Souls, where they ſtand; Whither
they are founded upon that Rock againſt which the Gates of Hell
ſhall not prevail; whither they are intereſted in that Covenant of
Grace which is ordered in all things and ſure, and which is <hi>all our
Salvation in a day of deſolation.</hi> Whether they be in the number of

Fellow Servants;</hi> or of the Family of the <hi>true Noah</hi> who ſhall be
taken into the Ark, and preſerved in the day of that Flood of the
Divine vengence, which is ready to overflow the inhabitants of
the Earth.</p>
            <p>What I have here publiſhed is according to the word of truth

            <p>THeſe verſes contain the ſummons, complaint, and
appeal of a deſpiſed and oppreſſed Chriſtian, once
a member of one of your Churches, now by
your unjuſt and unchriſtian abuſe of her, made a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to God, Angels, and Men, yea, a gazeing ſtock to
this great City, and a <hi>by-word</hi> to the common Rabble.
Beloved, have you ſo learned Chriſt? Doth the Goſpel
teach you to defame you neighbour in Coffee-Houſes,
Ale Houſes? will not that word ſpoken by the Holy
Ghoſt to the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> reſtrain you, 1 <hi>James</hi> 26. If
any man among you ſeems to be religious, and bridle not
his Tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is vain. You may ſooner hinder the Sun from ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then the truth of God from diſplaying it ſelf in ſuch
manner, and by ſuch inſtruments as he is pleaſed to
chuſe, who is the Holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
himſelf to be limited by man; the great God hath
put the word of truth in her mouth, and dare you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
her to declare it? can your ſcorn and contempt of
the weak inſtrument, fruſtrate the purpoſes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of God? no, his fooliſhneſs is wiſer then your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
wiſdom, and his weakneſs ſtronger then all your
conjoyned power. Can you prove that God hath not
ſpoken to her and by her? No, you dare not produce
that Book of hers (in yours cuſtody:) you too well know
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35375:10"/>
it would demonſtrate her to be in the Truth, and your
ſelves ſhameleſs Lyars. Pray conſider, if one of your
Preachers ſhould be ſilenced, you would preſently cry
out of Perſecution; and dare you attempt to ſilence
the Word of God, whoſe ſound is gone forth to the
ends of the Earth? Take heed of reſiſting, deriding
a Meſſage ſent from Heaven, (though by a weak In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument)
leſt you be found guilty of Blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Spirit of God; but rather to day, while you
hear his Voice, harden not your hearts, leſt he ſwear in
his wrath, that you ſhall never enter into his Reſt. It
is heard and received by ſuch who love the Truth, and
ſubmit to the Power of it; but if you perſiſt in your
Rebellion againſt it, you will find and feel to your coſt,
that Truth is ſtronger than all. Conſider theſe-things
Brethren, and the Lord give you underſtanding to judge
aright.</p>

I Am commanded by the King of Kings, to ſend this in the ſame

Spirits teaching, quench not the Spirit, deſpiſe not Propheſie;
There hath been too much deſpiſing and diſdaining of me already,
I pray God forgive them for all their hard ſpeeches; and cruel
uſage of me, for they have done they know not what; The Lord
help us to remember our Creator in the days of our youth, and
declining years, for when we have done all we can to pleaſe our
ſelves, yet the end of all is death; for pride, paſſion, ſelf-will,
bitterneſs, wrath, envy, malice, will yield no comfort at the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
