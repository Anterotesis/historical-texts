         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE Advantages of taking judicious and
accurate Journals in Voyages and Itineraries,
are ſo great and many, as the Improvements
of</hi> Geography, Hydrography, Aſtronomy, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<hi>and</hi> Moral Hiſtory, Antiquity, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
Trade, Empire, <hi>&amp;c. that few Books can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with them either for Profit or Pleaſure. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
Ramuſio, <hi>the</hi> De Brys, Hackluit, Purchas,
John de Laet, Thevenot, <hi>&amp;c. have begun a very
commendable Deſign, and their Works are like to be
always uſeful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Collection now publiſhed, containing ſome curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Voyages, and accurate Journals, never before
printed, both towards the</hi> South <hi>and</hi> North, <hi>beyond
and through the</hi> Magellan Streights; <hi>as alſo to</hi>
Greenland <hi>or</hi> Spitsberg, Nova Zembla, <hi>and</hi>
Groneland <hi>or</hi> Groyneland. <hi>'Twill be neceſſary to
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:52975:4"/>
premiſe in general, what other</hi> Navigators <hi>have gone
before to thoſe parts, and what additional Knowledge
may be reap'd from the</hi> enſuing Work; <hi>in doing of
which, we ſhall obſerve Order of</hi> Place <hi>and</hi> Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of ſome Diſcoveries and Navigations towards
the Southern Parts of the Globe,</hi> South-Weſt <hi>and</hi>
South-Eaſt.</p>
            <p>A. D. 1519. Ferdinand Magalianes, <hi>a</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe
<hi>Gentleman, upon ſome diſguſt taken at his Maſter
King</hi> Emanuel, <hi>applied himſelf to the Court of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,
<hi>offering to make great Diſcoveries of the rich</hi>
Spice-Iſlands <hi>by the Weſt, and to ſail round the Globe.
He was furniſh'd with five Ships and 250 Men, by
the Command of</hi> Charles V. <hi>They departed from</hi>
Sevil <hi>Auguſt 10. 1519. and after having in vain
attempted to paſs through by the great River</hi> La Plate,
<hi>and having winter'd in</hi> Port S. Julian, <hi>they found out
a great</hi> Streight <hi>leading into the South Sea, called af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
by the Inventor's Name, the</hi> Magellan
Streight; <hi>through which he was the firſt that paſſed
from the</hi> Atlantick <hi>into the</hi> Pacifick Ocean, <hi>and ſo
round the Globe home again by the</hi> Molucco'<hi>s and</hi>
Cape of Good Hope, <hi>having ſpent above three
years in this Circumnavigation. Entring the Streight
of his own Name, he found on the Shoar many Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
or Graves, whither the Inhabitants reſort in
the Summer time to bury their Dead; he alſo obſerv'd
a great Whale thrown up, and many Bones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anno Dom. 1525. Garcias de Loyaſa <hi>a</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
<hi>entred into</hi> Magellan's Streight, <hi>and gave
Names to ſeveral Places; as did alſo</hi> Simon de Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zova
<hi>in the year</hi> 1534. <hi>Afterwards the Biſhop of</hi>
Placentia <hi>fitted out three Ships, in the Year 1539,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:52975:4"/>
one of which got through the Streights of</hi> Magellan
<hi>to</hi> Arica <hi>in</hi> Peru.</p>
            <p>Anno Dom. 1577. <hi>Sir</hi> Francis Drake, <hi>with
five Ships and Barks, and I64 Men, began his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Voyage round the Globe; ſailing through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned
Streight of</hi> Magellan <hi>to the Coaſts of</hi>
Peru, New Spain, Mexico, <hi>and</hi> California; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to</hi> England, <hi>by the</hi> Eaſt Indies, <hi>and</hi> Cape
of Good Hope. <hi>Captain</hi> John Winter <hi>was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from Sir</hi> Francis <hi>upon their Entrance into the</hi>
South Sea, <hi>and by Storms was forced back again into
the Streights of</hi> Magellan, <hi>through which he repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
home, being the firſt that ſailed from the</hi> Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<hi>into the</hi> Atlantick Ocean, <hi>through theſe
Streights.</hi> Ladriller, <hi>a</hi> Spaniard, <hi>being ſent from</hi>
Chili, <hi>to attempt this paſſage, was driven back by
Storms and the approach of Winter.</hi> Anno 1579.
<hi>the Viceroy of</hi> Peru, <hi>thinking that Sir</hi> Francis
Drake <hi>was ſailed to the</hi> Magellan Streights, <hi>equipt</hi>
Don Sarmiento <hi>in the Port of</hi> Lima <hi>with two
Ships to purſue him. This</hi> Spaniard <hi>coaſted</hi> Chili
<hi>and</hi> Patagonia, <hi>entring the</hi> Streights, <hi>and ſo paſſed
to</hi> Braſil. Sarmiento <hi>upon his return to</hi> Spain, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Philip II, <hi>to ſend two Colonies to plant and
fortifie in the</hi> Streights <hi>of</hi> Magellan, <hi>in order to
prevent and obſtruct the Navigations, Depredations,
or Settlements of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> Dutch <hi>in thoſe
parts; but they all miſcarried partly by Shipwrack,
partly by Famine, and the Barbarities of the</hi> Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons.
<hi>This happened in the years</hi> 1584, 1585,
1586. <hi>The Project was contrary to the Advice of
the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Alva.</p>

of the</hi> Patagons, <hi>or Inhabitants, in their Canoes
and Huts; their Boats were made of the Barks of
Trees and Seal Skins very artificially interwoven, the
Head whereof was ſemilunar. They painted their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
either with an Earth or a Vegetable. In their
Huts, made of Boughs and Skins of Fiſhes, he found</hi>
Sea-Wolves <hi>and huge Muſcles, whoſe Shells they ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſo with rubbing of Stones, that they cut every
thing with them. Their Freſh Water was kept in Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
made of the Barks of Trees, and their Veſtments
were chiefly made up of the Skins of</hi> Penguins, Seals,
<hi>and other Animals peculiar to the Climate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anno Dom. 1586. <hi>The third Circumnavigation

Candiſh <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who very proſperouſly finiſh'd
that in two Years and two Months, which took both</hi>

compaſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anno 1593. <hi>Sir</hi> Richard Hawkins <hi>made his
Voyage into the</hi> South Sea <hi>by the ſame Sreight that
the aforementioned Navigators did before him. He
gives the moſt accurate Deſcription of the Tree that
bears the famous</hi> Winter-bark, <hi>ſee his</hi> Obſervations

Dutchman, <hi>his chief Pilot being Captain</hi> Melis <hi>an</hi>
Engliſhman, <hi>who had accompanied Mr.</hi> Candiſh <hi>in
his Voyage. This</hi> Noort <hi>ſteer'd much the ſame Courſe
with</hi> Magalianes, Drake, <hi>and</hi> Candiſh, <hi>having
ſpent near three years in encompaſſing the Earth.
He ſaw, upon the Land of</hi> Patagonia, <hi>ſome Deer,
a ſort of</hi> Bufalo, <hi>and</hi> Oſtriches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may note here, that in the Year</hi> 1589, <hi>the</hi>

Chidley <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Mr.</hi> Paul Wheel, <hi>got into the
Streights</hi> of Magellan; <hi>but meeting with Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
was forced back, having reach'd only</hi> Cape
Froward. <hi>Alſo in the year 1598.</hi> Verhagen'<hi>s
Fleet, under Sir</hi> James Mahu, Simon de Cordes,
Sebald de Wert, <hi>&amp;c. wherein</hi> William Adams,
<hi>was chief Pilot, ſuffered great Miſeries in theſe
Streights. This</hi> Sebald de Wert <hi>gave</hi> Cluſius <hi>a
deſcription of the Winter-bark-Tree growing up and
down</hi> Patagonia. <hi>They preſerv'd themſelves mith</hi>
Geeſe, Ducks, <hi>vaſt large</hi> Muſcles, Penguins,
Seals, <hi>&amp;c. Returning out of the Streight, and
ſailing Southwards they diſcovered</hi> Sebald's Iſles.</p>
            <p>Anno Dom. 1614. George Spilbergen <hi>General
of a</hi> Dutch <hi>Fleet of ſix Ships, paſſed through the
Streights of</hi> Magellan <hi>and the</hi> South Sea <hi>to the</hi>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:52975:6"/>
Eaſt Indies, <hi>from</hi> whence he returned by the <hi>Cape
of Good Hope</hi> to the <hi>Texel,</hi> having been out
about three years. This was the Fifth Circumnavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Globe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ann. Don. 1609, 1610. Pedro Fernandez Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros</hi> a <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> and Captain <hi>Ferdinand de Quir</hi>
a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> do both affirm, That they ſailed at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times above 800 Leagues together on the Coaſt
of a <hi>Southern Continent,</hi> until they came to the
height of 15 degrees of <hi>South Latitude,</hi> where they
found a very fruitful, pleaſant, and populous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<hi>Giros</hi> began to take his Courſe in the height
of the Streights of <hi>Magellan.</hi> This vaſt Tract of
Land perhaps may be one ſide of, or may belong to,
<hi>Janſen Taſmen's Land, Van Diemen's Land,
Zelandia Nova, Hollandia Nova, Carpentaria,</hi>
and <hi>New Guiney;</hi> which the <hi>Dutch</hi> afterwards
coaſted, detected, and gave Names to many Bays,
Rivers and Capes, in the Years 1619, 1622,1627,
1628, 1642, <hi>and</hi> 1644. from the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> to
44 deg. <hi>South Lat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> have indeed made the greateſt
Diſcoveries towards the South <hi>Terra Incognita,</hi>
which they have not yet divulg'd. <hi>Dirk Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brantſe</hi>
about 15 or 16 years ago publiſhed, in <hi>Low
Dutch,</hi> a ſhort Relation out of the Journal of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Abel Jenſen Taſmen</hi> upon his Diſcoveries of
the South <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> in the year 1642, to the
Southward of <hi>Nova Hollandia, Vandemen's Land,</hi>
&amp;c. 'Tis remarkable that all the Circumnavigators
of the Globe enter'd into the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> either by the
<hi>Philippines</hi> or the <hi>Molucco's,</hi> being peradventure
hindred from paſſing round more Southwards by that
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:52975:6"/>
vaſt long Chain of Land, which ſeems to ſtretch
almoſt from the <hi>Equinosctial</hi> to the 50 degree of
<hi>South Lat.</hi> Therefore they generally ſteer'd upon
the <hi>South Sea,</hi> either for the <hi>Iſles of Salomon,</hi> or
thoſe called the <hi>Ladrones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno Dom. 1615. Will. Cornelius Schouten</hi> of
<hi>Horn,</hi> and <hi>Jacob le Maire</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the Sixth Circumnavigation of the Globe, by a
new Paſſage Southwards from the Streights of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan</hi>

and paſſed, finding out <hi>Sebald's-Iſles, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-Land,
Maurice-Land, Barnevelt-Iſles,</hi> and ſo
by <hi>Cape Horn,</hi> in the 57deg. of <hi>S. Lat.</hi> they found
out a new way into the <hi>South Sea;</hi> called ever ſince
<hi>Le Maire's Streight,</hi> in this Voyage they gave Names
to ſeveral Iſlands and Countries, returning to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
by the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> having been out two years
and Eighteen days. Aftewards a <hi>Spniſh Fleet,</hi> under <hi>Bartolemeo Garcias de Nodal, Anno</hi> 1618.
ſailed through <hi>Le Maire's Paſſage:</hi> and in the year
1623. part of <hi>Prince Maurice</hi> his Fleet ſteered the
ſame Courſe, diſcovering ſome ſmall Iſles. <hi>Nodal</hi>
ſaw People near <hi>Le Maire's Streight,</hi> all painted and
clad with Birds Skins; they fed upon yellow Flowers
like <hi>Marigolds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno 1643. Brewer,</hi> or <hi>Brower,</hi> went another
way into the <hi>South Sea,</hi> by a Paſſage called after his
own Name, which is eaſt of <hi>Le Maire's Streight;</hi>
but whether <hi>Brewer</hi> went through a New Streight
with Land on each ſide, or had a wide Sea on the Eaſt
we cannot inform you, having never ſeen the <hi>Diary</hi>
of his Voyage: but moſt Maps make it a new
Streight, the perhaps he might ſail near the ſame

Courſe which Captain <hi>Sharp</hi> afterwards did; they
who have his Voyage may ſoon determine this Doubt.</p>
            <p>The Southern part of <hi>Terra Magellanica,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Terra del Fuego,</hi> from the great Fires
ſeen upon it by the Sailors; ſeems, by the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to be divided into many <hi>Iſles</hi>
and <hi>Streights</hi> leading into both Seas. The Country
appears mountainous, with fair and green Vallies,
Springs, Rivulets, and much Herbage. The Creeks
are fit for Shipping, Water and Wood being plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The Air is tempeſtuous from the vaſt quantity of
Vapours from both Oceans. The Natives paint their
Bodies, and deck themſelves with Shells and Skins.
They make their Baskets and Nets of Ruſhes, out of
which they twiſt Lines, and hanging Hooks made of
Stone, and baited with Muſcles, they take abundance
of Fiſh. Their Knives are made of ſharpened Bones,
and all their Arrows are armed with them. Their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes
are like the <hi>Venetian Gondola's.</hi> For the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption

80 Fathom deep, and diſcovered a great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi>

out Ships for making Diſcoveries, in the year 1605;
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:52975:11"/>
1606, 1607, but theſe performed little. At laſt

Ships, who tracing <hi>Forbiſher</hi> and <hi>Hudſon,</hi> came to
the 63 <hi>deg. 20 min.</hi> where he was forced to winter,

1617, 1619, 1620, 1622. the <hi>Engliſh Company,</hi>

for 6 or 7 hours about noon, ſo much light as to
read by it. <hi>Feb. 12.</hi> they ſaw the Rays of the Sun

The difference of theſe appearances, doth not
proceed from different <hi>Refractions,</hi> but from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of <hi>Latitude,</hi> in which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
wintered, tho the cold in <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> exceeded
that felt in <hi>Greenland.</hi> In theſe <hi>Countries</hi> there
is a continued Day for four or five months in the
year, as well as a perpetual Night for three months,
ſo for the moſt part there is either all Light, or all
Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were neceſſitated to winter in
<hi>Greenland,</hi> liv'd upon Veniſon (of which there is
great ſtore, perhaps 'tis of the <hi>Rhin-deer</hi>) upon <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Bears, Foxes,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Bears</hi> Fleſh was tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
pleaſant and wholſom, but the Liver made their
skins peel off; which was alſo obſerved by the <hi>Dutch</hi>
that wintered in <hi>Nova Zembla.</hi> As the Sun and
Day-light began to appear, the <hi>Fowls,</hi> and <hi>Foxes</hi>
crept abroad, for which they ſet Traps and Springs,
and ſo took vaſt numbers: The <hi>Foxes</hi> proved whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Food, for by it the <hi>Dutch</hi> were alſo relieved in
their <hi>Scurveys.</hi> In <hi>May</hi> they found great ſtore of
<hi>Eggs</hi> laid by <hi>Willocks.</hi> The cold had prodigious
Effects on our Men in <hi>Greenland,</hi> and on the <hi>Dutch</hi>
in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> as bliſtering and ulcering their
Fleſh, freezing their Sack and Spirits, ſtopping their
Clocks, freezing everything by the fire ſide; all which
<hi>Captain James</hi> ſuffer'd in the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Charleton,</hi>
tho only in the 51 <hi>Deg.</hi> of <hi>North Lat.</hi> whereas the

North Lat.</hi> In the building of Houſes, Tents, and
Cabins, upon theſe melancholy occaſions, 'twas found
expedient to make them under ground, and to line

his Obſervations made in <hi>Greenland</hi> in the <hi>High

His Voyage being the laſt and beſt was much deſired
here, it being full of <hi>Draughts</hi> and curious <hi>Remarks;</hi>
the Copying and Tranſlating of which, are perform'd
with all poſſible diligence.</p>
            <p>Theſe four make up the <hi>Volume,</hi> together with
many new <hi>Carts</hi> and <hi>Deſigns,</hi> drawn upon the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places, which do much illuſtrate the <hi>Work,</hi> and
improve both <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Mathematical Science.</hi>
To theſe we thought fit to tack a <hi>Supplement</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

            <p>'Tis to be lamented, that the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> have

equal to, if not beyond their Neighbours, <hi>Sint
Maecenates,</hi> We are apt to imitate a <hi>certain Prince</hi>

Part of him, <hi>viz. The Encouraging and Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Men in all Profeſſions, and the promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

which ſome <hi>Miniſters</hi> think not fit to practiſe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

            <p>Wedneſday <hi>September</hi> 29. Hazy weather, the
Wind to the North-weſt and by Weſt, a freſh gale:
I ſtood to the South-weſt-ward as near as I could;
this day at twelve a Clock, the <hi>Lizard</hi> bore North
of me a little Eaſterly, diſtance about 12 Leagues,
according to my account; Latitude by account, is
49 <hi>d.</hi> 35 <hi>m.</hi> This day I ſpoke with a <hi>French</hi> Banker:
<hi>Lizard</hi> in <hi>England</hi> lies in the Lat. of 50 <hi>d.</hi> 10 <hi>m.</hi>
and in Longitude Eaſt, from the Meridian of the
Weſt part of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> one of the Iſlands of the
<hi>Azores</hi> 18 <hi>d.</hi> 30 <hi>m.</hi> From the <hi>Lizard</hi> I take my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
and keep my daily account of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of my Longitude from that Meridian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> the 17. I made the <hi>Madera;</hi> which Iſland
is high Land, and irregular in Hills, with Wood
on the top and down the ſides; Planted with
Vines: there is ſome Sugar made in the Iſland;
the Inhabitants <hi>Portugueſes.</hi> The City of <hi>Fonchiale</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52975:23"/>
is the Metropolis, and is ſituated in a Bay on the
South part of the Iſland, cloſe to the Sea ſide, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
next the Sea, and well fortified with Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
freſh water comes running into the Sea in
the middle of the Bay, in a fair Rivulet from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an Arch in the Wall; the ſhoar-ſides are
great pebble ſtones in the Bay, and Rocks in the
other places; the Road is foul ground, to the Eaſt
part of it: the Ships ride in ſhot of Ordnance of
the City: this City is about an Engliſh mile in
length, and three quarters of a mile in breadth.</p>
            <p>The Deſarts are barren rocky Iſles of a good
heighth, and lie at the South-eaſt point of <hi>Madera,</hi>
above a mile diſtant from the ſhore; there is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enough between <hi>Madera</hi> and the Deſarts in the
midway, and no danger; the Deſarts trent to the
South-eaſt. <hi>Fonchiale</hi> Bay in the Iſle of <hi>Madera</hi> lies
in the Latitude of 32 <hi>d.</hi> 10 <hi>m.</hi> North, and in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude
Weſt from the <hi>Lizard</hi> of <hi>England</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> 1 <hi>m.</hi>
and Meridian diſtance 143 Leagues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> being the 17th. fair Weather and little
wind at North-weſt, Courſe by my Compaſs
South-weſt. I make my true Courſe from <hi>Fonchiale</hi>
Bay, till to day at noon South-ſouth-weſt, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,

the Iſland of <hi>Madera,</hi> bearing <hi>N</hi> b. <hi>E:</hi> the body of

Eaſt: Courſe by the Compaſs this afternoon <hi>SW.</hi>
little wind to night; I ſhaped my neareſt Courſe
for the Iſland of St. <hi>Jago</hi> with all the ſail I could
make, the <hi>Batchelour Pink</hi> in Company; I gave
order to my Maſter to make the beſt of his way
to St. <hi>Jago</hi> Iſland, but not to leave the Company
of the <hi>Batchelour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>October</hi> 23. The wind at <hi>N.</hi> b. <hi>E.</hi> a gale:
this day in the forenoon I croſſed the <hi>Tropick</hi> of
<hi>Cancer,</hi> all my men in good health, I praiſe the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God for it: many of my men that had
been with me in the <hi>Indies</hi> formerly, were let
blood; for I take bleeding in theſe hot Climates
to be a great preſerver of health, diverting Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentures;
I experienc'd it in two Voyages before
to the Iſland of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> and in one to the
Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi> where ſeveral of my men under
that diſtemper, were preſerved by bleeding; in all
theſe Voyages I was never ſick one day, nor in
two years time in the Mediterranean Sea, nor at
the <hi>Canaries;</hi> for when I came near the <hi>Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial</hi>
I always breathed a Vein.</p>
            <p>Thurſday <hi>October</hi> 28. the Wind at Eaſt-North-Eaſt
a ſtiff gale; this Morning I ſaw the Iſle of
<hi>Mayo</hi> bearing <hi>S.</hi> b. <hi>W.</hi> diſtant by eſtimation eight
Leagues; it makes a high Hill, and Craggy to the
Eaſt part, and low land towards the ſhore-ſide, to
the North-weſt part of the Iſland; it lies from <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naviſt
S.</hi> b. <hi>W.</hi> diſtant near 18 leagues. This day
at 11 a Clock I anchored in the Road in ſeven fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
water, ſandy Ground, about a mile from the
ſhore; the Northernmoſt point of the Road bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>N. N. W.</hi> half a point to the Weſt, and the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52975:24"/>
point of the Road, bearing South-eaſt from
me; diſtant about a mile and an half: there are
craggy Rocks to the South of the Road on the
ſhore ſide, but to the North a low ſandy ſhore;
the Road is on the North-weſt and by Weſt part
of the Iſland in a ſmall ſandy Bay; there's the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond
a bow's ſhot from the Sea in the low flat
Land; freſh water is very ſcarce here: I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore
preſently after I had anchored, and found a
heap of Salt of about 20 Tuns; I got aboard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
immediately, and ſent the Long-boat aſhore,
which brought off 2 Tuns and ½, the Suff came in
ſo much that no more could be got off; we halled
the Seyne here, and caught abundance of good
Mullets, with ſome <hi>Cavalle</hi> and ſilver Fiſh; one of
the Iſlanders a <hi>Negro</hi> came aboard, whom I ſent
aſhore, to tell the People that if they brought
down ſome Cattle I would buy ſome of them; I
rode here all Night; fair Weather, the Wind Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly.
This ſide of the Iſland is dry land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wood; here are many Goats, and Guinea
Hens.</p>
            <p>Friday <hi>October</hi> 29. fair Weather, the wind at
<hi>NE.</hi> a fine gale: this Morning I ſent my Boat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
and bought of the Iſlanders ſome Goats at
½ a piece of Eight per Head, and 8 Cows excellent
good meat at 6 pieces of Eight a Cow, giving the
skins again; my men caught a great many Fiſh
with the Seyne, which this day we ſplit, and laid
in pickle four Hours, then dried them to keep,
which they will a long time in any Climate, as I
have experienced in other Voyages, and are very
good Victuals at Sea: I made what diſpatch I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52975:25"/>
could to be gone for St. <hi>Jago</hi> Iſland. This day in
the forenoon, a Ship paſſed by to the Weſtward
on the South ſide of the Iſle, and in the afternoon
we ſaw ſeveral Ships coming from the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which were the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleet bound
for <hi>Brazil;</hi> they halled into <hi>Port Praya</hi> in the Iſle
of St. <hi>Jago</hi> to water: this night I weighed, and
ſtood away at twelve a Clock South-ſouth-weſt
for <hi>Port Praya,</hi> with the Pink in Company; I
touched at the Iſle of <hi>May</hi> for Salt, which I knew
would be a great help to get Proviſions in the
Voyage.</p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>October</hi> 30. fair wind at North-eaſt and
by North a freſh gale. This Morning I ſteered
South-weſt for the South ſide of St. <hi>Jago,</hi> where
is the Road of <hi>Port Praya,</hi> lying near South-weſt
from the Road of the Iſle of <hi>May,</hi> and diſtant nine
Leagues. This day at 12 a Clock I caſt my beſt
Bower-anchor in <hi>Port Praya</hi> Road, in 10 fathom
rough Ground, the Eaſt Point bore Eaſt of me,
and the Weſt Point about Weſt-ſouth-weſt, about
half a mile off; I could not go into the beſt of the
Road, the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleet of about thirty ſix Sail
riding in it; the Great <hi>Padre Eternel</hi> Admiral,
bound for <hi>Brazil,</hi> is a very great Ship and well
built, they ſay ſhe is in Burthen 1700 Tuns, ſhe
hath Ports for three Tier of Guns fluſh, but now
ſhe had but eighty, and poorly mann'd with Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and ſo were all the reſt, ſix Frigats might
have taken moſt of the Fleet. At my coming in
to Anchor, the Admiral ſaluted me with ſeven
Guns, I thanked him with as many; Captain <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Wilkſheir</hi> in the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> fired five, I returned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52975:25"/>
him three; ſo did the Reer-Admiral, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
the Complement in the like number, ſeveral
of the Fleet fired three, whom I anſwer'd in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
with three for all. I rode on the broad
ſide of the Admiral, and ſaluted the Fort with five
Guns, which return'd three, then I ſent my Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
aſhore to ask leave of the Governour to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which he granted forthwith; my Coopers, got
the Cask ready, and this Evening put one boat's
lading aboard.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>Octobor</hi> 31. fair Weather, the wind at
North-eaſt a fine gale. This Morning <hi>Don Carolus</hi>
went aſhore to <hi>Pryam;</hi> with much ado I got off a
boats lading of Water, for the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> boats
were filling too, and a great many Soldiers at the
watering place ſnatch'd ſome of our mens Hats
off, and run away, wherefore I would not let my
men go any more this day for fear of quarreling.
This Bay of <hi>Port Praya,</hi> as they call it, is no Port,
but a fine round Bay, having high ſteep Cliffs on
the Eaſt ſide, and in the bottom a ſteep Hill, where
the Caſtle is, that hath but four Guns, and is of
no force; there is a ſmall Fort on the top of a Hill
on the Eaſt side, which hath three Guns. On the
North-weſt part of the Bay the ſhore is gravelly
and ſandy, and there's a Grove of Coco-nut trees:
A freſh water Rivulet runs down into the Valley,
and thence through the Sand ſoaks into the Sea:
this Water is in great quantity, very good, and
keeps well at Sea: to the weſt part of this Bay lies
a ſmall Iſland cloſe on the ſhore, which has Graſs
on it that may be cut off for Cattle, which I did;
this Road is no ſafeguard for Shipping, for a Man
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52975:26"/>
of War may take any Ship out of the Bay, without
receiving any damage from the Forts aſhore, and
with Fire-Ships a whole Fleet may be ſpoiled at
pleaſure; for it's a freſh gale every day, and there's
but two points of Land by which a man may fetch
into any part of the Bay; alſo the Bay lies
open to the Sea from the Eaſt, Southerly to the
<hi>W. S. W.</hi> I called for my Lieutenants and Maſter,
and acquainted them, that I had Orders to ſail

Eaſterly enough of it, to weather the ſhoals of
<hi>Brazil,</hi> called the <hi>Abroholls,</hi> lying in and about
eighteen degrees of Southerly Latitude, for the
Wind blows for the moſt part thereabouts between
the Latitude of ten South, and the Latitude of
twenty South, at Eaſt by South, and Eaſt South-eaſt
freſh gales; whilſt this paſs'd, in came the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and told me all things were ſtowed, and the
Wind at <hi>E.</hi> b. <hi>N.</hi> freſh; I concluded with him that
our beſt Courſe at preſent would be South and by
Eaſt, and as we got Southerly and the Wind grew
large, we might alter our Courſe when we would:
we ſteered a Point or two from the Wind, that
the Ship might have freſh way through the Sea. I
ordered my Maſter to ſteer South and by Eaſt
by the Compaſs, and my Lieutenant to call all
hands to Prayer, read Service, and beg'd of God
Almighty a proſperous Voyage, continuance in
Health, and love to one another, <hi>and that we might

The Deſign of this Voyage on which you are

            <p>This Night I adviſed with <hi>Don Carolus</hi> where
it would be beſt for us to hale in with the Land,
in what Latitude, or at what Cape or Harbour on
this Coaſt of <hi>America,</hi> being now to the South-ward
of the River of <hi>Plate,</hi> and according to my
Inſtructions, before the Coaſt to be diſcover'd,
and a Trade ſet on foot with the Natives; He
told me I might do what I would, for he did not
underſtand the Coaſt, nor where 'twas inhabited;
'twas his whole Diſcourſe in the Voyage, that
he had been here in a Galley, and knew all the
Coaſts from the River of <hi>Plate</hi> to the <hi>Streights,</hi>
and thorow the <hi>Streights</hi> all along the Weſt Coaſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52975:32"/>
to <hi>Baldavia</hi> and <hi>Lima;</hi> being arrived here, as far
as I can perceive by him, he knows nothing of
the matter, nor any thing appertaining to Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;
all I can fancy of him is, that he may
have liv'd with a Weſt-<hi>Indian</hi> Governour, whom
he has heard talk of theſe Parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 8. at 7 a Clock this Afternoon the
Wind came to the Weſt South-weſt, a ſtiff gale. I
ſtood to the Southward; much Rock-weed paſs'd
by the Ship to day, and ſeveral Sea-Fowls ſeen;
very cold for the Seaſon, being Summer, which
<hi>Don Carolus</hi> began to complain of, and told me,
he did not think we ſhould have come ſo far
Southerly; I ſhew'd him by my Plates how
far we were to go through the <hi>Streights,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the Weſt Coaſt; he ſaid, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> went
to <hi>Chile</hi> a nearer way; I anſwer'd, 'twas into
the River of <hi>Plate</hi> and over Land, which we
could not do.</p>
            <p>My Company are all in good health, but ſome
of a puny Race grow weak in being ſo long on
Shipboard; I give them Vinegar once a Week,
which is very good to prevent the Scurvy in their
Mouths; alſo I order'd every Man to waſh his
Mouth, Face and Hands before the receive his
daily Allowance of Bread, and appointed one
Man to ſee it performed; if any neglected it, the
Steward kept their Allowance for one day; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
every Man is commanded to keep himſelf
clean, and free from Lice, upon forfeiture of his dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Allowance to the Party accuſing him; by theſe
means the Ship is kept neat, ſweet and clean, tho'
the dirty foggy Weather is a great Enemy to this
Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52975:32"/>
               <hi>February</hi> 19. I ſounded often to day, and had
fifty and fifty three Fathom; dark black Sand
wth ſome bright fine Sand in it; Beds of Rock-weed,
Seals, and Porpoiſes, ſuch as are in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi>
Seas, ſeen to day; three Whales, many
Fowls flying about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome Penguins in the
Sea, ſwimming near the Ships; at 2 a Clock in
the Afternoon the Wind was at <hi>E.</hi> b. <hi>S.</hi> a ſtout
gale and a great Sea; I ſtood to the Southward, cloſe
haled under my Courſes; the Pink half a Mile to
Wind-ward of me udner her's; ſhe out-ſails us
now it blows, and puts us paſt our Top-fails, and
ſteers along with us with only her Main-ſail ſet;
the Sea runs lofty.</p>
            <p>Monday <hi>February</hi> 21. At a quarter of an hour
paſt eight this Morning I ſaw the Land bearing
Weſt of me, and diſtant about 4 Leagues: I
ſounded, and had 21 Fathom; ſmall Stones and
Sand; ſtill I ſtood in Weſt by my Compaſs. The
Land makes but an ordinary heighth towards the
Sea ſide, but farther up, round high Hills, and
looks reddiſh; the Northermoſt Land I could ſee,
which was <hi>Cape Blanco,</hi> bore North-north-weſt of
me about two Leagues, and the Southermoſt
Land at the face of the Cape.</p>
            <p>The Land trented away to te Southward of me
Southweſterly, of an ordinary height by the Water
ſide, but up in the Land are Hills like Tables on the
top, a little higher than the reſt; the Land makes
in Hills and Valleys all along, like Downs of an
ordinary heighth; at nine a Clock this Morning I
braced the Head-ſails to the Maſt, and lay ſo half
an hour till the Fog cleared up, that I might make
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52975:33"/>
the Land plainly, being within five miles of the
ſhore ſide, which made a kind of Bay, breached
on the ſhore; I ſounded, and at 17 Fathom had
rough ground, with ſome ſmall ſtones drawn up
in the Tallow of the Lead, which was dinted by
Rocks; between nine and ten a Clock there was
a fine clear, by which I ſaw the Land very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
it look'd reddiſh like ſeared Graſs; no Woods
to be ſeen on any of the Hills or Valleys, but all
as bare as the Graſs-Downs in <hi>England;</hi> I durſt
not ſend my Boat a-ſhore for fear of loſing her in
the Fog, or being ſunk at the ſhore, whereon the
Sea breaks very much: the Wind was at North
and by Eaſt; a freſh gale blew almoſt along the
ſhore, and being out but 24 hours before, made
the Sea run high; the Land lies by the Sea-ſide
South-ſouth-weſt, and North-north-eaſt, as far as
I could ſee to the Southward; no fire or ſmoak
to be ſee upon the Land.</p>
            <p>Courſe made true after ſeveral Courſes, from
yeſterday Noon till to day at nine a Clock, when
I was 3 Leagues off the Land; true Courſe is
Weſt 6 <hi>d.</hi> 50 <hi>m.</hi> Northerly diſtance; ſailed fifty

            <p>Meridian diſtance from the <hi>Lizard</hi> Weſt 1014

735 Leagues, 1 mile, 5 tenths. Variation of the

            <p>I concluded we had ſhot paſt <hi>Port Deſier</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the Fog, for the Iſlands and Rocks which
we ſaw, were <hi>Penguin,</hi> and other Iſles lying about
it, which lies to the Southward of the Harbour of
<hi>Port Deſier.</hi> Many Seals, Penguins, pied Porpoiſes,
and ſeveral Sea Fowls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeen to day.</p>
            <p>Thurſday <hi>Febr.</hi> 24. Haſey Weather; Wind at
Weſt-north-weſt, a freſh gale. I ſent Men up to
the Top-maſt-head to look abroad; this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no ſight of the Pink; I judge ſhe muſt be in
<hi>Port Deſier:</hi> I weighed about 8 a Clock this
Morning, and ſtood to the Northward with my
Ship; I went in my Pinnace along the ſhore to the
Northward, whilſt the Ship ſail'd in the Offing,
about two Leagues from the ſhore: the Shore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
is in Beaches and ſcatter'd Rocks; in many
places the Tide of Flood was with us: at the
North-end of <hi>Seals Bay,</hi> lies a ſmall rocky Iſland
copling up like a Haycock. It is cover'd with
grey-colour'd Fowls Dung; a very ſtrong Tide
runs here, between the Iſland and the Main, 'tis
a little more than a Cables length from the Point
of the Main; there's a great many broken Rocks
about it by the Sea-ſide; here the main Land is
low and ſandy, up the Country in large Downs
and Hills; without Wood or freſh Water any
where: On this Iſland are abundance of Seals, and
Sea Fowls; we gave it the name of <hi>Tomahauke</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,
from an <hi>Indian</hi> Club loſt here, called by the
<hi>Caribbe-Indians</hi> at <hi>Surinam</hi> a <hi>Temahauke,</hi> 'tis all a
craggy Rock, a little bigger than <hi>Seal-Iſland,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52975:34"/>
is eight Leagues to the North-north-eaſt: diſtant
from it to the Northweſt of this Iſland, is a deep
rounding Bay, called in the Charts <hi>Spiring's Bay,</hi>
wherein lie three ſmall Iſlands of an indifferent
height: the Land, in the Country over this Bay
is large high Hills, Rocks lie in the North part
of the Bay; I croſs'd it in the Pinnace, amd ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as I went over, and had 21 Fathom, rough
ground in the mid-way: 'tis ſeven Miles broad,
and near 3 Leagues deep; it rounds with a turning
up to the North-northweſt ward, behind a Point
farther than I ſaw; upon which rounding Point
ſtand black Rocks, which make like a ragged
Building, and a Tower in it: at my coming in
with the Land, I ſail'd cloſe under this ſhoar with
my Boat; the ſhore is ſteep, black Rocks, and
low Bays, with Pebble-ſtones and ſandy Beaches;
green Graſs on the Hills, no Wood nor freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be ſeen; at the North-eaſt Point of this
<hi>Spiring's-Bay,</hi> the Land makes out full like a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
a fair high Land in large plain Hills, with
ſandy ſmall Bays; at the face of this Foreland
lie ſix rocky Iſlands; one is a Musket-ſhot off the
Main, the reſt farther off; the outwardmoſt is the
biggeſt, a Mile from the Point of the Main, and
is called <hi>Penguin-Iſland;</hi> it is indifferent high at
the ends and low in the middle; 'tis near three
quarters of a Mile long, North-north-eaſt and
South-ſouth-weſt, and near half a Mile broad Eaſt
and Weſt; it is all craggy Rocks, except in the
loweſt part of the middle, which is gravelly, and in
the Summer time had a little green Graſs; the great
black Gannets lay their Eggs here, and the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guins,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52975:34"/>
all over the Iſland upon and under the
Rocks in Holes; Seals lie all about the ſides, on
the tops of the higheſt Rocks and in the middle
of it; the number of Seals, Penguins, and Sea-Fowl
upon theſe Iſlands, is alſmost incredible to
them that never ſaw them; for the multitude of
each Creature that's there daily, is numberleſs
the Six Iſlands are full of Seals, but the Penguins
frequent the biggeſt moſt; I put a-ſhore at one of
them, and took into my Boat three hundred Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guins,
in leſs than half an hour, and could have
taken three thouſand in the time, if my Boat
would have carried 'em, for 'tis but driving 'em
in flocks to the ſhore, by the Boats ſide, where
two or three Men knock them on the head with
ſhort Truncheons, and the reſt heave them into
the Boat; the Seals will run over a Man, if he does
not avoid 'em; mean time the Ship was ſtanding
to the Northward; about 2 Leagues off many
broken Rocks and foul ground lie among theſe
Iſlands, and without the Point of the outermoſt it
makes a great ripling, which is the ſtrength of
the Tide, reverſed from the Iſlands aginſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tide; to the Northward of theſe Iſlands is
a Bay, four Leagues long, and a League and half
deep; in the Northweſt thereof lies the Harbour of
<hi>Port Deſier,</hi> which we could ſee from <hi>Penguin Iſland's</hi>
bearing North-north-weſt from <hi>Penguin Iſland,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
about 3 Leagues: about the middle of this
Bay are ſteep white Cliffs, near two miles long;
the upper part of the Cliff has black ſtreaks
down a fourth part, cauſed by the Water drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down on it; the Land is plain on the top of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52975:35"/>
theſe Cliffs but further into the Country high
rounding Hills and Downs, and toward the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide
low; on the South part of the Bay are
craggy Rocks on the Main like great Walls; near
the Sea there's a ſandy Cove, to hale a Boat
up in foul Weather; the Cove is juſt under theſe
wall-like Rocks.</p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. Fair Weather, the Wind at
Weſt, a ſtiff gale. I kept a Light out all Night,
that the Pink might ſee if ſhe came along; the
firſt part of the Night a great Fire was made on
the ſhore for the ſame purpoſe: Cold weather:
this Morning at 7 a Clock I manned both my
Boats, and into the Herbour; the Ship rode
moored at the Harbour-mouth, within the Muſcle-bank,
in ſix Fathom at low Water; I ſent my Men
upon the Hills on the North ſhore to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
for the Pink, and make a Fire in the dry
Graſs, that ſhe might ſee the ſmoak if ſhe were
thereabouts, but they could not ſee her; I ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Harbour in many places to day at low Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and found it a very good one for great Ships
to ride in, provided they have good Cables and
Anchros; I ſearched the ſhore, but found no
Wood, and very little freſh Water; on the hilly
and large Downs, very few Buſhes, but dry; long
Graſs growing in tufts and knots; the Soil is
gravelly and dry, in ſome Valleys well mixt with
black mould; no People, fire or ſmoak but our
own to be ſeen; I ſaw ſeveral places where they
had lain, behind Buſhes upon Graſs, which they
had plucked up, and that they had made ſmall
ſires, and roaſted Lumpets and Muſcles; there
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52975:35"/>
lay Wooll, Feathers, bones of Beaſts, and ſhivers
of Flints; I went to a Flag which I left on a Hill
yeſterday with Beads at it, but finding no body
had been at it, let it ſtand; no Beaſts ſeen any
where, except two Hares running over the Hills:
this day we were taken up with viewing the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
ſo that we did not advance above a mile and a
half into the Land: in the Valleys between the
Rocks grows abundance of wild Peaſe, which had
green leaves and blewiſh bloſſoms, both taſting like
green Peaſe-leaves in <hi>England,</hi> growing on vines and
tangled together; alſo very ſweet ſmelling Herbs
much like Tares, very green, and white and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Flowers, likewiſe green Herbs much like Sage,
but grow in knots near the ground like Lettice;
theſe Herbs with the Peaſe-leaves, made a good
Sallad to refreſh ſuch as were inclining to the
Scurvy; for want of which freſh Trade ſeveral of
my Men were falling into it. Here are abundance
of very good Muſcles, and Limpets on theRocks,
and an Iſland frequented by many Seals, and
Fowls; in the River were pied Divers as big as
Ducks, ſome of them grey and black ſhags; Ducks
and other Sea-Fowls breed on them amongſt the
Rocks and Buſhes: to day I went upon one of
theſe Iſlands, and caught as many young black
Shags in their Neſts as loaded the Pinnace: when
I have diſcovered better the particulars of the
Fowls and other things ſeen here, I will mention
them hereafter: Night coming on, and it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to blow hard, I went aboard with Herbs,
Fowls, and what elſe I had got to day; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
all things equally among the Company, the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52975:36"/>
Boys Dividend being as large as my own, or any
Man's; it blew very hard this Evening, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very black in the South-weſt, an ordinary gale;
I kept a Light out all Night in the Poop for the
Pink: this day all the Company eat of young
Seals, and Penguins, and commended them for
good Food; I judged this a very fit Harbour to
fit the Ship in, for the main Maſt muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig'd,
and a new gang of ſhrouds fitted, and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt
be had; and it might be a means to fall in
with the Pink, for from the tops of the Hills
we could ſee a great way into the Sea, ſo that if
ſhe ſhould come near the Coaſt, we could not
miſs her.</p>
            <p>We found 2 Springs of freſh Water, one in a
Valley cloſe by the Water-ſide, in a gully above
the Ship, half a mile up the River; the other up
a Valley between the Rocks, juſt a-breſt where
the Ship rode, about half a mile from the River's
ſide, right from <hi>Coopers-Bay</hi> in the ſame Valley;
theſe Springs are but ſmall, and the Water's a little
brackiſh or ſaltiſh, for in the dry Valleys the
Earth is naturally ſaltiſh; the Ground and Rocks
have a white Rhime of Salt-petre hanging on them;
I went into the Land 2 miles North-weſt, and
ſaw the Country hilly, and dry Land without
Wood or Water; ſome craggy Rocks and Valleys
low, but dry and of a Salt-petre nature; here and
there ſome Buſhes with prickly Branches, and
Leaves like White-Thorn Buſhes in <hi>England;</hi> the
leſſer Buſhes have ſmall dry Gauls growing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
them, with a ſmall dry Seed as hot in the Mouth
as Pepper; not a Tree to be ſeen: the Soil is gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52975:36"/>
velly and ſandy generally, with tufts of dry fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Graſs growing on it; I digged in ſeveral places
but ſaw nothing but gravelly Sand and Rocks;
no ſort of Metals or Minerals; I looked alſo among
the broken Rocks for Metals, but ſaw no
ſign of any; from the tops of the Hills I could
ſee a great way into the Land, which is all
Hills and Downs like <hi>Cornwall:</hi> toilſom travelling
to thoſe that were not uſed to it; I could travel
as far in an hour as many of my Men could in
two; to day we ſaw nine Beaſts feeding on the
Graſs, very like Deer, but larger, and had longer
Necks, but no Horns; reddiſh coloured on the
Back and aloft, whitiſh under their Bellies and up
their Flanks; when we had got within a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
of them they fell a neighing like Horſes, one
anſwered another, and then all run away.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>March 1.</hi> Fair Weather this Morning,
Wind at North, a fine gale and a cold Air. This
Forenoon I filled the Casks out of the Spring, and
dug them deeper; I ſet up a long Pole with a
white Cloath upon it, on a Hill near a mile into
the Land, where 'twas moſt likely to be ſeen by
the Inhabitants; with it I left Beads, a Looking-glaſs,
a Knife, a Hook and an Hatchet, to invite
the People of the Country to ſhew themſelves, for
I was willing to ſee 'em, that I might diſcover
what they had; but through I went about the
Hills this Afternoon, I could ſee neither People,
Fire, nor Smoak. I ſaw three Oſtriches, but could
not get near enough to make a ſhot at them; they
were feeding on Graſs, and at firſt ſight of me ran
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>way; I had a Greyhound with me, which I turn'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52975:37"/>
looſe upon 'em, who gave Chaſe to one of them,
and at laſt gave her a turn, which ſhe recovered,
took to the Hills, and ſo eſcaped; they are grey
coloured, and larger than a great Turky-cock in
<hi>England;</hi> they can't fly, but have long Legs, and
truſt to their running: I ſaw two handfuls of
Wooll among the Graſs, where the Natives had
made a Fire; it was the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> red Wooll, which
they bring out of <hi>India,</hi> and very fine; I brought
it away with me, and ſet the Greyhound at 3 of
the large Beaſts like Deer, but they were too ſwift
for him: Night coming on I returned on Board; at
7 a Clock this Night the Wind came to the North,
a freſh gale, and haſey Weather; no ſight of
the Pink to day: I could ſee a long way on the
Sea: at 10 a Clock it rain'd, and the Wind came
to the South-Eaſt.</p>
            <p>Friday <hi>March 4.</hi> Fair Weather this Morning,
the Wind at Eaſt, a fine gale, I went aſhore and
filled freſh Water, the reſt of the Seamen fitted rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;
this day at 12 a Clock I went with both the
Boats, and forty Men to <hi>Seal-Iſland,</hi> into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
every Man with his Staff and Club; we
landed, drove the Seals up together, beſet them
round, and in half an hours time killed four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
young and old; ſtriking them on the head
kills them preſently; as ſoon as they were knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down we cut their throats, that they might
bleed well whilſt they were hot; then loading both
the Boats with them, I carried them to the Bay
where the Tent was, landed, and laid them upon
the Rocks; to Night the Boat fetch'd them all off:
the great Male Seals are as big as Calfs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52975:37"/>
a Lion in their ſhaggy Necks, Heads, and
Faces, as well as in their Roar; the Females are
like Lioneſſes before, only they are hairy all over
like a Horſe, and ſmooth, and the Male is ſmooth
all over his hind-parts; their ſhape is very deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for their hind-part tapers till it come to a
point, where grow two Fins or Feet, two more
grow out of their Breaſt, ſo that they can go on
Land a great pace, and climb Rocks, and Hills of
a good height; they delight much to lie and ſleep
aſhore; ſome are very large, upwards of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Foot in length, and thicker about than a But
in the Bilge, and exceſſive fat; there are thouſands
fourteen foot long, the common ſort are about
five foot and all very fat; they'l gape at you when
you come to them, as if they would devour you,
and 'tis labour enough for two Men to kill one
of the great ones with a Hand-ſpike, which is the
beſt Weapon for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>March</hi> 5. Fair Weather, Wind at
South-weſt, a fine gale. This Morning we went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore
to flay ſome Seals, and cut the Bodies in good
handſom pieces, and ſalted it up well in Bulk on
Deal-boards, aſhore, that the blood might drain
from it; the Meat looks as well and as white as
Lamb, and is very good Victuals now, but when
'tis a little ſalt it will eat much better; thoſe we
dreſs'd were all young Seals, for they ſucked their
Dams, who as ſoon as they come aſhore bleat, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
come her young ones, and bleat about
her like Lambs, and ſuck her; one old Female
ſuckles four or five, and beats away other young
ones that come near, whence I believe they have
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52975:38"/>
four or five at a time; the young ones which we
killed and eat were as big as a midling Dog; we
cut the fat off of the Great ones, and made Oil of
it for the Lamps, and other uſes in the Ship; the
Oil of the young ones we fried, and eat with our
Proviſions; it is very ſweet and good to fry any
Food with; our Men will have it to be as good as
Olive Oil; moſt of my Men to day gathered of
thoſe green Peaſe-leaves and other Herbs for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads,
which ſome eat raw, ſome boiled; it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
to their Bodies.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>March</hi> 6. Blowing Weather, Wind at
Weſt: This day, after Prayers, I went aſhore on
the South-ſide of the River, and travelled eight
miles into the Land, South-weſt and by Weſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
twelve armed Men with me; my Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
went up the River in the Boat nine or ten
miles, to ſee for People that way; my other Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
went on the North-ſide with ten armed
Men to ſee for People, and view the Land; I
found in my Travels one of thoſe great Beaſts like
a Deer, dead and whole, the Vermin had not
touched him; all his Back had pretty long Wooll
of the colour of dried Roſe-leaves, and down his
ſides, his Belly white Wooll; he was as big as a
ſmall Colt, he had a long Neck, a Head like a
Sheep, ſo was his Mouth and Ears; his Legs very
long, and Cloven-footed like a Deer, a ſhort
buſhy Tail of a reddiſh colour; no Horns nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had any, it was a Male: I believe theſe Beaſts
are <hi>Peruvian</hi> Sheep; (<hi>Guianacoes</hi>) I had his Paunch
opened, and ſearched for the Bezoar-ſtone in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in the Pipe to the Stomach, I turned them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide

outward, but found none; I had heard <hi>Weſt-Indian
Spaniards</hi> ſay, that they have taken the
Bezoar-ſtone of Guianacoes, and therefore opened
this, which I take to be the ſame Beaſt: In tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
to day I ſaw ſeveral herds of them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ten, thirty, or forty together; I could not
get near enough to ſhoot at them; they neigh
like young Horſes, and ſo wander away: I ſaw
nine Oſtriches, but they would not ſuffer me to
come within ſhot of them; I let the Greyhound
at them, but they out-run him up the Hills: we
ſaw a Fox, a wild Dog, and five or ſix Hares, of
which the Greyhound killed one; they are ſhaped
like <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hares, and much larger, and inſtead
of a Tail have a little ſtub about an inch long,
without Hair on it; they have holes in the ground
like Coneys: no Woods to be ſeen, only a few
Buſhes like White-Thorns. The Land is dry, of a
ſandy gravelly Soil, in large rounding Hills, not
very high, but in Downs and Valleys, bearing
nothing but Graſs; here and there are gullies of
freſh Water in the Valleys, which is made in the
Winter-time when the Snow diſſolves: I ſaw ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places of ſalt Water in the Land, which is
occaſioned by the natural ſaltneſs of the Earth;
here are no Fruits nor Herbs: When I was at the
fartheſt, and on a Hill, I could not ſee any ſign
of People, or Woods, but ſtill Hills and Valleys
as far as we could deſcry; no Birds to be ſeen but
Kites, which are like thoſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſmall
Birds like Sparrows, and Linnets; ſome Flies and
Humble-bees here: we ſaw ſome ſmall four-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Animals running in the Graſs; ſpeckled-Grey,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52975:39"/>
ſhaped like a ſmall Creature in <hi>England</hi> called an
Eft, Newt or Lizard; no Adder nor Snake, nor any
venomous Creature; Cattle would live here very
well, ſuch as Horſes, Cows, Sheep, Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Evening growing upon us, I returned to the Ship,
and 'twas within Night when we got aboard our
Boat, and ten a Clock when we entered the Ship;
I found on Board my Lieutenant that went up the
River, but they which went on the North-ſide
were not come back; up the River they ſaw five
ſmall Iſlands, which had Sea-fowls on them and
Buſhes for fewel; the River grows broader up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and has ſeveral Rocks in it; on the ſhoar
they ſaw Guianacoes, Oſtriches, and Hares; no
People, Fire or Smoak; they ſaw where People
had been, and Fires made, and Muſcles and Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
roaſted; no freſh Water nor Wood, nor any
Metal or Mineral; the Land hilly with Graſs on
it: At twelve a Clock to Night thoſe that went
on the North-ſide came aboard; they had been
about eight miles into the Land North-weſt, and
ſaw no People, but found where People had been,
and made Fires in the Graſs, and Graſs laid to
fire the Buſhes; alſo where ſome had lain on open
places, and ſet little Buſhes in Half-moons, to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them from the Weather; on the top of a Hill
they made a fire with Graſs to ſee if any would
anſwer them; they ſat down by it all day, but
could ſee none made any where elſe: the Land
is in rounding large Hills, not very high, but like
Downs, as the Coaſt of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> about <hi>Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi>
no Woods nor Trees ſeen, nor freſh Water;
here and there a Buſh growing in a Valley; indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52975:39"/>
good Graſs; the Soil gravelly and ſandy,
and ſome ridges of Rocks; they ſaw Guianacoes,
Oſtriches, Hares, and Kites; ſeveral little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
like Efts; no kind of Fruit or Berry, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
or Metal: I charged them as they travelled
in any Gullies where Water had run to ſearch for
grains of Gold, or other Metal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Gold is
found in grains in ſuch Gullies, and much Gold
is found in the Land on the other ſide, not two
hundred Leagues diſtant from us; much Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hangs on the Earth where Water has been, in
a kind of Flower; the plaſhes of Water they met
with were as ſalt as Brine, which the Earth made.
I ſaw Smelts here eighteen Inches long lying dead
on the Shore, but hitherto have not ſeen one
Oyſter, or other ſhell-Fiſh, Crawfiſh, Lobſter, or
Crab, though 'tis poſſible the place may have 'em
all. Whilſt we were ſtanding by the Water-ſide,
a Seal chaſed on ſhore a Fiſh as large as a Mackrel
and like a Mullet; one of the Men took it up, and
dreſſed it, when he came on Board, 'twas excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
good; here muſt be a great quantity of Fiſh to
maintain all the Seals, Penguins, and other Fowls
that live upon nothing elſe, and yet are all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
fat, and innumerable in multitude; beſides
what Creatures we have not ſeen yet; I have
ſeen Seals in this Harbour ſwimming with their
heads above Water, with large Fiſh in their
Mouths.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>March</hi> 13. Indifferent Weather, Wind
at Weſt, a freſh gale; The Air cold this Morning.
I went up the River in my Boat with fourteen
Men armed; I paſt the Iſland, where the bruſhy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52975:40"/>
Buſhes are, and where we took the young Shags;
there the River grows broader, near a mile from
the North ſhore over to the South, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
that breadth four miles, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
narrower, and turns away to the South-weſt;
at this turning is an Iſland of a mean height
and Rocky, bearing ſome ſmall Buſhes and Graſs;
I went upon it, and ſaw a Poſt of five foot long
ſet up (it had been the timber of a Ship) with a
piece of Board about a foot ſquare nailed to it,
at the foot of it one of my Men took up a piece
of Sheet-Lead, and gave it to me, it had this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription

In a hole of the Poſt lay a latten or tin Box,
(which we found by a long Plug that ſtuck in
the hole) with a ſheet of written Paper encloſed
in it, but ſo eaten by the ruſt of the Box, that
'twas not to be read; I cut out with my Knife up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Board the Ship's Name, and the date of the
Year and Month, which I nailed to the Poſt; and
brought away the Lead with me, aud named the
place <hi>Le Mair's Iſland:</hi> we found on it ſeveral pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Boards, of the Wreck of ſome Ship, that
had been burned; they were drove up here by
the Tide; the People of the Country can't get
upon this Iſland: From hence I went on the North
ſide of the River two miles into the Land; no
Trees to be ſeen, but many Oſtriches and Guiana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes
in many places; the Soil is marly and good,
the Hills not very high, but plain large Downs,
with Graſs on them all over; digging in two or
three places I found ſandy dry ground near a foot
deep, then Marle: In my opinion it might be
made excellent Corn-ground, being ready to Till;
'tis very like the Land on <hi>New-market</hi> Heath; no
People to be ſeen; I ſearched the Gullies and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Rocks, for grains of Gold or Minerals, but
found neither: I returned to the Boat again, row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
farther under the ſhore, landed, and mounted
aſteep high Hill to view the Country; on the top
of this rocky Hill grow ſmall Buſhes: I could ſee
the courſe of the River a long way further, and the
Land all Graſs; here and there a white ſpot of
Marle on the ſide of a Hill; no People to be ſeen
nor Boats on the River; I came down to the Boat:
ſeveral Creeks run from hence a mile or two into
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52975:41"/>
the Land: I croſs'd the River to the South-eaſt
ſhore; we made the Boar faſt in a Creek in a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
and went all hands up the Land three miles;
we ſaw many Guianacoes, and Oſtriches, but could
not come within ſhot of them; I ſaw the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
of five Men that had been upon the Oar;
I meaſured my Foot with them, which was larger
and longer by half an Inch than any of them; we
could not ſee any People: it being near Night we
plucked up Graſs, and laid it to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for ſhelter; here we lay all Night, keeping
watch two by two; cold Air to Night, wind at
Weſt.</p>
            <p>Monday <hi>March</hi> 14. Fair Weather but cold. This
Morning by day-light we turn'd out, and marcht
into the Land four miles South-weſt and by South;
we could not find any freſh Water; we made a
Fire on the Graſs, but ſaw no ſign of any People;
we ſaw <hi>Guianacoes,</hi> Hares, Foxes, wild Dogs, pretty
large, and a grey Cat like an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one, running
up the Hills: to day we caught an <hi>Armadillo;</hi> the
Dogs put her to ground; they have holes like Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys;
we ſoon dug her out, 'twas as big as a great
Hedg-hog, and not much unlike one; the <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillo</hi>
is caſed over the Body with a ſhell,ſhutting
one under another like ſhells of Armour; the
Dogs couls not hurt her: we ſaw Rats in many
places, and a kind of Polecat, with two white
ſtreaks on the Back, all the reſt black; our Dogs
killed two of them; they ſtink much, ſeveral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriches,
ſome Partridges and many Kites: the
Land in fair Hills without Wood or freſh Water;
the Soil a ſandy Gravel with Graſs all over it; no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52975:41"/>
Mineral or Metal ſeen. This afternoon we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to our Boat, and went through a Creek two
miles long, which is dry at low Water, and
not more than thirty foot broad; it makes a fair
Iſland of a mean heighth, plain on the top, and
Graſs growing all over it, but no Wood nor Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon it; the greateſt part of it is a ſandy marly
Soil; 'tis two miles long, and half a mile broad;
the Greyhound killed two Hares on it preſently,
and we ſaw above twenty; I called it <hi>Hare-Iſland;</hi>
it is adjacent to the South-ſhore; eight miles up
the River from the narrow, I went down the River
and went aboard: this Evening cold Air, Wind at
Weſt, a ſtout Gale; towards Morning it came to
the North; I cannot perceive the <hi>Indians</hi> have any
Canoas or other Boats here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 24. Blowing Weather, Wind at Weſt.
We fetch'd all our things off the ſhore, and got the
Ship ready to Sail; I went a-ſhore on the South-ſide
to the peeked Rock, and found it a natural
Rock, ſtanding on a ſmall round Hill, as if it had
been built there by Man; it hath a Cleft on the
top it as big in circumference as a But: 'tis near
forty foot high above the Hill it ſtands on; about
it lie little lumps of Rocks; I ſaw nothing elſe
worth notice, ſo I return'd to the Ship; the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
ſtick growing in or near this Harbour, or in
the Countries as far as we went, which was twenty
Miles, would not make a Helve for a Hatchet, but
there are Buſhes which will ſerve for firing at Sea:
before Night I had all things on Board, and the
Ship fitted with intent to ſail next Morning, and
look'd along the Coaſts for the Pink, till I arrived

at <hi>Port St. Julian's Harbour;</hi> freſh Water is ſcarce
in <hi>Port Deſier Harbour</hi> in the Summer-time; the
places from whence I fetch'd Water, are ſmall
Springs on the North-ſide, out of which I filled
near forty Tuns; the firſt Spring is on the North-ſide,
as you enter the Harbour half a mile up a
Valley, in a gully of Rocks: it bears North-north-weſt
from the lower Rock; that we called <hi>Peckets
Well,</hi> is a mile up the River, within a Bow-ſhot
of the ſalt Water, 'tis in a gully: the Land in theſe
Valleys has very green and ſweet Graſs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of wild Peaſe; ſmall Nut-galls growing
on the Buſhes, but in no great quantity, and but
few Buſhes; Salt may be made here, for on the
Shore-ſide, and on the Rocks I gathered ſeveral
handfuls of good Salt.</p>

               <hi>March</hi> 25. Gentlemen, You are by me deſired

the Land in this Country on both Shores, for the

            <p>Saturday <hi>March</hi> 26. Wind at Weſt, a ſtout

at ſix a Clock when the Sun appeared above the
Eaſt Horizon, the Moon ſet in the Weſt-horizon,
being eclipſed at <hi>London</hi> at Elevan a Clock, ten
minutes in the Forenoon; but here at ſix a Clock
thirty minutes paſt, which gives four hours forty

            <p>Saturday <hi>April</hi> 2. Fair Weather this Morning,
Wind at North-north-weſt, a fine gale. I filled
at Day-light, and ſteered away South-ſouth-weſt,
and South and by Weſt by my Compaſs, as the
Coaſt lies; I ſailed along in twenty Fathom-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
black Sand diſtant from the ſhore near three
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52975:43"/>
Leagues: this forenoon at nine a Clock, I ſaw
a ſmall flat Iſland to the Weſtward of me; about a
League off the Land; it lies in the Latitude of
48 <hi>d.</hi> 40 <hi>m.</hi> South; the Land againſt it is high, in
large Hills, and ſome round copling tops; two
Leagues more to the Southward, the Land is low,
in a great Plain, and a Beach by the Sea-ſide, but
the ſhore againſt this Iſland is rocky; I was two
Leagues Eaſt from the flat Iſland, and had twenty
three fathom black Sand; I haled cloſe in for the
ſhore, and ſail'd within five Miles of it; all along
from this Iſland to <hi>Port St. Julian</hi> I ſounded as I
ſail'd along, and had 18 or 20 fathom fine black
Sand; the Land is low in a Valley; the Sea-ſhore
is a Beach, here and there a Rock; it is in a long
Beach for four Leagues; after you are to the
Southward of the Flat-Iſland one League, the ſhore
lies South-fourth-weſt and North-north-eaſt; at
the South-end of this Beach in-land are high round
Hills, but at the Sea-ſide is a ſteep white Cliff, of
an indifferent heighth with a black ſtreak in it;
over the Cliff the Hill rounds up to the top, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſome ſmall black Buſhes growing on the ſide;
no Wood or Tree ſeen.</p>
            <p>In this Bay is <hi>Port St. Julian;</hi> the Harbour's
mouth is in the middle of the Bay, but you cannot
ſee it without, for one Point ſhutting in the other;
you muſt ſend your Boat in to diſcover the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
at Low-water, and the Bar without, for 'tis a
barred Harbour: the Land in the Country over
<hi>Port St. Julian,</hi> on the Weſt-ſide, is high copling
round Hills, like blunt Sugar-loaves on the top;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is the higheſt Land I ſaw in all the Country,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52975:43"/>
and there are no ſuch Hills beſides on the Coaſt;
the Land is plain to the South without any Hill,
as far as we could ſee at this time: this Afternoon
it proved a Calm; I anchored in the Bay before
St. <hi>Julian,</hi> in twelve fathom Water, black oary
Land, the Harbour's mouth bearing Weſt-ſouth-weſt
of me, about two Leagues off: I ſent in my
Boat to diſcover the Harbour, and ſee if the Pink
was there, which returned to Night at ſix a Clock;
my Lieutenant told me there was a ſafe Harbour,
and Water enough for a bigger Ship, but no Pink,
nor any ſign of her having been there; now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired
of ever ſeeing her more, after my hopes
were fruſtrated here; nevertheleſs I doubted not
the ſucceſs of my Voyage, though the Company
thought 'twould be dangerous being a lone Ship,
a ſtormy Sea to ſail in, and unknown Coaſts to
ſearch out, and if we ſhould happen to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
any where, could expect no relief; theſe
ſuſpicions I ſoon put out of their Heads, by telling
them of the great Riches of the Land, and that
<hi>Captain Drake</hi> went round the World in one Ship,
when in thoſe days there were but ordinary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators;
and was it for us to queſtion our good
fortune, who beyond Compariſon are better Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
if we would put our ſelves in Action; and
for me, I would expoſe no Man to more danger
than my ſelf in the Attempt. Calm to Night; I
rode faſt, a ſmall Tide running where I rode; the
Water ebb'd near three fathom perpendicular: it
is near nine Leagues from the <hi>Flat Iſland</hi> to <hi>Saint
Julian,</hi> South-ſouth-weſt and North-north-eaſt as

            <p>Wedneſday
, <hi>April</hi> 13. Fair Weather, Wind at
Weſt, a ſmall gale. Froſty and cold Air, no ſign
of the Pink: I went aſhore and haled the Seyne
on the Eaſt-ſide; at the firſt of the Flood we
caught five hundred Fiſhes, as big as large Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and much like them, grey, and full of Scales:
ſome as big as a Man's Leg; we caught them all
in four hours time, returned aboard, and divided
them among the whole Ship's Company; they eat
admirably well; many good Muſcles lie on the
Rocks, and Oyſter-ſhells on the Shore-ſide, and
growing in Veins on the Rocks, but no Meat in
them: Wind at Weſt to Night, a freſh gale.</p>
            <p>Monday <hi>April</hi> 18. Wind at South-weſt, a ſtiff
gale. Cold Air and ſome Snow this Morning; the
Winter is come ſtrong and ſtormy, ſo that 'twill
be impoſſible to hold the Coaſt into the Streights;
for the Wind blows altogether from the Weſt or
Weſt-ſoutherly, and in ſuch Guſts as will force a
Ship off the Coaſt. This day I ordered my Purſer
to ſerve the Company Brandy-wine for their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance,
at a Quart <hi>per</hi> Week a Man: I got a
Boats lading of the Wood of the Country aboard
for firing; to Night it blew hard at South-weſt;
all the Company eat ſalt Seal, and Penguins for
their Allowance: ſweet and very good Meat, and
keeps well and long in Salt.</p>

Friday <hi>April</hi> 22. Wind at South-weſt, a ſtiff
gale, and cold Air. This Morning I went aſhore on
the North-weſt ſide with twenty Men to the Salt-pond,
which is ruſted all over like a Pavement,
with very white and good Salt, two Inches thick,
for two miles long: in <hi>February</hi> here's Salt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to fill a thouſand Ships; we filled two Bags
and laid up near two Tuns out of the Water, for
there was Water over the Salt, which began to
decay with the Rain and Weather beating on it:
at Night I returned aboard, we brought as much
Salt with us as filled a Punchion, very good white
Stone-ſalt, whiter than <hi>French</hi>-Salt, and of a very
pleaſant ſmell; I ſaw ſome Guianacoes, and Oſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
the Hills and Valleys dry Earth, and Graſs
on them: on the higher Hills lies Snow, no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but many places where they had made fires,
and lain under a Buſh for ſhelter; no Mineral or
Metal, Tree, or Fruit.</p>
            <p>Wednesday, <hi>April</hi> 27. Cloſe Weather, and little
Wind; a cold Air, it freezes hard, the Ice bears a

            <p>Thurſday <hi>April</hi> 28. Wind at Weſt and by
South, a fine gale, cold froſty Weather. We un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig'd
the Ship, and made all ſnug, intending to
Winter in this Harbour; the Ice will not ſuffer us
to paſs the Streights; the Winds are ſo ſtormy, and
generally out of the Weſtern quarter; the Nights
ſo long and cold, that the paſſage is impossible
this Winter. The Port I found ſafe to ride in, and
good refreſhment to be had of Fowls: as Ducks,
Peekes, and Divers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Spring I may be
ready to ſail to the Southward, when we ſhall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52975:45"/>
have the year before us, and the Sun in the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Signs, which will give long Days and ſhort
Nights, and temperate Weather; Wind at North-north-eaſt
this Evening, and Rain: it blew a great
ſtorm to Night, the Boat ſunk at the Ship's ſtern,
and loſt the Oars: leſs Wind towards Night, and
veared to the Weſt.</p>
            <p>Friday <hi>May</hi> 6. Wind at Weſt-north-weſt, a fine
gale. I went a-ſhore on the North-weſt ſide with
thirty Men, and travelled ſeven or eight miles up
the Hill, ſaw no People: the Land is great Graſs-Downs
in moſt places; and on the tops of the
Hills, and in the Ground are very large Oyſter-ſhells
they lie in Veins in the Earth, and in the firm
Rocks: and on the ſides of Hills in the Country;
they are the biggeſt Oyſter-ſhells that ever I ſaw;
ſome ſix, ſome ſeven Inches broad, yet not one
Oyſter to be found in the Harbour; whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
they were here when the Earth was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
no ſign of Mine or Metal, no Woods or Tree;
We found a good Spring of freſh Water up in the
Hills, it drains into ſalt Water-ſwaſhes: We ſaw
ſeveral Salt-water Ponds ſix miles in the Land,
made by the ſaltneſs of the Earth; we ſaw Oſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Guianacoes, and a Fox. I made a Fire on the
top of the higheſt Hill, but could ſee no anſwer;
I returned aboard with my Company very weary;
ſome of my Men fetched Salt to day: fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Night.</p>
            <p>Friday <hi>May</hi> 13. Indifferent Weather, Wind at
Weſt-ſouth-weſt, a fine gale. This day we fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Salt: a Gentleman of my Company, Mr. <hi>John
Wood,</hi> walking on the <hi>Iſland of Juſice,</hi> found three
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52975:45"/>
ſmall pieces of Gold Wire in two Muſcle-ſhells:
which Shells were made together by a green Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring:
the Gold was to the value of two ſhillings
Engliſh, and had been hammered, the wire as big
as a great Pin.</p>
            <p>Monday <hi>June</hi> 6. Cloudy cold Weather, Wind at
South-weſt, a freſh gale. This day I went a-ſhore
with ſixteen Men, and travelled ten miles Weſt
into the Land; the Hills there are covered with
Snow: 'tis very cold, we could not go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for Snow; and the Air is ſo cold that we
could not endure to lie on the ground; on the
Hill that I was on, we could ſee nothing but Hill
beyond Hill; no Woods, nor Trees, nor Buſhes,
all graſs Downs: the Land is flat on the tops of
the Hills; freſh Water runs down in ſeveral places,
which is melted Snow, and when the Water leaves
running, there's no Snow. I ſaw many Guiana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes,
and Oſtriches; no People or ſign of any:
cloſe by the Water-ſide we ſaw many places, where
they had lain on open Hills in the Snow, and ſome
places where they had killed and eat Guianacoes
and Oſtriches; they make but ſmall Fires with
little ſticks; I do not find they roaſt their fleſh at
them, for we ſaw ſome raw Fleſh hanging to the
Bones, which they had gnawed with their Teeth:
their Fires are only to warm their Children's Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
as we imagine: I gathered ſome handfuls of
Guianacoes Wool that lay here; I am perſuaded
theſe People muſt needs ſee us travelling to and
fro every day, but won't come near or be ſeen by
us: they live like wild Beaſts, or rather worſe, for
ſometimes they muſt be in great want of Food;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52975:46"/>
here's neither Fruit, Root, or Herb for it: The
Land is a dry gravelly Soil, with Sand, and in
many places a Marle two foot below the Surface;
the Graſs, which is dry, grows in knots, not very
long but thick; in the Valleys the Earth is of a
Petery or nitrous Nature; Oſtriches ſeen; no ſign
of Metal or Mineral; I and my Company have
looked in moſt places where we travelled for it:
to Night we got down but very weary.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>June</hi> 7. clſe dark Weather, Wind
at North-eaſt and by Eaſt, a fair gale: a new
Moon to day, fine Weather to Night, but
cold; the Stars near the <hi>Pole Antartick</hi> are
very viſible; ſome of the ſmall Stars in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation
of little <hi>Hydra</hi> are near the <hi>Pole;</hi> Here
are many good Stars near the Pole, good for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
of the firſt and ſecond Magnitude: the
Star at the South-end of <hi>Ariadne,</hi> the Star at <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra's
Head;</hi> the Star in the <hi>Peacock's eye,</hi> and the
Stars in <hi>Tucan's bill,</hi> and the Stars in <hi>Tucan's thigh
and back;</hi> the stars in <hi>Grus's head and wing and
body;</hi> but the brighteſt Stars are the Stars in the
former foot of <hi>Centaurus</hi> and the <hi>Croſiers;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stars are of the third, fourth and fifth Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude:
The two Clouds are ſeen very plainly,
and a ſmall black Cloud, which the foot of the
<hi>Croſs</hi> is in, is always very viſible when the Croſiers
are above the Horizon, as they are alway here
in theſe Latitudes. The Heavens in this South
Hemiſphere are as the Heavens in the North He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere;
but no Stars within eighteen degrees
of the Pole fit for Obſervation; no Pole-ſtar, as
the Star in the Tail of the little <hi>Bear</hi> is in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52975:46"/>
North: the Air cold to Night, but very healthy
for ſtirring Men; I have not had my Finger ached
as yet; a Man hath an excellent ſtomach here; I
can eat Foxes and Kites as ſavourily as if it were
Mutton; every Fox and Kite as we kill, we eat,
which is ever now and then one killed. Nothing
comes amiſs to our ſtomachs, not one Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of cold in his Head or of Coughs. Young
Men well grown and of good ſhape are moſt fit
for this Country, it being a dry and an hungry
Air, and Proviſions to be got with pains. The
Oſtriches are nothing ſo big as the Oſtriches in
<hi>Barbary,</hi> nor of the Colour nor Feather; theſe are
grey on the Back, and ſhaggy Feathers of no uſe,
and the Feathers on their Bellies are whire; they
have long Legs and ſmall Wings; they cannot
fly; they have a long Neck, and a ſmall Head,
and beaked near like a Gooſe; they are much like
a great Turky-cock, and good lean dry Meat and
ſweet: to Night I came aboard; it blew freſh at
weſt.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday <hi>June</hi> 22. Wind at Weſt-north-weſt,
a ſtout gale. This day I went aſhore on
the Eaſt-ſide, ſaw no People; this day Mr. <hi>John
Wood</hi> went aſhore on the Weſt ſide, and three Men
with him; they were armed; they travelled into
the Land Weſt and by North about four miles;
where they ſaw ſeven People of the Country on
a Hill, making a noiſe and wafting them to the
Ship: Our Men went up the riſe of the Hill to
them; three of the <hi>Indian</hi> Men came to Mr. <hi>Wood</hi>
with their Bows and Arrows in their Hands, and
a looſe skin about their Bodies, and a Furr-skin
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52975:47"/>
about their Heads, and pieces of skins about their
Feet, and all the other parts of their bodies na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;
they were painted red and white on their
Faces; they would not come ſo near as to let our
Men touch them, but ſlepped back as you mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
forward; they continuing their noiſe, and
wafting with their Hands towards the Ship, and
and kept talking, but no Man could underſtand
them: they repeated <hi>Ozſe, Ozſe,</hi> very often; they
have an harſh Speech and ſpeak in the Throat;
they received any thing that you caſt to them on
the ground. Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> gave them a Knife, and a
Shaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, and a Neckcloath, and a bottle of Brandy:
they would not drink; Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any Bracelets they had, or any thing about
them ſave their Skin: they are people of a middle
ſtature, and well-ſhaped; tawny Olive-colour'd,
black Hair, not very long: they ſeem to be of a
rude behaviour, for they returned nothing for
what they received, nor took no notice of any
thing; the reſt of their Company ſtayed at the
Hill: they can endure much cold, for their Legs,
Buttocks, and lower parts are naked. Mr. <hi>Wood</hi>
was taller than any of them, and he judged the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of the three to be upwards of forty years old,
the other thirty. They ſeemed to be very fearful;
they took their own time, and went away into the
Land. Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> returned aboard and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me with what he had ſeen. This Night we
ſaw a Fire in the Hills. It blew hard to Night at
Weſt. They have ſmall Dogs with them; they
would not have come near our People, if they had
not fallen accidentally in the Hills and Valleys
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52975:47"/>
with them. I have thought that they have heard
of the cruel dealings of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and dare not
truſt us.</p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>July</hi> 2. Wind at Weſt, a fine gale. I
went a-ſhore on the Eaſt-ſide; we killed a great
Guianacoe with the Greyhound. I looked in his
Paunch for the Bezoar-ſtone, but found nothing.
I travelled to and fro but ſaw no people: I ſaw
where People had made earthen Pots, and had
glaſed them, for there lay ſome of their ſtuff run
together: at Night I went aboard.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>July</hi> 3. Wind at South, cloſe Weather.
The Guianacoe weighed, cleaved in his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
two hundred and fifty pounds neat. He
ſerved all the Company for a days Fleſh, and is
good Meat.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>July</hi> 12. Cloſe Weather, and little
Wind at North and by Weſt. I went up to the
head of the Harbour, but ſaw no People: There
is in the Fullers-Earth Cliffs at the head of the
Harbour, a Vein made like rotten Iſing-glaſs; I
took ſome out, but cannot find it good for any
thing: I digged in the Cliff, but ſaw nothing to
be taken notice of. I ſaw in two places pieces of
floor Timbers of a Ship; they have laid a long
time rotting. We ſaw that the biggeſt of theſe
Buſhes here, have been cut down by ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
People. I ſaw wooden Plates, and a piece of
Cork, and a piece of an old Oar: ſome Chriſtian
Ship had been here formerly. I lay aſhore to
Night.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>July</hi> 31. Fair Weather, Wind at South-west,
a ſtiff gale. The Weather as cold as it is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52975:48"/>
in <hi>England</hi> in the height of Winter, and the Air
rather ſharper and dryer; I have now twelve Men
lame with the cold, and their Legs and Thighs
are turned as black as a black Hat, in ſpots, the
cold having chilled the Blood; yet they uſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
and ſtuping thoſe places, and all that they
can to prevent it, but it rather encreaſeth on them
than otherwiſe: Theſe are ſuch people as I could
not make ſtir by an meyans; they that ſtir are as
well as any Men in the World can be.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>Auguſt 2.</hi> Cloſe Weather, Wind at
South-weſt, a gale and cold Air. We fall on fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of our Rigging and getting the Ship fit: Here
are hundreds of Guianacoes in companies near the
Water-ſide: my Greyhound is lame, ſo that I
cannot make her run; alſo here are many Oſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
together with many green plovers at the
Watercr-ſide, and ſome Swans, but not full ſo large
as ours: They are white, ſave a black Head, and
half the Neck and Legs black: Here are ſome
white Geeſe, as <hi>European</hi> geeſe; the brant-Geeſe
are ſome whith, ſome black and grey; The Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards
and Ducks are grey; and the Teals are grey.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>Auguſt 16.</hi> Cloſe Weather, Wind at
Weſt and at North-weſt, a fine gale. I ſent the
Boat for Water to a Swaſh on the Eaſt-ſide; two
of my Men ſaw two of the People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
on the Eaſt-ſide behind a Buſh; my Men went
toward them; they went away and left a bundle
of Skins under the Buſh; my Men made ſigns to
ſpeak with them, but they would not ſtay; m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Men did not go after them but ſat down, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52975:48"/>
my Men brought the Bundle aboard to ſhew
it to me, and two mungrel Dogs, which were cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
together. I opened the Bundle and it was
ſeveral bags of Skins, with red Earth and white
Earth, and Soot or paint in a Bag: this is the
Trade they paint themſelves with; they had
Flint-ſtones and Arrow-heads in the Bundle; I
ſearched the Bundle all over to ſee grains of
Gold, but could not find any: There were Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
of Shells, and bits of Sticks, and braided
Thongs, and Arrows, and Muſcle-ſhells, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madillo-ſhells,
and a ſmall point of a Nail in a
ſtick for a Bodkin: Their Skins were pieces of
Seal-skins, and pieces of Guianaco-skins, ſewed
together with ſmall Guts; all very old and full
of holes, and ſmelt of greaſe; There were pieces
of Flints made faſt with a green Gut, in the ſplit
of a Stick, which they hold faſt to knock their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-heads
into ſhape: There were alſo pieces of
Sticks to get Fire with. This was all that was in
the Bundle; it was made faſt with Leather-thongs,
braided round like Whip-cord, and the Dogs
were coupled with ſuch ſtrings: The Muſcle-ſhells
are their Knives. I put all things up in the
Bag, and made it faſt. Their Dogs are much of
the Race of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dogs; a good large mungrel
Cur, but very tame; any Man might handle them;
they were grey in colour, and painted red in ſpots:
they were very lean; there were two grcat Staves
of four foot long, which was tough Cane in ſhort
joints: I carried them a-ſhore next day.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>Auguſt</hi> 30. Foggy cloſe Weather this
morning, Wind at North. We travelled away
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52975:49"/>
Weſt into the Land ten or twenty miles farther:
The Land all dry, with Graſs, and Buſhes in ſome
places like Thorns; the Hills high, and many,
and Snow on the tops; no Woods, nor Trees to
be ſeen; Freſh-water comes running out of the
Hills in fine Rivulet; no Fruit; many ſedgy
Buſhes grow on the Brink, and brave green Graſs,
and a green Herb of a pretty ſtrong hot taſte;
ſome Teal in the Water, and Water-birds; this is
all I ſaw about the Rivulet. Many large Ponds
in the Country, but ſalt Water in thoſe Ponds;
we ſaw Fowls like Herons, but all red; in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
we ſaw hundreds of Guianacoes in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and twenty Oſtriches: ſome Heres and ſome
Partridges, greyer and bigger than ours; ſome
Snipes and ſmall Birds; ſeveral Penne-wrens: we
ſaw ſeveral Kites, and ſmall Hawks, and Owls;
we caught two Armadilloes; I ſaw two Foxes and
a wild Dog, and many brant-Geeſe: the Land is
in Hills and Valleys as far as we could ſee, and
bad travelling on foot; the Soil is gravelly and
dry sand, of a Salt-petre nature; the Graſs in
ſome places long and dry, and in ſome places ſhort
and dry; the Hills are rounding aloft like large
Downs: We red Earth in ſome places, ſuch
as the <hi>Indians</hi> uſe; we ſaw the Footſteps of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in many places in the Clay, and places where
they had been, and had killed Guianacoes, and
made a fire there; I gathered Guianacoes-Wooll,
and Oſtriches Feathers were ſcattered about the
place, and Bones: there lay the Skulls of three
People, no fleſh on them; they were very clean,
and no larger than the Skulls of <hi>European</hi> Men;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52975:49"/>
ſmooth and even Teeth, cloſe ſet; one of thoſe
Skulls was broken. Whether theſe people be
<hi>Man-eaters</hi> or not I cannot tell; I judge they have
Wars one with another, by reaſon here are ſo
few People in this great Land, and food enough
to live on, and the Land all clear and good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturage
for Cattle, and no Mountains; in all the
Land there are Plains and graſſy Meadows: here
wants only Wood to build with; it that were
here, it would be as good a Land as any part of
<hi>America,</hi> for the Counrry is very healthy. This
Afternoon it rained, and was very thick and fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
ſo as we could not tell which way to go, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we had a Compaſs with us; for there is
no going into the Land without one, becauſe a
Man will miſtake his way, the Country is ſo open
in great Plains and Downs: We were very much
wet and cold; We got to Buſhes, and there made
a Fire and dried our ſelves: we ſtayed here all
Night; we neither heard nor ſaw any thing to
Night.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>September</hi> 1. 1670. Cloſe haſey Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Wind at North, a ſmall gale, ſo as I could
not Sail this day; we tried for Fiſh, but caught
none, the Water is ſo cold, I was on the Land,
when I was at the fartheſt, twenty five miles
Weſt-north-weſt from the Harbour-mouth, and
all things as I ſaw I have mentioned, excepting
ſome ſmall Creatures like Efts, which run in the
Graſs; no manner of Snake or venomous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have I ſeen in this Country; here are ſome
Earth-worms, and Caterpillers, and other Buggs,
but few in number: no wild Beaſt of prey, or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52975:50"/>
any other thing to annoy the Inhabitants, but
Cold and Hunger: Here lies a large Country,
open to receive any Inhabitants from forein Parts,
and large enough to ſatisfie the Undertakers:
The Land would produce <hi>European</hi> Grain, if plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
here, and breed Cattle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> 16. I conſidering my Men, being
very weak, thought it moſt fit to go for <hi>Port De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier,</hi>
and there to refreſh the Men, for I knowing
there I could have what Penguins and Seals I
would have, which are good Proviſions; alſo I do
intend to ſalt up a quantity of each, to carry to
Sea with me, to lengthen out my Proviſions. This
Forenoon I ſteered from St. <hi>Julian</hi> North-north-eaſt,
and made what Sail I could to get to <hi>Pert
Deſier:</hi> This Night it was a ſmall gale, and
veered to the Weſt-ſouth-weſt; I judge it beſt to
make my eaſie Sail in the Night, for fear of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up with the Eady Stone-Rocks before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday <hi>September</hi> 21. Fair Weather to day,
the Wind veerable round the Compaſs. This
Morning I had both the Boats leden with Seals,
and Penguins and Penguin-eggs; ten Men may
kill ten thouſand Penguins in leſs than an hours
time; the Seals and Penguins are numberleſs:
a Man cannot paſs on the Iſland for them. This
Evening I got on board and landed our lading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore;
fair Weather to Night. The Eggs are
very good Nouriſhment, and the Fat ſerves for Oil
to the Lamps.</p>
            <p>Thurſday <hi>September</hi> 22. Fair Weather, Wind
at Weſt. This day I divided the Eggs amongſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52975:50"/>
the Men: we skinned the Seals and the Penguins,
and ſalted the Fleſh in bulk on the Rock, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it to keep the Wind from it: good Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and little Wind to Night.</p>
            <p>Friday <hi>September</hi> 30. The Wind at North this
Morning; this forenoon it came to the South-eaſt,
and blew hard, and rained. This day I went
up the River about ten miles, and <hi>Don Carolus</hi> with
me, and ten Men to ſee for People: we lay out all
Night on the South-ſide, but ſaw no People; this
Night the people of the Country came to our little
Well, which is up in the Valley, and ſtole an Iron
Pot, and three ſuits of Cloaths of the Mens, that
were laid there a drying, with ſome other Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen;
but did not meddle with the Beads, which
are hung up on a Pole on the Hills, and they will
not come near it nor meddle with it: The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Country have made in a Valley, the
form of the Ship in Earth and Buſhes, and ſtuck
up pieces of ſticks for Maſts, and redded the
Buſhes all over with red Earth; the Model I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
is to record our Ship, for they cannot
have any Records but by imitation: This Fancy
we let alone untouched, only I laid a ſtring or two
of Beads on it and came away: cloſe Weather to
Night. Theſe People muſt certainly have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſome injury in former times, from ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that have been here in Shipping, otherwiſe
they would come in ſight of us; or elſe they have
heard of the cruel dealings of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Indians,</hi> where they lived near: I have
uſed all endeavours poſſibly by fair means to have
Conference with them, but all is in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52975:51"/>
Tueſday <hi>October</hi> 11. The Wind at Weſt-ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt,
a ſtout gale; very cold, Hail and ſleety
Snow to day. Our Men are all in good health
and are luſty and fat, thoſe wihch had the Scurvy
are got very well with eating of freſh Meat, and
ſuch green Herbs as they can get on the ſhore, as
green Peaſe-leaves and ſuch trade; they mince it,
fry it with Eggs and Seal-oil; and it hath raiſed
every Man in as good health as they were at our
coming out of <hi>England:</hi> We fare very well, and
have great plenty of good Proviſions: Here is
Proviſion enough of Seals and Penguins, if ſalt
be plenty, to lade Ships; I can confidently ſay,
that on the <hi>Iſland of Penguins</hi> there are more Seals
and Penguins at this preſent, than three hundred
Tuns of Cask can hold, when dreſſed and ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
beſides what are going off and coming on; if
any Men ſhould have occaſion for proviſions of
Fleſh, If they have Salt, here they may furniſh
themſelves with what quantity ſhall ſeem fit for
them, and I can aſſure them it will laſt four
Months ſweet, if not longer, if care be taken in
bleeding, and dreſſing, and ſalting, as I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
before; the Salt may alſo be had at Saint
<hi>Julian</hi>'s Salt-pond in Summer-time; alſo I believe
that Salt may be made at <hi>Port Deſier</hi> in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time,
for here is ſome dried Salt on the holes
of the Rocks: Here are ſeveral Flats, where Men
may make Pits and let in Salt-water, and ſo make
Salt, as I have ſeen in other places.</p>
            <p>The Penguin is a Fowl that lives by catching
and eating of Fiſh, which he dives for, and is very
nimble in the Water; he is as big as a brant-gooſe,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52975:51"/>
and weighs near about eight pounds; they
have no Wings, but flat ſtumps like Fins: their
Coat is a downy ſtumped Feather; they are
blackiſh, grey on the Backs and Heads, and white
about their Necks and down their Bellies: they
are ſhort legged like a Gooſe, and ſtand upright
like little Children in white Aprons, in companies
together; they are full-necked, and headed and
beaked like a Crow, only the point of their Bill

            <p>Variation of the Compaſs here I find to be
Eaſterly, 17 Degrees.</p>
            <p>Here is Anchoring all about this Part of the
<hi>Streights,</hi> in the fair way from <hi>Cape Virgin-Mary,</hi>
till you come into the Narrow. I did not find much
Tide any where hereabout, but in the Narrow,
and there the Tide runs ſtronger than it does in
the <hi>Hope</hi> a good matter; the floud Tide ſets into
the <hi>Streights,</hi> and the Ebb ſets out; it keepeth
its courſe, as on other Coaſts: it is ſix hours
Floud and two hours Ebb; it riſeth and falls near
four Fathom perpendicular; it is an high Water
here, on the change day of the Moon at eleven of
the Clock, as far as I could perceive. Many beds
of Rock-weed are driving to and fro here. This
day at two of the Clock I was a-breaſt of Point
Poſſeſſion; I ſteered from thence Weſt-north-weſt
about two Leagues, and then Weſt and Weſt-ſouth-weſt:
and South-weſt and by South, round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the North-ſhore: As I ſhoaled my ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
I had 22, and 18, and 16, and 12, and 9
Fathoms, ſandy, and ſometimes gravelly Ground
and pebble Stones; I ſailed, rounding the ſhore
being unacquainted, and could not tell certainly
where the Narrow lay, for it was ſhut in one Land
with the other, ſo as I could not ſee the opening:
I was open of the Narrow at five a Clock, having
a fine gale at North-north-eaſt. I ſteered in South-weſt
and by South into the chops of it, but could
not get paſt a League into it; the Tide being
bent out and run ſo ſtrong as I could not ſtem it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52975:52"/>
I was in danger of running the Ship againſt ſteep
Rocks, which lie in the North-ſide, the taking a
ſhear with the Tide, and the Wind was a freſh
gale at North-north-eaſt. There grew long Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed
on the Rocks; I went and ſounded over
them, and had five foot Water on them, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Fathom by the ſide of them, next the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel:
they come trenting from the point of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the North-ſide, a mile off. At ſix of the
Clock the Wind came to the North; at eight of
the Clock it came to the North-weſt; it fell very
dark and rained much; I was forced to fall
back again out of the Narrow as well as I could;
the ſhore I could not ſee, it was ſo dark; it fell,
a flat Calm, I finding twenty five Fathom Water,
pebble Stones and oary; I anchored and rode all
Night; little Wind at South-weſt, and dark.</p>
            <p>It is eight Leagues from the firſt Narrow to the
ſecond, and ſomething better; the Courſe from
one to the other is Weſt and by South, and Eaſt
and by North. This Reach from the firſt Narrow
to the ſecond is ſeven Leagues broad, from the
North-ſhore to the South-ſhore; it ſhews like a
little Sea when one comes into it, for we could
not ſee to the ſecond Narrow, till I had ſailed
therein three Leagues or more. At the point
of the ſecond Narrow, on the North-ſhore;
up to the North-eaſt-ward a mile or two, there is
a Bay on the North-ſhore, and a white Cliff of
an ordinary height, which is called <hi>Cape St. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory:</hi>
In this Bay you may ride in eight Fathom
Water, fine clean ſandy Ground, and a good half
mile off the ſhore; This is a good Road, if the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52975:53"/>
Wind be between the North-eaſt and the South-weſt
to the Weſtward; the Winds are given moſt
to blow on the Weſtern-quarter. As I ſailed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the ſecond Narrow, I ſounded in the fair
way, and had twenty eight, and thirty Fathom
ſmall ſtones; The North-ſhore on this Narrow
makes in a Bay at the Eaſt-point, and is white Cliffs
all the way through: This Narrow lies throughout
Weſt-ſouth-weſt, and Eaſt-north-eaſt, and at the
Weſt-end of the Narrow the Land is ſteep up, in
white Cliffs, and the South part rounds away in a
rore-land: The South-ſhore rounds away South-eaſt
from this Fore-land, and then it trents away
to the Southward in low Land: The North-ſhore
of this Narrow or Streight, rounds up to the
Northward in white Cliffs, and falls into ſhores;
there goes in a Harbour which hath four Fathom
in the Channel, at High-water; it is a flat round
Harbour within, and oary; I called this <hi>Oaz-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi>
When you are at the Weſt-part of this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
you will ſee three Iſlands come open, which
ſhew to be ſteep up Cliffs: they lie Triangle-wiſe
one of another; they are four Leagues diſtant
from the Narrow, Weſt-ſouth-weſt; The ſmalleſt
and Eaſtermoſt Iſle is called <hi>St. Bartholomews,</hi> the
biggeſt and Weſter-moſt is called <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> the
middle-moſt and souther-moſt is called <hi>S. George's,</hi>
and by ſome <hi>Penguins-Iſle,</hi> and indeed there are
many Penguins on it. This Evening I got up to
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, and anchored in eight Fathoms and
an half sine black Sand, two miles off the Iſland.
The Eaſt-point bears South and by Eaſt of me:
fair Weather all Night, the Wind at South and by
Weſt.</p>

This Morning I went aſhore on <hi>Elizabeth-Iſland,</hi>
and at my landing nineteen of the Countrey-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came off the Hills to me: I had Conference
with them, and exchanged Knives and Beads for
ſuch things as they had: which were Bows and
Arrows, and their Skin-Coats, which are made of
young <hi>Guianacoes</hi> skins; I gave them a Hatchet and
Knives, and Beads and Toys, Trumps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they
ſeem'd to be very well-pleaſed; I ſhewed them
Gold, which they would have had; I made them
ſigns, that if they had any, I would give them
Knives and Beads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it, or If any where in
the Land: I laid Gold and bright Copper into
the Ground, and made as if I found it there, and
looked to and fro on the Earth as if I looked for
ſuch things; they looked one on another and
ſpake to each other ſome words, but I could not
perceive that they underſtood me, or what I meant;
nor that they knew Gold, or any other Metal:
they would gladly have had every thing they ſaw;
they tried to break the Boats Iron-grapenel with
ſtones, and would have carried it away; I let
them alone, and obſerved their actions and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
which was very brutiſh: they catched
at every thing they could reach, although I cauſed
them to ſit down, and I put ſtrings of Beads about
their Necks; ſtill they deſired more: My Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<hi>Peckett</hi> danced with them hand in hand,
and ſeveral of my Men did dance with them, and
made all the ſhew of Friendſhip as was poſſible;

they much eſteem: I was in great hopes I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52975:54"/>
might find Gold among them; I gave them all
the courteous reſpect I could: After two hours
Conference with them, I made ſigns I would go
and get more things and come again to them;
They went, and would have us to Land again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Cliff, which I judge was their Deſign, to
heave ſtones into the Boat to ſink her, for the
place was very convenient for ſuch a purpoſe:
They ſet themſelves down on the Graſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſet fire on the Graſs on the ſide of the
Bank: by what means they got Fire ſo ſuddenly
I could not underſtand. I went and ſounded the
Channel between <hi>Elizabeth-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>St. Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew's-Iſland,</hi>
and found it a fair Channel to Sail
through, of a mile broad neareſt and deep Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
in the middle thirty eight Fathom, and
nine and ten Fathom near the Shore-ſide, gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sand.</p>
            <p>Theſe People are of a middle ſtature, both
Men and Women, and well-limbed, and roundiſh
Faced, and well ſhaped, and low Fore-headed;
their Noſes of a mean ſize, their Eyes of the mean
and black; they are ſmooth and even toothed and
cloſe ſet and very white; ſmall Ears: their Hair
is ſmooth flag Hair, and very black and harſh on
the fore-part, even and round; and the Locks of
a mean length, both Men and Women alike; they
are full Breaſted, they are tawny Olive-coloured,
and redded all over their Bodies with red Earth
and Greaſe; their Faces dawbed in ſpots down
their Cheeks with white Clay, and ſome black
ſtreaks with ſmut, in no Method; their Arms and
Feet the like: they have ſmall Heads and ſhort
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52975:54"/>
Fingers: they are active in Body, and nimble in
going and running; their Cloathing is pieces of
Skins of Seals, and Guianacoes, and Otters skins
ſewed together, and ſewed ſoft; their Garment
is in form of a Carpet, of about five feet ſquare,
or according to the largeneſs of the Perſon; this
they wrap about their Bodies, as a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Man
doth his <hi>Plading:</hi> they have a Cap of the Skins of
Fowls, with the Feathers on; they have about
their Feet pieces of Skins tied to keep their Feet
from the Ground: they are very hardy People to
endure cold; for they ſeldom wear this looſe Skin
when they are ſtirring, but are all naked of Body
from Head to Feet, and do not ſhrink for the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for it was very cold when I ſaw them, and
the Hills all cover'd with Snow: they have no
Hair on their Bodies nor Faces, nor any thing to
cover their privy Parts, excepting ſome of the
Women, which had a Skin before them; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Men and Women are cloathed alike;
only the Men have Caps and the Women none:
The Women wear Bracelets of Shells about their
Necks, the Men none; the Men are ſomewhat
larger than the Women in Stature, and more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Fac'd; the Men have a harſh Language, and
ſpeak ratling in the Throat, and groſs; the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhiller and lower; they pronounce the word
<hi>Urſah,</hi> but what it means I could not underſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
nor one word they ſpake; if they did not like
any thing, they would cry <hi>Ur, Ur,</hi> ratling in
their Throats: their Food is what they can get,
either Fiſ: or Fleſh: they are under no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but every Man doth as he thinks fit; for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52975:55"/>
they had no reſpect to any one, nor under any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of any in this Company; neither did
they make any ſhew of Worſhipping any thing,
either Sun or Moon, but came directly to us at
our firſt going on Land, making a noiſe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man his Bow ready ſtrung, and two Arrows
a Man in their Hands: their Bows are about
an Ell long, and their Arrows are near eighteen
Inches long, and neatly made of Wood, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Flint-ſtones, neatly made broad-Arrow-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
well faſtned to the Arrow; and the other end
is feathered with two Feathers, and tied on with
the Gut of ſome Beaſt, when it is green and moiſt;
the Bow-ſtring is ſome twiſted Gut. Theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have very large mungrel Dogs, much like the
race of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dogs, and are of ſeveral colours;
I did not ſee any other domeſtick Creature they
have, neither could I at this time ſee their Boats;
for they lay at the other end of the Iſland, next the
Main; they waited on this Iſland for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of fair Weather, to go to the other Iſlands
for Penguins, there being great numbers of thoſe
Birds on the ſouthermoſt of the three Iſlands, and
many other white-breaſted Divers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 30. To Night I anchored in a ſmall
Bay in eleven fathom Water, gravelly Ground,
half a mile off the Shore; no Tide runs here as
to thwart up a Ship; the Water riſeth and falls
perpendicular ten Feet. This Bay hath two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulets
of freſh Water in it, and good Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees
of eighteen Inches through, and near forty
Feet long: the Wood is much lik a Beech; here
are wild Currant-trees, and many ſuch like Buſhes:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52975:55"/>
the Woods are very thick and green, and much
old Wood lies on the Ground, ſo as there is no
travelling into the Woods. I was a-ſhore looking
to and fro here three hours: I called this <hi>Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
Bay;</hi> this is near nine Leagues to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of <hi>Sweepſtakes Bay;</hi> Sand-point is a mean
low Point, lies out more than the other Points
of the Shore, and few Trees grow on it.</p>
            <p>It is ſix Leagues from <hi>Freſh-water</hi> Bay, to <hi>Port
Famen</hi> South and North from the one to the point
of the other: that neareſt <hi>Port Famen</hi> cannot be
ſeen, as you come from the Northward, till you
come to bring the Point <hi>S. Anne</hi> up on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
of you, for the Bay lies up in a little hook
North-weſt, and the Land on the Weſt-ſide of the
Bay is low in a Point, and ſandy, and ſome Graſs
grows on it, and much drift-Wood lies on it like
a Carpenters-yard: a little within Land from the
Water-ſide grow brave green Woods, and up in the
Valleys, large Timber-trees, two foot throughout
and ſome upwards of 40 Feet long: much like our
Beech-timber in <hi>England;</hi> the Leaves of the Trees
are like green Birch-tree leaves, curiouſly ſweet;
the Wood ſhews in many places as if there were
Plantations; for there are ſeveral clear places in
the Woods, and Graſs growing like fenc'd Fields
in <hi>England;</hi> the Woods being ſo even by the ſides
of it, and on Point Saint <hi>Anne</hi> as you come
ſailing from the Northward, you will ſee good
Buſhes and tall Trees grow on the very point of it:
This Point is rocky on the Shore-ſide, but no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
lies or it; you may be bold on it to get into
<hi>Port Famen</hi> Bay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52975:56"/>
Here is good Wooding, and Watering, and
good catching of Fiſh with the Seyne or Net: I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
above five hundred large Fiſhes a-ſhore at one
hale, much like to a Mullet, all ſcaly Fiſhes, here
are many large Smelts or twenty Inches long, and
many Anchovies, and ſome ſmall made Scates:
Here is great plenty of Fiſh, ſo much as we feed
wholly on it, and ſalt up much of the Mullets
and Anchovies. Here grow many Trees of good
large Timber, forty Inches through: the Leaves
are green and large, much like Bay-tree Leaves in
<hi>England;</hi> the rind is grey on the out-ſide and
pretty thick rined; this Rind or Bark of theſe
Trees, if you chew it in your Mouth, is hotter
than Pepper and more quicker; it is of a ſpicy
ſmell when it is dry; I cut of the Bark and made
uſe of it in my Peaſe, and other Proviſions inſtead
of Spice, and found it very wholeſom and good:
wee ſteeped it in our Water, and drank it, and it
gave the Water a pretty flavor. There grow of
theſe Trees in the Woods, in many places in the
Streight on both Shores, and on the Coaſts on
both ſides of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> before your enter them.
This may be the <hi>Winter-bark</hi> of the Shops, which
has an Aromatick pepper-like or ſpicy taſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Port Famen</hi> lies in the Lat. of 53 <hi>d.</hi> 35 <hi>m.</hi> South;
and in Longitude Weſt, from the <hi>Lizard,</hi> 68 <hi>d.</hi> 9 <hi>m.</hi>
and Meridian diſtance 1092. Leagues Weſt, as my
Account is in my Sailing: this Voyage, I give no
credit to the plain Sailing: therefore this Meridian
diſtance ſignifies very little as to Navigation.</p>
            <p>I travelled in many places, but could not ſee
any Fruit-trees, or Oak, or Aſh, or Haſel, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52975:56"/>
any Timber like ours in <hi>England:</hi> Here are but
two ſorts or Timber in all theſe Woods, and one
is the Pepper-rind Tree, which is indifferent
Wood, and the other is the Timber much like
Beech: Here are the beſt and biggeſt Trees in all
the <hi>Streights;</hi> here are Trees of two foot and an
half through, and between thirty and forty feet
long; there may be great Planks cut out of them.
I could not ſee any grains of Metal of Mineral
in any place, and I looked very carefully in Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and places where Water had guttered. Here
are ſome Herbs to be plucked up, as we boiled
for Salleting, and green Graſs with it, which reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
pretty well. The Land in the Woods is dry,
and of a gravelly and ſandy Soil, and ſome places
good brown Earth; it is bad travelling in the
Woods for old Trees and Under-woods: the
Woods trent all up on the ſides of the Hills; the
Land all about on the North-weſt and Weſt of
<hi>Port Famen,</hi> trents up to very high Hills, and
the In-land is very high Hills; for we can ſee the
tops of them all barren and ragged, peeping over
thoſe Mountains next to the Shore-ſide; much
Snow lies continually on them: the Land on the
South-ſhore is very high and peaked.</p>
            <p>I ſaw many Ducks and brant-Geeſe on the
Shore-ſides, and in the freſh Waters, together
with ſome Whales ſpouting in the main Channel.</p>
            <p>I do verily believe that in theſe Mountains,
there is ſome Metal either Gold or Copper, for
the Man that went aboard pointed up to the
Mountains, and ſpake to me when I ſhewed him
my Ring. Theſe People eat up the Proviſion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52975:57"/>
which was carried to them, and greaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
all over with the Oil, and greaſed their Skin-Coats
with it: I made ſigns to them to go
and get ſome Gold and bring it to me: ſome of
them went away to their Boats, the reſt ſat ſtill
on the Graſs, talking one to another, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Ship. Their Language is much in the
Throat, and not very fluent, but uttered with
good deliberation: I could not perceive but only
the younger were obedient to the elder, and the
Women were in obedience to the Men; for I
took the Mens Coats and put about the Women,
but the Men would not ſuffer them to keep the
Coats long, and themſelves to be naked, but
took the Coats from the Women, and put them
about themſelves: I proffer'd them to exchange
one of my Lads for one of theirs, and they laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but the <hi>Indian</hi> Lad would not go with me,
but hung back: I gave to the Men Knives and
Fiſh-hooks, and to the Lads Jews-trumps and
Pipes, and to the Women Looking-glaſſes and
Beads. I did this to gain their loves, and in
hopes to have Trading with them for the future;
they refus'd Brandy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cape Froward</hi> is the ſouthermoſt Land of the
great Continent of <hi>America,</hi> and it is very high
Land on the back-ſide of it; the Face is ſteep up,
of a Cliff of Rocks, and it is blackiſh grey, of
a good height, and deep Water very near it. I
ſounded with my Boat cloſe to it, and had forty
Fathom: A Man may lay a Ship cloſe to the face
of the Cape, for there is Water enough: there
is no Ground in the Channel at two hundred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52975:57"/>
and but little Tide, or any ripling as I
ſaw, but a fair Channel to ſail throughout; of three
Leagues broad from the North-ſhore to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore.
It is beſt for a Ship to keep nearer the
North-ſhore than the South-ſhore; for the Winds
are more generally of the Weſtern Quarter.</p>

The Streight ſhews now as if there were no
farther paſſage to the Weſtward; for the South
Land rounds up ſo much to the North-Westward,
that it ſhuts againſt the North-Land to a Man's
ſight. At this diſtance I ſaw two large openings
into the South-Land, one oppoſite to <hi>Charles-I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,</hi>
the other more to the Westward, up of
the round South Bite; there I ſaw many Whales
ſpouting, that place I called <hi>Whales-Bay;</hi> I ſaw
ſeveral Brant-geeſe and Ducks here: I left in the
<hi>Indians</hi> Houſes Beads and Knives, in hopes of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Commerce: I ſaw on the South-ſide, a Fire
made in the Graſs by the Natives.</p>
            <p>From the pitch of <hi>Cape-Froward,</hi> to the pitch
of <hi>Cape-Holland,</hi> the Streight lies in the Channel
Weſt and by North, neareſt, and is diſtant full five
Leagues; and from the pitch of <hi>Cape-Holland,</hi> to
the pitch of <hi>Cape-Gallant,</hi> the Streight lies in the
Channel, Weſt and by North, a little Northerly,
and is diſtant eight Leagues: From the pitch of
<hi>Cape-Gallant,</hi> to a low Point three Leagues to the
Weſtward, the Streight lies in the Channel North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
and by Weſt, a little Northerly: This
Reach is not more than two miles broad, from
the North-ſhore to the Iſlands, which I called
<hi>The Royal Iſles:</hi> when I was a-breſt of the Weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Iſland, which I called <hi>Rupert's-Iſland,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the middle of the Channel with the Ship,
ſhot off one of my Sakers with a ſhot, and the
ſhot lodged cloſe to the Iſlands ſide. This low
Point, a breſt of <hi>Rupert's-Iſland,</hi> on the North
ſhore, I called <hi>Point-Paſſage.</hi> This Evening at ſix
of the Clock, I was ſhot paſt <hi>Point-Paſſage,</hi> half
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52975:58"/>
a mile to the Weſtward of it; having a fine Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly
gale.</p>
            <p>Monday <hi>Noveomber</hi> 7. Cloudy guſts, foggy
Weather, the Wind at Weſt, and ſometimes at
North-weſt: I rode faſt all day cloſe aboard the
ſhore. This Afternoon I went in my Boat over
to the South-ſide, oppoſite to <hi>Elizabeth's-Bay,</hi> at
the Point called <hi>Whale-point,</hi> for the many Whales
ſpouting thereby. I travelled up the Hills two
miles, but could not ſee any Gold or Metal; the
Land very irregular and Rocky, with moſsy kind
of Graſs growing on it, and very boggy and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
for I thruſt down a Lance of ſixteen feet
long, into the Ground with one hand very eaſily:
Here grow many Juniper Trees, ſome of a foot
throughout, the Wood not very ſweet: Here I ſaw
many brant-Geeſe and Ducks, much Snow on the
inland Mountains, ſo as I could not travel any
farther: I returned down to the Boat again; I
ſaw where the Natives had been by the evening
of the Graſs, but I could not have a ſight of any.
Here are many good Muſcles on the Rocks of
five Inches long, and good Fiſh in them, and many
ſeed Pearls in every Muſcle: Here are alſo large
Limpets and Sea-eggs among the Rocks.</p>
            <p>All the Ripling is not worth the taking notice
of, for it is but an hours time on both Tides Ebb
and Floud, when the Tide runs ſtrong; neither
are the Tides any thing prejudicial to the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Streight, but rather advantagious to
help to turn from Road to Road either way: For
I have had a benefit of them in plying from place
to place. The Weather indifferent this After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52975:59"/>
I went a-ſhore after I had done Sounding
but ſaw no People nor any Metal; the Woods
very thick, and ſeveral Trees of the hot Bark, the
other Trees much like Beech-timber: ſome Ducks
and brant-Geeſe ſeen on the Shore-ſide.</p>
            <p>The Streight in this Reach between <hi>Elizabeth's
Bay</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom's River</hi> is about two Leagues,
broad and high Land on the South-ſide; which
hath ſeveral brave Coves on it like the Wet-dock at
<hi>Deptford,</hi> and ſafe to lay Ships in them from either
much Wind or any Sea. This Bay I called <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcle-Bay,</hi>
for in it there are many and great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of good Muſcles. The Shore-ſides are rocky,
ſteep too in moſt places; no Ground in the main
Channel; at an hundred Fathom; alſo in the Bays
on the South-ſide it is deep Water, and ſmall
Iſlands lie in the Bays, and cloſe along the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore
lie ſmall Iſlands. Here are many Whales,
and I ſaw many Penguins, and ſome Seals: The
Shores are woody on both ſides, but ragged Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and boggy Ground; the tops of the Hills
bare Rocks and irregular: ſeveral ſtreams of
Snow-water run down in the Cliffs of the Hills,
two Leagues to the Weſtward of <hi>Elizabeth's-Bay.</hi>
On the North-ſhore the Land is low and woody
near the Water-ſide, and up of a Valley in this
Low-land: In this Valley there runs a freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-River;
I went it with my Boat: It is
but ſhallow at low Water, hardly Water enough
for my Boat: Here I ſaw ſeveral Arbors of the
<hi>Indians</hi> making, but no People. This River is
a very convenient place to lay Shallops, or
ſuch like ſmall Veſſels in it; they may go into
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52975:59"/>
it at high Water, for the Tide riſeth here eight
or nine feet: this River I called by the name of
<hi>Batchelor's River.</hi> Before the mouth of this River,
in the <hi>Streights,</hi> there is good anchoring, in nine,
or ten, or twelve Fathom Water, ſandy Ground;
a fair birth off the Shore: the Tide runs but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and the Floud-tide comes from the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and the Tide that comes out of St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>'s
Channel, makes a ripling with the Tide that
comes along the ſtream of the <hi>Streight:</hi> I called
this Road that is before <hi>Batchelor's-River, York-Road:</hi>
This is a good place to ride in with We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly
Winds, for here cannot go any great Sea;
neither ſhall a Man be embayed; that if a Cable
give way, he may have the Streight open to carry
it away; for the Weſterly Winds are the greateſt
Winds that blow here by the Trees, for they all
ſtoop to theſe Winds, and lean to the Eaſterward,
and the Weſt-ſide of all the Trees that ſtand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
are made flat with the Winds: the tops of
the Mountains look to the Eaſtward; the Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Winds ſeldom blow ſtrong here as to what I
have obſerved. By the Shore-ſide which lies open
to the Eaſt, the Graſs grows down to the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
and they are the greener Shores, and the
Trees are ſtreight and tall on the Eaſt-ſide of the
Hills, but on the Weſt-ſhores, the Graſs and
Trees are much weather-beaten, worn away, and
crippled, and the Shore-ſides much tewed with the
ſurge of the Waters.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Cape Quad,</hi> the Lands ſhut one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as if there were no farther paſſage: but as
you make nearer to it, you will ſee the opening
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52975:60"/>
more and more, as the Streight rounds there more
to the Northward again. <hi>Cape Quad</hi> is on the
North-ſhore; and it is a ſteep up Cape, of a rocky
greyiſh Face, of a good height before one comes
at it: it ſhews like a great building of a Caſtle;
for it points off with a Race from the other
Mountains, ſo much into the Channel of the
Streight, that it makes ſhutting in againſt the
South-land, and maketh an Elbow in the Streight:
the Streight is not paſt four miles broad here,
from ſhore to ſhore; and the Land is ſteep too
on both ſides, and rocky; the Mountains high
on both Shores, and craggy barren Rocks: ſome
Trees and Buſhes growing here, and much Snow
on the Mountains on both ſides. Oppoſite to <hi>Cape
Quad</hi> on the South-ſide, there is a fine large Bay,
which is called <hi>Rider's Bay:</hi> I did not go into it;
if there be Anchoring in it, it is a fair Road for
any Winds: the Water is very deep here in the
Channel, no Ground at one hundred Fathom:
this part of the Streights, from <hi>Point Paſſage</hi> to
<hi>Cape Quad,</hi> is the moſt crooked part of all the
Streight; therefore I called this <hi>Crooked-Reach.</hi>
Here are two ſmall Iſlands in the North-ſhore, to
the Eaſtward of <hi>Cape Quad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 14. This Morning I was a-breſt of
<hi>Cape-Munday,</hi> ſo I called it, it being a Cape on
the South-ſide, and is diſtant from <hi>Cape de Quad</hi>
about thirteen Leagues: the Streight here is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four miles broad, and the North-ſhore makes
into the Land with great ſounds and broken Iſlands;
the Land on both Shores is high rocky Hills, and
barren, very little Wood or Graſs growing on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52975:60"/>
them: Here at <hi>Cape Munday,</hi> the Streight grows
broader and broader to the Weſtward, but keeps
all one Courſe, North-weſt and by Weſt to <hi>Cape
Upright;</hi> which is a ſteep upright Cliff on the
South-ſide, and it is diſtant from <hi>Cape Munday</hi>
four Leagues. Here the Streight inclines to the
Weſtward near half-a Point: the Streight lies
from <hi>Cape Munday</hi> Weſt-north-weſt, half a Point
Northerly right out into the South-Sea, if you
be in the middle of the Channel, or nigh the
North-ſhore; I find little or no Tide to run here,
or Current: no Ground in the Channel at two
hundred Fathom, a Musket ſhot off the Shore
on either ſide. Here run into the South-ſhore
many Sounds and Coves; I have ſailed fair along
by the South-ſhore all this day; for the North-ſhore
makes in broken Iſlands and Sounds: Here
lie all along the South-ſhore ſeveral ſmall Iſlands,
but no danger, for they are all ſteep too: the
Streight is a very fair Channel to ſail throughout.
This day at Noon, I was a-breaſt of an Iſland,
which lies on the North-ſide of the Streight, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it <hi>Weſtminſter-Iſland;</hi> there lie a great many
Iſlands between that and the North-ſhore, and to
the Eaſtward and Weſtward, as alſo ſome broken
Ground, and Rocks lie about it: Theſe Iſlands I
called <hi>The Lawyers,</hi> and this I ſland which I called
<hi>Weſtminſter-Iſland,</hi> is an high rocky Iſland ſhewing
like <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> the Streight is five Leagues
broad, between <hi>Weſtminſter-Iſland</hi> and the South-ſhore;
but between that and the North-ſhore,
there are many rocky Iſlands and broken Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:52975:61"/>
The Streight lies from <hi>Cape Munday</hi> to <hi>Cape
Deſſeada</hi> Weſt-north-weſt, and Eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, half
a point Northerly, and half a point Southerly
neareſt, and they are diſtant from one another
near fifteen Leagues: from <hi>Cape Quad</hi> to <hi>Cape
Deſſeada,</hi> it is about twenty eight Leagues; and
the Streight lies near North-weſt, and by Weſt
from <hi>Cape Quad</hi> into the South-Sea, and near
in one Reach, which I called <hi>Long-Reach:</hi>
and ſome of my Company called it <hi>Long-Lane.</hi>
This part may properly be called the <hi>Streights;</hi>
for it is high Land all the way on both Shores,
and barren Rocks, with Snow on them; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from <hi>Cape Quad</hi> into the South-Sea, I called

they lie in Eaſt and Weſt at the firſt, till you come

broken Iſlands and Sounds, that a Man may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
the right Channel or Streight, and ſteer up
into one of them, as he comes out from the South-Sea,
if he loſe ſight of the South-ſhore.</p>
            <p>Here lie four ſmall Iſlands at the North part of
the mouth of the Streight, in the South-Sea; they
lie pretty near together: the Eaſtermoſt ſtands
ſingly by it ſelf, and is round copling up of a fair
height like an Hay-cock, or Sugar-loaf: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three are flattiſh; they lie from <hi>Cape-pillar</hi>
North-north-weſt, by the true Compaſs 6 Legues

            <p>I went a-ſhore with my Boats for freſh Water,
which I had them laden with preſently; for here is
freſh Water enough, and very good; I ſearched
the Shore what I could, I ſaw on old Hutt or
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52975:62"/>
Arbour of the <hi>Indians</hi> making, and ſeveral ſticks
that were cut, but all old done. I could not ſee
any ſign of People on the Iſland now; I believe
the People come rambling to this Iſland from the
Main in the beſt ſeaſon of the Year to get young
Fowls: for I do not ſee any thing elſe in the Iſland
for the ſuſtenance of Mans Life; I could not ſee
any kind of Mineral or Metal: the Soil is a ſandy
black Earth, and ſome Banks of Rocks: the Iſland
is irregular, and grown all over with impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
thick Woods, ſo as I could not ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
part of it: the Woods are ordinary Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
none that I ſaw was fit to make Planks of;
the nature of the Wood is much like Beech and
Birch, and a ſort of heavy Wood good for little but
the fire, it is white: no Fruit or Herbs; very little
Graſs, the Woods are ſo thick; much kind of long
ſedgy Graſs; no wild Beaſt to be ſeen; ſeveral
ſmall Birds in the Woods like Sparrows: there
are ſeveral Fowls like Kites in the Woods, ſeveral
black and white brant-Geeſe and pied Shags, and
other ſuch Sea-Fowls, as Pinks and Sea-mews:
what elſe the Iſland affords I cannot tell. I made
a Fire on the Shore, in hopes to have ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of it on the Main, but had not. At Noon
I went aboard, and ſent my Boats a-ſhore again
for more Wood and Water, whilſt the Weather
permitted landing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 30. This Forenoon I was over on
the main ſide, the Ship lay off, and in. I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore
with my Boat on an Iſland which lieth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
to the Main:
There runs a Channel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
that and the Main, and many Rocks lie
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52975:63"/>
in it, and foul Ground, ſo as I durſt not venture
the Ship in it. This Iſland ſhewed as if it had
been the Main, till I went to it with the Boat;
being about four Leagues long from the North-point
to the South-point, and in ſome places a
League broad. The Iſland is of a mean height,
and in ſome places two Leagues broad, and grown
all over with Woods very thick: the Timber is
ſuch like as is on the Iſle of <hi>Socoro:</hi> I could
not ſee any kind of Mineral or Metal in it; the
Shore-ſide ſandy in many places, and rocky in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
the Earth on this Iſland is of a ſandy black
ſoil, but very wet with the continual Rains that
are here. Not finding this noted in my Draughts,
I called it after my own Name <hi>Narbrough's-Iſland;</hi>
I took poſſeſion of it for his Majeſty and his
Heirs: I could not ſee any People, or any ſign of
them here.</p>
            <p>South-eaſt from <hi>Narbrough's-Iſland</hi> on the Main
diſtant about three Leagues, there runs into the
Land a River or Sound, and ſome broken ground
lies before it. The Shore-ſide is rocky, and the
Hills are high in the Land on both ſides of it;
this opening lies in Eaſt and Weſt, I take it for
that place which in the Draughts is called <hi>Saint
Domingo.</hi> This place lies in the Latitude of forty
four Degrees, fifty Minutes South; and more to
the Southward thereof lie many round coplin
high Iſlands grown over with Woods: all along
the Coaſts as far as I could ſee, there lie Iſlands
adjacent to the Main, and they are of a great
height.</p>

give to the Natives. At ſeven of the Clock <hi>Signior
Carlos</hi> was ſet a-ſhore, on the South-ſide of the
Harbour of <hi>Baldavia</hi> without the Mouth of it a
Mile, in a ſmall ſandy Bay, about two miles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Point <hi>Gallere,</hi> between the Point and the Mouth
of the Harbour. When he was a-ſhore, he took
his leave of my Lieutenant, and bad him go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
and look out for his Fire in the Night. He
went from the Boat along the Sea-ſide in the path
toward the Harbour's Mouth: the Men in the
Boat ſaw him go along for the diſtance of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Mile, till he turned behind a point of
Rocks out of ſight. The Shore-ſide is low and
ſandy, and ſome ſcattered Rocks lie in it: the
Land riſeth trenting to large Hills: the land is
all woody and very thick, that there is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
but by the Water-ſide. My Lieutenant
went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore to the edg of the Woods, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
ſeveral green Apples off the Trees: for there
grow Apple-trees on the Shore-ſide, much like
our <hi>European</hi> Winter-Fruit; the Apples are bigger
than Walnuts with their ſhells on; whether theſe
Trees were planted by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or grow na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
in the Country, I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>I do not find any Current or Tide to ſet on
this Coaſt, that is any way prejudicial to Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
neither do I find the Winds to blow Trade:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52975:64"/>
but they are veerable, and are given to blow
hard on the Weſtern Quarter, and rain much.</p>
            <p>The Mouth of the Harbour of <hi>Baldevia</hi> on the

            <p>the Account I make by my ſailing from the
Meridian of the <hi>Lizard,</hi> according to my daily
Account of my Ships way: I do not make any
Account of plain Sailing to be fit for Seamen to
obſerve; but the beſt Navigation is by <hi>Mercator,</hi>
ſailing according to the Circle of the Globe,
which I ever ſailed by, and keep my Account of
Eaſting and Weſting by Longitude, which is the beſt
and moſt certain Sailing, to give the true deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Globe. I have noted down the Meridian
diſtance I made daily, whereby ſush Navigators
and Seamen as know better, may have that to
give them the knowledge of the diſtances of
Places, according to their Underſtanding. Most
of our Navigators in this Age ſail by the Plain
Chart, and keep their Accounts of the Ships way
accordingly, although they ſail near the Poles;
which is the greateſt Errour that can be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
for they cannot tell how to find the way
home again, by reaſon of their miſtake; as I
have ſome in the Ship with me now that are in
the ſame Errour, for want of Underſtanding the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52975:65"/>
true difference of the Meridians, according to
their Miles of Longitude, in the ſeveral Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.
I could with all Seamen would give over
ſailing by the falſe plain Card, and ſail by <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>'s
Chart, which is according to the truth of
Navigation; But it is an hard matter to convince
any of the old Navigators, from their Method of
ſailing by the Plain Chart; ſhew moſt of them the
Globe, yet they will walk in their wonted Road.</p>
            <p>At eight of the Clock in the Forenoon my
Boat put from me, and rowed to the Shore with.
in point <hi>Gallery,</hi> to the place where <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was
landed: I laid off and on with the Ship before
the Port; the Boat rowed all along the Shore by
the place where <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was landed, and along
the Shore into the Harbour; at the Points on the
South-ſide of the Harbour ſtands a ſmall Fort of
ſeven Guns called S. <hi>James's Fort:</hi> My Boat came
ſuddenly on it, and before they perceived it to
be a Fort, they were within ſhot of it. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
ſtood on the Shore; and waſted with a
white Flag, and called to them; My Lieutenant
rowed to them, and asked of them what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
they were? they anſwered, of <hi>Spain:</hi> They
asked my Lieutenant of what Country he was?
He anſwered, of <hi>England;</hi> they asked him to
come a-ſhore, whch he did, in hopes to have ſeen
<hi>Don Carlos</hi> there, for that path that <hi>Don Carlos</hi>
went in when he was landed, led directly to this
Fort by the Sea-ſide, and it was not a Mile from
the Fort to the place where he was landed, ſo as
he muſt go to this Fort, and be upon it before he
was aware of it, unleſs he knew it before. The
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52975:65"/>
path went all along between the Woods and the
Sea: In the Woods there is no travelling, they
are ſo thick, and grow on the ſide of an Hill;
the Fort ſtands juſt by the Wood-ſide on a race of
the Bank, of five yards aſcent from the Sea,
with a bank of Earth caſt up before the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and flight Palliſadoes plac'd in an Half-moon,
four yards diſtant from the Guns to the
Southward, which Palliſadoes are to keep the
Natives from running violently on the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
ſo theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> guard themſelves with
long Lances againſt the Natives in the Fort. The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> have Match-lock Muſquetoons, but
they are very ordinary ones, and they are as ſilly
in uſing them.</p>
            <p>At my Lieutenants landing, about twenty <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
and <hi>Indians</hi> came to the Water-ſide in Arms,
and received him and his Company a-ſhore, and
carried him ſome twenty yards from the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
up the race of the Bank, under a great Tree,
where the Captain of the Fort, and two other <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Gentlemen, received him under the ſhade with
great Courteſie, after the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Ceremony;
they ſat them on Chairs and Benches placed about
a Table, under the ſhade; for the Sun ſhone
very warm, it being a very fair Day. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Captain called for Wine, which was brought
to him in a great Silver Bowl; He drank to my
Lieutenant, and bid him welcome a-ſhore, and
cauſed five of his Ordnance to be fired, being
glad to ſee <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men in this place, and told
him that this was <hi>Baldavia,</hi> ſpeaking very kindly,
and how welcome they were to him: After every
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52975:66"/>
one had drank, and my Lieutenant had thanked
him for his Entertainment, he deſired my Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to ſit down, and he diſcourſed with them,
and asked from whence they came, and what way
they came into this Sea, and what their Captains
Name was, and if there were Wars in <hi>England?</hi>
My Lieutenant anſwered him to his demands:
My Lieutenant asked him, if they were in peace
with the <hi>Indians?</hi> He anſwered, that they were
at Wars with them round about, wafting his Hand
round the Harbour, and that they were valiant
People and very barbarous, and fought on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
and did them much spoil; and that two days
before, the <hi>Indians</hi> came out of the Woods and
killed a Captain, as he ſtood at his Duty by the
ſide of the Fort, and cut off his Head and carried
it away, ſticking on their Lance. He ſhewed my
Lieutenant the place where the <hi>Indians</hi> came out
of the Woods, and the place where the Man was
killed. They ſeem to be very fearful of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi>
for they will not ſtir any way, but they
will have their Piece or their Lance with them.
It is a manifeſt ſign they are much affraid of the
<hi>Indians:</hi> alſo they have no more ground than the
Fort; neither do they clear any of the Woods on
this ſide of the Harbour, nor walk at a Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot
diſtance from the Palliſadoes, along the
Woods-ſide. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay that the <hi>Indians</hi>
have much Gold, and that their Armour for their
Breſt is fine beaten Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Afternoon a Dinner was brought out of
the Fort to the Tent, where they were, and placed
on the Table: The firſt Courſe was Soppas, then
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52975:66"/>
Olleos, then Pullets, then freſh Fiſh, all dreſſed
with hot Sawce, and very good Diet it was; the
laſt Courſe was Sweet-meats: every Courſe was
ſerved in Silver Diſhes, and all the Plates were
Silver, and the Pots and Stew-pots, and all the
Utenſils belonging to the dreſſing of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
were Silver; the Baſon wherein they brought
Water to waſh their Hands was in like manner
made of Silver, very large, and the Hilts of the
Soldiers Swords were Silver, but the Hilts of the
Officers Swords were Gold of good value: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the Plate at the But-end of the Stock of
their Muſquetoons was of the ſame Metal, and
the Pipe that the Rod runs in was Silver; as alſo
the tip of the Gun-ſtick, and their Tobacco-Boxes,
and Snuff-Boxes, and the Staves which
they walk with were headed and ferrelled with
Silver, and ferrelled on the joints with Silver. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are Maſters of much Silver and Gold,
and it is but little eſteemed among them.
Their boaſting was <hi>Plata no vallanada muchoro in
terra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentlemen deſired to go aboard
with my Lieutenant, and ſee the Ship, and Pilot
her into the Harbour, if I would come in, which
they did not queſtion but I would, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
afterward by a <hi>Spaniard</hi> that came aboard
to me, who revealed to me their whole Deſign,
how they intended to ſurpriſe the Ship, which I
ever took care to prevent, giving them no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity:
For it hath been a general practice with
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> to betray all forein In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in theſe parts; as I had read of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52975:67"/>
dealings with Captain <hi>Hawkins</hi> at Saint
<hi>Juan de Vlloa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had much Diſcourſe with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
this day concerning <hi>Baldavia,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Chile:</hi> They tell me they have much Gold
here at <hi>Baldavia,</hi> and that the Natives do much
hinder their getting of it; for they are at cruel
Wars with them, and will not permit them to plant
anything near here about, nor at <hi>Baldavia,</hi> but they
come and deſtroy it with Fire. And that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
are very cruel and barbarous; if they take
any <hi>Spaniard</hi> they cut off his Head, and carry it
away on their Lances end. Theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> tell
me that they live here, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora</hi>
in <hi>Barbary,</hi> having their Enemies round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them. Theſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
are tall Men, and of a Gigantick ſtature and
extreamly Valiant, and that they fight on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
eight and ten thouſand Men in Arms, and
well diſciplin'd. The <hi>Indians</hi> have much Gold;
and their Weapons are long Lances, and Bows,
and Arrows, and Swords and ſome Muſquets,
which they have taken from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
know how to uſe them in Service; taking alſo
Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> are very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in the Land about <hi>Baldavia,</hi> and at <hi>Orſono,</hi>
and on the Iſland of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and at <hi>Chile,</hi> and
that they have much Gold on theſe parts about <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſono,</hi>
and <hi>Chilue,</hi> and that they trade with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
and give them Gold.</p>
            <p>This Captain ſaid, that they have ſix great
Ships going yearly from <hi>Lima</hi> to the <hi>Philippine</hi>
Iſlands, to the Port of <hi>Mannelos,</hi> and that they
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52975:67"/>
have a great Trade with the <hi>Chineſes;</hi> and that
theſe Ships ſail from the <hi>Calleo,</hi> that is the Port of
<hi>Lima</hi> in the Month of <hi>January,</hi> and their paſſage
is but little more than two Months, from <hi>Lima</hi>
to the Port of <hi>Mannelos,</hi> and they ſail it within
the Tropicks, and have much Eaſterly Winds;
and they return back by the Northwards, to gain
the Weſterly Winds, which brings them to <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornia,</hi>
and to the Port of <hi>Aquapulco,</hi> which lieth
on the Weſt-Coaſt of <hi>Nova Eſpana,</hi> and from thence
they come to <hi>Panama,</hi> and then to the Port of
<hi>Lima.</hi> They bring rich Lading, much Silks and
other rich Commodities, and Spices and Callicoes.
The <hi>Mannellos</hi> have a great Trade with the <hi>Japone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and <hi>Chineſes,</hi> which is very beneficial to them.
The Captain demanded of me whither I was
bound? I anſwered him, I was bound for <hi>China,</hi>
and that I had rich Lading for that Country; and
that I only touched in at this place, knowing here
were Settlements of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Subjects,
hoping here to have Wood and freſh Water, and
refreſhing for my Men, whereby I might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proceed on my Voyage. He ſaid, I ſhould
have what the Country would afford, and that
the Captain of the Fort had ſent for Proviſions
for me, and that I might have Water on the
Shore-ſides pointing his Hand to the place which
was near by; the Captain ſaid, it was <hi>Aqua del
oro</hi> (which is <hi>Water of Gold</hi> in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>) This
ſaying cauſed me to laugh; then he ſaid, it came
running from the Hills where they find Gold, and
that there was Gold in that Rivulet. I asked
him how they get the Gold? He ſaid, they waſh
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52975:68"/>
the Earth which is in the Mountains, and find
the Gold in the Bowl or Tray when the Earth is
waſhed out. And they buy much Gold of the
<hi>Indians,</hi> which they gather in the Gullies of the
Hills, which is waſhed in there by the Rains, and
ſnow diſſolv'd, which deſcend from the high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
which they ſay are very high and barren
Rocks, thirty Leagues In-land from the Sea-ſhore.
The Land between thoſe barren Hills and the
Sea-ſhore, is mighty good Land, and the Country
very fruitful, abounding in many Plains, and
much Cattle that the <hi>Indians</hi> have, as Horſes and
Cows, and Goats and Sheep, which they have taken
from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſince they came into this
Country. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> call the high rocky
Mountains the <hi>Andes,</hi> and ſay that thoſe <hi>Andes</hi>
run all along the Land from <hi>Magellan</hi> Streights in
a row to S. <hi>Martha,</hi> which is in <hi>Terra firma,</hi> not far
from <hi>Cartagean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt Gold in all the Land of <hi>America</hi> is
in <hi>Chile,</hi> as what is known at this time. But I
find the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have but little knowledge of
the Land all along to the Southward, from <hi>Balda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
to the Streights Mouth, as far as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by them, excepting at the Iſland of <hi>Caſtro:</hi>
There they have a Settlement, and on the Main
against <hi>Caſtro</hi> at a place called <hi>Orſono:</hi> At theſe
two places they have good ſtore of Gold, and
there are many <hi>Indians:</hi> but farther Southerly
than <hi>Caſtro,</hi> they know nothing of the Country,
or of the Sea-Coaſt. <hi>Caſtro</hi> lieth in the Latitude
of 43 <hi>d.</hi> 30 <hi>m.</hi> the South end of the Iſland,
and the North end lies in the Latitude of 41<hi>d.</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:52975:68"/>
40<hi>m.</hi> It is a fine Iſland, and near the Main, there
grows good Wheat on it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are but
few in number there, but there are many <hi>Indians,</hi>
and thoſe too valiant and of a large ſtature;
but not Giants as I underſtand: Theſe <hi>Indians</hi>
have Wars with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to ſearch the Country for Wealth.</p>
            <p>A Ship brought from <hi>Lima</hi> Proviſions for the
City of <hi>Baldavia</hi> and the Forts, and Cloaths, and
Ammunition, and Wines, and Tobacco, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
and ſhe lades away from <hi>Baldavia</hi> Gold and
Bezoar Stone, and red Wool, &amp;c. and <hi>Indian</hi>
Slaves that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> take here in theſe parts;
they carry them to <hi>Peru,</hi> and make perpetual Slaves
of them there; and the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> they bring
hither, and make Soldiers of them againſt the
<hi>Chile-Indians,</hi> of which Soldiers there are many
hereabout, whom my Men ſaw when they were
at the Fort. There were about thirty <hi>Indians</hi>
and <hi>Muſteſes</hi> Soldiers there, and ſome ſixteen
white Men who were Officers. Moreover, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> make uſe of the <hi>Peru-Indians</hi> to Trade
with the <hi>Chile-Indians</hi> for Gold, although they are
at Wars. For they of <hi>Chile</hi> without doubt are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of Trade, whereby they may furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Knives, and Sciſſers, and Combs, &amp;c.
which are wanting among them; as alſo with
Arms that many times by ſtealth are ſold to them,
although they be prohibited; Traders will be
dealing; ſo as they can get benefit, they do not
conſider the future danger by its means, provided
it miſs them at the preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52975:69"/>
I asked them how far it was to <hi>Baldavia?</hi> they
anſwered me, three Leagues, and that the Boats
could go up to it, and that it was ſituated by the
ſide of the River and the Plains, and that there
were five great Ordnances in a Fort to command
the City, and that there were one thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
in the City of all ſorts of Men, Women
and Children. I asked him, if there were any
paſſage by Land from <hi>Baldavia</hi> to the other parts
of <hi>Chile?</hi> they ſaid there was, and they ſent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Week, but they went with good Guards to go
ſecure from the <hi>Indians.</hi> Then I asked them if
they built Shipping here? they ſaid no, but at
<hi>Velperrazeo</hi> they did build great Ships. I asked
them who lived in the Iſland of <hi>Mocha?</hi> they ſaid
<hi>Indians,</hi> many Men and Women, and that they
were <hi>Poco amigo'</hi> s to them; in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they were
but ſmall Friends to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> There are
many Sheep, Goats, Hogs and Hens, which the
<hi>Indians</hi> will ſell for Hatchets, Knives and Beads.
As to the Iſland of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of it, and have a Fort on it with five Guns,
but few <hi>Spaniards</hi> live there: it is plentiful of
Proviſions, as Hogs, and Sheep, and Corn, and
Potatoes: and they ſaid there is ſome Gold, that
the <hi>Indians</hi> have on the Iſland of <hi>Mocha,</hi> but they
will not part from it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not care for
anſwering me to ſuch things as I would gladly
have heard of theſe parts; for I laid the Draught
of all that Coaſt on the Table before them, and
asked them who lived at this Port, and who lived
at that: at ſome places they would ſay, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
lived there, and at ſome the <hi>Indians.</hi> but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52975:69"/>
they did not care to anſwer my deſires, but frame
other Diſcourſes to wave mine. I find that they
are but little acquainted on the Coaſts to the
Southward of <hi>Baldavia;</hi> they ſay they have <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
living on the Iſland of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and that much
Corn grows there, more eſpecially <hi>European</hi>
Wheat; and that on the Main there are <hi>Spaniards</hi>
living at a place called <hi>Orſono,</hi> which is againſt
<hi>Caſtro,</hi> and that there they have Gold, and there
are many <hi>Indians</hi> I asked him if Shipping could
go in between <hi>Caſtro</hi> and the Main? they could
not tell me, or would not; but they ſaid ſome
Ships went thither, which come from <hi>Lima</hi> with
Furniture for the People.</p>
            <p>The Anchoring at the Iſland of <hi>Mocha</hi> is on the
North-north-eaſt part of it, in a ſandy Bay in
eight Fathom Water near the Shore; a North-eaſt
Wind is the worſt Wind for the Road: on the
South-ſide of <hi>Mocha</hi> there lies a ledg of Rocks,
and ſome broken Rocks on that part of the Iſland,
ſcattered from the Shore.</p>
            <p>The Anchoring at the Iſland of St. <hi>Mary</hi> is on
the North-ſide in a fine ſandy Bay, in eight or
nine Fathom Water, a fine Birth from the Shore;
the North-north-weſt Wind is the worſt Wind for
that Road. There is Wood and freſh Water on
both the Iſlands, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> report. The
Tides are but mean on the Coaſt, and the Flood
comes from the Southward, and riſe about eight
or nine feet Water.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Mocha</hi> lies in the Lat. of 38 <hi>d.</hi>
30 <hi>m.</hi> South.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of St. <hi>Mary</hi> lies in the Lat. of 37 <hi>d.</hi>
14 <hi>m.</hi> South,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52975:70"/>
They have Apples, and Plums, and Pears and
Olives, Apricocks, Peaches, Quinces, Oranges,
Lemmons, and many other Fruits: There are
alſo Musk-Melons, and water-Melons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe
<hi>Spaniards</hi> report it to be the fineſt Country in the
whole World, and that the people live with the
greateſt Luxury of any on the Earth; they enjoy
their Health with ſo much delight, and have ſo
much Wealth and Felicity, that they compare the
Land to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> abounding above other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
with all Delights for Mankind.</p>
            <p>I ſaw a good Teſtimony of the healthineſs of
the Country; for theſe four Men who are on
Board, are as well-complexioned Men as ever I
ſaw in my days; and the People a-ſhore, both
Men and Women of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are well-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexioned
People, of a ruddy colour, and ſeem to
be mighty healthy. Some of the Men are very
corpulent, and look as if they came from a
very plentiful Country, where there is great
ſtore of Proviſions, and abundance of Gold and
Silver.</p>

into matters of this Concern, which I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

the Harbour, and the Fortifications the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have, and the diſpoſition of the People; and
that it was my whole deſire to have Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with the Natives of the Country that are
at Wars with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if by any mens poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
it may be obtained; for it is my whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:52975:70"/>
to lay the Foundation of a Trade there for the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation for the future; for I ſee plainly this
Country is loſt for want of the true knowledg of it</p>
            <p>My Men in the Boat obſerved the Harbour
and the Fortifications, and took good notice of
the people. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> bought ſeveral things
of my Boats Crew: and paid for what things they
bought in good Pillar pieces of Eight; they would
not part from any Gold, although my Men were
deſirous to have ſome rather than Silver for their
Goods: neither would they part from any Bread in
payment, pretending that they ſhould have Bread
to morrow from <hi>Baldavia.</hi> The things which
they bought of my Men at this time, were two
Fowling-pieces, which coſt in <hi>England</hi> about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhillings a piece, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
pieces of Eight apiece for them; and Caſes
of Knives of three ſhillings the piece in <hi>England,</hi> the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> gave five pieces of Eight for them: and
for ſingle ten-penny Wires, they gave a piece
of Eight a piece for them; and for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Leather-gloves, of ten pence the pair, they
gave a piece of Eight a pair; for Broad-Cloath-Coats
of the Seamens, which coſt ſixteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in <hi>England,</hi> they gave nine pieces of
Eight for a Coat: They were very deſirous
to buy Cloaks, and pieces of Bays-cloath. The
Men were very gallant in Apparel in their Pluſh-coats,
and under-Garments of Silk and Silver
wrought together, and good Linnen, and good
<hi>Flanders</hi> Laces, and broad about the Crown of
of their Hats, in faſhion of an Hat-band, and a
great Silk-ſcarf with Gold Lace on the ends of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:52975:71"/>
it, that was croſs over their Shoulders: a ſhort
Cravat of Linnen about their Necks, and a Cane
in their Hand headed with Silver; their Choes,
and Stockings, and Breeches after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion.
They were very kind to my Lieutenant
and Men, and treated them very courteouſly.
They were not permitted to go into the Fort,
but were entertained in a Tent by the Fort.
Four of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Wives would needs go into
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boat, and ſit down on the Benches, to
ſay that they had been in a Boat which came from
<hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe were very proper white Women
born in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru</hi> of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Parents:
they never had been in <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
have ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Women to their Wives: the
Women were all well Apparelled in Silks afrer the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> faſhion, and about their Necks great Gold
Chains, and Pendants at their Ears of Saphir
Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Captain of St. <hi>Jago's Fort</hi> preſented my
Lieutenant with a Silver Tobacco-box, and a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-headed
Cane, and a Plume of Oſtriches Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which he wore on his Hat at the ſame time:
the Feather of the Plume is but ſmall, nothing ſo
good as the <hi>Barbary</hi>-Feather: this Plume was of
red, and white, and blew Feathers died in the
Country. I ſaw another Plume which a <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Gentleman gave to Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> which was black
and large, and a very fair one, made of the Oſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Feather of the Country. There are many
Oſtriches in the plain Lands, and <hi>Guianacots,</hi>
which are the Beaſts that bear the red woou
whereof Hats are made in <hi>England.</hi> There is much
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52975:71"/>
of this Wooll in the Kingdom of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Chile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My People could not by any means come to
Converſe with the Natives who are at Wars with
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and have the Gold, without viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Power: for on the Shore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Harbour, the <hi>Indians</hi> made a Fire by the
Woods ſide, and hung out a white Flag on a long
Pole, and kept wafting of it a long time. My
Lieutenant would have gone in his Boat to them,
but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not permit him, and ſaid
that they were their own People who lived there.</p>
            <p>My Seamen which came aboard in my Boat,
came to me, and told me, that the Lieutenant had
been at Fort St. <hi>Jago,</hi> and had deliver'd my Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
there to the Captain, but he had no Order
for my fetching of Water, and that he wiſhed my
Lieutenant to go to Fort St. <hi>Peter;</hi> which he did,
and a Frier and two <hi>Spaniards</hi> went over with him
in the Boat, the Flag of Truce flying in the Boat,
and the Trumpeter ſounding, according to my
Order, all the time till they landed at the Fort.
At their Landing, the Lieutenant was received
very courteouſly by ſeveral <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gentlemen,
and deſired to walk up to the Governour; which
my Lieeutenant did to a Tent where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
was; the Governour received the
Lieutenant very kindly, and deſired him to ſit
down. My Lieutenant preſented my reſpects to
the Governour, and delivered to him the Cheeſe
and Butter, togerher with the Spice, Glaſſes and
Tobacco-pipes, which I ſent to him, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, that I ſent him to deſire to know if he
would be pleaſed to permit my Boat to Water
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52975:72"/>
to day, for my Boats lay ready, and had the Cask
in them, and I waited his Anſwer. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
cauſed my Lieutenant and Mr. <hi>Forteſcue</hi> to
ſit down, and drank to them in a Silver Bowl
with <hi>Chile</hi> Wine? He gave no Anſwer to the
Lieutenant at preſent, but ſent an Officer and
Soldiers and ſeized on my Boat; My Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
deſired to know what the meaning was that
poſſeſſion was taken of the Boat? The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
anſwered, he had Order from <hi>Don Pedro
de Montaies,</hi> Captain General of <hi>Chile,</hi> to keep
them till the Ship was brought into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
under the command of the Caſtle, and he
was ſorry he had no more Officers of the Ships
in poſſeſtſion.</p>

            <p>I examined my Seamen which came in my
Boat from the Lieutenant, and they related to me
the whole matter, and they believed that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
had a deſign to betray the Ship, but they
could not agree among themſelves: I talked with
the two <hi>Indians</hi> that came aboard, they could
ſpeak the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue indifferently well; they
told me that I was a Friend to the <hi>Indians</hi> of the
Mountains, and that I was not a <hi>Spaniard:</hi> they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52975:73"/>
would needs know of me where my Country is,
and if I would come again; I made them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that my Country is a little way off, on the
other ſide of the Sea, and that I would come again,
and bring Knives, Hatchets, Beads, Glaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and live in the Country with them, and that they
ſhould ſee my Country; and that my King would
give them many things, and they ſhould live with
us; and that my King is the greateſt King in the
World, and Commands all other Kings, and that
our Names are <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> laughed and
ſeemed to be very glad: I bad them acquaint the
<hi>Indians</hi> of the Mountains, or In-lands, that I came
to ſpeak with them, and that I was their Friend,
and would give them many Hatchets, and Knives,
and Swords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if they would come to me, and
that I came purpoſely to ſpeak with them; and
that my <hi>Maſter</hi> the <hi>Great King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> hath
ſent them many things, and would willingly
ſee them.</p>
            <p>After theſe People had heard all that I ſaid to
them, they ſat for a time mute, and conſidering
of the Kindneſſes they received from me and my
Company, and that they muſt go a-ſhore again
under the Command of the cruel <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they
weeped extreamly, and uttered theſe words,
<hi>Numbra Spanalos muccho Deablo,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Engliſh</hi> it
is, <hi>The</hi> Spaniſh <hi>men are much Devils,</hi> &amp;c. I verily
believe that theſe poor innocent Creatures ſpeak
truth, for they are great Devils in abuſing theſe
poor Souls ſo unmercifully as they do. In ſight
of my Men the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with a great Staff would
ſtrike an <hi>Indian</hi> on the Head as he talked with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52975:73"/>
him, and beat him all along, for no cauſe at all;
but this they do to ſhew their Greatneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſneſs.
The beſt Name the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can
afford to call an <hi>Indian</hi> by, is Dog, and Devil, and
ſuch like Names.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> ſay, that there is much Gold in
the Land, and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have much <hi>Oro;</hi>
I gave to each of theſe <hi>Indians</hi> a Knife, and a ſmall
Looking-glaſs, and ſome Beads: they were very
thankful, and I put them in mind again to ſpeak
to the <hi>Indians</hi> of the In-land, that I would give
them Knives and Glaſſes if they would come to
me. I was in great hopes all this time, that I
ſhould have the opportunity to ſpeak with my
Golden Friends, by the means of theſe People;
for they ſeemed to be glad of the Meſſage, or of
the things which I gave them to do it.</p>
            <p>Theſe People are of a middle ſtature, ſtrongly
ſet and well-fleſhed; they are tawny coloured,
and have long black flaggy Hair; their Features
tolerable, of a ſomewhat melancholy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
they are very active in Body, and
hardy in enduring of Weather or Diet: They
wear ſmall Caps on their Heads like to Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,
and their Garment is a long Mantle; but
moſt of their Garments are a ſquare piece of Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Cloth like a Carpet, of their own weaving
of the Wool of Guianacoes: they cut an hole
in the middle of this Carpet through which they
put their Head, and it hangs upon their Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and covers their whole Bodies like a Cloak,
when it is buttoned down before. Some have
theſe Cloaks ſo long as it reacheth down to their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52975:74"/>
middle Leg, and ſome to the Knee; ſome wear
half-Stockings on their Legs, but no Shoes nor
Shirts: ſome have Breeches after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
but cloſe to their Thighs and Knees.</p>

               <hi>December</hi> 18. 1670. This Evening I took the
Suns Amplitude with my Compaſs, and I had a
good Obſervation. I find the variation of the
Compaſs to be eight Degrees ten Minutes Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterly.</p>
            <p>I do much reaſon with my ſelf as to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation,
that it differs ſo much in the ſame Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
between the Eaſt and Weſt-ſide of the Land
of <hi>America;</hi> for on the Eaſt-ſide as I ſailed in the
Latitude of forty Degrees, I found the Compaſs
to have twenty Degrees variation Eaſterly, by
ſeveral good Obſervations, which I took with the
ſame Inſtrument as I now do uſe, which is a large
<hi>Azimuth</hi> Compaſs; and here I find but eight De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and ten Minutes variation; and it is but
eight Degrees of Longitude more Weſterly in the
ſame Parallel, differing between theſe Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the difference of Variation.</p>
            <p>I find the Land to be but one hundred and
twenty five Leagues broad, from the Eaſt-ſide to
the Weſt-ſide, in the Latitude of forty Degrees
South of the Equinoctial; certainly the attractive
quality of the Magnet, muſt be very powerful in
the Eaſtern part of the Land, more than in the
Weſtern, which cauſeth the difference: yet I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
being on both ſides of the Land, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
ſhould always have the ſame variation
Eaſterly. I was of the Opinion that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
would have been Weſterly on the Weſt-ſide,
it being Eaſterly on the Eaſt-ſide: but I
find the contrary by experience; therefore I
believe that the attractive quality is not much in
this part of <hi>America,</hi> but in ſome other part more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52975:75"/>
to the Eaſtward than I was; for if the attractive
quality had been in this Land, and I ſailing on both
ſides of it, the variation muſt have been Eaſterly
on the one ſide, and Weſterly on the other.
This Diſcourſe I leave to a better Underſtanding;
for I am not as yet ſatisfied what occaſioneth the
variation and the great difference of it, although I
have been on ſeveral Voyages, and have made
great benefit of the Underſtanding of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
of the Compaſs, in directing of the true
Courſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Port of <hi>Baldavia</hi> there are three fair
Rivers, which come out of the Country, and
empty themſelves into the Port with a brisk ſtream
of freſh Water, which cauſeth the ſtream always
to ſet out of the Harbour, and the Waters to be
freſh juſt within the Harbours-mouth: one Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
runs up into the South-eaſt part of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
into the Country; another River runs into
the Country to the Eaſtward, on the back-ſide of
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fort: the third River runs into the
Country, about the North-point of the Harbours-mouth,
between the point and the North-end of
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Iſland: it runs up in the North-Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and nine or ten Mills ſtand upon the River
from the Harbours-mouth. The City of <hi>Balda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
is ſituated on the Bank of the River, as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
tell me.</p>
            <p>I judge this City of <hi>Baldavia</hi> is but a ſmall
place, and kept only as a Garriſon, and a place
for Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> for Gold, Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,
Guianacoes-Wooll, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
that were aboard, and the <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid, that there
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52975:75"/>
were but five great Guns in it, and three hundred
Men. I know that they ſpeak of the moſt of
every thing in the matters as concerning their
ſtrength and number of Men.</p>
            <p>I believe that theſe Rivers may run into the
Country a long way, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to have
but little knowledge in the inward parts of this
Country: for the <hi>Indians</hi> will not ſuffer the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſearch into the In-lands. I believe
alſo that theſe Rivers are not Navigable for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
for the Bark which was there would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have gone up the River to the city of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia,</hi>
and delivered her Goods there, and not
troubled themſelves to carry the goods up in Boats,
and ſmall flat-bottomed Barges, which they have
there for the purpoſe: The Barges are built much
like our Weſt-Country Barges, and ſmaller by
much. Theſe Boats or Barges will carry about
ten or twelve Tuns: they ſteer with a Rudder,
and have one Maſt and Sail, as our Barges have;
the Sail is made of Cotton-cloth, and the Ropes
are made of the rind of <hi>Mangrove Trees;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Anchors, they have wooden Crab-claws
or Kellocks. Anchors of Iron and Grapnels are
ſcarce in theſe Countries: Ropes and Cables of
Hemp are alſo ſcarce there, and good Fir-maſts
much wanted in all theſe Countries for their
Ships. The Maſts for their Ships are made of
white Cedar, and ſuch like Wood; they are very
heavy and ſhort-grained, and will break ſhort. There
are not any Fir-trees growing in all the Land:
Good Workmen for the building of Ships are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
much wanted here, and Seamen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:52975:76"/>
The ſmaller Boats which they have here are
Canoas, being cut out of the Body of a large
Tree, and ſhaped ſomewhat like a Shallop at the
ends: ſome are thirty feet long, and built one
ſtrake of Board upon them, to raiſe them higher
on their ſides; they will carry near twenty Men
a piece: ſome are rowed with Oars, and ſome
are leſs, and rowed with Paddles: thoſe which
are walt, have a great Beam laſhed faſt along each
ſide without Board, which keeps them from over-ſetting.
Theſe Boats are very ill built, for I ſaw
not any one of them fit to row in any Sea-gate,
or for any Service, or to carry any Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in. The <hi>Indians</hi> are the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Slaves to
row them to and fro, and to do all manner of
labour; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will not lay their Hands
to any thing in that nature, accounting it beneath
them to foul their Fingers with Work; for they
ſcorn to be Servants one to another, let the one be
never ſo Potent, and the other not worth the Rags
which he weareth: yet he ſcorns to be a Servant
to him, and live in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Land about the Harbour of <hi>Baldavia</hi> is of
a good height, and in Land it riſeth in large
Hills: it is low by the Water-ſide, and the Shore
is ſandy in ſome Bays, and broken ſhatty bits of
glittering Rocks lilke Gold, lie ſhatter'd along by
the Shore-ſide. All the whole Country is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
with green Woods, as what I could ſee of it,
and by the Rivers ſides: there is no travelling in
the Woods, they are ſo thick with Under-bruſh,
old rotten Trees, and Leaves, and ſuch Traſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:52975:76"/>
The Harbour is near a Mile and an half broad,
and the Guns cannot command from one ſide to
the other: St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fort is near two Miles from
the Harbours mouth; any Ship may come in and
beat them from their Guns, in St. <hi>Jago</hi> Fort, and
in St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Sconce, which are on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
ſide of the Harbour. After you are in, Saint
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Fort can do very little or no hurt at all to
your Ship, excepting it be accidental dropping
ſhot. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have no Plantation on this
South-weſt ſide, they only keep the Forts for
poſſeſſion, that no forein Ship may come and
have the Port free to ride in, and Trade with
the Natives. The Harbour is like a Sound,
after one is within the Mouth of it toward the
South part.</p>
            <p>Here grow many good Canes on the Shore-ſide,
ſuch as are brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
which are called <hi>Bamboas;</hi> theſe are very ſtiff
Sticks, firm and heavy; they grow among the
Trees on the ſides of the Woods like Vines, and
wind about the Trees: ſome are above twenty
feet long, and taper from the root to the top, like
an Angling-Rod.</p>
            <p>All Commodities which come from <hi>Europe</hi> are
very dear here, and ſcarce, for they have none
brought to them, but by the way of <hi>Panama,</hi> and
by the River of <hi>Plata,</hi> which paſs through ſeveral
Merchants hands before they come into theſe
parts, and the tranſporting of them from place to
place, is very chargeable. Many alſo are but of
little eſteem, here being ſuch plenty of them:
<hi>French</hi> Hollands, Silks, <hi>Flanders-</hi> Laces, Silk-ſtockings,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52975:77"/>
Ribbaning, <hi>French</hi> Linnen, Looking-glaſſes,
and ſuch like Commodities were much
enquired for here, and would have ſold at great
Rates.</p>
            <p>Gun-powder for Fowling-pieces, is worth a
piece of Eight <hi>per</hi> pound: and Bird-ſhot is worth
two Ryals of Plate a pound, and a Ryal and an
half a pound. All Commodities of <hi>European</hi>
Workmanſhip are of great worth here, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;
and believe that more Northerly on the
Coaſt of <hi>Chile</hi> about <hi>Vale Parazo,</hi> and <hi>Coquinto,</hi>
and <hi>Areca,</hi> where there are more Inhabitants,
Commodities would bear a much greater price
than what I mention, and there would vent grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quantities: for Silver is more plentiful by
much in theſe parts than at <hi>Baldavia,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nearer the Mines of the <hi>Potoſea;</hi> for the
Silver of <hi>Potoſea</hi> comes down to the Port of
<hi>Areca,</hi> and from thence it is carried to <hi>Lima</hi> by
Sea.</p>
            <p>I am of Opinion that the moſt advantageous
Trade in the World, might be made in theſe parts,
if it were but follow'd, and that leave were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to Trade
freely in all their Ports and Coaſts: for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which inhabit there are very deſirous of a
Trade: but the Governours durſt not permit it
without Orders, unleſs ſuch Ships of force were
to go thither and Trade <hi>per</hi> force, and not take
notice of the Governours; which might be eaſily
performed by four Ships of twenty and thirty
pieces of Ordnance a Ship; and I believe that
the Natives in the Southern parts of <hi>Chile,</hi> about
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52975:77"/>
               <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and <hi>Orſono,</hi> and at <hi>Baldavia,</hi> would be
brought to a rich Trade of Gold, when once they
grew to be acquainted with thoſe that ſhould be
employed on the deſign, and they did but uſe
them civilly at the firſt, and gain their loves;
which may be eaſily done by giving them Knives,
Sciſſars, Glaſſes, Beads, Combs, Hatchets, and
the like Commodities, and treat them kindly.
For what I underſtand by the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were
aboard of me, they are Maſters of the Golden
part of the Country.</p>
            <p>My intent being, if Weather permit me, to
ſail all along the Coaſt from <hi>Baldavia</hi> to the
Southward, till I come to the Streights-Mouth at
<hi>Cape Deſiade.</hi> I came in great hopes to meet with
the <hi>Indians</hi> in ſome part of the Coaſts, and to
Trade with them for Gold, and to find good Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
I reſolve alſo to ſee in at the Iſlands of
<hi>Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Orſono,</hi> and try what I can find among
thoſe <hi>Spaniards</hi> who are ſettled there, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they live accordingly as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

            <p>Thurſday <hi>December</hi> 22. This Morning it
prov'd very fair Weather; at Day-light the Wind
was at South-weſt, a freſh gale; the Sea indifferent
ſmooth: I plied to the Windward along the
Coaſts, and was about three Leagues off the

had a good Obſervation of the Sun with my
Quadrant; and I found my ſelf in the Latitude

Leagues off the Shore, and could not get ground

            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> 31. This afternoon it blew hard at

Night. Here are ſeveral ſorts of Porpus. Fiſhes
in theſe Seas, unlike ours in <hi>Europe:</hi> ſome pied
white and black, and ſome grey and large ones.

a ſtout gale, and a great Sea: I was much afraid

            <p>Friday <hi>January</hi> 6. Haſey, foggy Weather this
Morning, the Wind at <hi>W. S. W.</hi> a ſtout gale: I
ſteered in for to make the four Iſlands, which I
called the <hi>Iſles of Direction,</hi> or to make <hi>Cape De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiade:</hi>
My Courſe was <hi>E. N. E.</hi> by my Compaſs,
the Nights being but ſhort, and light; for the
Moon was at the full, ſo that I could ſee at ſome
time clear a League before us.</p>
            <p>At four of the Clock this Morning, it being
fair day-light, I cauſed the Lead to be caſt forth,
but could not get ground at eighty Fathom: I
reckon my ſelf about ten Leagues from <hi>Cape De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiade,</hi>
and on the Latitude of 52<hi>d.</hi> 53<hi>m.</hi> South.
A little paſt four of the Clock, it cleared up on
the Eaſt Horizon: we looked well abroad, and
ſaw the four Iſles, called <hi>The Directions,</hi> which lie
at the Mouth of the Streights <hi>N. N. W.</hi> from <hi>Cape
Deſiade,</hi> diſtance from thence abought eight
Leagues. Theſe Iſlands made in four <hi>Hommac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coes</hi>
like Hay-cocks, when I ſaw them: they bear
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52975:79"/>
               <hi>N. E.</hi> of me, diſtant about four Leagues: they lie
in the Latitude of 52<hi>d.</hi> 42<hi>m.</hi> and at five of the
Clock the Iſlands bore North of me, diſtant three
Leagues off; I ſounded, but could not get ground
at 70 Fathoms; I ſaw <hi>Cape Deſiade;</hi> it cleared up,
for the Fog was much on the Hills; the <hi>Cape</hi> was
<hi>E. S. E.</hi> of me, diſtant near eight Leagues: the
tops of the ragged Hills, or rocky Spires were
clouded with the flying Fog, ſo as I could not ſee
the Cape ſooner; for in clear Weather, the Land
at <hi>Cape-pillar</hi> and <hi>Cape Deſiade</hi> may be ſeen fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or ſixteen Leagues, it is ſo high and
ragged.</p>
            <p>I ſteered by <hi>Cape-pillar</hi> Eaſt and by South, the
Wind at Weſt-ſouth-weſt, a freſh gale; a great
humming Sea ran here, which came out of the
South-weſt; I ſaw the Sea break upon broken
ground, which lieth at leaſt four Leagues from the
point of <hi>Cape Deſiade</hi> Weſt into the Sea, and many
Rocks that were ſunk, and prints of Rocks above
Water, which the Sea breaketh terribly: theſe lie
off <hi>Cape Deſiade</hi> about two Leagues, and a
League, and ſome not half a Mile off, very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
            <p>As I came nearer the Streights-mouth, I raiſed
the Land on the North-ſide by <hi>Cape Victory,</hi> and
the broken Iſlands within the Streights, which I
called <hi>Weſtminſter Iſle;</hi> and the <hi>Lodgers Iſle:</hi> they
make ragged in Hillocks at the firſt ſight. At
nine of the Clock <hi>Cape-pillar</hi> bore South of
me, being diſtant about a Mile and an half
from me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:52975:80"/>
No Tide or Current as I could perceive, ſet
either in or out of the Streights, ſo as to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
Navigation.</p>
            <p>The difference of Longitude, Eaſt is 1<hi>d.</hi> 39<hi>m.</hi>
4 tenths: the Latitude by my Account now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but

            <p>I find but very little Tide or Current in this

Longitude out of my Account, in ſailing between
<hi>Cape-gallery</hi> and <hi>Cape-pillar,</hi> forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>At any time if you have a deſire to enter the
Streights of <hi>Magellan</hi> at the Weſt-mouth, it will
be ſafeſt in my Opinion, to bear in for the Land,
in the Latitude of 52 Degrees, and 50 Minutes.
South, and then you will ſee the four Iſles of
<hi>Direction,</hi> which lie before the Mouth of the
Streights, ſomewhat toward the North-ſide; they
lie North-north-weſt from <hi>Cape-pillar,</hi> near eight
Leagues diſtant. Theſe Iſlands may be known,
for there are but four of them, and they be but of
an indifferent height, and but ſmall, and bare ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
Rocks, and they be near together: the
Eaſtermoſt Iſle is near a Mile diſtant from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52975:80"/>
three, and it is peeked up like a Sugar-loaf:
the Sea breaks much on theſe Iſles with Weſterly
Winds, <hi>&amp;c. Cape-pillar</hi> is the ſteep Point of Rocks
on the South-ſide of the Streights-mouth, at the
entring into the Streights: <hi>Cape Deſiade</hi> is the
Weſterly Point, for it falleth off from <hi>Cape-pillar</hi>
near South-weſt, and they are diſtant about two
Leagues one from another, which is the Face of
the Lands between theſe two Capes: for at the
Point of <hi>Cape Deſiade,</hi> the Land on the South-ſide
of the Cape trents off to the South-ſouth-eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
all high ragged rocky Mountains: what
I ſaw of it, at the pitch of <hi>Cape Deſiade,</hi> there lie
many ſhatter'd Rocks which are above Water, and
ſhew like the Ruins of old Houſes: and there are
ledges of Rocks that are ſunk, which lie near four
Leagues off of the Cape, Weſt; the Sea breaks
much on them, and they are dangerous: they lie
in the Latitude of 53<hi>d.</hi> 10<hi>m.</hi> South, by my rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning;
I called theſe Rocks <hi>The Judges;</hi> they
are near ten Leagues diſtant South and by Weſt
from the <hi>Iſles of Direction,</hi> ſo broad is the firſt
opening of the Streights; for when you can but
once ſee the Land, to make it, there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but a Stranger that ſhould paſs out of the
South-ſea, and had not paſſed the Streights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
will find it very difficult to paſs the Streights
from the Weſt to the Eaſt; for at the firſt entring
into it out of the South-ſea, as we call it, there
are many Openings and Sounds on the North-ſide,
which ſeem fairer for a paſſage than the
Streight it ſelf doth: therefore it is beſt to keep
the South-ſide, far aboard all along from <hi>Cape-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52975:81"/>
which is the point at the Entrance: the
Courſe will be Eaſt and by South for a Mile or
two, and then Eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, and South-eaſt
and by Eaſt: ſo the Channel lieth to <hi>Cape Quade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The North-ſide of the Streights from <hi>Cape Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,</hi>
all along to the Eaſtward to <hi>Cape Froward,</hi>
is all a ragged, rocky, mountainous, deſolate
Country; many high rocky Iſlands, and ſmall
Rocks, and ſucking Rocks lie on the North-ſide
of the Streights, at coming out of <hi>Mare del Zur,</hi>
fifteen Leagues in diſtance into the Streights to
the Eaſtward. There alſo run great Sounds and
Waters into the North-Land, which ſhew like a
paſſage more than the Streights doth. There is
no ſafety for a Ship to keep the North-ſhore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
in this part; for here lie ſo many Iſlands
and Rocks, ſo that if the Weather prove foggy
and thick, a Man may miſtake the right Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
and ſteer in among the broken Iſlands and
Rocks, ſo far as to endanger his Ship, if the
Wind be Weſterly, and it is for the moſt part of
the Winter there, very thick and foggy.</p>
            <p>Here are many Sounds and Coves on the
North-ſide, between <hi>Cape-Victory</hi> and <hi>Cape Quad:</hi>
but how far they run into the Land, I know not.
I wanted a Sloop, or ſome other ſmall Veſſel, to
diſcover thoſe Sounds: and many other places in
the Streights, which I would gladly have ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 6. In <hi>Tueſday-bay</hi> and <hi>Iſland-bay,</hi> there
grow thick ſhrubby Buſhes on the lower Land,
which have many Berries like Hurts growing on
them: theſe Buſhes grow in a moſſy looſe Earth,
which lieth four or five Feet thick on the Rock;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52975:81"/>
theſe Buſhes will ſerve for Fuel: there grows alſo
long ſedgy Graſs very thick; many Geeſe and
Ducks do make their Neſts and breed in it, and
other Sea-Fowl: here are Ducks, white and pied
brant-Geeſe, grey Gulls, Sea-Mews, Sea-Divers
and Penguins on the Water; I could not ſee any
People now, but ſome have been there; for I ſaw
where they had made Fires, and an Arbour.
Here are Muſcles and Limpets on the Rocks, but
as for other Fiſhes I ſaw none. I rowed two Miles
up the Sound, and could have gone farther, but
it rained ſo much, and blew ſo hard, as I durſt
not be abſent from the Ship; the Water is mighty
deep in the Sound. At night I got aboard, my
Seamen were joyful to ſee me, for they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
that the Ship would have broke looſe in the
time of my abſence. Much Rain to Night, and
Fogs, the Wind at Weſt-ſouth-weſt, a ſhort gale
at Night; I rode faſt on the ſmooth Water, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Point on the North-weſt of me: Here is
a great deal of freſh Water comes running in
ſtreams down the ſides of the bare rocky Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
into the ſalt Water; many Whales ſpouting
to and fro in theſe Bays and Sounds, and ſome Seals
on the Rocks: this part is very deſolate, and a
mere Chaos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At eight of the Clock this Evening, I anchored
before the place called <hi>Batchelors River,</hi> in nine
Fathom Water, clear ſandy Ground, two Cables
length from the ſhore. Here is very good clear
ſandy-ground before the River, and good Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in ſix, or ſeven, or eight, or nine, or ten, or
eleven Fathom: a fine barth of ſhore, and good Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52975:82"/>
with Weſterly Winds, and Northerly: the
worſt Wind is a South-Wind, for it blows right
on in this Reach; but there cannot go much Sea
here; for the Streight in this Reach is but two
Leagues broad. This <hi>Batchelors</hi> River is near five
Leagues to the Eaſtward of <hi>Cape Quade,</hi> and two
Leagues to the Eaſtward of St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> Channel:
on the North-ſide of it, the Tide runs of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
ſtrength in this place, both Ebb and
Flood; it ſets in and out of St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> Channel,
riſing and falling about eight or nine Feet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular:
here is not above ten Foot Water at
a High-water, at the going in of <hi>Batchelor</hi>'s River.
This River is a good Harbour for Barks and
Sloops, or the like. This River lieth in a Valley,
and a fine Grove of green Trees grows on the Weſt
Point: At the entrance here is very good freſh
Water, and a good place to Wood at. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
People or Natives frequent this place often;
for here are many Arbours, which are their Houſes:
Calm Weather to Night, and Foggy; I rode faſt,
the Ship being moored.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>January</hi> 8. Calm Weather, and a fine
warm Sun-ſhine; This Morning at Day-light, I
went in my Boat with twenty Men into <hi>Batchelor</hi>'s
River, and rowed four Miles up the Creek, or
River, which was as far as the Boat could go; the
Water being high: the River ends in a ſmall
Creek, coming out of a Lake of freſh Water, in a
Valley amongſt the Hills: we made the Boat
faſt, and marched all into the Land five or ſix
Miles, being ſtop'd from going further, by Hills
riſing very ſteep, and Mountains, and impenetrable
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52975:82"/>
Woods: we made ſeveral Fires, but could not ſee
any ſign of them ſo far in the Land. No Beaſt
or other Creature to be ſeen; many ſmall ſtreams
of freſh Water come running from the ſnowy
Mountains, with great Falls from the ſteep Rocks:
we looked in many places of the Earth, and in
the ſtreams of Water for Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but found
none, nor any other Metal of Mineral: Here
grow on the Buſhes many ſmall red Berries, much
like Hurts, very good to eat; the Graſs-Land is
very looſe and Boggy: the Rocks are a kind of
white Marble; the Trees like thoſe at <hi>Port Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi>
here are ſmall Pepper-trees. To Night I got
on Board; Calm Weather: I rode faſt with the
Ship.</p>

            <p>Wedneſday <hi>January</hi> 11. Fair Weather, Wind va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable,
from South-eaſt to South-weſt. This Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we made the beſt of our way to get into <hi>Port
Famen</hi> Here we had Fiſhes from the Shore to Fiſh
our Main-maſt: At twelve a Clock we Anchored
in nine Fathom Waaer. This place afforded what
we wanted, as very good large Trees for Fiſhes:
good Water, good wild Fowl, good fiſh, like
Mullets, and large Smelts. here we fitted our
Ships Maſts, and Rigging as well as we could;
Careen'd her, and filled our Casks with good
freſh Water, and took as much Wood aboard, as
we thought fit.</p>

               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:52975:83"/>
               <hi>January</hi> 16. Fair Weather, and little Wind,
Weſterly. This Morning the Lieutenant was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to go up with the Boat in <hi>Segars</hi> River, as
high as he could with convenience, and to ſee for
<hi>Indians:</hi> He went up about nine Miles, but could
nor get higher with the Boat, by reaſon of the
Trunk-timber, and ſhoalineſs in the Water. So I
landed, and went up two Miles by Land to ſee for
<hi>Indians:</hi> but I could not ſee any, not any thing
worth the Obſervation. How far the River runs
up, I know not, for I ſaw not the end of it: ſo I
returned a-board again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>January</hi> 29. Fair Weather, and little Wind
at South-weſt. This Morning the Captain went
over with the Pinnace to the South-ſhore to ſee
for <hi>Indians,</hi> and if there were and Harbour for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
ſhort of <hi>Port Famen.</hi> This day came an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
to the Point of <hi>Port Famen,</hi> and made a Fire;
and I went a-ſhore to ſee what he had: but he
had neither Bow, nor Arrow, nor any thing elſe
to the value of the Farthing: I would have had
him come a-board with me, but he would not; as
far as I underſtood by the Signs he made to me,
he had been a slave to ſome other <hi>Indians,</hi> and
had run away from them, and was travelling
home.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>January</hi> 31. Fair Weather, Wind va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable.
This Evening the Captain came a-board
again, having been over on the South-ſhore, to
ſee for an Harbour, but could find none, nor ſee
any <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>February</hi> 4. Fair Weather, Wind at
Weſt by North. This Morning, at four a Clock
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52975:83"/>
we ſet Sail for <hi>Port Famen,</hi> and at eleven a Clock
we were ſhort of <hi>Freſh-water Bay;</hi> and at ſix a
Clock in the Evening, we Anchored in twelve
Fathom Water, in a fine ſandy Bay, about four
Leagues to the Northward of <hi>Freſhwater</hi> Bay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 5. Fair Weather, but very much Wind,
at South-weſt, and Weſt-ſouth-weſt. This Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Captain ſent me to <hi>Freſhwater</hi> Bay to ſee
for <hi>Indians,</hi> but I ſaw none there, ſo I returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
aboard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 7. Fair Weather, Wind Northerly.
This Morning the Captain ordered me to take
the Pinnace, and to go along the North-ſhore, and
between <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Iſland and the Shore, to ſee
for <hi>Indians.</hi> In the Afternoon, it blew hard Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly,
that we could not row a head; ſo I put
back into a ſandy Bay, and went a-ſhore, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there all Night; and in this Bay we haled
the ſame, and got a great many good and large
Smelts; Smelts of twenty Inches long, and eight
Inches about.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday <hi>February</hi> 8. Fair Weather, Wind
Weſt-ſouth-weſt. This Morning at four a Clock,
I run down the Streights with the Pinnace, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Norht-ſhore a-board, and run berwixt it
and <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Iſland, but ſaw no <hi>Indians:</hi> yet
ſaw ſeveral places, where they had been very
lately, and where they had built their Canowes.
From <hi>Cape Deſiade</hi> to <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Iſland, there is
Wood and freſh Water plenty; but from <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>
Iſland, to <hi>Cape Virgin-Mary,</hi> Wood and freſh
Water is very ſcarce to come by. This Afternoon
at three a Clock, I got a-board again, and at four
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52975:84"/>
a Clock, we came to an Anchor in eight Fathom
Water, black Sand; we rid within a Mile of the
North-ſhore: St. <hi>Georges,</hi> and St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s
Iſland were both ſhut in one, and they bore South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouth-eaſt
of me; and <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Iſland bore South
and by Eaſt; And here we rid with the Ship all
Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 9. Fair Weather, Wind Weſterly.
This Morning the Captain ſent me to ſee for <hi>Indians,</hi>
but I could ſee none; yet I fell with a good
Harbour for ſmall Veſſels, on the North-ſide, and
at the South-end of a great deep Bay, thwart of
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> Iſland; the entrance of this Harbour
is not a Bow-ſhot from ſide to ſide: I ſounded
it, and there was twelve foot Water at a low
Water; but within there was three Fathom Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
at low Water: from the entrance of this
Harbour to the upper end of it. is about ſeven
Miles; Here is in this Harbour great ſtone of
Geeſe and Ducks; and a-ſhore there is great ſtore
of Heath-berries, and Hicts, and ſmall Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,
good and well-taſted; but I ſaw no <hi>Indians,</hi>
ſo I returned a-board again; the Captain
went into another Harbour, a Mile to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the ſecond Narrow on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
and ſounded, and had four Fathom Water in it;
it is very broad within, and there is great ſtore of
Sea-Crabs.</p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>February</hi> 11. Fair Weather, Wind va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable.
This day the Captain ordered me to go
with the Pinnace, and diſcover the North-ſhore,
and if I could with convenience diſcover ſome
part of the South; and to go to the firſt Narrow,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52975:84"/>
and there to ſtay for the Ship; ſo I went through
the ſecond, and landed on the South-ſide, in a fine
ſandy Bay, or Cove, expecting to fall with <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
for I ſaw a many Fires up in the Land; I
went up about five or ſix Miles, but could ſee
no <hi>Indians.</hi> Then the Night coming on, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again to the Boat, and there we pitched a
Tent to lie in, and lay all Night; and at High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
we ſet the ſame thwart a Pond of Water,
and there it ſtood until Low-water; then we hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Pond all over, and haled a-ſhore about
700 good and large Fiſh like Mullets. This
Land is very dry, barren Land, and nothing to
be ſeen in it worth the Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 12. Fair Weather, Wind Northerly.
This Morning I went over to the North-ſhore,
and there I fell with a fine ſandy Bay; I ſounded
it, and had 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 Fathom Water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
half a Mile from the Shore. This Bay is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the ſecond Narrow, and <hi>Cape Gregory;</hi> cloſe
under <hi>Cape Gregory;</hi> this Cape is about five or
ſix Miles to the Eaſtwards of the ſecond Narrow:
here I landed, the Winds being Northerly, a
freſh gale, and haled the Boat up dry; and went
up into the Country to ſee for <hi>Indians;</hi> but ſaw
none, and I returned to the Boat again, where
we pitched our Tent, and lay all Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 13. Fair Weather, and a freſh gale of
Wind Weſterly. This Morning I run all along
the North-ſhore from <hi>Cape Gregory,</hi> to the firſt Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:
and I was no ſooner entred into the firſt
Narrow, but I ſaw three Anchors, which lay up
above <hi>High-water Mark,</hi> in a ſmall ſandy Cove:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52975:85"/>
there I landed, and haled up the Boat; and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about to ſee if we could fall with any Guns,
or other Trade. One of the Men found an Iron
Commander for ſome Ships Poop: one of thoſe
Anchors were twelve Foot long in the Shank,
and the other two were eleven Foot a piece, and
they were all <hi>spaniſh</hi> Anchors. The Land here is
barren, dry Land, and affords neither Wood, nor
freſh Water; and for the ſpace of five, or ſix Miles
about, the land is full of Rats; they have Holes
in the Ground like Coney-burroughs: their Food
I ſuppoſe to be Limpet, for there is great ſtore
of Limpet-ſhoals lying cloſe to their Holes: I
ſaw no <hi>Indians</hi> here, nor any thing worth Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
Night coming on, we here pitched our
Tent, and lay all Night; here are very good
ſandy Bays on the North-ſide, all the way betwixt
the firſt and ſecond Narrow: for I ſounded all
along as I came down in the Boat, and had ten
and twelve Fathom Water, a good Burth off.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>February 14.</hi> Cloſe, haſey Weather,
with ſome Rain, and very much Wind Weſterly.
This Morning I ſaw the Ship coming down the
Streights; and after ſhe was through the Narrow,
they brought her to, and I got a-board; and we
made all the Sail we could, and by Night we got
clear of the Streights into the North-ſea; and at
three a Clock <hi>Cape Virgin-Mary</hi> bore North-weſt ½
a Point Northerly, diſtance 4 Leagues.</p>
            <p>Thurſday <hi>February</hi> 23. Fair Weather the Wind
variable, from the North-north-weſt, to the Weſt-north-weſt.
This Evening at nine a Clock, we
came to an Anchor in 22 Fathom Water, ſandy
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52975:85"/>
Ground on the South-part of <hi>America,</hi> in the Lat.
of 47<hi>d.</hi> 16<hi>m.</hi> South; and then <hi>Cape-Blanco</hi> bore
North-north-weſt of me, diſtant about ſix Leagues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 24. Fair Weather, and little Wind,
Northerly. This Morning we weighed, to go
to <hi>Port Deſire-Bay,</hi> and in the Evening at ſix
a Clock we Anchored in the Bay, in fourteen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February,</hi> 25. Fair Weather, and a Freſh gale
of Wind Eaſterly. This day the Long boat went
into <hi>Port-Deſire</hi> for freſh-Water, but could not fill
above five or ſix Puncheons; for there was no
more to be had there, and all they brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
was brackiſh: Fair Weather, Wind variable.</p>
            <p>Sunday <hi>February</hi> 26. Fair Weather, and a freſh
Wind at South-ſouth-weſt. Thiw Morning we ſet
Sail from <hi>Port-Deſire,</hi> to go for <hi>England;</hi> and at
twelve a Clock, I was in the Latitude of 47 deg.
10<hi>m.</hi> South. And then <hi>Cape-Blanco</hi> bore North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
of me, but not by the Compaſs; for here is
a Point and half variation Eaſterly: and at four
a Clock <hi>Cape-Blanco</hi> bore Weſt-north-weſt of me,
by the Compaſs, diſtance nine Miles, and then
we had twenty Fathom Water: but when it bears
Weſt-north-weſt from you, and you are 8 Miles
off, you will have but ten Fathom Water. Here
is very good Sounding al the Coaſt along, from
this Cape ot <hi>Cape Virgin-Mary,</hi> which lies in 52<hi>d.</hi>
15<hi>m.</hi> South. Within five Leagues off the Main,
you will have 25 and 30 Fathom Water; and 10
Leagues off, you will have 50, and 55 Fathom
Water, it is black oaſie Sand.</p>

Wedneſday <hi>May</hi> 17. The Weather fair. This
Evening at ſix a Clock, we ſaw the Iſland of Saint
<hi>Mary,</hi> one of the Iſles of <hi>Azores,</hi> it bore Eaſt-north-eaſt

            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 19. Fair Weather, Wind Eaſterly. This

upon the Iſland of St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> one of the
Iſles of <hi>Azores,</hi> bore North of me, diſtant about

<hi>Cape-Blanco</hi> to this Town is My
Meridian diſtance from <hi>Cape-Blanco</hi> to this Town
is Leagues, Miles, Tenths, Eaſting

or not; and I was informed by Mr. <hi>Richard Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuſon,</hi>
that we had War with none, but the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gea</hi>-Men.
So I returned a-board again, and we

            </p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>May</hi> 23. Fair Weather, and much

to revenge, but the water going high they were
hindred; this Bay was by them for this reaſon
named <hi>Murderers Bay,</hi> as it is marked in the

found the Land all round about them: It ſeems
a very good Land, fruitful, and well ſcituated, but
by reaſon of the bad Weather and Weſt Wind

an Iſland which they named <hi>three Kings Iſland,</hi>
to which they went to refreſh themſelves, and
being come near they ſaw upon the Hill thirty
or thirty five Men, being of tall Stature (as well
as might be diſcerned from far) with Sticks or
Clubs, who called to them with harſh or loud
voices, but they could not underſtand them;
and thoſe Men when they walked made very wide
paces or ſteps. In turning about this Iſland there
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52975:90"/>
appeared very few Men, and they ſaw little or no
Cultivated Land, but only found a freſh River,
where our People intended to get freſh water,

The fourth that Attemped it was <hi>William Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
a well Experienced Navigator and Artiſt,
ſent out of <hi>Holland</hi> by Prince <hi>Morrice</hi> in the
Year 1606. He ſailed into the Waygates, but
being entred, he found the ſame Incumbrance
with Ice that <hi>Pett</hi> and <hi>Jackman</hi> had done before;
ſo taſting of the Water, and finding of it freſh,
which neither <hi>Burrough, Pett,</hi> nor <hi>Jackman</hi> had
obſerved; he returned without any hope or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
of a Paſſage that way: but this not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
him, he reſolved a ſecond Adventure
to the Northward of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> to ſee what
might be Performed that way.</p>
            <p>So in the Year 1607. he ſet forward, and
arrived on the Coaſt of <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> in the Lat.
of 73. where he met with Ice; and ſo coaſted
the Shore till he came to the Lat. of 76. where he
could get no farther, and by the Ice was there
driven on Shore, and his Ship broke in peices by
it, and he confined to Winter there, where they
all indured the greateſt extremity of Cold that
ever Mortals did: the Winter being paſt they
with difficulty, in two Boats, got to <hi>Cola</hi> in <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
but before their arrival there <hi>William Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
dyed, to the great grief of all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>The next that Attempted it, was that famous
Diſcoverer of our own Nation Mr. <hi>Henry Hudſon,</hi>
in the Year 1610. but he being diſheartned by
the Voyage of <hi>Barrans,</hi> attempted but little.</p>
            <p>So the thought of a Paſſage by the North-Eaſt
was wholly laid aſide, till of late within this
Year or two ſome Novile Accidents happening;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52975:100"/>
the Opinion of the North-Eaſt was received in
ſome, and ſomething relating thereunto was
printed in the <hi>Tranſactions</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now will I come to the Reaſons of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
me to believe there was a probability of a
Paſſage, and then the cauſe of my undertaking
of the ſaid Voyage.</p>
            <p>My firſt Reaſon was grounded on the Opinion
of <hi>William Barrans</hi> before ſpoke of; which was,
that <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> and <hi>Greenland</hi> being 200
Leagues diſtance between one and the other,
that if he had Steered away North-Eaſt from the
North Cape, which would have brought him in
the mid-way betwixt the two Lands, that then
he might have probably found an open Sea, free
from Ice, and ſo Conſequently a Paſſage; and in
that Opinion he remained to his dying day; for
he did verily believe that the Ice was not to be
met off of either Shore more than 20 Leagues,
and the reſt to be free and open, and that his
being too near the Shore of <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> was
the cauſe of his meeting ſo much Ice, which was
the overthrow of his Voyage, and if he had
lived, he had purpoſely intended another Voyage,
and to have ſailed the mid-way.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon that made me believe a
Paſſage, was a Letter ſent out of <hi>Holland;</hi> which
is Publiſhed in the <hi>Tranſactions</hi> of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi>
which affirmeth, the Grand <hi>Zar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovia</hi> had
cauſed a particular Survey of the Land of <hi>Nova
Z<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mbla<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and that they had found it to be no
Iſland, but to joyn to the main Land of <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
and that to the Northward of it was a free
and open Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:52975:100"/>
The third was a Journal, Printed in <hi>Holland,</hi>
of a Voyage from <hi>Batavia</hi> to <hi>Japan,</hi> wherein
the Ship was caſt away upon <hi>Corea,</hi> a Peninſula
of <hi>China,</hi> where by the Natives they were made
Slaves, The Relator having been there 16
years, at laſt eſcaped to <hi>Japan,</hi> and writ this
Journal, wherein amongſt other Obſervations
he Relates this; that in a Bay on the Coaſt of
<hi>Corea,</hi> there doth at ſeveral times drive in dead
Whales with <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Harping Irons in
them, which if true had been a great Argument
of a Paſſage.</p>
            <p>The fourth was a Relation of Mr. <hi>Joſeph
Moxons,</hi> who being in <hi>Holland</hi> above 20 years
ſince, heard a <hi>Dutchman</hi> relate (as he did believe
the real Matter of Fact) that he had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Pole it ſelf; and that it was as warm there
as it was at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in Summer time.</p>
            <p>The fifth was a Relation of one Captain
<hi>Goulden,</hi> who had made above thirty Voyages to
<hi>Greenland,</hi> and this he did relate to his Majeſty;
that being at <hi>Greenland</hi> ſome twenty Years ago,
he was in Company with two <hi>Hollanders</hi> to the
Eaſtward of Edges Iſland, and that the Whales
not appearing on the Shore, the two <hi>Hollanders</hi>
were reſolved to go farther Northerly, and to
Fiſh amongſt the Ice; ſo they departed from him
and went to the Northward, and in a Fortnights
time returned to him again, and gave it out,
that they had ſailed unto the Lat. of 89. that
was within one Degree of the Pole, and that
they did meet with no Ice, but a free and open
Sea, and that there run a very hollow grown Sea

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52975:102"/>
like that of the Bay of <hi>Biſca.</hi> Mr. <hi>Goulden</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not ſatisfied with the bare Relation, they
produced him four Journals out of the two
Ships, which teſtified the ſame, and that they
all agreed within four minutes one of the other.</p>
            <p>The ſixth Inducement that made me believe
there was a Paſſage, was a Relation from the
ſame Captain <hi>Goulden,</hi> which was, that all the
drift Wood that they found at <hi>Greenland,</hi> was
eaten with a Sea-Worm to the very Heart, which
if ſo, it muſt of neceſſity come out of a Hot
Climate; for Experience ſheweth, that the Worm
biteth in no Cold Country, therefore it could
not be ſuppoſed that it came from any other
Country than <hi>Jedzo, Japan,</hi> or ſome Land there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh Argument was another Narration
Printed in the <hi>Tranſactions,</hi> of two Ships of late
that had attempted the Paſſage, ſailed 300
Leagues to the Eaſtward of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and
had after proſecuted the Voyage, had there not
a difference aroſe betwixt the Undertakers and the
<hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> againſt whoſe Intereſt it was
to ſuffer it to be found out; ſo they being a Body,
and more powerful than the other, ſuppreſſed it.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeven were the main Arguments, though
I had many more, that Converted me into the
Opinion of there being a poſſibility of a Paſſage
to the Northward of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> to <hi>China</hi>
and <hi>Japan;</hi> theſe being as I ſuppoſed, or as any
Man would have done, if he had well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, to be Matter of Fact, and no Fables.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:52975:102"/>
Beſides theſe Arguments, I had ſome grounded
upon Reaſon and Nature, which ſeemed to be
aſſiſtant in the Deſign of the Attempt, ſuppoſing
the aforeſaid Arguments to be true, and there
being no Land nor Ice in the way as and Obſtacle
to hinder it.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, That being near the North-Pole
in the Summer time, it might be as warm as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Artick</hi> or <hi>Antartick</hi> Circle, or warmer
than with us in the Winter time; for under the
Pole it ſelf, in <hi>June</hi> the Sun being 23 degrees
high, and having no Depreſſion towards the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
but always ſwimming about at the ſame
hight, might illuminate that part of the Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere
with more heat than it doth ours in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when he is no more then 15 degrees high,
when he is at the higheſt, that is on the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
and not more than eight Hours above the
Horizon; or that it might be as hot as any place
near either Polar Circle, becauſe there the Sun
hath a Declination toward the Horizon, and ſo
the Atmoſphere hath almoſt as much time to cool,
as it hath to heat, which under the Pole ſhould
have no intermiſſion. And one Argument to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
this Opinion, was the Relation of moſt
<hi>Greenland</hi> Traders, who affirm, that the farther
North they go on the Coaſt of that Land, that
they meet with more green Herbs and Graſs,
than they do to the Southward, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more Deer.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was (that which I moſt feared)
which was foggy Weather, which I did imagin,
if it ſhould happen, it could not at the ſame
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52975:103"/>
time blow hard; becauſe it is uſual in all other
Climates, when Wind happeneth, to diſperſe the
Fog; ſo that if it ſhould ſo happen, one might lie
by, or make little way till Wind came that one
might ſee before them.</p>
            <p>The third was the Solution of a Doubt that
moſt men had fancied, which was, that if one
came near the Pole, the Septenteral Declination
of the Needle of the Compaſs ſhould be quite
taken away, which would of neceſſity follow if
the Pole of the World, and the Pole of the
Magnet were all one; which I am certain is not,
but is placed ſo far off, that one might go under
the Pole of the World, if Land or Ice did not
hinder, with this ſuppoſition, that one muſt know
where the Pole Magnetical is, to allow the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
that will there happen.</p>
            <p>Having conſidered all theſe Arguments and
Reaſons, with many more I met with, which
will be too tedious to Relate; and the poſſibility
of a Paſſage being now imprinted in my Mind
and Inclination, I do intend to ſhew the Reaſons
in ſhort, that induced me to undertake the ſaid
Voyage.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, That the King, whom God Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
ſhould Rcap the Honour and Glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and his Subjects the Profit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There being no Actions within the
Hemiſphere of His Majeſties Dominions wherein
any vacancy was, but all being ſupplyed, I choſe,
rather than to be Idle, to apply my ſelf to His
Majeſty for the Proſecution of the Deſign; and
being adviſed to it by a great many of the beſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52975:103"/>
Merchants of the City of <hi>London;</hi> where, after
divers conſultations with them, and the Reaſons
and Arguments before-mentioned being debated,
it was by many thought Practicable, and by
more thought Profitable to the Nation: the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
to relate would ſwell into a conſiderable
Volume.</p>
            <p>The third Reaſon was peculiar to my ſelf,
though when known, to the Uſe and Benefit of all
Mankind; which was, that having for ſome years
paſt framed an Hypotheſis of the motion of the
two Magnetical Poles, for two ſuch there be;
and by the Obſervations of all, or moſt that
writ of that Subject, with my own Obſervation,
and coſtly Experiment upon a great many Places
of the Superficies of the Terreſtrial Globe; I
having found out their Motion very near, and
thereby the Inclination of the Magnetical Needle
under the Horizon, in all Latitudes, and all
Longitudes; and Variation of the Compaſs may
be found in any place in this World, without
aſſiſtance of any other Luminary. But not being
ſo fully ſatisfied as I might be, if I could come
ſo near the Pole as was ſuppoſed, it prompted
my Inclination, as far as any other Argument
whatever, to Attempt this Voyage.</p>
            <p>So having all theſe Reaſons that there was a
Paſſage, and Reaſons for me to unertake it; I
advanced. The firſt ſtep to it was, I drew a Polar
Draught, whereing I traced all thoſe Navigators
that had Attempted the North-Eaſt, which I
preſented to His Majeſty, and Royal Highneſs,
and applyed my ſelf to them with the Reaſons
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52975:104"/>
aforeſaid: which after their Royal Conſideration,
and Conſult with many Merchants, and Seamen,
that had uſed to Sail Northward; and if thought
by all feaſable, His Majeſty was Graciouſly
pleaſed to grant me the <hi>Speedwell</hi> Frigot, to be
Manned and Victualled at his Royal Charge,
with all other Appurtenances thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>But becauſe in all Attempts of this Nature it
was not Convenient to venture one Ship alone,
for the many Accidents that are incident to a
ſingle Ship in an Enterprize of this Nature;</p>
            <p>Therefore

            <p>Theſe Eight Honourable Perſons, at their own
proper Charge, bought a Pink, called the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous,</hi>
of the Burthen of a Hundred and twenty
Tuns, fitted her to Sea, Men, Amunition, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
and Merchandize, which was ſuch as
was Reaſonably purpoſed to Vend on the Coaſt
of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> or at <hi>Japan,</hi> if a Paſſage had been
found.</p>
            <p>Now the Ships being fitting out, the <hi>Speedwell</hi>
at <hi>Deptford</hi> in the King's Yard, where the Builder,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52975:104"/>
Mr. <hi>John Siſh,</hi> took no ordinary Care in Strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her, and in her Shething, which was as
well performed as in any Ship that ever ſailed on
the Sea. Thus being fitted, I was to ſatisfie moſt
People the Advantage to our Nation that would
accrue, if there was a Paſſage.</p>
            <p>The firſt Advantage that I purpoſed, was, that
on the Coaſt of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> it being a cold Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
we might Vend our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth, which
now is grown a Drug; and certain it is that they
wear Cloth which is ſent them from <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and
<hi>Moſcovia,</hi> which before it arrive at their Hands
muſt needs be very Dear in the Price; ſo if one
could come on their Coaſt, one might Vend a
great deal more, and abundance Cheaper.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Advantage, as would have been,
that in ſix Weeks one might have ſailed to <hi>Japan,</hi>
which in the other Way is nine Months; and
the Paſſage that way being as hazardous and
perillous as this would have been, if there had

            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, June</hi> 29. From the 28 Noon to this
Day Noon, little Wind, with Rains: we ſtood
away from the Ice to Sea; true Courſe allowed

16 Miles, departure 8 Miles, Lat. <hi>per</hi> Judgment

Noon the Wind at Weſt and Weſt and by South,
a ſine Gale, but very foggy Weather; we ſtand
away South to get from the Ice, we being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayed
in it. At 11 at Night the <hi>Proſperous</hi> Pink
fired a Gun, and bore down upon us, crying out
Ice on the Weather-Bow, with that we clap'd the
Helm hard a Weather, Veered out the Main-Sheet
to Ware the Ship; but before the Ship
could Ware, and bring to upon the other Tack,
She ſtruck on a ledge of Rocks which lay ſunk.</p>
            <p>From 12 at Noon to 11 at Night thick foggy
Weather, the Wind from the North-weſt to the
Weſt by South. Courſe <hi>per</hi> Compaſs between the
South-weſt, and the South by Weſt, cloſe Haul'd;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52975:111"/>
but at Night the <hi>Proſperous</hi> Pink ſaw the Sea break
on the Weather-Bow, bearing down upon us
cryed out it was the Ice; with that we preſently
bore up round to bring to upon the other Tack,
but our Ship not wearing round, run on a ledge
of Rocks, there ſtuck faſt, but Captain <hi>Flawes</hi>
Ship got clear, wearing more rounder: we fired
ſeveral Guns to give Captain <hi>Flawes</hi> notice of our
diſtreſs, we uſed all means poſſible to get her off,
by carrying out a Haſſer and Anchor, and ſtaving
of Water and Beer, and throwing Proviſion over
Board, but could not get the Ship off, for the
Water did Ebb, and the Ship Sued above 3 Foot;
but when the Flood came it brought a great Sea
with it, and the Ship beat very hard: we uſed
all means to heave her off, but could not, and
the Ship making Water more than we could
Pump; with that we cut our Maſts by the Board,
and ſent our Yaul unto the Shore to diſcover
ſome place to Land, at whoſe return aboard
brought word that there was landing, with that
we got up Bread out of the Bread Room, and
brought it up into the great Cabbin: and the
Carpenter made ready to ſave ſome Tools, and
neceſſaries to Rebuild our Long-Boat to ſave our
lives, if ſo neceſſitated, that Captain <hi>Flawes</hi>
ſhould not return to us. So about 12 at Noon
we got all our Men aſhore, except two which
were drowned in the Pinnace, by a Sea which
broke into her, juſt as ſhe put off from the Ship
ſide: having Bread, Powder, and Proviſions in
her, and all loſt with the Pinnace. Alſo, to
our great grief, having nothing but the Long-Boat,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52975:111"/>
to truſt in, to ſave our lives, which could
not carry above 30 Men of 70. We uſed all
means to ſave Bread, but the Ship filling up to the
upper Deck, we were forced to leave her, having
ſaved but two Bags of Bread, with ſome pieces
of Pork, and a little Cheeſe: this being all on
Shore, we carried our Proviſions, and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
upon a Hill, where came to viſit us one
of the Natives, which was a Prodigious great white
Bear, which one of our Men ſhot at, and as we
ſuppoſed hit her, which made her run away:
with that we made all haſt to build us a Tent to
keep us from the cold, and to keep our Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
dry, having ſaved Canvas for the purpoſe,
which we laid over Oars and Spars, and threw
up a Trench of Earth round us, to preſerve us
from Wild Beaſts; but all this time indured much
cold, moſt of our Men being wet, and having
no firing; therefore all our Hopes and Prayers
were that God would ſend us the Ship aſhore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, June</hi> 30. A freſh Gale, and very foggy,
with a great Sea; our Ship began to ſplit, and
much Wreck came aſhore; ſo that we got Oars,
Spars and Deals, to build us Tents, and firing,
of which we ſaved as much as we could; but the
Weather proved very foggy to our great grief,
being we could not expect Captain <hi>Flawes</hi> as
long as the Fog continued. The Wind at Weſt-north-weſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, July</hi> 1. The Wind at North-weſt a
freſh Gale, the Ship brake in pieces, ſo that we
had much Wreck came aſhore, and Proviſions,
which we indeavoured to ſave with much pains
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52975:112"/>
and trouble, the Sea breaking much on the Shore,
and the Weather very cold and foggy. We ſaved
two Casks of Flower, ſome Brandy, and a Butt
of Beer, and a Cask of Oil: the Flower did us
great kindneſs to ſave our Bread, for we made of
the Flower Pan-Cakes, and Pudding, and baked
Cakes on Stones, to our great refreſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, July</hi> 2. The Wind at Weſt, and very
foggy; we ſaved more Flower, Butter, and a
few pieces of Beef and Pork, the Cask being
Staved. The Gunneras he was ſaving of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
there came a great White Bear to him,
which he ſhot at, and fell'd her down, but ſhe
roſe again and at him; with that there came
more Men and fired at her: ſhe was a very great
one, and very Fat, and the Fleſh very good, and
look'd delicate, and Eat well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, July</hi> 8. The Wind at Weſt-north-weſt;
a very great Fog, and all our Men in
great deſpair of our ſeeing Captain <hi>Flawes:</hi> we
beginning to conſider our moſt miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and contriving how to ſave our Lives; the
Long-boat not being able to carry above 30 Men,
and a Deck built on her, and her Waſt raiſed;
with that we concluded to lengthen her 12 Foot,
and to carry all our Men; but upon conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of wanting Materials, and the Carpenters bad
aſſiſtance, the Men would not agree to have her
cut a ſunder, for fear ſhe could not be lengthened;
but were willing to Travel by Land towards the
Waygates, in hopes to find ſome <hi>Ruſſia</hi> Lodges.
With that we began to raiſe her Waſt, and build
a Deck, the Weather continuing very foggy till
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52975:112"/>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, at which time we eſpyed
Captain <hi>Flawes</hi> to our great joy; with that we
made preſently a great Fire, and ſent our Yaul
to meet him, who immediately ſaw our Fire and
ſteered into us, and ſent his Boat to help to bring
off our Men; with that we broke up our new
Work, which was done to our Long-Boat, and
Lanched her; and about Noon got all on Board
Captain <hi>Flawes,</hi> in good Health.</p>

            <head>Now, after the JOURNAL, I do
intend to ſhew my Conceptions of
the ſaid Voyage, and a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of our Miſcarriage; with
ſome Obſervations made in the ſaid
Voyage.</head>
            <p>THE firſt was the following the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>William Barrans,</hi> that was to
ſteer directly North-eaſt from the
North Cape, and to fall in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
betwixt <hi>Greenland</hi> and <hi>Nova Zembla:</hi> ſo
having made the Land to the Weſtward of the
North Cape, the 19. Day of <hi>June,</hi> I ſteered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
North-eaſt by Compaſs, which was not ſo
much by the true Courſe, becauſe of the variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that is there Weſterly; and the 22. Day at
Noon we ſaw the main Body of Ice, being in
the Lat. of 76 <hi>d.</hi> and about 60 Leagues to the
Eaſtward of <hi>Greenland.</hi> At the firſt ſeeing of
Ice, I did imagin it had been the Ice that joyned
to <hi>Greenland;</hi> and that if I went more Eaſterly
there might be a free Sea; ſo I ran cloſe by the
Ice, it lying away. Eaſt-ſouth-eaſt; and Weſt-north-weſt,
and every League, or leſs, that we
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52975:121"/>
ran, we met with a Cape of Ice; ſo when we
were about that, we could ſee no Ice to the
Northward; ſo ſtanding in North-eaſt, ſometimes
two Glaſſes, that is one hour, we could ſee more
Ice a Head, and then we were forced to go out
the ſame way we came in, and thus I continued
Coaſting the Ice, ſometimes with great hopes of
a clear Sea, and then again diſheartened by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Ice; till at laſt I had no hopes at all,
which was when I ſaw the Land of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi>
and the Ice joyn to it. So here the Opinion of
<hi>William Barrans</hi> was Confuted, and all the
reſt of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Relations, which certainly are
all forged abuſive Pamphlets; as alſo the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our own Countrymen. But certainly, if
Men did really conſider the many individual
dangers and miſchiefs that comes upon the
broaching of ſuch untruths, they would never do
it; for I do now verily believe that if there be no
Land to the Northward of the Lat. of 80 <hi>d.</hi> that
the Sea that is there is all frozen, and always
continueth ſo; for I that could get no farther
than 76 <hi>d.</hi> found it ſo frozen without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and ſome of the Ice that we ſaw, that was
on the main Body of it, had been conveyed 10
Degrees more Southward, would have taken
ſome Centuries of Years to Thaw it: for the
looſe Ice that lay about the Edges of the main
Body, was not more than a Foot thick in ſome
pieces above the Superficies of the Water, and
the reſt of the Cake that was ſunk, was more
than 18 Foot below. So I conclude that thoſe
vaſt Mountains that were on the main Body were
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52975:121"/>
all on Shore, as of neceſſity they muſt, if they
hold the ſame proportion; and conſidering the
ſhallowneſs of the Water, which I found all along
the Ice, which in the mid-way between the two
Lands, I found to be no more than 70 Fathom,
was doubtleſs a ſign that to the Northward is
Land, and that the main Body of Ice that lyeth
cruſted about the Shore, may be 20 Leagues or
more, and that <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> and <hi>Greenland</hi> are
the ſame Continent; for if there had been any
Paſſage, there would have been ſome Current,
which I could never, or very hardly find to be
any, and the little that was run Eaſt-ſouth-eaſt
along the Ice, which is nothing elſe but a ſmall
Tide which riſeth ſome 8 Foot. Thus the Ice
having been an obſtacle in our way, as alſo the
cauſe of my coming ſo far to the Eaſtward,
which before I never intended.</p>
            <p>I will come to the misfortune that happened
to us in the loſs of our Ship: which was thus,
being amongſt the Ice the 29. Day of <hi>June</hi> in the
Morning, we had like to have been incloſed in
it: it proving likewiſe foggy Weather, I ſtood
out to the Southward, thinking to lye there till
fairer Weather, or to ſpend ſome time to the
Southward, and then come up to the Ice again,
to ſee if there might be any alteration in it as to
its removal either Eaſt, Weſt, North, or south;
but all this Day it proved foggy dirty Weahter,
the Wind being at Weſt: ſo we lay South-ſouth-weſt
with the Stem, and by our Judgment and
Reckoning, the Weſtermoſt Land of <hi>Nova Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bla</hi>
bore from us Eaſt-ſouth-eaſt, that was 4 Points
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52975:122"/>
under our Lee Bow. But ſuch was our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that it proved not ſo, for about 10 of the
Clock Captain <hi>Flawes,</hi> being upon our Weather
Quarter, fired a Gun and bore to me, and called
out that there was Ice a Head; then I looking
out a Head, ſaw ſomething white juſt under the
Bow, which preſently I perceived to be a breath,
and no Ice; now if I had ſtaied with the Ship,
Captain <hi>Flawes</hi> being to Windward, I ſhould
have been on Board of him, and then certainly
we had been both loſt, ſo I was forced to bear
up with hope that I might get clear of it; but
the Ship being a great while wearing ſtruck on
the Rock, her Head lying to Seaward, which if
it had not, but that the Broadſide had been to
the Sea we had all periſhed without Gods great
mercy: Captain <hi>Flawes</hi> in the mean time (being
a ſhorter Ship) wore round, and came cloſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Stern, and with great Providence eſcaped,
and stood off to Sea: here we lay beating on the
Rock in moſt cruel manner for the ſpace of 3 or 4
hours, uſing all poſſible means to ſave her, but all in
vain, for it blew ſo hard that it was impoſſible to
carry out an Anchor capable to do us any ſervice,
though we had an opportunity to carry a ſmall
Anchor, and warp to hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> another out by, which
ſignified but little: the Ship all this while lay, and
at the end of 4 or 5 hours we ſaw Land cloſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Stern, to the great amazement of us all,
which before we could not ſee for the foggy
Weather; ſo I commanded the Men to get out
our Boats before our Maſt came by the Board,
which was done. I ſent the Boatſwain toward
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52975:122"/>
the Shore in the Pinnace, to ſee if there was any
poſſibility of landing, which I much feared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Sea ran ſo high. In half an hour he
returned with this anſwer, that it was impoſſible
to ſave a Man, the Sea ran ſo high, and the Snow
being in high Clifts on Shore was unacceſſible,
which was but bad tidings: ſo then it was high
time to think on the ſafety of our Souls, and we
went all together to Prayers, to beſeech God to
have Mercy on us, for now nothing but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
ruin appeared before our Eyes: after
Prayers being done it proved a little clearer
Weather; and I looking over the Stern ſaw a
ſmall Beach directly with the Stern of the Ship,
where I thought might be ſome poſſibility of
landing; ſo I ſent the Pinnace again with ſome
Men to be landed, but they durſt not venture on
Shore; ſo I ſent the Long-Boat with ſome 20
Men to Land, who attempted it, and got ſafe on
Shore; ſo they in the Pinnace ſeeing that, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them and their Men likewiſe, and both
returned on Board again: now the Men on the
Shore ſent to me deſire ſome Fire-Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
for there was many Bears on Shore; ſo
I cauſed to be put into the Pinnace two Barrels
of Powder that we had ſaved dry, before the
Ship was belged, and ſome ſmall Arms, and ſome
Proviſion, with my own Papers, and Mony;
but as ſhe put off from the Ship ſide, a Sea over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
her, ſo that all was loſt with the life of one
Man, by name <hi>John Boſman,</hi> being Coopers
Mate, and ſeveral others taken up for dead; the
Long-Boat being then on Shore to Land more
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52975:123"/>
Men, and they hearing us call from aboard,
(when as then we could not ſee the Shore) they
came on Board and ſaved the Men, but the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
was all broke to pieces, which was no ſmall
grief to us; ſo the Long-Boat being on Board,
and the Sea running prodigious high, the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain
and ſome others would compel me and
the Lieutenant to leave the Ship, ſaying that it
was impoſſible for the Boat to live any longer in
that Sea, and that they had rather be drowned
than I; but deſiring me when I came on Shore
(if it were poſſible) to ſend the Boat again for
them: ſo I being half way on Shore the Ship
over-ſet; ſo I made all the haſt poſſible to Land
them Men I had in the Boat, and having landed
them I went off to the Ship again to ſave thoſe
poor Men that had been ſo kind to me before:
ſo with great hazard I got with the Boat to the
Quarter of the Ship, and they came down the
Ladder into the Boat, only one Man who was
left for dead, which was one that had been caſt
away in the Pinnace, whoſe name was <hi>Alexander
Frazor,</hi> a very pretty Saylor. So I returned to
the Shore and got ſafe to Land, though very wet
and cold; ſo we hauled up the Boat on Shore,
and went up the Land about a flightſhoot, where
our Men were making a Fire, and a Tent with
Canvas and Oars, which we had ſaved for that
Purpoſe; ſo we lay all that Night very cold, wet,
and weary. The next Morning the Man that
we left on Board recovered, and got unto the
Mizen-Top; for that Maſt we left ſtanding when
we came away, the other we had cut all down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:52975:123"/>
The Ship laboured and beat violently, but it
blew ſo hard, and the Sea ran ſo high that it
was impoſſible to ſave him; ſo the Weather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
blowing, with extreme Fogs, and with
Froſt and Snow, and all the ill compacted Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that could be imagined together. We built
more Tents to preſerve our ſelves, and the Ship
breaking in pieces came all aſhore to the ſame
place where we landed, which ſerved for ſhelter
and Firing; beſides there came to us ſome
Hogſheads of Flower, and Brandy good ſtore,
which was no little Comfort in our great Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
Here we lay betwixt hope and deſpair,
hoping for fair Weather that Captian <hi>Flawes</hi>
might find us, which was impoſſible that ever he
ſhould do if it continued foggy; and ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing
of his being ſafe, but that he might be
Lost as well as we. But ſuppoſing we never was
to ſee him again, I was reſolved to try the utmoſt
to ſave as many as I could in the Long-Boat; in
order thereunto we raiſed her two Foot, and
laid a Deck upon her to keep the Sea out as much
as was poſſible and with this Boat and 30 Men.
(for ſhe could carry no more) I intended to Row
and Sail to <hi>Ruſſia</hi> but the Men not being ſatisfied
who ſhould be the Men, began to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
in their mind and behaviour; every one
having as much reaſon to ſave himſelf as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſome holding Conſultation to ſtave the
Boat, and all to run the like Fortune. But here
Brandy was our beſt Friend, for it kept them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
Fox'd, ſo that in all their Deſigns I could
prevent them; ſome were of the mind to go by
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52975:124"/>
Land, but that I knew was impoſſible to any
Man; neither had we Proviſions, nor Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to defend us from the Wild Beaſts; and if it
had been paſſable, that is any going on the ground
for Bogs, that they would have met with Rivers
that they knew not whether to go: ſo there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no probability of going by Land, nor for
any to attempt going in the Boat, without forty
Men having been firſt deſtroyed. I will leave it
to the conſideratiion of any, whither we were
not in a very miſerable condition without Divine
Providence: to Write my thought I had at that
time, to ſave as many Men as I could, it is not
pertinent at all to the Diſcourſe, ſince it cannot
but be imagined to be Tragical. The Weather
continued ſtill very bad with Fogs, Snow, Rain,
and Froſt, till the 9. Day of our being on Shore,
which was the 8. Day of <hi>July,</hi> when in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it cleared up, and to our great joy, one of
the Sailors cried out a Sail, which proved Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Flawes,</hi> as reaſonable may be imagined; ſo
we ſet fire to our Town that he might ſee where
we was, which he preſently ſaw, ſo come to us,
and ſent his Boat to us (but before I went off) I
Writ a brief Relation of the intention of the
Voyage, with the Accidents that had befallen us,
and put it in a Glaſs-Bottle, and left it in the
Fortification I had there built. So by twelve a
Clock we all got ſafe on Board, but left all on
Shore that we had ſaved from the Ship; for we
much feared it ſhould prove foggy again.</p>

            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:52975:124"/>
            <head>Now I intend to give a brief deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of the Land, and the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
I made there.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>NOva Zembla,</hi> is ſo called by the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi>
which ſignifieth <hi>New Land</hi> in their
Language; to prove it is either an
Iſland, or whither it joyneth to the
Continent of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> would be a very hard
Task, nor is it certainly known to any; for by
Circumſtances I think it impoſſible to prove, and
by Experience the ſearch thereof is ſo impoſſible
that it will hardly be tryed.</p>
            <p>But let it be either, I think the matter is not
much, ſince it is the moſt miſerable Country that
lyeth on the Foundation of the Earth; a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
moſt part of it covered perpetually with Snow,
and that that is bare is not to be walked on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
like Bogs, upon whoſe Superficies grows a
kind of Moſs; which beareth a ſmall blue and
yellow Flower, and this is all the Product of the
Earth of this Country. Under the ſuperficies of
this Earth, about two Foot deep, after we had dug
ſo low, we came to a firm Body of Ice; which, as
I think, was never heard of before: ſo theſe Men
that did imagin, if they were forced to Winter
to the Northward, would dig Caves in the Earth
to preſerve themſelves from cold, would find
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:52975:125"/>
here but very bad Lodging. The Snow lieth
here contrary to what it doth in any other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
for in all other Climates the Snow melteth
ſooneſt away near the Sea ſide, but here the Sea
beateth againſt the ſnowy Clifts, which in ſome
places are as high as either of the Forelands in
<hi>Kent:</hi> the Sea has waſhed underneath the Snow
a prodigious way, and the Snow over hanging,
moſt fearful to behold, and up from the Water
ſide, upon the firſt Ridge of Hills, the Snow
was melted till you come to the next Ridge,
which are Mountains, and they all the way up
are covered with Snow, which I believe hath
lain there evere ſince the Creation; but after we
had aſcended this, which in ſome places was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Perpendicular, we came to the top of all
the Mountains, as we ſuppoſed, for we could
not ſee far; for we could hardly ſee one the other
the Fog was ſo thick, and remained ſo all the
time we were in the Country; but on the top of
theſe Hills we found it bare from Snow, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
good walking. The beſt that I found
in the Country were only Bears: I continued on
the top of thoſe Hills fome two hours, and went
as far as was convenient, that we might find the
way back again. Here I found the Track of
many large Deer, alſo we found an Horn of
Beam of Deer; beſides Deer, there be abundance
of large White Bears, and ſome Foxes, and a
little Creature much like a Coney, but not ſo
big as a Rat; and ſome few little Birds like
Larks, and theſe be all the Beaſts or Fowls
we found in the Country. Every quarter of a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:52975:125"/>
Mile there runneth down from the Hills into the
Sea a ſmall Rivulet of very good Water, which
is melted from Snow. Upon the Hills we found
abundance of Slate-ſtone, which made it good
walking; but at the Sea ſide, where the Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
came down, we found very good Black
Marble, with White Veins in it.</p>
            <p>The Point where we loſt our Ship I called
Point <hi>Speedill:</hi> the high Hills I called King
<hi>Charles</hi>'s Snow Hills; and the next Point to the
Southward, which is the Weſtermoſt Point of
<hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> I named <hi>James</hi> Foreland, and the
Point to the Northward, <hi>York</hi> Point. Point <hi>Speedill</hi>
lieth in the Lat. of 74 <hi>d.</hi> 30 <hi>m.</hi> North, and in
the Longitude Eaſt from the City of <hi>London</hi> 63 <hi>d.</hi>
00 <hi>m.</hi> The variation of the Compaſs is 13 <hi>d.</hi>
Weſt, and it is full Sea at South-weſt Moon.
The Tide riſeth 8 Foot, and ſetteth directly
upon the Shore, which is a certain ſign that there
is no Paſſage to the Northward. The Sea Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
about the Ice and Land, is very ſalt, and
much ſalter than any I ever taſted, and a great
deal heavier, and I may certainly ſay the cleareſt
in the World, for I could ſee the ground very
plain in 80 Fathom Water, which is 480 Foot,
there being few Steeples ſo high as that was
deep, and I could ſee the Shells at the bottom
very plain.</p>
            <p>If the Voyage had ſucceeded, I ſhould, God
willing, have given a more full and nice account
of all the Experiments I had, and ſhould have
made, eſpecially thoſe of the Magnet, which I

was North-eaſt. At night, when

The 27th we had ſtorms, hail and ſnow,
with very cold weather, the wind North-eaſt
and by eaſt, we were in 71 degrees, and came
to the Ice, and turned back again. The <hi>Iſland</hi>
of<hi>John Maien</hi> bore from us South-weſt and
by weſt, as near as we could gueſs within ten
Miles. We might have ſeen the Iſland plain
enough, but the Air was haizy and full of
fogs and ſnow, ſo that we could not ſee far.
About noon it blew a ſtorm, whereupon we
took down our Top-ſails, and furling our Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail,
drove with the Miſſen-ſail towards South-eaſt.</p>
               <p>The 29th it was foggy all day, the wind
North eaſt and by north, we came to the Ice,
and ſailed from it again, as you may ſee in the
Plate<hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 3cth, the firſt Sunday after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> was
foggy, with rain and ſnow, the wind at North,
at night we came to the Ice, but ſailed from it
again; the Sea was tempeſtuous, and toſſed
our Ship very much.</p>
               <p>The 3d of <hi>May</hi> was cold, ſnowy, with hail,
and miſty Sun-ſhine, the wind North-weſt and
by weſt, the Sun ſet no more, we ſaw it as
well by night as by day.</p>
               <p>The fourth we had ſnow, hail, and gloomy
Sun-ſhine, with cold weather, but not exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
the wind at North-weſt, the weather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day unconſtant. Here we ſaw abundance
of <hi>Seales,</hi> they jump'd out of the water before
the Ship, and which was ſtrange, they would
ſtand half out of the water, and as it were
dance together.</p>
               <p>The 5th-in the forenoon it was moderately
cold, and Sun-ſhine, but toward noon darkiſh
and cloudy, with ſnow and great froſt, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52975:131"/>
wind North-weſt and by North. We ſaw dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
many Ships, failing about the Ice, I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that as they paſſed by one another, they
haled one another, crying <hi>Holla,</hi> and asked
each other how many fiſh they had caught,
but they would not ſtick ſometimes to tell more
then they had. When it was windy, that they
could not hear one another, they waved their
Hats, to ſignifie the number caught. But when
they have their full Fraight of <hi>Whales,</hi> they put
up their great Flag as a ſign thereof; then if
any hath a Meſſage to be ſent, he delivers it to
them, as you may ſee in the Plate <hi>A</hi> by <hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 7th we had moderate froſt, clouds and
ſnow with rain. In the evening we ſailed to
the Ice, the wind was quite contrary to us, and
the Ice too ſmall, wherefore we ſailed from it.
In the afternoon we ſaw <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> the South
point of the North-foreland, we ſuppoſed it
the true Harbour. The Land appeared like a
dark Cloud, full of white ſtreeks, we turned
to the Weſt again, that is, according to the
Compaſs, which is alſ to be underſtood of the
Ice and Harbour.</p>
               <p>The 9th was the ſame weather, and cold as
before, the Wind South-weſt and by weſt.
In the afternoon a <hi>Fin-fiſh</hi> ſwam by our Ship,
which we took at firſt to be a <hi>Whale,</hi> before we
ſaw the high fins of his tail, and came near to
it. We had let down our Sloop from the Ship,
but that labour was loſt, for he was not worth
taking.</p>
               <p>From the 25th of <hi>April</hi> to this day, we had
not taken the Sun's altitude, we were then in
70 degrees and 3 minutes, and ſailed towards
the North and the Ice. It may ſeem ſtrange,
that we ſo often ſailed to the Ice and from it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52975:132"/>
again, but I ſhall give you a reaſon for that
hereafter.</p>
               <p>The12th it was ſtormy and exceſſive cold,
the wind North<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we had the greateſt froſts
in this Month of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 14th the wind was North-weſt, fine
weather, with Sun-ſhine, we were within 75
degrees and 22 minutes. We told twenty Ships
about us, the Sea was very even, and we hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
felt any wind, yet it was very cold.</p>
               <p>In this place the Sea becomes ſmooth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
again after a ſtorm, chiefly when the
wind blows from the Ice; but when it blows
off the Sea, it always makes a great Sea.</p>
               <p>The ſame day we ſaw a <hi>Whale</hi> not far off from
our Ship, we put out four Boats from on board
after him, but this labour was alſo in vain, for
he run under water, and ſaw him no more.</p>
               <p>On the 19th we had a dull Sun-ſhine, the
wind was North, and it was ſo calm that we
could hardly feel it; we rowed in the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat
to the Ice, and killed two <hi>Sea-hounds</hi> or
<hi>Seales;</hi> there were ſo many of them on the Ice
that they could not be numbred.</p>
               <p>On the 20th it was exceeding cold, ſo that
the very Sea was all frozen over; yet it was
ſo calm and ſtill, that we could hardly perceive
the wind, which was North; there were nine
Ships in our Company which ſailed about the
Ice; we found ſtill the longer we ſailed the
bigger the Ice.</p>
               <p>On the 21th (which was the fourth Sunday
after <hi>Eaſter</hi>) we ſailed into the Ice in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
with another <hi>Hamburger</hi>-ſhip, called the
<hi>Le peler,</hi> with 8 <hi>Hollanders.</hi> We fixed our Ship
with Ice-hooks to a large Ice-field, when the
Sun was South-weſt and by ſouth; we num-bred

30 Ships in the Sea; they lay as it
were in an Harbour or Haven (as you may ſee
Plate <hi>A</hi> at <hi>B.</hi>) Thus they venture their Ships in
the Ice with great hazzard.</p>
               <p>On the 30th it was fair weather in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſnowy about noon, the wind was South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt
and very calm. We rowed in the great
Sloop, before the Ship, farther into the Ice. In
the morning we heard a <hi>Whale</hi> blow, when the
Sun was in the Eaſt, and brought the <hi>Whale</hi> to
the Ship, when the Sun was at South-weſt and
by eaſt; the ſame day we cut the Fat from it,
and filled with it 70 Barrels (which they call
Kardels.) By this fiſh we found abundance of
Birds, moſt of them were <hi>Mallemucks,</hi> (that is
to ſay fooliſh Gnats) which were ſo greedy of
their food, that we kill'd them with ſticks.
This fiſh was found out by the Birds, for we
ſaw every where by them in the Sea where the
Whale had been, for he was wounded by an
Harping Iron that ſtuck ſtill in his fleſh, and he
had alſo ſpent himſelf with hard ſwimming;
he blowed alſo very hollow, he ſtank alive, and
the birds fed upon him. This <hi>Whale</hi> fermented
when it was dead, and the ſteam that came
from it inflamed our eyes, and made them sore.
See Tab. <hi>A</hi> at <hi>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſame night <hi>Cornelius Seaman</hi> loſt his Ship
by the ſqueezing and cruſhing together of the
Ice, for in this place are very great Sheets or
Iſlands of Ice, and the Seamen call it <hi>Weſt-Ice,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it lieth towards the Weſt, as you may ſee
in the Plate <hi>B</hi> marked with <hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 2d of <hi>June</hi> we had a ſevere froſt in
the forenoon, and in the night we ſaw the
Moon very pale, as it uſed to look in the day
time in our Country, with clear Sun-ſhine,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52975:135"/>
whereupon followed miſt and ſnow, the wind
North-eaſt and by north.</p>
               <p>In the morning, <hi>June</hi> the 4th, we were a
hunting again after a <hi>Whale,</hi> and we came ſo
near unto one, that the Harponier was juſt a
going to fling his Harpoon into her, but ſhe
ſunk down behind, and held her head out of
the water, and ſo ſunk down like a ſtone (as
is to be ſeen by <hi>d</hi> on the cut <hi>A</hi>) and we ſaw
her no more; it was very like that the great
Ice-field was full of holes in the middle, ſo
that the <hi>Whale</hi> could fetch breath underneath
the Ice. A great many more Ships lay about
this ſheet of Ice, one hunted the <hi>Whales</hi> to the
other, and ſo they were frighted, and became
very ſhy. So one gets as many fiſhes as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſometimes they all get one. We were
there ſeveral times a hunting that very day, and
yet we got never a one.</p>
               <p>On the 8th it was foggy, and ſnowed all day;
we ſaw that day very many (<hi>Sea-dogs</hi> or) <hi>Seales</hi>
on the Ice about the Sea-ſide, ſo we ſet out a
Boat and killed 15 of them.</p>
               <p>On the 12th it was cold and ſtormy all day,
at night Sun-ſhine; he that takes not exact no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
knows no difference whether it by day or
night.</p>
               <p>On the 13th in the afternoon it was windy
and foggy, we were in 77 degrees; we ſailed
along by the Ice ſomewhat eaſterly towards
<hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> as is to be ſeen in the Cut <hi>A</hi> at <hi>e.</hi>
That night we ſaw more then 20 <hi>Whales</hi> that
run one after another towards the Ice; out of
them we got our ſecond fiſh, which was a
male one; and this fiſh, when they wounded
him with Lances, bled very much, ſo that the
Sea was tinged by it where he ſwam: we brought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52975:135"/>
him to the Ship when the Sun was in
the North: for the Sun is the Clock to the
Seamen in <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> for elſe they would live
without order, and miſtake in the uſual ſeven
weekly days.</p>
               <p>On the 14th it was cold and windy, the night
foggy, the wind blew Weſt, that day we came
to <hi>Hans Lichtenberg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We arrived at <hi>Spitzbergen, June</hi> the 14th.
Firſt we came to the <hi>Foreland</hi> thereof, then to
the ſeven <hi>Ice-hills</hi> or Mountains, then we paſſed
the Harbour or Bay of the <hi>Hamburgers, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalens,
Engliſh</hi> men and <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſailed into
the South-bay: we were followed by 7 Ships,
3 <hi>Hamburgers</hi> and 4 <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as is to be ſeen
by <hi>a</hi> in the Plate <hi>C.</hi> For here it is juſt the
ſame, as when they will ſail into the Ice, if
more then one is there, for no body cares to
be the firſt, becauſe they do not know in what
condition the Harbour or the Ice is within.
In our Voyage thither we ſaw no Ice at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
we came to <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> for the wind had
blown it all away; in the night we did cut off
the fat of the fiſh, and filled with it 65 Kardels
or Veſſels.</p>
               <p>That night we ſailed with three Boats into
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Harbour or Bay, and ſaw a <hi>Whale,</hi>
and flung into him three Harpoons, and threw
our Lances into him; the <hi>Whale</hi> run under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the ſmall Ice, and remained a great while
under water before he came up again, and then
ran but a very little way before he came up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
and this he repeated very often, ſo that
we were forced to wait on him above half an
hour, before he came from underneath the Ice.
The Harpoons broke out at length, and we loſt
him. On the Ice we ſaw two great <hi>Sea-horſes</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52975:136"/>
or <hi>Morſes,</hi> that were got upon the ſheet of Ice,
through a hole that was in it, and were aſleep;
we cut off their return by covering the hole
with a piece of Ice; then we awaken'd them
with our Lances, and they began to defend
themſelves for a while before they were killed.
We ſaw alſo many White-fiſh.</p>
               <p>On the 22th we had very fair weather, and
pretty warm; we were by <hi>Rehenfelt (Deersfeild)</hi>
where the Ice ſtood firm: we ſaw ſix <hi>Whales,</hi>
and got one of them that was a male, and our
third fiſh; he was kill'd at night when the Sun
ſtood weſtward: this fiſh was kill'd by one
man, who flung the Harpoon into him; and
kill'd him alſo, while the other Boats were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
in purſuing or hunting after another <hi>Whale.</hi>
This fiſh run to the Ice, and before he died,
beat about him with his tail; the Ice ſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him ſo that the other Boats could not
come to this Boat to aſſiſt him, till the Ice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
again, that they might row, when they
tied one Boat behind the other, and ſo towed
the <hi>Whale</hi> to the great Ship, where they cut him
up into the Veſſels, and filled with him 45 Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels.
This night the Sun ſhined very bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>On the 29th we had fair weather, Sun-ſhine
and calm. On the ſame day we ſailed before
the wide Harbour or Bay; where we found a
great quantity of the fat of a <hi>Whale,</hi> three Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
full, together with the Image of St. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
which ſtood behind a Ship that was loſt,
driving in the Sea. There was alſo here and
there ſtill much Ice.</p>
               <p>On the 1ſt of <hi>July</hi> about noon, two <hi>Whale</hi>
came near to our Ship; we ſaw that they had
a mind to couple together; we ſet our Boat
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52975:136"/>
for them, and the Harpoonier hit the female,
which when the other found, he did not ſtay
at all, but made away. The female run all
along above the water ſtraight forward, beating
about with her tail and fins, ſo that we durſt
not come near to lance her; yet one of our
Harpooniers was ſo fool hardy to venture too
near to the fiſh, which ſaluted him with a ſtroak
of her tail over his back ſo vehemently, that
he had much ado to recover his breath again.
Thoſe in the other Boat, to ſhew their valour
alſo, haſten'd to the fiſh, which overturned their
Boat, ſo that the Harpoonier was forced to
dive for it, and hide his head underneath the
water; the reſt did the ſame; they thought it
very long before they came out, for it was cold,
ſo that they came quaking to the Ship again.</p>
               <p>In the ſame morning a <hi>Whale</hi> appear'd near
our Ship before the wide Harbour, we put out
four Boats from our Ship after him, but two
<hi>Holland</hi> Ships were about half a League from
us, one of them ſent out a Boat towards us;
we uſed great diligence and care to take him,
but the fiſh came up juſt before the <hi>Dutchman</hi>'s
Boat, and was ſtruck by him with a Harpoon.
Thus he took the bread out of our mouths.</p>
               <p>On the 2d of <hi>July</hi> we had Sun-ſhine all day
and night long, and it was pretty warm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
about midnight we went a hunting, and
caught the fifth fiſh, who was a male; we cut
the fat off, and flung it into the Forecaſtle.
This is done when they are very buſie in <hi>Whale</hi>
catching, that they may not loſe time, then
they cut great pieces off of the <hi>Whale,</hi> that
they may have done the ſooner, for it doth
not harm the fat if it ſhould lie ſo for ſeveral
days; nay, ſome reckon it to be the better
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52975:137"/>
for it, but that cannot be, for the fat runs away
from it.</p>
               <p>On the 4th we had Sun-ſhine all day and
night. We ſtill were <hi>Whale-</hi> hunting, and that
night we got the ſixth fiſh, a male alſo, he held
49 <hi>Kardels</hi> of fat.</p>
               <p>On the 3d and 4th day of <hi>July</hi> we ſaw more
<hi>Whales</hi> than we did in all our Voyage.</p>
               <p>On the 5th of <hi>July</hi> in the forenoon it was
bright Sun-ſhine, and pretty warm, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
it was foggy, at night Sun-ſhine again,
which laſted all the night. We hunted all that
day long, and in the morning we ſtruck a
<hi>Whale</hi> before the <hi>Weigatt;</hi> this fiſh run round
about under the water, and ſo faſtned the Line
whereon our Harpoon was about a Rock, ſo
that the Harpoon loſt its hold, and that fiſh got
away. This <hi>Whale</hi> did blow the water ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that one might hear it at a Leagues di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>The ſame day about noon, the wind ſouth,
and Sun-ſhine, we got the ſeventh fiſh, which
was a female, and had 45 <hi>Kardels</hi> of fat; this
we cut alſo into the Hold, and ſo we ſailed
from <hi>Weigatt,</hi> a little toward the weſt before
the <hi>Muſcle-Harbour,</hi> where we dropped our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor;
we were employed with cutting the
great pieces of fat into leſſer pieces, to fill our
<hi>Kardels</hi> with them: in the mean while the
wind turned to North-weſt and weſt, and the
ſingle Anchor was dragg'd by the Ship, ſo we
dropped another, and would have weigh'd up
the former, but our Cable broke, the Anchor
being faſtned to a Rock.</p>
               <p>On the 6th we had the ſame weather, and
warm Sun-ſhine all night. Hard by us rode a
<hi>Hollander,</hi> and the Ships crew buſie in cutting
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52975:137"/>
the fat of a <hi>Whale,</hi> when the fiſh burſt with ſo
great a bounce, as if a Canon had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
and beſpattered the Workmen all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>On the 8th the wind turned North-weſt,
with ſnow and rain. We were forced to leave
one of our Anchors, and thank'd God for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off from Land, for the Ice came on fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon us; at night the wind was laid, and it
was colder, although the Sun ſhined.</p>
               <p>On the 9th we got another male <hi>Whale,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the eighth, which was yellow underneath
the head; we filled with him 54 <hi>Kardels</hi> with
fat; the Sun ſhined all night.</p>
               <p>On the 12th we had gloomy Sun-ſhine all
day. At night we ſailed with three Boats into
the Ice before the <hi>Weigatt,</hi> and got three white
Bears, an old one with two young ones, they
ſwam in the water like fiſh. On the Ice lay
abundance of <hi>Sea-horſes,</hi> and the further we
came into the Ice there were the more of them,
we rowed up to them, and when we came
near to them we killed ten of them, the reſt
came all about our Boat, and beat holes through
the ſides of the Boat, ſo that we took in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of water, we were forced at length
to row away from them becauſe of their great
number, for they gathered themſelves more
and more together; they purſued us as long as
we could ſee them, very furiouſly. Afterwards
we met with another very great one who lay
in the water faſt aſleep, but when he felt our
Harpoon within him he was very much fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ran away before the Boat again, where
he was ſoon eaſed of his fright by our Lances.
We ſaw but very few <hi>Whales</hi> more, and thoſe
we did ſee were quite wild, that we could not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52975:138"/>
come near them. That night it was ſo dark
and foggy, that we could hardly ſee the Ships
length; we might have got <hi>Sea-horſes</hi> enough,
but we were afraid of looſing our Ships, for
we had examples enough of them that had loſt
their Ships, and could not come to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
but have been forced to return home
in other Ships. When after this manner any
have loſt their Ships, and cannot be ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
diſcharge a Cannon from the Ship, or ſound
the Trumpets, or Haut-boys, according as they
are provided in their Ships, that the men that
are loſt may find their Ship again.</p>
               <p>On the 13th we had cloudy Sun-ſhine, the
wind towards night turned to North-eaſt and
by eaſt. The Ice came a floating down apace,
we ſailed from the South-eaſt Land to the weſt,
and we could but juſt get through by the North
ſide from the <hi>Bear-Harbour</hi> or Bay. We ſailed
on to the <hi>Rehenfelt</hi> (or <hi>Deer-field)</hi> where the Ice
was already fixed to the Land, ſo that we
could but juſt get through; we ſailed further
to the <hi>Vogelſanck (Birds-ſong)</hi> as you may ſee by
<hi>b</hi> in the Plate <hi>D.</hi> Then we turned toward
the Eaſt with a North-eaſt wind, in company
with twelve Ships more, to ſee whether there
were any more <hi>Whales</hi> left, with <hi>George</hi> and
<hi>Cornelius Mangelſen,</hi> and <hi>Michael Appel,</hi> who ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in four fathoms water, and touched upon
the wreck of a Ship that was loſt there.</p>
               <p>On the 14th in the morning we ſailed ſtill
amongſt the Ice, the wind being North-eaſt
and by eaſt; we had a fogg all that day, with
Sun-ſhine, with a Rainbow of two colours,
white and pale yellow, and it was very cold,
and we ſaw the Sun a great deal lower.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52975:138"/>
On the 15th it was windy, cold, and foggy
the whole day; the wind turned North-weſt,
and the Ice came on in abundance, ſo that
we could hardly ſail, for it was every where
full of ſmall ſheets of Ice. At this time there
were many ſhips beſet with Ice, in the <hi>Deer</hi> or
<hi>Muſcle-Bay.</hi> We ſailed all along near the ſhoar,
and at night we entred the <hi>South-Harbour</hi>
(marked with <hi>c</hi> in the Cut <hi>D</hi>) where 28 Ships
lay at Anchor, 8 whereof were <hi>Hamburgers,</hi>
the reſt <hi>Dutchmen.</hi> From that time, when we
ſailed out of the <hi>South-haven,</hi> we kept always
within ſight of the Land, and ſaw it always,
except it was foggy; and ſo long the Skippers
ſtay by the Ice, to ſee whether there is any
more <hi>Whales</hi> to be had. That night we fetched
water from the Land, near the <hi>Cookery</hi> of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingen,</hi>
out of a hole, marked by <hi>b</hi> in the
Plate <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 16th in the morning we ſaw the
Moon, and afterwards it was windy, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of ſnow.</p>
               <p>On the 18th we had fair weather, with Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine,
and we were alſo becalmed that we could
not ſail, wherefore we towed with a Boat into
the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Harbour, to gather ſome Herbs from
the Rocks. In the <hi>South-Haven</hi> rode 30 Ships
at Anchor.</p>
               <p>On the 19th we had warm Sun-ſhine and fair
weather, but in the night ſtormy and rain.</p>
               <p>On the 20th ſtorms, rain, and a great deal
of ſnow, the wind South-weſt.</p>
               <p>On the 21th rain all day long.

when the Sun was North-eaſt,
we waied our Anchors, and ſailed out

               <p>On the 24th it was ſo warm with Sun-ſhine,

changed our Courſe ſouthwards, and ſtood
South-eaſt.</p>

               <p>On the 9th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> it was windy all day,

we ſailed South-weſtward all along the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern

               <p>On the 13th, being <hi>Sunday</hi> in the morning,

year; but how far this Country is extended to
the North, is ſtill unknown.</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth, becauſe the Ice ſtands firm, and
floats not, as that in the Sea doth, that there
ſhould be land not far behind it.</p>
               <p>As the higheſt Countries are ſurrounded with
Mountains, as a Fortification is with Walls and
Works, ſo are theſe Countries naturally ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with high Hills.</p>
               <p>The inward Condition of this Country
we do not know, but it ſeemeth, ſince we ſee
one Hill behind another, that it is ſo throughout
the whole Country.</p>
               <p>At the <hi>Muſcle-Haven,</hi> or <hi>Muſcle-Bay,</hi> we find
plainer and leveller Ground; and the farther
we ſail toward the Eaſt, the Ground groweth
the lower, yet it is all ſtony, and with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
of ſmaller Hills; it doth not look at all
as if it could be inhabited by Men.</p>
               <p>I believe alſo that the Land there muſt of
neceſſity be lower and lower; for elſe we ſhould
ſee it higher above the other, as we do the other
Mountains.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Beaſts that live on this Land,
I believe they come over the Ice in the Spring,
when the Ice ſtands firm, into theſe Countries,
and that the ſame way they go away from
thence again, when the long nights begin.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Birds, we have partly a

is known, as I ſhall mention when I come to

like fire, and the tops of them were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
foggs; the ſnow was marbel'd, and look'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52975:144"/>
as if it were boughs of branches of Trees, and
gave as bright and glorious a ſhining of gloſs to
the Air or Skies, as if the Sun had ſhin'd.</p>
               <p>When the Mountains look thus fiery, a hard
ſtorm generally enſues.</p>
               <p>Theſe Countries are in the Winter encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
with Ice from divers places, according
as the winds blow; as if it be Eaſt from <hi>Nova
Zembla,</hi> if North-weſt form <hi>Greenland,</hi> and the
Iſland of <hi>John Mayen:</hi> it alſo happeneth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that the Land is begirt with Ice in the
Summer, as they have often ſeen, that go thither
every year.</p>
               <p>But when the Ice comes floating on too
hard, or in too great a quantity, then the Ships
make to the Harbours, Havens, Bays or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
as they call them, that run up into the
Country; the wind uſeth to receive us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unkindly, when we ſail into them, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the dry Hills with ſmall Whirl-winds.
The water in theſe Rivers is ſalt.</p>
               <p>We meet here with no freſh Streams or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volets;
nor did I ever ſee a Spring there.</p>
               <p>Of ſome Rivers we know their beginning,
of others it cannot found out, becauſe of
the danger of the Ice, which they are never
free from; ſome becauſe of the hidden Rocks
underneath the water, which are diſcovered
by the vehement breaking of the Sea, or by
great quantity of white foam.</p>
               <p>The Names of the Havens you find all in
order one after another in the Map of <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>
as far as we have been.</p>
               <p>Theſe Havens they reckon to be the ſafeſt,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Safe-Harbour,</hi> and the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>North-Bay,</hi>
which are the moſt known of any in
<hi>Spitzbergen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52975:144"/>
The other Havens, of what names ſoever,
we commonly ſail by, becauſe they lye open
to the Sea.</p>
               <p>Others we paſs by becauſe of the conſtant
Ice that is in them, and the hidden Rocks.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>North-Haven</hi> or <hi>Bay,</hi> ride com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the moſt Ships; I told ſeveral times ten,
twenty, nay thirty Ships, that lay at Anchor,
as your may ſee in the Plates <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> marked
with <hi>c</hi> and <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Birds, we ſee abundance
more of them by and on the Land, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Ice, chiefly when they hatch their
Eggs; we do not find they make their Neſt up
with far-fetcht things, neither do they gather
any thing for them from <hi>Norway, Schetland,</hi> or
the like.</p>
               <p>The Seeds of ſeveral Herbs might grow in
<hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> but the Herbs nature hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on thoſe Countries are ſuch as are fit for
the Diſeaſes and Diſtempers that are common
there.</p>
               <p>We ſaw abundance of <hi>Sea-horſes</hi> by <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>
on the low Land, and upon the Ice;
but we ſaw but very few <hi>Seales</hi> on the Ice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.</p>
               <p>The Country (as is aforeſaid) is ſtony, and
quite throughout it are high Mountains and
Rocks.</p>
               <p>Below, at the feet of the Mountains, ſtand
the Hills of Ice very high, and reach to the
tops of the Mountains; the Cliffs are filled up
with Snow; wherefore theſe Snow-Mountains
ſhow very ſtrange to thoſe that never ſaw them
before, they appear like dry Trees with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Twigs, and when the Snow falleth
upon them they get Leaves as it were, which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52975:145"/>
ſoon after melt, and others come in the room
of them.</p>
               <p>There are ſeven large Ice-Mountains in a
Line in theſe Countries, that lye between the
high Rocks, which look of a glorious blew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
as alſo is the Ice, with a great many
cracks and Holes in them; they are hollowed
out, melted away, and cut in Groves by the
rain and ſnow-water that runs down; they are
increaſed greatly by the Snow, as the other Ice
that ſwimmeth in the Sea is alſo: they are aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
likewiſe by the melted Snow from the
Rocks, and from the Rain that falls on them.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeven Mountains of Ice are eſteemed
to be the higheſt in the Country; indeed they
ſhewed very high as we ſailed by them, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath:
the Snow look'd dark from the ſhades
of the Skies, which ſhewed very neat and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
with the blew cracks where the Ice was
broken off.</p>
               <p>About the middle of the Mountains ſome
foggy Clouds hovered over; above theſe the
Snow was very bright.</p>
               <p>The true Rocks look't fiery, and the Sun
ſhin'd pale upon them, the Snow giving the
Air a bright reflection. They were covered
with Clouds, ſo that you could ſcarce ſee the
tops of them.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe Rocks are but one ſtone from
the bottom to the top, appearing like an old
decayed Wall; they ſmell very ſweet, as the
green Fields do in our Country in the Spring
when it rains. See <hi>c c</hi> in the Plate <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtones for the moſt part are vein'd dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
like Marble, with red, white, and
yellow: at the alteration of the weather the
ſtones ſweat, and by that means the Snow is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52975:145"/>
ſtained or coloured; and alſo if it raineth much,
the water runs down by the Rocks, and from
thence the Snow is tinged red.</p>
               <p>On the foot of the Mountains, where no
mounts of Ice ſtand, lye great looſe Rocks, as
they chance to be fall'n one upon the other,
with Caves and Holes, ſo that it is very tickliſh
walking upon them; both great and ſmall
Stones or Rocks are mixt together: theſe ſtones
are of a grey colour, or grey with black veins,
they gliſter like Silver-oar. Most of the Rocks
that are at the bottom of the Mounts are like
the Pebles we pave our Streets withal. On theſe
Rocks grow all ſorts of Herbs, Graves, and
Moſs very plentifully; they grow up in the
two Months of <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> from the ſeed to
bear ſeed again. Look <hi>f</hi> in the Plate <hi>C.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Herbs grow thickeſt where that water
runs of falls down from the Hills, (and alſo
where they are defended from the North and
Eaſt winds) from whence always ſome Duſt
or Moſs is carried down with it, which after
a long time becomes Earth (yet it is rather
dung than a true earth) and the Birds do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
by their dung towards it.</p>
               <p>Theſe Mountains ſeem as if they were Earth
at top by reaſon of the height, but when you
are at the top of them, they are Rock as well
at the top as the bottom, which we alſo ſee,
when great pieces of them fall down. If ſtones
are flung down from theſe Mountains, it ſounds
as if it thundred with an Echo and Rattling
in the Valleys, as if very great pieces were
thrown off from the top of them.</p>
               <p>The Mountains alſo are full of cracks wherein
the Birds make their Neſts; they all fly down
from the Mountains to ſeek their food in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52975:146"/>
water; ſome eat the Carrion of Fiſhes, others
eat ſmall Fiſhes and Shrimps, as I ſhall ſay, when
I treat of the Birds.</p>
               <p>There are alſo White-Bears, Deer and Foxes
in theſe Countries. The Bear liveth upon dead
Whales or dead Men; the Fox feeds upon Birds
and their Eggs; and the Deer eat the Herbs.</p>
               <p>One may conjecture at the height of theſe
Mountains by this, when ths Skies are not very
clear, the Mountains ſtand, to about the middle,
in the Clouds; ſome of them look as if they
were a coming down every moment, as in the
Plate <hi>D</hi> at <hi>f.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why the lowermoſt Hills do not
ſeem ſo high, is becauſe ſo very great ones ſtand
near them. A Ship with its Maſts and Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
in no more to be compared with theſe
Mountains, than a ſmall Houſe with a high
Steeple. The Miles ſeem alſo to be very ſhort,
but when you go to walk them upon the Land,
you find it quite another thing, and you will
ſoon be tired; and alſo because of the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſharpneſs of the Rocks, and for want
of a path, you will ſoon get warm be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo cold: a new pair of Shoes will not laſt
one long here.</p>
               <p>We went in the night, when it was a very
clear Sun-ſhine, upon one of the Rocks near
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Haven, about a Mile long, to look
after a <hi>Whale</hi> that had got away from us; in
the middle of this Harbour others were a row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Long-Boats, which we could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcern: a great part fell down from one of
theſe Mountains, which ſounded very loud.
The Mountains look'd black, ſtrip'd with veins
of Snow. I was ſo calm that we could hardly
perceive any breeze of wind, and not very
<pb facs="tcp:52975:146"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52975:147"/>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52975:148"/>
cold. The ſhoar was very full of <hi>Sea-horſes,</hi> which
roared ſo that we could hear them a great way
off, as if ſome Bulls had bellowed.</p>
               <p>In the Country we travel thus; We take
along with us two or more Guns and Lances,
to reſiſt the Highway-men the Bears, but one
is ſoon tired, as I ſaid before, becauſe of the
ſtones and the looſe Ice, whereon it is very
troubleſome to walk.</p>
               <p>As many as I have ſeen of theſe Mountains
are ſituated thus; The higheſt are from the
<hi>Foreland</hi> to the <hi>Muſcle-Haven</hi> (or <hi>Muſcle Bay:</hi>)
after the <hi>Foreland</hi> follow the ſeven Ice Mounts,
which are very high Mountains; and they are
called ſo from the Ice-Hills that fill up the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
of lye between the Rocks. Theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
Rocks are not ſo ſharp or pointed at the
top as the two foremoſt Rocks at the <hi>Haven</hi> of
<hi>Magdalen</hi> are. Then cometh the <hi>Haven</hi> of
the <hi>Hamburgers, Magdalen,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Daniſh</hi> Harbour, and at laſt the <hi>South-Haven.</hi>
At the <hi>Magdalen-Haven</hi> the Rocks lye in a
round of ſemi-circle, at each ſide by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſtand two high Mountains that are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
within, as if they were dug out: after the
faſhion of a Breaſt-work, with points and
cracks at the top, like Battlements; at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
within the Hill, ſtands a Snow-hill that
doth reach to the very top of the Mountain,
like a Tree with branches and twigs; the other
Rocks look rudely.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>South<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>Haven</hi> the Ships ride at Anchor
between high Mountains; on the left as we
ſail into it, is a Hill called the <hi>Beehive</hi> in the
Cut <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> marked with <hi>g;</hi> called ſo from
its reſemblance of a <hi>Beehive:</hi> cloſe to it lieth a
large and high Mount, called the <hi>Devils Huck,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52975:149"/>
commonly covered with a fogg, and if the wind
bloweth over it, it darkneth the Haven, and
ſeemeth as if it ſmoaked, filling the Haven
therewith; on the top thereof are three
ſmall white Hills covered with Snow, in the
Cut <hi>C</hi> and <hi>D,</hi> marked with <hi>h;</hi> two of them
ſtand near to one another. In the middle of
this Harbour is an Iſland in the Cut <hi>C</hi> marked
with <hi>i,</hi> which is called the <hi>Dead-man's Iſland,</hi>
becauſe they bury the dead men there after this
manner; They are put into a Coffin, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a heap of large ſtones, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all this, they are ſometimes eaten
by the white Bears.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen no other ſort of Ground but
great ſtones at <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> ſo that the froſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
penetrate far into ſuch Ground. I admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Snow was at that time all melted
away, and in the Cliffs between the great
Rocks was no more Snow to be ſeen, although
the holes were very deep. I fancy that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of rain had fallen in the Spring, and that
the weather had been tolerable, or elſe we muſt
have ſeen more Snow there.</p>
               <p>There are alſo more ſmall Iſlands here and
there in this Harbour, that have no particular
names, but are called <hi>Birds Iſlands,</hi> becauſe we
gather thereupon the Eggs of Mountain <hi>Ducks</hi>
and <hi>Kirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Then you come to <hi>Schmeremburg,</hi> ſo named
from <hi>Schmer,</hi> which ſignifieth greaſe; there
are ſtill Houſes ſtanding, formerly built by the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> where they uſed to boil their Train-Oil.
Some <hi>Dutchmen</hi> once attempted to ſtay there
all the Winter, but they all periſht: in the Cut
<hi>C</hi> it is marked with <hi>k.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52975:149"/>
It is obſervable that a dead Carkaſe doth not
eaſily rot or conſume; for it has been found,
that a man buried ten years before, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in his perfect ſhape and dreſs; and they
could ſee by the Croſs that was ſtuck upon his
Grave, how long he had been buried.</p>
               <p>Theſe Houſes are now from year to year
deſtroyed and burnt.</p>
               <p>This year were yet ſtanding ſeveral Houſes,
like a little Village, ſome where of were then
burnt.</p>
               <p>Over-againſt <hi>Schmerenburg</hi> were alſo ſeveral
Houſes ſtanding, and a Kettle or Boyler; they
call that place the <hi>Cookery of Harlem.</hi> This year
four Houſes remained, whereof two were
Ware-houſes, in the others they dwelt. They
are built after this faſhion, not very large; there
is a Stove before with a Ceiling at top, and
behind a Chamber taking in the whole breadth
of the Houſe: the Ware-houſes are ſomething
larger; therein were ſtill ſeveral Barrels or
Kardels that were quite decayed, the Ice ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſame ſhape the Veſſels had been of.
An Anvile, Smith's Tongs, and other Tools
belonging to the <hi>Cookery,</hi> were frozen up in the
Ice. The kettle was ſtill ſtanding as it was
ſet, and the wooden Troughs ſtood by it.
From thence you may go to the <hi>Engliſh Haven;</hi>
on the other ſide is the place where the dead
are buried; this is ſomething even, like earth,
but it is levelled on purpoſe. Behind theſe
Houſes are high Mountains; if one climbeth
upon theſe, as we do on others, and doth not
mark every ſtep with Chalk, one doth not
know how to get down again. When you go
up, you think it to be very eaſie to be done;
but when you are to deſcend, it is very difficult
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52975:150"/>
and dangerous, ſo that many have fallen and
loſt their lives.</p>
               <p>The River there is called the <hi>South Harbour,</hi>
or <hi>Bay;</hi> and if the Ships ſuffer any damage at
Sea, they refit there.</p>
               <p>At the entry into the <hi>South Harbour,</hi> in the
Valley between the Mountains, is collected
great quantities of freſh Water from the Snow
and Rain, upon the ſhoar ſtand abundance of
Kardels or Barrels; we uſed this Water for our
Victuals, and other occaſions: it is alſo found
in the Clifts of the Icy-hills on ſhoar; but true
Springs out of the Ground I never ſaw in <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſhoar there is not very high, but the
water is deep, there was no Ice at all to be ſeen
in it, from whence I conclude that it had not
been a ſevere Winter; for it is impoſſible that
the Ice could have been melted in ſo ſhort a
time, not only here, but alſo in the <hi>Engliſh Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
or <hi>Bay,</hi> where the Ice ſtood firm ſtill, and
hardly lay above half a Fathom under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Ice doth melt much ſooner in Salt-water
than in freſh River-water, but yet it is
impoſſible that ſo thick Ice could have melted
in ſo ſhort a time. We ſaw alſo that the Snow
melted on the tops of the high Rocks, and the
water ran down, although it was there much
colder then below; yet above and below it
melted alike: differently from what I obſerved
ſince in <hi>Spain</hi> in the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1672.
the wind being North-weſt, when the Rain
fell below about a quarter of a League, yet
above it the Mountains were all covered with
Snow, all in the ſtreight Line, one not higher
than the other, as if they had been levell'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52975:150"/>
In the <hi>Northern Haven</hi> or <hi>Bay,</hi> lyeth a very
large Mountain, flat at top; this Iſland is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Birds Song,</hi> from the great number of
them that build and hatch there; for when
they fly up, they make ſo great a noiſe, that
one can hardly hear his own words: This is
marked with <hi>b</hi> in the Cut <hi>D.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide theſe there are more <hi>Iſlands</hi> named in
the Map, as the <hi>Clifted Rock,</hi> and ſuch other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rehenfeld</hi> is a low Land, and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſo from the Deer commonly ſeen there.</p>
               <p>I was informed that it is all Slats, that ſtand
up edgewiſe, ſo that it is very troubleſome to
go on, it is all over-grown with Moſs. There
is a Hill upon it that looketh like fire.</p>
               <p>Behind the <hi>Rehenfeld</hi> are high Mountains
again, they are not pointed at top, they lye
as it were in a Line; by the <hi>Rehenfeld</hi> runs up a
River into the Country, and is called the
<hi>Halfmoon-Bay,</hi> from its ſhape. On the other
ſide of the River is a Mountain, flat at the top,
and full of cracks all filled up with Snow. Then
cometh the <hi>Liefde-Bay (Bay</hi> of <hi>Love)</hi> where
two Hills ſtand together very like unto
<hi>Spitzbergen</hi> at <hi>Magdalens Bay,</hi> and thoſe two
Harbours are very much like one another.</p>
               <p>Then we come to lower Ground behind the
<hi>Muſcle Harbour,</hi> where the Graſs was ſo high,
that it covered our ankles, as far as we went.</p>
               <p>Next is the <hi>Weihgatt,</hi> or the <hi>Straights of Hindelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</hi>
The <hi>Weihgatt</hi> is called ſo from the Winds, (for
<hi>weihen</hi> ſignifieth blowing) becauſe a very ſtrong
South-wind bloweth out of it. On the <hi>Bear-Haven,</hi>
upon the Land, are all red ſtones.</p>
               <p>Behind the <hi>Weihg att</hi> followeth the<hi>South-weſt
Land,</hi> which is alſo low; it ſeemeth as if it was
adorned with ſmall Hills: then follow the ſeven
<hi>Iſlands</hi> which we could ſee.</p>

We ſaw no Ships go any farther, neither
could I underſtand that ever any Ships did go
farther, nor can they go ſo far every year to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Eaſt, becauſe of the danger of the
Ice that ſwimmeth, and is brought from thence
by the wind and ſtream.</p>
               <p>In <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> is the beſt fiſhing in the Ice

In <hi>July</hi> and <hi>August</hi> the <hi>Whales</hi> run
Eaſtward by <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> we ſaw at the latter

looking like Marble. This breaking and foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Waves is ſucceſſively repeated.</p>
               <p>So the ſwelling Waves continually follow one
another, moving before the wind with a quick
motion, but when theſe Waves are ſhort, they
daſh over the Ship, and break much, ſo that the
Ship is hardly able to live.</p>
               <p>In ſtormy weather little Waves curle on the
top of the great ones, and leſſer again upon
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52975:152"/>
The Ships do not feel theſe ſmaller Waves but
only the great ones, that are called Sea-Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
which heave and mount the Ship with
them, but nevertheleſs ſhe always keeps her
ſtrait way through theſe unpathed Waves, which
is wonderful to behold.</p>
               <p>In a hard ſtorm the froth of the Sea drives
like duſt, and looketh as when the wind driveth
the Snow along upon the Ice, or as the Duſt of
the Earth does in dry weather, and you ſee the
Sea every where to look like curled Ice, that
when it is a freezing is hindred from it by the
wind, all covered with a white foam, and one
Wave blows over the precedent, with a great
roaring and noiſe, as if a Water-mill were a
going; and this ſame noiſe the Ships make
likewiſe when they cut through the Sea.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, that the Waves daſh
againſt one another when the wind changeth,
and croſs over through one another, with
great daſhing over the Ships, before they move
all one and the ſame way.</p>
               <p>I did not obſerve here the Seawater ſo clear,
nor found it ſo ſalt as near the Ice; it may be
by reaſon of the ſhallow ground or bottom,
and the many freſh Rivers that run into it; or
becauſe the Froſt cleareth the water more.</p>
               <p>Concerning the manner of their Sailing; they
ſail and change their Ways and Sails according
as they think fit. If there be a freſh Gale, they
make uſe of all their Sails; if a ſtorm, with the
two lowermoſt Sails, whereof they call the firſt
the <hi>Fock</hi> or <hi>Fore-ſail,</hi> the middlemoſt <hi>Schumfer</hi> or
<hi>Main-ſail,</hi> and the third the <hi>Baſan</hi> or <hi>Mizen-ſail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52975:152"/>
In hard ſtorms they furl the fore Sail, and
ſail only with the Main-Sail and the <hi>Mizen-ſail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the greateſt ſtorm of all, with theſe Sails
reefed or half tied in, as they call it, or with
the Mizen-ſail half furled up; this they do
becauſe the Ship goeth the ſtedier by reaſon
of the wind, for elſe it would rowle too much
up and down in the Sea, and the water would
daſh in too much on the ſides thereof.</p>
               <p>One man ſtands always at the Helm to ſteer
the Ship, but in hard weather ten men can
hardly hold the Helm, wherefore they faſten
it with a Tackle, and ſo let it go too and fro,
as the Compaſs directs them.</p>
               <p>In and after a ſtorm we have oftentimes
ſtrangers come to viſit us in our Ships, <hi>viz.
Blackbirds, Starlings,</hi> and all ſorts of ſmall Birds,
that have loſt their way in a ſtorm from the and,
and fly to the Ships to ſave themſelves, and
prolong their lives, when others fly about till
they are ſpent, and then fall into the Sea, and
are drowned.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lumbs,</hi> and other Water-fowl, come not
near us; which I mention on purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the erroneons Opinion of ſome, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the before-mentioned Birds come to
the Ships as Meſſengers, to bring the ill news
of bad weather.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, theſe following ſigns or
marks commonly fore-tell a ſtorm or hard
weather, when great fiſh come near to the
Ships in great numbers, when they play, dance,
rowl about, and leap out of the water, which
is not always playing in them, but rather their
Bodies are afflicted with ſome pain or other.
We ſaw ſeveral <hi>Whales</hi> in the Sea, that threw
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52975:153"/>
themſelves about as if they were ſick, or a
dying.</p>
               <p>When the Sea is tempeſtuous, it is not to
be thought that it doth proceed from the Sea
only, but a hard and tempeſtuous ſtorm and
wind followeth upon it, that ſendeth the Waves
like Meſſengers before it, until it arriveth it
ſelf with a tempeſt; but this is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of the North-ſea, but only of the
Sea betwixt <hi>Hitland</hi> and <hi>Spitzbergen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Air is ſo diſpoſed, as the Stars do
not only look bigger, but as if they were more
in number alſo, it is a great Prognoſtication,
and often proveth true alſo; It is a ſign that
the Air is full of Miſt, which cauſeth upon
changing of the Froſt, great foggs, and a high
wind follows ſoon after.</p>
               <p>At night, when the Sea daſheth very much,
it ſhines like fire, the Sea-men call it burning:
This ſhining is a very bright glance, like unto
the luſtre of a Diamond.</p>
               <p>But when the Sea ſhines vehemently in a
dark night, and burns; a South or Weſt-wind
followeth after it.</p>
               <p>At the ſtern of the Ship, where the water is
cut through, you ſee at night deep under
water, bubbles riſe and break, then this ſhining
or luſtre is not there.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have diſcourſed of the North-ſea,
but next of the Waves between <hi>Hitland</hi> and
<hi>Spitzbergen;</hi> near <hi>Hitland</hi> the ſtream runneth
very ſwift toward the North, and it grows daily
colder.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that here the Waves of
the Sea run longer, almoſt as they do before
the narrow Channel between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh Sea,</hi> (and what hath been
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52975:153"/>
obſerved heretofore of the rowling and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Sea belongeth properly to this)
with a continual toſſing of the Ships, which
maketh the men Sea-ſick.</p>
               <p>The vomiting and ſickneſs is attributed to
the Sea-water; but it really proceedeth from
the great and continual motion of the Body,
when oftentimes we are forced to creep on all
four.</p>
               <p>Neither Meat nor Drink taſts well, the head
akes and is giddy, and they are always reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to vomit. Coſtiveneſs of the Body doth
generally accompany this Diſtemper, and the
Urine is highly tinged. I reckon it no more
then if one is not uſed to ride in Coaches or
Waggons; only that it is always accompanied
with a bad ſtomach and reſtleſneſs.</p>
               <p>The beſt Remedies for this Diſtemper, I
believe, are Aromaticks chewed in ones mouth,
as Cinamon, Cloves, Galengal, Ginger, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs,
and the like. Many think to drive this
Diſtemper away with faſting, but they will
find themſelves miſtaken. Some drink Sea-water,
and believe that will make them vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
which notwithſtanding is not occaſioned
by the Sea-water, but by the loathſomneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>To take away the ill taſte out of ones
mouth, in my opinion, the beſt means is to
eat and drink plentifully, it eaſeth quickly;
neither ought one to ſleep too much, but keep
in the Air, and look into the Wind, and to
walk up and down in the Ship, is alſo very
proper.</p>
               <p>But now let us return to the Waves again,
they riſe, although it be not windy, as high
as Mountains, very ſmooth, and run away as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52975:154"/>
far as one can diſcern them, which is to be
underſtood when the Sea is turbulent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
quickly a hard Gale of wind followeth.
In a ſtorm the Waves run after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as is juſt now ſaid, but with many curl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and foaming whirls, as is deſcribed in the
ſtorm of the North-ſea. Theſe Waves run a
great way, ſo that you may ſee between them
at a great diſtance.</p>
               <p>If any Ships be in your Company, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you cannot ſee them.</p>
               <p>There Waves are a great deal larger then in
the North-ſea, and have alſo greater power
when they fall over, but do not daſh ſo eaſily
over the Ships as they do in the North-ſea.
The Waves in the North-ſea are preſently lay'd
after a ſtorm, but the commotion of theſe laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
often to the third day; if it be never ſo
calm, the Ships are moved very violently,
that you cannot walk, ſit, or lie; it is beſt
to keep in the middle of the Ship, for before
and behind the Sea beats hard againſt them.
The Sails are driven againſt the Maſts, and
have no ſteadineſs from the wind. If in a brisk
Gale of a full wind the Sails are all full and
round, the Ship ſails beſt upon the Sea.</p>
               <p>There is as great difference in Ships, as to
ſailing, as there is in Horſes, concerning
eaſineſs and ſwiftneſs; the motion of the
Ships is therefore different; the ſtilneſs
and quietneſs, when nothing is tumbled up
and down in the Ship, furthereth alſo ſailing
very much.</p>
               <p>The Ships ſwim ſomething higher in the
Sea then they do in Freſh-water; for there is
almoſt a foot difference in a ship with the ſame
loading. 'Tis generally agreed upon, that one
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52975:154"/>
may ſee a Ship in a calm Sea three, or three
and a half <hi>German</hi> Miles off, and beyond that
diſtance the Sea loſeth it ſelf in the Air, and
the Air in the Sea. If a Ship ſaileth on the
main Sea at one and half <hi>German</hi> Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
you have loſt the ſight of half the
Ship; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t two Miles you ſee only the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Maſt, at three Miles diſtance you ſee
only the Flagg, and when it goeth farther, you
have quite loſt it.</p>
               <p>Land and Mountains may be ſeen at a great
diſtance at Sea; we ſaw <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> at twelve
Miles diſtance off at Sea; the Country looked
like a black Cloud full of white ſtroaks, as is in
the Cut <hi>D</hi> marked with<hi>a, b, c, g, h, i.</hi> Near
the Ice of this Sea it is coldeſt where the Waves
are quiet; and the Sea-water is ſo clear, that
at twelve and more Fathoms deep you may
ſee the bottom. There is no ground to be
found near the Ice to drop an Anchor.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, that according
to the colour of the Skies, the colour of
the Sea is changed. If the Skies be clear,
the sea looks as blew as a Saphir; if it
is covered ſomewhat with Clouds, the Sea
is as green as an Emerald; if there be a fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
Sun-ſhine, it looketh yellow; if it be
quite dark, like unto the colour of <hi>Indico;</hi> in
ſtormy and cloudy weather, like black Sope,
or exactly like unto the colour of black Lead.</p>
               <p>If the wind be quite calm, one may hear
beating or knocking at a great diſtance on the
the Sea, by which we alſo obſerve the <hi>Whale</hi>
hears, as ſhall be mentioned in its proper
place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52975:155"/>
Among the Ice the ſtream runs South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
which we obſerved by our driving
back a great way. At the <hi>Muſcle-Haven</hi> the
ſtream ran Northwards. Thoſe that ſail year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to thoſe places, cannot give any certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
concerning ebbing and flowing;
only they have obſerved the water to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
about the Land, when the winds have
been higher then at other times. And this I
have alſo obſerved, that if there was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
or continual ebbing and flowing, the
Eggs of the Birds would be drowned upon
the Iſlands.</p>
               <p>Certain information, concerning ebbing
and flowing, is not eaſily to be had, I know
no more of it then what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>

               <p>IN the Months of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> the weſt

               <p>The difference between the Ice of <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>

not ſmooth there, ſo as to ſlide upon it.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52975:156"/>
Tables, Chappels, and all ſort of Beaſts.</p>
               <p>These Ice-fields are a great deal deeper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water, then they are high above it, and
are of a paler colour under water then above;
the top of them might be called the Kernel
and Marrow of the Ice, becauſe the colour is
much deeper then that of the other.</p>
               <p>The higheſt colour is delicate blew, of the
ſame colour with the bleweſt Vitriol, ſomewhat
more tranſparent, yet not ſo clear as that in
our Country, which you may ſee through, let
it be never ſo thick; it is as hard as a ſtone, and
it is not eaſily ſplit or cleav'd, becauſe it is
ſpumgy, like unto a Punice ſtone. Among
this Ice the Ships ſail up and down, until they
come to bigger Ice fields, for the ſmall ones
incumber the Sea, that the Ships ſail often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them and periſh; for when the winds
ariſe the Waves drive againſt the Ice-fields, as
if it was againſt Rocks, and beat the Ships to
pieces.</p>
               <p>When we are paſſed by theſe ſmall Ice-fields
that ſwim at a great diſtance from one
another, then we ſail in between them, and
draw a ſmall Ice-field behind the ſtern of our
Ship, that it may be the ſooner ſtopt, and
kept from ſwift ſailing, without letting the
Sails ſtrike, for elſe it might eaſily run againſt
an Ice-field. Every Ships Maſter is left to his
free-will, whether he will ſail into the Ice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in the Spring the <hi>Whales</hi> are in great
numbers ſeen there in the <hi>Weſt-Ice,</hi> as they call
it.</p>
               <p>The Maſters do not willingly ſail in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Ice, when it is dark, or foggy, or
ſtormy, which muſt be expected in the Spring,
and the ſmall ſheets of Ice ſwim up and down
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52975:156"/>
in the Sea, which the Skippers muſt avoid,
leſt they loſe their Ships.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem ſomething ſtrange, that they
ſail ſo often to the Ice and back again but there
is the ſame reaſon for it as is in hunting after
Deer, if we do not find Whales in one place,
we muſt ſeek them in others; for the fortune
in ketching of <hi>Whales</hi> is like the Chances of
Gaming, and there is no great underſtanding
required to find them: ſome ſee and catch
more then they deſire, and others but at half
a mile diſtant from them, ſee not one, which is
very common.</p>
               <p>When they go in amongſt the Ice, the
men ſtand ready with great Ice-hooks to keep
them off, that the Ship may not run againſt
them.</p>
               <p>The farther you ſail into, and amongſt the
Ice, the greater Ice-fields you ſhall foe, ſo that
you cannot look over them; for about the
Weſt, as they call it, are larger Ice-fields to be
ſeen then about <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> quite white at the
top, covered with Snow, ſo that there is but
ill walking upon them, becauſe you fall deep
into the Snow. (See <hi>A</hi> marked with <hi>l,</hi> and
<hi>B</hi> marked <hi>c.</hi>)</p>
               <p>The prints of the <hi>Bears</hi> footing we ſaw on
the ſhoar of the Ice-fields, for they ſeek their
Prey in the water, which is the dead Carkaſes
of the <hi>Whales,</hi> the <hi>Foxes</hi> generally accompany
them, for their choicer food of Birds is here
ſcarcer then at <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> for they flock not
together, but fly ſingly.</p>
               <p>When they ſail ſome Miles into the Ice,
where there is pretty large Ice-fields, they joyn
their Ships to them with great Ice-hooks, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ſtrong Cables, where they lie at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52975:157"/>
ſeveral Ships about the ſame Ice-field,
but they rather choſe to be alone, becauſe they
are an hindrance to one another in <hi>Whale</hi>-catching,
and the hunting of them from one
to another maketh them ſhie.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Ice we find no great Waves,
but it is pretty ſmooth, even when it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſtormy. All the danger is from one Ice-field
being bigger then the other, and the
little ones ſwiming faſter then the great ones,
which often cauſeth a ſtoppage, ſo that they
crowd upon one another, not without great
danger of the Ships, which are often catcht
between, and broken by them. See the Plate <hi>B</hi>
at <hi>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Seamen hinder the preſſing on of the
Ice as much as in them lieth, with great Ice-hooks;
but what ſmall help this affordeth them
daily experience teſtifies ſufficienty. In fair
weather the miſchief is as ſoon done as in
tempeſtuous, becauſe the Ice drives in the Sea
either with the ſtream or wind, as either of
them is the more prevalent, craſhing and grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt each other whence the danger ariſes
to the Ships, for after ſuch a manner many
Ships periſh. See Plate <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay that a dead <hi>Whale</hi> tied to the Ship,
is the beſt defence againſt the Ice. Others
hang the Tails and Fins about their Ship, which
way is not to be rejected, for it is of great uſe
to them to prevent the danger of the ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Ice; they have examples, that in
ſuch ſqueezing of the Ice a dead <hi>Whale</hi> hath
preſerved them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52975:157"/>
The Ice riſes out of the Sea as high as a
Mountain; the ſtriking of them together
makes ſo great a noiſe, that one can hardly
hear his own words; and from this joyning
together of the Ice, the great Ice-hills are
made, that drive up and down in the Sea.</p>
               <p>Other great Ice fields are not ſo high as the
Ice hills, yet notwithſtanding they are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ever quite plain, and without a Hill; you
ſee the Ice under water as deep as you can ſee.
It is all of a blew colour, but the deeper you
look the purer blew you ſee; which beautiful
colour changes with the Air, for if it be rainy
weather, this colour groweth paler. I alſo
have often ſeen the Ice underneath the water
very green, the occaſion whereof was the
troubled Air, whence the Sea aſſumeth this
colour.</p>
               <p>I wonder that upon the largeſt Ice-fields
no high Mountains are ſeen, as are ſeen where
the Ice grinds and daſhes one againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I am of opinion, that the Ice melts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the bottoms, for one may ſee it ſpungy;
for elſe, if one would compute from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
it muſt have reached the very
ground, even in the middle of the depth of
the sea.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen in <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> white Ice that
was frozen quite curled, it look'd juſt like Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-candy,
was very hard and thick, and
ſwam even with the Seas ſurface. The Ships
are not always in this danger of ſqeezing,
for often times there is little or no Ice to be
ſeen there, although you are a great way in
the place where it uſually is; but as ſoon as a
wind ariſes, you would admire from whence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52975:158"/>
ſo great a quantity of Ice ſhould come in leſs
then an hours time.</p>
               <p>At the greateſt Ice-fields of all, Ships do not
always ride the ſafeſt; ſince by reaſon of the
bigneſs, and the motion of the Sea, theſe Ice-fields
break, not without danger.</p>
               <p>When ſuch Ice-fields break they part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
which cauſeth a Whirl-pool in the
Sea, where all the out-parts preſs to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
and by that means the pieces of the Ice-fields
raiſe themſelves up, and daſh and grind
againſt each other.</p>
               <p>When we came to 71 degrees in the
Month of <hi>April</hi> we ſaw the firſt Ice, and ſo
we failed up and down by the Ice, until that
Month was ſpent, for ſo early in the year no
body dares venture himſelf into or amongſt
the Ice, by reaſon of the ſtormy winds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
ſome times the Ice is ſtill fixed, and ſtands
firm, and therefore there is but a few <hi>Whales</hi>
ſeen, for underneath the Ice they cannot
breathe.</p>
               <p>Into the Ice we ſailed at 77 degrees and
24 minutes, and drove with that ſheet of Ice
towards the South. In this Month, and alſo
in the following Month of <hi>May,</hi> are the moſt
<hi>Whales</hi> ſeen here, which run towards the Eaſt,
and we follow them all along by the Ice to
<hi>Spitzbergen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Near to the Land ſmaller Ice-fields are ſeen,
becauſe the Ice cannot give way by reaſon
of the Land, which cauſeth greater grinding
and breaking, and upon that account ſmaller
Ice than is in the open Sea. Yet for all this,
ſome greater Ice-Mountains are ſeen there,
that ſtand firm on the ſhoar, and never melt
at bottom, but increaſe every year higher and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52975:158"/>
higher, by reaſon of the Snow that falls on
them, and then Rains that freezes, and then
Snow again alternately; and after this manner
the Icy-hills increaſe yearly, and are never
melted by the heat of the Sun at the top.
Theſe Ice-Mounts change their firſt colour in
time by the Air, by Rain and by the Clouds;
and the faireſt blew that can be, is ſeen in
the cracks of theſe Ice-hills. From theſe ſame
Ice-hills, oftentimes break off great pieces,
that ſwin in the Sea, and is more compact
than the other Ice by far. I once ſaw one of
theſe pieces that was curiouſly workt and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as it were, by the Sea, like a Church with
arched Windows and Pillars, the Doors and
Windows hung full of Icikles, on the inſide
thereof I ſaw the delicateſt blew that can be
imagined; it was bigger than our Ship, and
ſomewhat higher than our ſtern, but how deep
it was under water, I cannot exactly tell.
Near unto the <hi>Muſcle-Haven,</hi> a great Ice-hill
came driving towards our Ship, that was as
high as our Poop, and went ſo deep under
water, that it took up our Anchor, which lay
fifteen Fathoms deep. I have alſo ſeen ſeveral
others, and of other figures, <hi>viz.</hi> round and
fourſquare Tables, with round and blew Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
underneath, as in Plate <hi>B</hi> marked with <hi>f:</hi>
the Table was very ſmooth and plain at the
top, and white with the Snow; at the ſides
hung down a great many Icikles cloſe to one
another, like a fringed Table-cloth; I believe
that near forty men might have ſat about it.
I have ſeen of theſe Tables with one foot, and
with two or three Pillars, and abundance of
<hi>Seales</hi> ſwam about it. The Diſhes that furniſht
this Table, were a piece of Ice like an Horſes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52975:159"/>
head, and a Swan, I doubt they were but ſalt.
You muſt obſerve that this Ice becometh very
ſpungy by the daſhing of the Sea, and from
thence grows ſalt, like Sea-water, and thence
alſo changeth its colour, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Sea
and Rain-water mixt with it; for you ſhall
commonly ſee the Water look blew or yellow,
if you walk under water, with your eyes open,
and look upwards.</p>
               <p>The other Ice, as far as it is above water, is
of a taſte like other Ice, but that below the
Sea ſalt like the Sea-water.</p>
               <p>When we arrived at <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> the Ice at
<hi>Rehenfelt</hi> was as yet fixed, but a few days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it was driven away by the winds.</p>
               <p>The Ice begirts theſe Countries on all ſides:
as the Wind ſets either from the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>John
Mayen, Old Greenland,</hi> and <hi>Nova Zembla.</hi> We
found at this time, that the Ice reached from
the other ſide of <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> and the Ships
ſailed between the Ice and the Land, as if it
were in a River.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as this Ice is drove thither by the
winds, the Ships muſt give way, or go into
the Harbour, until the Winds have blown
or driven the Ice away, or elſe they are loſt;
but if there be other Ships that eſcape, the men
are ſaved.</p>
               <p>On this Ice I did not ſee many <hi>Sea-hounds,</hi>
but a great many <hi>Sea-horſes,</hi> and many Birds
and Fowl.</p>
               <p>We failed ſtill on till we ſaw the <hi>Seven Iſlands,</hi>
but could go no farther.</p>

               <p>THE Froſt is unconſtant in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
but it is not ſo in <hi>Spitzbergen.</hi> In
the Month of <hi>April,</hi> at 71 degrees, it was ſo
cold that we could hardly keep warmth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us. They ſay that in this Month, as alſo in
<hi>May,</hi> the hardeſt Froſts happen every year.</p>
               <p>All the Rigging, by reaſon of its being wet,
is covered over with Ice, and ſtiff.</p>
               <p>They do not ſend their Ships ſo ſoon as
they did a few years ago, and yet they come
time enough there, for if they arrive too
early, there is nothing for them to do, becauſe
the Ice is not yet diſſipated, and therefore
but few <hi>Whales</hi> to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>In the two firſt Summer Months of <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>
their Teeth chatter in their Heads com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
and the Appetite is greater than in any
other Countreys.</p>
               <p>The Sun ſets no more after the third day
of <hi>May,</hi> and we were about 71 degrees,
when we could ſee as well by night as by day.
I cannot ſay much of conſtancy of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in theſe two firſt Months, for it chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
daily. They ſay alſo, if the Moon appears
cloudy and miſty, with a ſtreaky Sky, that
then there commonly follows a ſtorm. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Moon doth prognoſticate ſuch ſtorms,
I cannot tell, becauſe we have obſerved, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52975:160"/>
after we have seen the Moon, in a clear Sky, the
Air has grown foggy, which happeneth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
chiefly if the wind changes. When the
Hills ſhow fiery, it is from Foggs, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſpread themſelves every where, and the
Cold encreaſeth: Theſe Foggs look blew, like
<hi>Indico,</hi> and black afar off, which upon chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Weather are driven along by the
wind, ſo that in leſs than half an hour the Sea
is ſo covered with a thick Fogg, that you
can hardly ſee from one end of the Ship to the
other.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of <hi>May</hi> the Air was bright
and clear, and yet very cold; we could ſee
the <hi>Whales</hi> farther off in the Sea, then uſually
at this time: We could not diſtinguish the
Air from the Sea, for it ſhewed as if the
Ships danced in the Air like naked Trees or
P<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es.</p>
               <p>After the ſame manner <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> looks at
a diſtance like a Cloud; the Mountains are ſo
reflected by the Sea, that he that knows not
the Country very well, cannot eaſily diſcern
if from the Air; and ſo other Countries very
often appear. The other three Months, <hi>June,
July,</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> were very calm.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Cold, it is much according
to the quality of the Winds; ſo North and Eaſt
winds cauſe very intenſe Froſts; ſo that one
can hardly keep alive, eſpecially if the wind
blows hard.</p>
               <p>Weſt and South winds, when ſomewhat
conſtant, cauſe much Snow, and ſometimes
Rain alſo, and moderate cold.</p>
               <p>The other winds of the 32 according
to the Compaſs, whatever names they have,
are changed by the Clouds, ſo that ſometimes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52975:160"/>
when the wind was Southweſt and by South
in one place, at a few Miles diſtance, there
blows quite another wind.</p>
               <p>What heat the Sun oftentimes affords we
ſaw by our Eyes watering, and the tears that
ran continually down our Cheeks. Yet this
ſevere Cold is not always, as is already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
for if it were, how could any Herbs
grow there.</p>
               <p>Neither is there every year a conſtancy of
winds or weather ruled by the Moon, but an
alteration, as is in other places, ſometimes a
milder, and ſometimes a ſeverer Winter.</p>
               <p>Skilful Ship maſters and Harpooners, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
thoſe years for <hi>Whale</hi> catching, that have
not many foggy and cloudy days.</p>
               <p>Whether, according to the New and Full
Moons, the Spring-tydes happen, cannot be
known.</p>
               <p>Such clear Skies as we have ſometimes in a
Summers day, with pleaſant curled Clouds, I
have not ſeen at <hi>Spitzbergen;</hi> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
ſeveral dark and foggy ones. Riſing
Thunder-clouds I have not ſeen, nor ever
heard of any body that had ſeen them.</p>
               <p>Above the Ice the Air appears white, from
whence we know where the firm or fixed Ice
lies, as I have before obſerved in the Chapter
of the Ice.</p>
               <p>In the two laſt Summer Months, chiefly in
<hi>July,</hi> before the <hi>Weigatt,</hi> the Sun ſhin'd ſo
warm, that the Tarr of the Ship between the
Seames, where the wind could not come at it,
melted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52975:161"/>
There is hardly any difference of Cold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Night and day, yet at Night when the
Sun ſhineth, it ſeemeth to one that rightly
conſidereth it, as if it was only clear Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
ſo that you may look upon the Sun, as
well as you can upon the Moon; ſo that
thereby one may diſtinguiſh Night and Day
from each other. Increaſe of Cold, and
changing of the Compaſs, we did not obſerve
as far as we went.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, that the Froſt doth
not let a dead Body be conſumed eaſily in
the Ground, as is already obſerved, in the
Chapter of the Deſcription of <hi>Spitzbergen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in our Voyage
homeward, we obſerved the Sun firſt to
ſet.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Meteors generated in the
Air, I obſerved that the <hi>Rime</hi> fell down in the
ſhape of ſmall Needles of Snow into the Sea,
and covered it as if it was ſprinkled all over
with Duſt: theſe ſmall Needles increaſed more
and more, and lay as they fell croſs one over
the other, and looked very like a Cobweb;
they are formed by the cold of the Air, and
increaſed to that degree, that the Sea ſeemed
covered by them, as with a Skin, or a tender
Ice, which had the taſte of Freſh-water; as
alſo the Sea-water that is taken up into the
high Air is changed, and falleth down again
in ſweet or freſh Rain.</p>
               <p>This hapneth in clear Sun-ſhine and intenſe
cold weather, and it falleth down as the Dew
doth with us at Night inviſibly, in dull wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
when the Sun doth not ſhine, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee this; but you ſee it plainly, if you look
when the Sun ſhines towards a ſhady place;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52975:161"/>
for then it ſparkles as bright as Diamonds;
ſhews like the Atoms in Sun-ſhine, all day
long it falleth in ſo ſmall Particles, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſticks or hangs on your Cloaths of it to
make them wet.</p>
               <p>At Noon when the Sun ſhines very warm,
theſe ſmall Needles melt in the Air, and fall
down inſenſibly like Dew.</p>
               <p>Sometimes we ſee in our Country, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
a little like theſe ſmall Needles, which
is what we call Rime, and falleth from the
Trees in Atoms like Duſt. This is ſmall Snow,
and may be ſeen as well in the Shade as in the
Sun. Theſe Needles ar not the Exhalation
or Vapour that uſes in cold Weather, to ſtick
to the Hair of Men and Beaſts. I muſt not
forget, that we ſee in theſe falling Needles a
Bow like a Rain-bow of two colours, white
and a pale yellow, like the Sun, reflected by
the dark Shadows of the Clouds.</p>
               <p>After this I proceed to the Deſcription of
an other Bow, which I call a Sea-bow. This
is ſeen when the Sun ſhines clear and bright,
not in the great Waves, but in the Atmoſphere
of the Sea-water, which the Wind blows up,
and which looks like a Fog Commonly we ſee
this before the Ship, and ſometimes alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
to the Lee-ward (ſo they call that ſide of
the Ship towards the Sea) over-against the Sun,
where the Shadow of the Sail falleth. It is not
the Shadow of the Sail, but a Bow ſheweth it
ſelf in the Shadow of the Sail. We ſee this
pleaſant reflexion, in the ſmall drops of the
Salt-water of ſeveral colours, like the Rain-bows
in the Skies, that are ſeen over-againſt the
dark Clouds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52975:162"/>
This brings to my Mind another Phanome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
<hi>viz.</hi> that in the Clouds near the Sum, a
very bright Light is ſeen, like a Parelion or
Mock-ſun. Theſe Lights are called Weather-galls
by the Sea-men.</p>
               <p>This bright Light we find in the lower-moſt
Air, in the dark ſhady Clouds, that are not
unlike to a Cloud of Rain, becauſe it is full of
drops, wherein the Sun is represented, as
things are in a Looking-glaſs.</p>
               <p>This clearneſs of the Sun cauſeth a Heat,
which drives from it a Rain-bow, figured by
the Sun, which Bow are the Drops that by the
Heat of the Sun are changed into a Vapour
or Fog, and this Vapour ſhews like ſmoak in
the Air, when the Cold remits, wherein theſe
Colours are no more ſeen.</p>
               <p>But in theſe raiſed Drops as aforeſaid, the
Sun repreſents it ſelf, and cauſeth theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
which are truly diſtinct, and repreſent
Blew, Yellow and Red; which are the three
primary Colours of the Bow.</p>
               <p>Concerning the bigneſs thereof, I did conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and minded the Bow that I ſaw in <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>
and found that it moved about with the
Sun by Day and by Night, and that it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much bigger in the Morning, Evening, and
at Night, than in the Day-time.</p>
               <p>I will not mention the Whirlwinds which
are unknown in theſe cold Countries; that
uſed to take up the Water into the Air: But
yet I will not omit the ſmall Whirlwinds,
that proceed from the high Mountains, from
whence the Wind recoils, and ſo turneth
round about.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52975:162"/>

               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:52975:163"/>
We ſee farther in <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> that the Sea
as well as the other Waters, ſends forth a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
when the Clold encreaſes, which Vapour
is turned into Rain in the Air, or into Snow,
and it ſmelleth like a Fog or ſteaming Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe an Obſervation there, that
when we ſee great Vapours or Fogs in the Air,
and that ſuch a Vapour riſeth almoſt every
moment in a clear Sun-ſhiny Day, without
Wind or other Cauſes, the cold Weather is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to remit: But when the Air is overbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
by theſe Vapours, the Couds are diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
and they laſt a great while with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Wind. Such Vapours as we ſee in
the Air, ſtick to our Cloaths and Hair
like Sweat.</p>
               <p>Out of theſe ſmall vaporous Drops the Snow
is firſt generated: Firſt of all you ſee a ſmall
Drop, as big as a ſingle Sand in the Plate <hi>E</hi>
marked with <hi>A.</hi> This is augmented or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by the Fog, until it cometh to be like
unto a Shield or Plate with ſix corners as clear
and tranſparent as Glaſs, to theſe ſix corners
ſticks the Fog like Drops, as <hi>B.</hi> then it freezes
and ſplits aſunder, ſo that you ſee the Figure of
a Star, as <hi>C.</hi> which yet is ſtill frozen together;
until in time it is quite parted or divided aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one from the other, and then you ſee
a Star with ſix Points, as <hi>D.</hi> which Points are
not yet quite frozen, becauſe there are ſtill
hanging ſome wet drops between the Points;
until at length it aſſumes the perfect Form of
a Star, with Points ſerrated at the ſides, like
Ferne, on the Points whereof ſtill hand ſome
Drops, as you ſee at <hi>E,</hi> which are loſt,
and ſo it is turned into an exact and perfect
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52975:164"/>
Star: And this is the Formation of the ſnowy
Star, which is ſeen in the ſevereſt Froſt ſo
long until at laſt it loſeth all its Points. See <hi>F.</hi>
as to the many ſorts of Snow that fall in <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>
and in what Weather I have made
theſe following Obſervations and Diſtinctions,
Number 1. in the Plate of <hi>E.</hi> ſheweth the
Snow that falleth, when it is tolerable cold
and rainy withal, then it falls like unto ſmall
Roſes, Needles and ſmall Corns. When the
cold Weather doth remit the Snow falleth like
Stars, with many points like the Leaves of
Ferne. Plate <hi>E.</hi> Numb. 2. If it be only a
Fog at laſt, and it ſnoweth much, it looketh as you
ſee Numb. 3. If it is very cold and windy like
Numb. 4. When it is very cold and not windy
withal, the Snow falleth like unto Stars in a
cluſter, becauſe the Wind cannot blow them
aſunder, like Numb. 5. When the Wind was
<hi>North-Weſt,</hi> or the Skies were thick of Clouds,
and it was ſtormy withal, there fell Hail that
was round and oblong all over full of Prickles,
and of the ſame bigneſs as you ſee it as Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
6.</p>
               <p>There is many more ſorts of ſtarry Snow to
be ſeen, with more Points, and ſome like unto
a Heart, but they are all generated after the
ſame manner, by the Eaſtern and Northern
Winds. The needly Snow is generated by
Weſterly and Southerly Winds: If the Snow
is not diſperſed by the Wind, it falleth down
in cl;uſters</p>
               <p>But when the Wind driveth it, Stars, or
Needles only fall, every piece by it ſelf, like
the Atoms in the Sun.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:52975:164"/>
Thus much have I obſerved hitherto of the
Snow, and find that alſo when it is cold and
a North Wind blows, all ſorts of Snow, both
ſtarry and of other ſhapes, fall as well in theſe
Countries as in <hi>Spitzbergen.</hi>

               <p>I deſire the courteous Reader to accept at
preſent of theſe for a Sample, to ſhew him that
on theſe rough, barren and cold Mountains,
there yet grow ſome Plants, for the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both of Man and Beaſt. The Herbs grow
of their perfection in a ſhort time, for in <hi>June,</hi>
when we firſt arrived at <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> we ſaw
but very little Green, and yet in <hi>July</hi> moſt of
them were in flower, and ſome of them had
their Seeds already ripe, whence me may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the length of their Summer.</p>
               <p>I proceed to the Deſcription of thoſe Plants,
which I had time to delineate, and begin with
thoſe, that put forth their Leaves only at, and
about their Roots, and have but few or no
Leaves on their Stalks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52975:166"/>
Then ſhall follow thoſe that have ſingle
Leaves on their Stalks; then thoſe that have
pairs of Leaves or oppoſite ones, afterward
thoſe with three Leaves, and then conclude
with the imperfect Plants.</p>

               <p>IT is a very pretty Herb, and puts forth
thick, prickly and ſad green Leaves like
thoſe of Aloes, a brown naked Stalk, about
half the length of your Finger, whereon hang
round Heads of Fleſh-coloured Flowers in

               <p>The Roots are differing, that of the firſt
hath many ſmall Fibers, and the fourth hath
a thicker and longer, with tender and ſmall

burn ſo.</p>

Leaves agree with them of the firſt, yet
they are leſs, and thoſe that grow higher, and
come up after the lowermoſt, are in two places
deeper cut, ſo that the firſt part of the

with two inciſions, and it burns the Tongue.
The Flower is ſmall, and hath ſix and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſeven Leaves. The Seed-veſſel is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the former, only it is leſs. The Root is
like that of the firſt, only it hath more Fibers;
there is alſo a kind of thick ſheath that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roundeth

round about it upon the Ground. The
Stalk grows out of the middle of theſe Leaves,
which is a great deal lower than in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
with a few Leaves underneath the Sprouts.
The Flowers are of four white Leaves, they
grow many on the ſame Stalk one above the
other, when one Flower fades, another cometh
in its room when the Flower is paſt; the Seed
appears in a longiſh Box, as you may ſee in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52975:170"/>

perfection, and it ſeeded in the Month of
<hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that the Leaves of this

                  <p>This <hi>Snite</hi> which is alſo called the Strand-runner
(becauſe it keepeth about the <hi>Strand</hi>)
is no bigger than a Lark.</p>
                  <p>Its Bill is narrow, thin, and corner'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Our Snites Bills are at the farther end
broader and roundiſh, and cut in with croſs
notches like a Raſp to raſp Wood withal; ſo
that the whole upper Jaw and Bill looketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
like a Raſp with its handle. Our Snites
are alſo bigger than thoſe of <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they are very like one another in Shape
and Colour; this Bill both above and below is
four ſquare, of a browniſh colour, and about
two Inches long. The Head is roundiſh, and
of the ſame thickneſs with the Neck.</p>
                  <p>Their Feet are made of three divided Claw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Root hath a great many Branches that
are divided again, and ſtick very cloſe unto
the Rock underneath the Water. The whole
Plant groweth under Water ſeveral Fathoms:
When we wayed our Anchor, we pulled it
up in great quantity from the Ground.</p>
                  <p>Together with this Herbs we pulled up the
hairy Plant that ſtands by it, about ſix Foot
long, and it is very like an Horſes Tail, only
that here and there it hath ſome ſmall knobs
like nitty Hair, or ſuch as are ſplit at the ends;
the whole Plant was browner of colour than
the former, and its Roots was fixed unto the
former.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Plants were ſome rediſh Worms
wrapt or folded up like Caterpillers, with
many Legs. They are figured Tab. <hi>P.</hi> at <hi>i.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Herb was like Dodder, wherefore it
may be call'd Water or Rock Silk. Amongſt
all the Icons that I have ſeen in printed Herbals,
I find it comes neareſt to that hairy Plant,
which <hi>Antony Donat,</hi> in his Book of Plants,
growing about <hi>Venice,</hi> calleth in his ſecond
Book, <hi>Muſcus argenteus Marinus, ſimilis Plumae,</hi>
only this is not as white as Silver, but rather
yellow or browniſh.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe two Herbs we found great plenty
in the <hi>South Haven</hi> on the 20<hi>th.</hi> and 21<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>July.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another Sea Plant, which I called
Sea-graſs, whereof there is plenty in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Haven</hi> underneath the Water above eight
Foot long. The Leaves were about two or
three Fingers broad, of a yellow Colour like
Glew, and tranſparent, ending in a blunt point,
at the top ſmooth edged, without nicks or

               </p>
               <p>It has a broad flat Stalk like a Leaf, and yet
there ſprout out of it many equally broad

not whether one may take thim for its Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Cloſe to theſe there grow other oblong
Leaves, that are hollow, and as it was blown
up, and fill'd with Wind, and many leſſer
Bladders round about cloſe to one another:
The Leaves that are blown up have nothing in
them but Wind; for when I preſſed them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they gave a little bounce, whether
theſe ſmall Bladders have Seeds in them or no,
I could not obſerve.</p>
               <p>The Seamen informed me, That from the
Seeds of that Plant, the ſmall Sea Snails are
produced, but I am not ſatisfied, whether they
proceed from theſe Bladders, or from Eggs as
our Snails do.</p>
               <p>It may be after the ſame manner, as we find
on many Leaves in our Country, Bladders filled
up with the Seeds of Worms or Caterpillers,

               <p>When this Herb is dried, it looketh brown

when a South or Weſt Wind blows, becauſe of
the Salt that penetrates it; but when the Wind
is Eaſt or North it is ſtiff and dry.</p>
               <p>Among all the Figures that I have ſeen, I
find none liker than that given in the 39<hi>th,</hi>

Herbal,</hi> by the Name of the <hi>Alge Marina Platyceros
poroſa,</hi> only that this is porous or ſpongy and
white. In the Tab. <hi>F.</hi> it is marked with <hi>b.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Leaves of the great Rock Herb, are
very like unto a Man's Tongue, it is on each
or both ſides curled, but plain before and not
curled, through the middle of it run two black
Stroaks or Nerves to the Stalk, and on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
of them appear many black ſpots, within
the black ſtroaks, on each ſide, to the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
plain ſtroaks; the Herb is adorned with
ſmall curles, in the middle it is quite ſmooth to
the Stalk, on the end of the Leaf, next the
Stalk, are two white ſtroaks almoſt to the
middle of the Leaf, bending round outwards,
if they were quite cloſed, they would make
an Oval.</p>
               <p>The Leaf is above ſix Foot long, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and the Stalk yet longer; the Stalk is
round and ſmooth, of a yellow colour like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiled

cleanſed from the Moſs a Crown a Pound, as
I have been informed; But the Feathers of
the <hi>Mountain-ducks</hi> of <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> which they
call Down, the Seamen put into their Pillows,
and Straw-ſacks, which if they ſhould be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <p>The <hi>Kirmew</hi> layeth their Eggs upon Moſs,
and ſo do the <hi>Rotges.</hi> The Neſts of the reſt of
the Birds were too high for us, ſo that we could
hardly, and not without great difficulty reach
them. If it be never ſo dark by reaſon of a
Miſt, yet every Bird knoweth how to find
their own Neſt again, and flyeth directly to it.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Names of the Birds I have
made uſe of thoſe, that the Seamen have given
them formerly, according to their own Fancy,
that he that heareth them called by theſe Names,
may alſo know how to find them by them in
this Book.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe Birds, as <hi>Lumbs, Strundjagers,
Mallemucks, Kirmews,</hi> and the <hi>Mews</hi> called
<hi>Kutyegehfen,</hi> I have alſo ſeen about <hi>England,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>

have heard the <hi>Kirmew</hi> and <hi>Kutyegehf</hi> cry, but
there is a difference, as well between the Beaſts
as Men of other Countries.</p>

                  <p>Firſt of the <hi>Rathſher</hi> (or Alderman in <hi>Engl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi>)
for this is the firſt of the thin billed Birds
that have three Claws, and is called ſo by the
Seamen, becauſe he is very ſtately and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52975:179"/>
Bird, but leſs than that which they call
<hi>Burgermeiſter</hi> (or Major in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>This Bird hath a ſharp, narrow and thin
Bill, and hath only three Claws or Toes, that
are joined together by a black Skin, but he hath
no Claw behind. His Legs are not very long,
and black, as the Eyes are alſo.</p>
                  <p>This Bird is whiter than the Snow, for when
you ſee him upon the Ice, you may diſtinguiſh
him from the Snow; he ſhews very beautiful,
with his white Body, his black Bill and Eyes,
black Legs and Feet, and beſides he is very
well ſhaped.</p>
                  <p>His Tail is pretty long and broad, like a
Lady's Fan.</p>
                  <p>His Cry is ſomewhat lower than the little
<hi>Kirmews,</hi> as if he did ſay <hi>Kar,</hi> when ſhe cries
<hi>Kir,</hi> he ſpreads his Wings and Tail out when
he flies, as the <hi>Strundjager</hi> or Crow doth. He
doth not willingly ſwim in the Water as the
other Birds do, nor doth he much care for
wetting his Feet, but he ſtays rather where it
is dry, yet he loves Fiſh mightily; and ſo the
Proverb that we commonly ſay of the Cats is
true of him; <hi>The Cat loves to eat Fiſh, but does
not love to wet her Feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſeen him upon the Ice feed on the
Dung of a Sea-horſe, upon whoſe Body he
will reſt while he is alive, as Crows will do
in our Countries. He flieth commonly alone
by himſelf, but where there is a Prey they
flock in great numbers.</p>
                  <p>I did delineate them in the ſhallow Corner
(called ſhallow Point) in <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> on the
10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> when we ſhot him, he was not

               <head type="sub">Of the Broad or Web-footed Birds.</head>
               <p>THere are ſeveral ſorts of theſe about
<hi>Spitzbergen.</hi> Some of them have thin
pointed Bills, others have thick and broad ones.</p>
               <p>Some of the thick billed one have them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
or parted as the <hi>Malle-mucken</hi> (mad Gnats
in <hi>Engliſh</hi>) others have undivided ones, as the
<hi>Parret</hi> ſo called.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a conſiderable difference in the
Heels of theſe Birds, for ſome of them have
Heels, as the <hi>Mountain-duck, Kirmeu</hi> and <hi>Malle-mucks:</hi>
Others have them not at all, as the
<hi>Burgermeiſter, Rathſher, Strundjager, Kutyegehf, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
Lumbe, Pigeon,</hi> and the <hi>Red Gooſe;</hi> no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſticks to their Feathers no more than on the
Swans and other Water Fowl, for it runs off
from them, as if they were oiled all over.</p>
               <p>Some are Birds of Prey, others not. There
is alſo a difference in their flying.</p>
               <p>Some flie like unto a Partridge, as that called
the Pigeon, others like Swallows, as the
<hi>Lumbs</hi> and <hi>Red Geeſe,</hi> others like the Mews, as
the <hi>Mallemucke, Rathſher</hi> and <hi>Strundjager,</hi> others
like the <hi>Stork,</hi> as the <hi>Burgermeiſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Birds of Prey are, the <hi>Burgermeiſter,
Rathſher, Strundjager, Kutyegehf</hi> and <hi>Mallemucke.</hi>
There is alſo a great difference in their Fleſh;
the Birds of Prey are not ſo good to eat as the
others, except you hang them up by their Legs
for ſome days, that the Train Oil may run
out of them, and the Air blow through them,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52975:180"/>
and then you do not taſte the Train Oil ſo
ſtrong, for elſe it would make you vomit.</p>
               <p>The Pigeons, Parrets, Red Geeſe and Ducks,
are the moſt fleſhy, the old Lumbs have a very
tough and dry Fleſh, not to diſparage the Rotges,
Kirmews and young Lumbs when boiled, and
the Fat taken away from them, and afterwards
fryed in Butter; for then one may make a ſhift
to eat them;but if you ſhould eat their Fat, it
would vomit and diſorder the Stomach very
much. Thſe Birds except the <hi>Strundjager,
Kirmew</hi> and <hi>Mountain-duck,</hi> all make their Neſts
upon the high Rocks, where they are ſecured
from the Foxes and Bears;but ſome of them
make their Neſts higher than others.</p>
               <p>They fit in ſo great-numbers or flocks upon
the Rocks, chiefly at the time when they hatch
their Young ones, which is about the latter end
of <hi>June,</hi> and beginning of <hi>July,</hi> that if they
flie up when the Sun ſhineth, they ſhade the
Ground like a Cloud, and make ſo great a noiſe,
that one Man can hardly hear the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kirmews</hi> and <hi>Mountain-ducks,</hi> and alſo
the <hi>Strundjagers.</hi> make their Neſts on low
Grouands, (that one would think that the high
Water muſt needs run over them) on the ſmall
Iſlnds, where they are ſecure from the Foxes,
but not from the white Bears, for they ſwim in
the Water from one Iſlands to the other. We
took up great ſtore of their Eggs.</p>
               <p>The Neſts of theſe Birds are not all made
after the ſame manner. For the <hi>Mountains-duck</hi>
makes its Neſt of the Feathers of its own Belly,
mixing them with Moſs.</p>
               <p>The Feathers of theſe Neſts are not the
Edder Down, brought us from Iſland, for
that cometh from great Birds (that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants)</p>

of a Lark;but when the sun ſhines upon
it, it ſhews blewiſh, very like thoſe two Colours
obſerved on our Ducks Necks when the Sun
ſhines upon them. They feed upon the little
gray Worms and Shrimps.</p>
               <p>We ſhot ſome of them in the South Harbour,
near the Cookery of <hi>Harlem</hi> they had not the
taſte of Fiſh at all. See Tab. <hi>K</hi> at <hi>a.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Snow-bird</hi> is no bigger than a sparrow,
and like a Linnet in his Shape, Bill and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                  <p>The Bill is ſhort and pointed, its Head of
the ſame thickneſs with its Neck. The Legs
are alſo like the Linnets, their Feet are divided
into three fore Claws, with longiſh crooked
Nails, the hinder Claw is ſomewhat ſhorter,
but hath a long bended Spur, or Nail. The
Legs are grayiſh, and not very long.</p>
                  <p>From their Head over all their Belly to the
Tail they are white like Snow, but all over
their Backs and Wings they are gray. Some
of them are gray all over, but theſe are little
Ones.</p>
                  <p>I can tell nothing of its ſinging, only that
it whiſſeleth a little, as Birds uſe to do when
they are hungry.</p>
                  <p>When we ſailed near the Ice, they came in
great flocks to us in our Ship, near the Iſland
of <hi>John Mayen,</hi> and were ſo tame, that you
could take them up with your Hands.</p>
                  <p>They run upon the Ice where I only ſaw
them, and not upon the Land, which is the
reaſon that they are called <hi>Snow-birds.</hi>

                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:52975:181"/>
They kept with our Ship till we catch'd the
firſt Whale, and after that the other Birds fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them away.</p>
                  <p>We fed them with Oatmeal, but when their
Bellies were full, they would not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be taken up. We put ſome of them
in a Cage, and hung them up in the Cabin,
but they did not live long.</p>
                  <p>We eat ſome of them, and they were not of
an unpleaſant taſte, but very lean. If I may
give my Opinion, why the Birds flie to the
Ships, I believe that they are ſtray'd from the
Iſland, and that ſo the Hunger compels them to
the Ships for Food. Tab. <hi>K.</hi> at <hi>b.</hi>

one of the beautifulleſt Birds of <hi>Spitzbergen.</hi>
It is of the bigneſs of a Duck, the Bill is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

two Inches long and hollow within. It
hath but three red Toes on its Feet, with
crooked Claws; it hath ſhort rediſh Legs, and
a ſhort Tail.</p>
                  <p>Some of theſe Birds are black all their body
over; but others. and ſo was that which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated;
about their Wings, and in the middle

are in the middle of their Wings quite white;
their Bill is red within; the Tongue is alſo
red and hollow; they cry like young Pigeons,
whence they have their Name, for they are in
nothing elſe like them. In their Crops I found
Shrimps, or Prawns, and ſmall Sand-ſtones.</p>
                  <p>They do not flie high over the Sea, and
their flight is very like the Partridges: They
do not flie many together as the Lumbs, but
uſually by pares, and ſometimes one alone by
its ſelf.</p>
                  <p>They can keep a great while under Water;
wherefore they may be called Diving Pigeons.</p>
                  <p>But chiefly when they are purſed by Men, or
if their Wings be hurt by a Shot, they will dive
and keep a great while under Water; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they get underneath the Ice, and there
they are ſuffocated, they were as nimble and quick
under Water (if their Wings or Feet are not quite
ſhot off) as we could row with our Boat. Their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52975:183"/>
Fleſh is good to eat when the Fat is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from it, if afterwards it be fryed in But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Diving Pigeon I got the 23<hi>th.</hi> of

                  <head>III. Of the Lumb.</head>
                  <p>This Bird is the likeſt in his Bill unto the
Diving Pigeon, only it is ſomewhat ſtronger
and crookeder.</p>
                  <p>He hath black Feet, with three black Toes,
and as many black Nails; his Legs are black
alſo and ſhort.</p>
                  <p>He is quite black at the top, but underneath
his Belly even to the Neck he is ſnow white;
his Tail is ſhort.</p>
                  <p>His Cry is very unpleaſant, moſt like that of
a Raven, and they cry more than all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Birds, except the <hi>Rotger-divers,</hi> he is big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Diving Pigeon, as big as a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Duck. In their Crops I find ſmall Fiſh
and Prawns, and alſo ſome Sand-ſtones; and
one of them flying over our Ship dropp'd a
large red Prawn into the Ship. I alſo delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it in the mentioned place. They ſay
likewiſe, that ſmall freſh River Fish are their
Prey; but this I cannot relate for certain.</p>
                  <p>When they have young ones, they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſit by the old ones one or two on the Water,
who teach them to dive and ſwim. After the
old ones have brought their young in their
Bill, from the Rocks to the Water, the Prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bird called <hi>Burgermeiſter</hi> ſometimes catches
the young ones, when the old ones are not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52975:183"/>
preſent, and ſometimes when they are alſo, for
they are not able to reſiſt them.</p>
                  <p>They love their young ones ſo well, that
they will be killed before they will leave them,
(and will defend them as a Hen doth her
Chickens, ſwimming about them) at other
times they are very hard to be ſhot; for as
ſoon as they ſee the Fire, they are immediately
under Water, or fly away. They fly in great
flocks, with pointed Wings like Swallows, and
move their Wings much in their flight. One
can hardly know the young <hi>Lumbs</hi> from the
old ones, at the first ſight, if you do not take
exact notice of their Bills; for the upper part
turns beſide the under part, at the point, and
the undermoſt beſide the uppermoſt, as you ſee
in the Croſs Bill, yet not so much in these;
and it is commonly done in the 15th, 16th, to
the 20th year of their Age. The old ones are
full of Fleſh, but it is very dry and tough, and
therefore unpleaſant to eat.</p>
                  <p>They boil them like the Pigeons, and ſcum
off the Fat when they boil, then they fry them
in Batter. I did not ſee them upon the Ice,
but abundance of them upon the Mountains:
They go waddling from one ſide to the other,
like the diving Pigeons. I have ſeen many
Thouſands of them together in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
on the Mountains, on that ſide where the
Eaſt and Northern Winds could not blow hard
or not fully upon them, (and ſo do all other
Birds chuſe ſuch places on the Mountains for
their Habitations) where the Herbs do grow.</p>
                  <p>But I ſaw not ſo many by the Haven of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi>
where I drew my Figure on the 25th of

                  <p>This is beautiful <hi>Mew,</hi> and is called
<hi>Kutge-gehef,</hi> becauſe it cryeth ſo: He hath
a Bill ſomewhat bent, as the <hi>Burgermeiſter;</hi> on
the undermoſt part of its Bill is a ſmall knob
or riſing: About his black Eyes he hath a red
circle, as the <hi>Burgermeiſter;</hi> and he hath but
three Claws, joyned together with a black Skin.</p>
                  <p>The Legs are alſo black, and but ſhort; the
Tail is ſomewhat long and broad, like a Fan.</p>
                  <p>All the Belly is as white as Snow; the
Wings and Back are grey, and the point of the
Wings black. He is almoſt as big as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Mew,</hi> but ſomething leſs than the <hi>Strunt-jager.</hi>
When we cut the fat off from the
Whales, we ſaw abundance of them fly by the
Ship, and heard them cry.</p>
                  <p>When the Seamen have a mind to catch
ſome of them, they bait their Hooks with a
piece of Whales Fat, and ſo tye the Hooks to
a Line, and fling it into the Sea, and ſo they
catch not only theſe, but all the other Birds of
Prey. He flieth with ſmall Wings as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Mew, and dives not. His Food is the
Fat of the Whale. He is hunted by sthe <hi>Strunt-jager</hi>
(in Engliſh <hi>Dung-hunter</hi>) who leave him
not till he dungs, which the <hi>Strunt-jager</hi>
eats.</p>
                  <p>This I could hardly believe at firſt, until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

with a Hook, in the <hi>South Haven.</hi> I did pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
obſerve in this Bird, that it uſed to ſwim
upon the Water, and hold its Head up againſt
the Wind, if it was never ſo great a Storm;
and ſo we found whole flocks of them ſwim
upon the Water together.</p>
                  <p>This is not only to be underſtood of this
Bird, but alſo of all the reſt, for they look
againſt the Wind, that their Feathers may not
be blown aſunder and opened; for if they
ſhould ſit or ſwim with the Wind, their Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would be blown aſunder by the cold
Wind, and ſo the Cold would get in between
them to their Skin, which perhaps might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
their Health, for Birds are covered with
their Feathers as Men are with their Clothes.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, when they fly up, they preſs againſt
the Wind with their Bodies, and expand their
Wings, and ſo fly away very ſwiftly; alſo their
Feathers would be entangled, ſo that they
could not have a ſure and ſteddy flight, but
faulter in their flying, like Birds that learn to
fly. There is but little Meat upon them; we
eat but the Legs and the Breaſt, for the Wings
are nothing but Skin and Bone. We have a
Proverb, and ſay, <hi>Thou art as light as a Mew:</hi>
This we may very well ſay of theſe Mews.
I have ſeen them ſince in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sea, and

                  <head>V. Of the Burgermeiſter.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Burgermeiſter</hi> (in English <hi>Major</hi>) is
the biggeſt of all the Birds of <hi>Spitsbergen,</hi>
wherefore this Name is given him as being the
Chief of them. His Bill is crooked, of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
colour, narrow and thick; his Under-bill
is ſomewhat riſing or knobby at the point or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end,
a great deal more than the <hi>Kutge-gebefs,</hi>
which looketh very pretty, as if he had a Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in his Mouth; he hath longiſh Noſtrils, and
a red Ring about his Eyes, as I mentioned
when I ſpoke of the <hi>Kutge-gehef;</hi> he hath but
three Claws, of a grey colour, his Legs are
grey, and not quite ſo long as thoſe of a Stork,
yet he is almoſt equally big with him.</p>
                  <p>His Tail is broad, like a Fan, and white,
which is chiefly to be underſtood of theſe
Birds when they fly; his Wings are of a pale
colour, and ſo is all the Back, but the Wings
are white at the tip, and ſo is the whole Body.
He Builds his Neſt very high in the Clifts of
the Rocks, where you can neither ſhoot nor
catch them any other way; which was the
reaſon I could not ſee their Neſts. I have ſeen
ſometimes two, three and four of their young
ones together; we ſhoot moſt of them when
we draw a dead Whale behind our Ship, where
they flock in great numbers, and bite off great
pieces of the fat of the Whale; at other times
we muſt ſhoot at them a great diſtance, as
at other wild Birds, ſuch as Ravens, Herns, and
the like.</p>

                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52975:187"/>
His Cry is like the Cry of ſome Ravens
that I have ſometimes heard; he flyeth in the
Air like a Stork; he preys upon young Lumbs
as the Hawk doth upon all ſorts of Birds; he
feeds alſo upon the fat of the Whale, whereof
he doth ſwallow down peices as big as ones
Hand whole.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mallemucks</hi> are mightily afraid of him,
they will lye down before him (when they are
upon the Carcaſs of a dead Whale) then he bites
them about the Neck, which I believe doth
not hurt them much, becauſe they have a very
thick Skin, for elſe they would oppoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
him, or fly away, but they do not matter
it, neither will they leave their Meal for his
biting. I have ſeen him alſo about the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Horſes,
whoſe Dung he eats. He flyeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſingle, except when they meet at their
Prey. He loves to reſt on the water, but doth
not care much for diving; we ſhot one before

but ſhort, ſomewhat thick, of a black colour;
his Feet have but three Claws, with as many
black Nails, and are joyned by a black Skin;
his Legs are ſhort and black; he is almoſt all
over black, except his Belly, which is white.</p>
                  <p>Some of this kind have their Wings ſpotted
with white and black, like the diving Pigeon;
no Water ſticketh to their Feathers, no more
than to a Swans; they are moſt of them like
Hair on a very thick Skin: Their Tail is ſhort.</p>

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52975:188"/>
They are very much like a Swallow in their
ſhape; I took them at firſt to be Swallows, for
they fly like them; they are in great flocks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as the Swallows are when they are
about to hide themſelves againſt the Winter.</p>
                  <p>They go wabbling from ſide to ſide, as the
Divers do; they cry very loud <hi>Rottet, tet, tet,
tet, tet,</hi> at firſt high, and ſo by degrees lower
and lower; and this their calling or crying is
the occaſion of their Name. They make more
noiſe than any other Bird, becauſe their Voice
is ſhriller; but the <hi>Lumbs</hi> in this are not much
inferior to them, although they cry lower;
the Burgermeiſter, Rathſher, and the whole
crew of Birds of <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> ſtrike in with
them, ſo that one can hardly hear another's
words.</p>
                  <p>The calling or crying of the Rotages amongſt
one another ſounds almoſt, at a diſtance, as if
you hear a great many Women ſcolding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
They are ſomewhat bigger than a Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>They build their Neſts in the Clifts of the
Rocks, yet not all of them, for ſome make their
Neſts upon the Hills or Mountains, of Moſs,
where we found them, and we killed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

it is black.</p>
                  <p>He hath but three Claws, which are joyned
together with a black Skin; his Legs are not
very long; his Tayl, which is like unto a Fan,
hath this mark, that one Feather thereof ſtands
out before all the reſt: He is black on the top
of his Head: His Eyes are black; about his
Neck he hath a dark yellowiſh Ring or Cricle;
his Wings, as well as his Back, are brown; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneatſh
his Belly he is white; he is ſomewhat
bigger than the Mew called <hi>Kutge-gehef;</hi> he
hunts and flies in the Air after the Mew <hi>Kutge-gehef,</hi>
ſo long torments her, until ſhe avoideth
her Dung, on which this Bird feeds, which he
catches dexterouſly before it falls down into
the Water; and this is the reaſon why they
call him <hi>Strunt-jager,</hi> in Engliſh the <hi>Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He flyeth with the Mews called <hi>Kutge gehef,</hi>
which do not fear him in the leaſt, and they
are both equally ſwift in their flying, but when
he intends to make them dung, he hunts them
and makes them cry out very loud, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſeldom cries: He generally keepeth but to
one Mew, but if two or three of the Mews be
togher, and one makes her eſcape from him,
then he hunts the other two, and flyeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
above and ſometimes underneath them.
I could never ſee him hunt after any other
Birds, but once I ſaw him fly after a Mallemunck,
but I ſaw him ſoon leave her, perhaps becauſe
her Dung did not pleaſe him. I am of opinion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52975:189"/>
that this Dung, becauſe it is thin, ſerves him
inſtead of Drink, for elſe he eats the Fat of the
Whale for his Food: He builds his Neſt not
very high.</p>
                  <p>He goes upright upon his Legs, like the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemeiſter,
Rhatſher,</hi> or <hi>Kutge-gehef.</hi> It is a rare
Bird, and I ſaw but very few of them: He
flies commonly alone; I ſaw very ſeldom two
or three of them together; he flies like the <hi>Rhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher,</hi>
or like a Crow, but his Wings are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more pointed at the ends.</p>
                  <p>He hath a loud Voice, when he cries it
ſounds as if he did ſay, 1 <hi>Ja.</hi> To ſome it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

His Fleſh is not better than that of the other

                  <p>This is commonly called the <hi>Parret.</hi> Amongſt
all the web-footed Birds that have three Claws,
this hath a peculiar Bill; and becauſe it ſeem'd
to thoſe that gave him this Name to be like
that of a Parret, therefore they called him alſo
a Parret; but in truth his Bill is not at all like
that of a Parret, its Bell is broad, and full of
ſlender ſtrokes of ſeveral colours, <hi>viz.</hi> red,
white, and the broad part thereof is black;
the uppermoſt as well as the undremoſt are
both pointed; the uppermoſt arch is red, and
his upper Bill hath a thin bended Hook; the
undermoſt hath a yellowiſh arch, and is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end downwards cut off ſomewhat
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52975:189"/>
ſloaping: The upper part of its Bill, as well as
the lower part, is about three fingers broad, and
about the ſame length, if you meaſure the upper
and undremoſt together: He hath of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Bill four arched or bended oblong pitted
holes, and on the lower he hath as many, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the furthermoſt is not altogether ſo
plain.</p>
                  <p>Theſe holes or pits of the upper and lower
Bill make together a Half-moon; and the parts
that are elevated make in the ſame manner, as
well as the pitted or hollow ones, a Half-moon.</p>
                  <p>By theſe holes are as many raiſed or eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
parts; the uppermoſt of them is as broad
as the three furthermoſt ones together, and
hath underneath on each ſide a longiſh hole,
which without doubt are his Noſtrils; but the
undermoſt on the under Bill is about a Straws
breadth broader; the upper broad part is
blackiſh, and ſometimes blew.</p>
                  <p>On this broad part of the upper Bill that is
thus elevated above the reſt, is towards the Eye
a long whitiſh piece of Cartilage that is full of
holes, whereon you ſee towards the inner part
of the Mouth ſomething like a Nerve, which
alſo reacheth towards the under part, and there
endeth itſelf, whereby the Bill is opened and
ſhut.</p>
                  <p>His Feet have alſo but three Claws, joyned
with a red Skin between them, with three ſhort
and ſtrong Nails; the Legs are but ſhort, and
of a red colour; he walks wabbling.</p>
                  <p>About his Eyes he hath a red ring, and above
this Ring ſtands upright a little Horn, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
the Eyes lyeth another little, longiſh,
black Horn croſs over; as you may ſee in the

His Tail is ſhort: The Head is black at the
top unto the Horn; but his Cheeks are white;
about his Neck he hath a black Ring; all his
Back and Wings alſo, at the top or the outſide,
are black, but underneath the Belly is white.
They fly either ſingly or by pairs, and have
ſharp pointed Wings like the Lumbs. He will
keep a great while under Water. He eats like
the reſt, red Shrimps or Prawns, and Star-fiſh,
for I found ſomething in his Stomach that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <p>He hath more Fleſh upon him than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

The Drake hath black and white ſpotted Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52975:190"/>
and the Duck hath Feathers of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of a Partridge. The hindmoſt Claw is
broad and ſhort, with a ſhort Nail; the Tail
is bobb'd, like that of other Ducks. I could
find nothing in their Mews or Gizzards that
could make me certain of thier Food, but only
Sand-ſtones. They fly a great many of them
in flocks like other wild Ducks; when they
do ſee any Men, they hold up their Heads and
make a very long Neck. They make their
Neſts upon the low Iſlands; they make them
of the Feathers of their Bellies, which they mix
with Moſs; but theſe are not the ſame Feathers
which are called the Edder-down.</p>
                  <p>We found their Neſts with two, three, or
four Eggs in them, the moſt whereof were rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
when we came to <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> but ſome of
them were good to eat; they are of a pale
green, ſomewhat bigger than our Duck-eggs;
the Seamen made an hole at each end, and ſo
blew the White and the Yolk out, and ſtrung
the Shells upon a Packthread. I would have
brought ſome of them to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> but they
began to ſtink, ſo that I was forced to fling
them away, although the Shells were entire.
Theſe Ducks have a very good Fleſh, we boyl'd
and roſted them as we did the other Birds,
but the fat of them we flung away, for it taſted
of Train-oyl, and made us vomit.</p>
                  <p>The Ships that arrived at <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> before
us got a great many of them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Mountain-Ducks</hi> are not at all ſhy, or
afraid of Men, when we firſt arrive there, but
afterwards they grow quite wild, ſo that you
can hardly come near enough to ſhoot them.
That which I have drawn here was ſhot in the

                  <head>X. Of the Kirmew.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Kirmew</hi> hath a thin ſharp-pointed Bill,
as red as Blood; the ſhews very large, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when ſhe ſtands upright, becauſe of her
long Wings, and Feathers of her Tail, but
when the Feathers are off, there is no more
Meat than upon a Sparrow. It is peculiar to
this Bird to have very ſharp pointed Wings,
and its Tail is longer than that of a Swallow,
and as long as the longeſt Feather of the Wings.
Becauſe of theſe long and ſharp-pointed Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in her Wing and Tail, ſhe might very
properly be called the <hi>Swallow-mew,</hi> but it is
commonly called <hi>Kirmew</hi> from its Cry. The
Claws, as well as the Skin between them, are as
red as Blood; the Nails are black on all the
four Claws; the hindmoſt Claw is very little:
The Legs are ſhort and red: it ſhews very
brisk and pert when it ſtands upright on its
Legs. The Head at the top is black, like a
black Cap; the ſides of the Head are Snow
white, and the whole Body is of a Silver co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or white enclining to grey; the Wings
and Tail are white underneath; one ſide of the
Feathers of the Wings are black. All theſe
differing colours, together with the Blood-red
Bill, red Legs and Feet, make her very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
her Feathers are thready or hairy; ſhe
flies ſingly, for ſo I ſaw her always in the <hi>South
Haven,</hi> and in other places where we were.
Where their Neſts are they fly in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
Theſe they make of Moſs. One can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52975:191"/>
diſcern their Eggs from their Neſts, for both
of them are of a dirty white, but the Eggs have
black ſpecks; they are of the bigneſt of a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's
Egg; I eat of them at <hi>Spttzbergen,</hi> and
found them very good, they taſted like the
Lapwings Eggs; the Yolk was red, and the
White blewiſh; they are very ſharp-pointed at
one end. She defends her Neſt and Eggs, and
flies directly at a Man, biting and crying. It is
the ſame with her as what we ſay of the Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing;
ſhe endeavours to defend all the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and yet cannot defend her own Neſt.</p>
                  <p>I brought about thirty of their Eggs with me
to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> but they were rotten and ſtunk. It
is a kind of a Hawk, and throws herſelf into the
Water, as othe Mews do.</p>
                  <p>I am of an opinion, that ſhe feeds on thee ſmall
grey Worms, and perhaps on Shrimps and
Prawns, for I found no other Food they could
get.</p>
                  <p>I ſhot but one ſingle Bird of them flying,
whitch I did not eat of, becauſe the large ſhot
had torn it very much.</p>
                  <p>This Bird is quite grey in our Countries,
which differs much from that of <hi>Spizbergen,</hi>
whoſe Feathers are much finer. That here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated,
was ſhot, by the <hi>Birds Song</hi> in <hi>Spitzber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
on the 20th of <hi>June.</hi> See it Tab. <hi>N,</hi> at <hi>b.</hi>

                  <head>XI. Of the Mallemucke.</head>
                  <p>This Bird hath a remarkable Bill, which is
ſeverally divided: The uppermoſt Bill hath
next to the Head oblong and ſmall Noſtrils;
underneath them groweth out as it was a new
Bill, that riſes up, is crooked and very ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52975:192"/>
The under part of the Bill conſiſts partly of
four pieces, two whereof meet in a point to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
downwars, the other two gape upwards;
the two undermoſt that meet in a point, meet
exactly with the point of the upper Bill. The
hinder Claw of the Feet of this Bird is very
ſmall, of a grey colour, and ſo are the other
Claws and the Skin between them. The Tail
is ſomewaht broad, the Wings are longiſh after
the manner of the <hi>Kirmew.</hi> They are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
of the ſame colour; ſome are quite grey,
which we take to be the oldeſt, others are grey,
on their Back and Wings, but their Head and
Belly are white, which are the young ones:
This is generally thought, but I am of opinion,
that this difference of colour proceeds rather
form a difference in kind than from a difference
in age; for the grey ones I only ſaw about
<hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> but they grey and white ones, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I have ſeen ſome few of them at <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>
yet we ſaw abundance more about the
<hi>North Cape,</hi> and Alſo about <hi>Hitland</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
He flies like a great Mew, hovers near the
Water with a very ſmall motion of his Wings.</p>
                  <p>They do not avoid a Strorm as our Mews do,
but they take good and bad together, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens;
ours bend themſelves like an Ear of
Corn with the Wind, which the Mallemucks
do not: They do not much care for diving,
but when they waſh themſelves they ſit upon
the Water, and put their Wings a-croſs one over
the other: They fly ſingly; when they go to
fly up thye wabble a great way before they can
raiſe themſelves upon the Wind, but the Lumbs
and Parrets that have but ſmall Wings do it
more. When they ran upon the Deck of the
Ship, They could not fly up before they came
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52975:192"/>
to a place where a ſtep went down, or from
ſome advantageous riſe. They flock in great
numbers when we catch Whales, and light
down upon the live Whales, bite them in their
Backs, and pick out great pieces of his fat, even
when he is yet alive, and when we cut up the
dead Whales, there came ſo many of them
about us, that we could not imagine from
whence they could all come, ſo that we were
forced to kill them with Sticks and with broad
Nets in Frames, ſuch as they uſe in the Tenis-Court,
to be rid of them: They are ſo bold,
that they would not fly away, although they
ſaw us caome upon them, but ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be killed in great numbers, which we
hung upon the Tackle of our Ship.</p>
                  <p>But after they began to be more ſhy of us,
and would not ſtay ſo long. They flock in ſo
great numbers after the Whales, that many of
them are diſcovered by them; wherefore I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that he flings up ſome fat when he blows
the Water out, which the Mallemucks eat. But
a great many more, when the Whale is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
follow the bloody track left in ther Water,
for then they are numberleſs. They alſo often
diſcover a dead Whale, and ſo we get them
ſometimes without any great trouble.</p>
                  <p>His Name is given him, becauſe he is ſo ſilly
or mad (which the Dutch call <hi>Mall</hi>) to ſuffer
himſelf to be ſo eaſily killed, whereunto is put
the word <hi>Mucke,</hi> which ſignifies a Gnatt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are as numerous as Gantts; ſo that
the Name <hi>Mallemucke</hi> ſignifieth as much as ſilly
Gnatts, or mad Gantts.</p>
                  <p>They eat ſo much of the fat of the Whales,
till they ſpew it up again, and tumble them
ſelves over and over in the water until they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52975:193"/>
up the Train-oyl, and then they begin to
eat afreſh, until they grow weary of eating:
They bite one another, and fight together,
which is very good ſport, about a piece of Fat,
fiercely, although there is enough for them all,
and to ſpare.</p>
                  <p>When they are full they reſt upon the Ice or
Water. I really believe it is the moſt devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Bird of all, for he eats till he can ſtand no
longer, but falls down. He bites very hard,
but the Burgermeiſter bites yet harder, to
whom he ſubmits himſelf, and lies down before
him to be bit by the Burgermeiſter, which he
does very ſeverely, yet the Mallemucke feels
little or nothing of it, his Feathers are ſo thick;
which I conclude, becauſe he is not eaſily ſhot,
but will endure a great blow; nor is it eaſie
to kill him with a Stick at one blow. When
they ſteer themſelves in the Water with their
Legs, they have countinually an eye upon their
Prey, yet they mind both the Man and their
Prey; but if you have a long Stick, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get up ſo ſoon or ſwift but you may have
a blow at them. He is the firſt and commoneſt
Bird of all you ſee in <hi>Greenland;</hi> they cry all
togehter, and it ſounds afar off as if they were
Frogs. He walks but ill upon the Land and
Ice, like a Child that juſt learns to go, but
he underſtands better to fly; you ſee him
always near unto the ſurface of the Water, for
he is very light. Of all the Birds of Prey, I
believe, he hath the leaſt Meat on him. He
builds his Neſt high on the Mountains, yet not
ſo very high as the Bungermeiſter, yet it was
too high for me, I could not come at them.
His Breaſt and Legs only are to be eaten, they
are tough, and taſte ſtrong of Train oyl; when
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52975:193"/>
you will eat them you muſt hang them up by
the Legs, that the Fat of the Whales, or the
Train-oyl, may run out of them, for two or
three day, and that the Wind may blow thro'
them and the Froſt pierce then alſo; them
you lay them into freſh Water, that the rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
may be drawn out, afterwards boil and
fry them in Butter. They are every where
ſeen in the North Sea, as I have ſaid before,
yet they are differing. This that you ſee here
I did deſign among the Ice the firſt of <hi>June.</hi>

               <p>AMongſt theſe are the <hi>Red Gees,</hi> which were

               </p>
               <p>Then I ſaw another Bird flying ſingly with
broad Feet, a very handſom Bird, called <hi>John
of Ghent;</hi> it is as big as a Stork, and of the
ſame ſhape with white and black Feathers; he
hovers in the Air, and moveth his Wings but
very little; when he cometh to the Ice he
turns back again. It is a kind of a Hawk, and
I have reaſon to believe that he hath a very
ſharp ſight, for he ſhoots down from a great
height into the Water. They ſay, that the
Brains of this Bird are in great eſteem, but for
what I could never learn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:52975:194"/>
He is alſo ſeen in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sea, and every

he is ſeen where they catch Herrings.</p>
               <p>I was alſo informed, that a black Crow was
ſeen in <hi>Spitzbergen;</hi> other Birds are not ſeen
there, except it may be now and then a ſingle
one that ſtrays and ſo cometh thither, as the
crow did. All theſe Birds come at certain
times, and abide at this place as long as the
Sun ſhines; afterwards, when the Cold begins
to encreaſe, and the Nights lengthen, every
one of them returns to its own place again.
When they are going from thence they gather
all together, and when they are all met they
<hi>fly away,</hi> every kind by themſelves, which
hath been very often obſerved: Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
they cannot live in this intolerable cold
place in the Winter. They reſt as well upon
the Water as the Land, (and when they fly up
they look againſt the Wind) for elſe they
would quite be tired in this long <hi>Journey.</hi>

               <p>Which way thoſe Birds that have divided

are not all alike, ſor ſome are rounder, and
others longer or leaner: he hath a Beard about
his Mouth, and Hair on the Noſe and the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids,
yet ſeldom above four: the Eyes are very

with white ſpots, ſome yellow, ſome grey, and

wherewith he can bite off a Stick as thick as

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52975:197"/>
long, and ſharp Nails or Claws; their Tail is
ſhort; they bark like hoarſe Dogs; their little
or young ones mew like Cats; they go lame
behind; they can climb upon the high Ice,
whereon I ſaw them ſleep, chiefly when the
Sun ſhined, wherein they take great pleaſure,
but when it is ſtormy weather they muſt march
off and leave it, for the Waves of the Sea beat
with great violence againſt it, as if it were
againſt Rocks, as I have mentioned already in
the Chapter of Ice.</p>
                  <p>We ſaw moſt of them upon the Ice about
the Weſt ſide near to the ſhoar, where there
was an incredible number of them, that if the
Maſter of a Ship ſhould not catch Whales
enough, they might lade their Ship with <hi>Seales</hi>
only; and we have Examples that little Ships
have taken their Lading only of them, but it is
very troubleſome to flea them: Nor are they
all alike fat at the time when we arrive
there.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> we ſee but a few of them, but
inſtead of them there is plenty of Sea-horſes.
Where many <hi>Seales</hi> are ſeen, that is not a good
place to catch Whales in. It ſeemeth as if they

and tread theſe Skins in it, which ſucks
up the Fat, and the Skins become to be dry,
after the ſame manner as we uſe to take out
ſpots of Fat out of ſine Linnen or other Clothes,
when we hold it againſt the Sun: They are of
the ſame bigneſs as ours, great and ſmall:
Their Hair is long, and as ſoft as Wool: their
Noſe and Mouth are black before, and their
Talons alſo black: The fat of their Feet mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out, is uſed for pain of the Limbs; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
given to Women in travail, to bring away
the Child; it cauſes alſo a plentiful Sweat.
The ſaid Fat is very ſpongy, and feels very
ſoft; it is beſt to try it up there preſently: I
ſtrove to keep it until I ſhould come home, but
it grew foul, rancid, and ſtinking. I believe
it would be very good to try it up with Orris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root,
for then it would remain the longer good
and ſmell well.</p>
                  <p>The other is like Suet when it is tryed up, it
becometh thin like Train-oyl, or the fat
of Whales: But this is not to be compared to
the other for Vertue and Goodneſs, it is only
uſed in Lamps, where it does not ſtink ſo
much as the Train-oyl: The Skippers met it
out there, and bring it home with them to ſell
it for Train-oyl. Their Fleſh is whitiſh and
fat, like that of a Sheep, but I did not care to
try how it taſted, for I was afraid that my
Hair would turn grey before its time, for the
Seamen are of opinion, that if they eat of it,
it makes their Hair grey. They ſuckle their.

large and thick Cudgels, upon their Heads,
with ſuch blows that would have knock'd down
a Bullock, and yet they did not matter it at all.
When we had a mind to kill them, we were
forced to run them through with our Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>They ſwim from one ſheet of Ice to the
other, they alſo dive under Water, when they
were at one ſide of our Long-boat, they did
dive, and came up again on the other. They
alſo run upon the Land. I did not hear them
roar ſo as ours do, but they only bark.</p>
                  <p>We could not diſcern the young ones from
the old ones, but only by the two furthermoſt
long Teeth, which in the young were hollow
within, but thoſe of the old ones were cloſe and
ſolid. If you burn their Teeth, and powder
them, and give them inwardly, it diſperſeth
coagulated Blood. The young ones keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
cloſe to the old ones; we obſerved that
two young ones and an old one would not
leave one another, for if one ran away, it turn'd
back again immediately as ſoon as it did hear
the others, as if it would come to help
them. The old one run to the young one, and
the young one to the old one, and rather than
they would leave one another, they would ſuffer
themſelves to be all killed.</p>
                  <p>They feed upon the Carcaſſes of Whales, and
near them we killed the moſt: They alſo eat
Men alive when they have an opportunity to
maſter them: They remove or roll away the
Stones of the burying places, open the Coffins,
and eat the dead Men, which many have ſeen,

                  <p>For Sports ſake I went once along with
them upon the Ice, and run one through the
Body with my Sword ſeveral times, which he
did not matter at all; I fell into the Snow up

himſelf off from the Ice into the Sea, and went

                  <p>The <hi>Sea-horſe</hi> is not unlike unto the <hi>Seale</hi> in
the ſhape of the Body, only is much bigger
than the other: He is as big as an Ox: Their
Legs are alſo like thoſe of the <hi>Seale,</hi> for they
have five Claws as well on the fore as the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Feet, but they have only ſhort Nails: Their
Head is thicker, and rounder, and alſo much
ſtronger: Their Skin is an inch thick, chiefly
about the Neck, covered with ſhort Mouſe-coloured
Hair, ſome reddiſh, ſome grey, ſome
have but little Hair, and are mangy, and full
of Scarrs that are bitten, and look as if they
were flea'd; every where about their Joints
their Skin is full of Lines, as the inſide of a
Man's Hand: They have two great and long
Teeth in their upper Jaw-bone, that hang
down below their under Lips, that are about
a foot and two foot long, ſometimes they are
longer: The young ones have no great Teeth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52975:199"/>
at all, but they grow in time as they grow ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
All the Sea-horſes have two firm long
Teeth; yet I have ſeen old ones that had but
one; it may be that ſometimes they looſe them
when they fight, or otherwiſe they may fall
out of themſelves, for I obſerved that ſome of
them had foul, hollow, rotten Teeth. Theſe
two long Teeth are eſteemed beyond Ivory,
becauſe they are ſo very white, and are dearer;
they are cloſe and firm within, and heavy, but
the Root thereof is hollow. Of their Teeth
are made Knife-hafts, Boxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Jut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
make Buttons for their Clothes of the
other Teeth. Their Mouth is very broad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
like a Bullocks, whereon grow above and
underneath ſeveral Briſtles that are hollow
within, and of the bigneſs of a Straw: Of
theſe Briſtles the Seamen make Rings, which
they wear on their Fingers for the Cramp.
Above the uppermoſt Beard they have two
ſemicircular Noſtrils, whereout he blows the
Water, like the Whale, yet with a leſs noiſe.
Their Eyes are at a good diſtance from the
Noſe; they have Eyelids as other fourfooted
Beaſts have; his Eyes are naturally as red as
Blood when he doth not turn them, and I
could ſee no difference when they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
for they always turn'd their Eyes when
they did look upon me, and then they look
much uglier, though they are never handſom.
Their Ears are ſomewhat higher than the Eyes,
but very near to them, which are like thoſe of
the <hi>Seales.</hi> Their Tongue is at leaſt as big as a
Neat's, when it is but newly boiled it may be
eaten, but if it is laid by for two or three days,
it becomes rank, like Train-oyl. Their Neck
is very thick, wherefore he does not readily
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52975:199"/>
this fright of theirs we ſtrike them with Half-pikes,
or long Poles upon their Noſes, and
knock them down half dead, but for all that,
they recover themſelves, and riſe again: Some
of them ſtand upon their defence, bite at, and
run after the Men, and they run as faſt as a
Man, and their lame way of going doth not
hinder them at all, for they ſhove themſelves
along juſt like an Eel: Some run from the Ice
to the Water, and leave a yellow Dung behind
them, which they ſquirt out at their Hunters,
as the Hern does: They ſtink naturally abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably.
Others ſtand in the Water with half
their Belly, and look about them to ſee what
is done upon the Ice: When they are going to
dive under the Water, they hold up their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and make a long Neck: When they jump
from the Ice under Water, and alſo when they
make a dance of <hi>Seales,</hi> as they call it, about
the Ships, they conſtantly dive with their
Heads under water. They have their young
ones by them, one whereof we took away with
us to the Ship alive, but it would not eat any
thing, but did mew juſt like a Cat, and if we
touch'd him he would ſnap at us, ſo we killed
him. The biggeſt of them that I have ſeen
were from five to eight foot long, out of which
we cut ſo much fat, that we filled half a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with it. He that I have drawn here was
eight foot long. Their Fat is about three or
four Fingers thick, it covers the Fleſh juſt under
the Skin, and we do flea it off as a Skin: This
Fat yields the beſt Train-oyl; the Fleſh is quite
black. They have abundance of Blood, as if
they were only filled up with it. They have
great Livers, Lungs, and Hearts, which we eat
after we have drawn out the rankneſs with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52975:200"/>
Water, we boil them, but this Diſn is very
loathſom, ſo that I could not eat it, it taſted ſo
of Train-oyl. He hath abundance of Guts,
which are very ſmall: I found no Fat within
them; their parts of generation is a hard Bone,
like unto that of a Dog, about a ſpan long, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Sinews; ſome were hardly ſo long
as your little finger, and yet they were not
young ones neither. The Cryſtal of their Eye
is not of the ſame colour always, for ſome were
like a Cryſtal, others white, others yellowiſh,
others reddiſh; they are bigger than a Pea; if
one will keep them he muſt let them dry gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or one may wrap them in Linnen Rags,
and ſo lay them in a moiſt place, for elſe they
fly or crack to pieces. I am informed, that
when they couple they are very fierce, ſo that
a Man dares not come near them upon the Ice,
then they bring their Long boats near the Ice,
and ſo kill them out of the Boats. They do
not quickly dye when the Blood is almoſt all
run out, after they have been mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and flea'd, they ſtill live, and it looks ill to
ſee them tumble themſelves about in their own
Blood. We had an Example of that in him
that was eight foot long, for when he was flea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and moſt of the Fat cut off, notwithſtanding
all the blows he had had upon his Head and
Noſe, he would ſtill ſnap at us, and bite about
him, and took hold of a ſhort Pike with his
Teeth after ſuch a rate, as if nothing ailed him.
Then we run a ſhort Pike through his very
Heart and Liver, and there ran out as much
Blood as if it had been a Bullock. The
Maſters of the Ships will not ſuffer theſe naſty
doings in their Ships, for it fouls them mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Not only this was ſo vivacious, but all the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52975:200"/>
turn his Head about, and this is the reaſon why
he turneth his Eyes generally. Their Tails are
ſhort, like thoſe of the <hi>Seale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From their Fleſh we cut no Fat, it is all
mixed together like unto Hogs-fleſh, to which
it is the likeſt: Their Heart and Liver we did
eat; they taſte well enough, chiefly where we
have no great variety of Diſhes. Their Yards
are of a hard Bone, about two foot long, thick
at the bottom, and leſs before, ſomewhat bent
in the middle, at the ſide towards their Belly it
is flat, but it is round without, and it is every
where covered over with Sinews. They
turn also <hi>Knife hafts</hi> and other things out of this
Bone. What their Food is I cannot certainly
tell, they may perhaps eat both <hi>Herbs</hi> and
<hi>Fish;</hi> that they eat <hi>Herbs,</hi> I conclude from
hence, that their Dung looks like Horſe-dung:
That they eat <hi>Fiſh</hi> I judge, becauſe when we
cut the Fat off a Whale one of them did often
take the Skin with him under Water, he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
fling it up, and catch it again. The <hi>Burger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meiſter</hi>

ſome will dive under the Water near unto the

endeavour to get into the Boat.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a Battel a Sea-horſe did once ſtrike

                  <p>When they roar, if they are imitated, they
ſtrive which ſhall get underneath the Water,

They never give over ſo long as one of them
is alive, and if you are forced to fly, becauſe
of their unſpeakable number, they will follow
the Boat till you loſe them out of ſight, for
they cannot follow far, their great number hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
one another. This we found by <hi>Weiheg at</hi>
by <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> where they got together in
great numbers, and made our Boat take in
Water, ſo that we were forced to flee, yet they
followed us as long as we could ſee them, on
the 12th day of <hi>July.</hi> We take them only for
their Teeth: You ſhall ſee almoſt a hundred

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52975:201"/>
I ſaw one in the <hi>English Haven</hi> lying on a
ſheet of Ice, at firſt we took him to be a <hi>Seale,</hi>
but we found it was an old, bald, and mangy
<hi>Sea-horſe.</hi> We gave him ſome blows, which
he took, and dived under Water. When they
ſee them lye upon the Ice, or hear them roar,
they row with their Boats to them, where they
lye in great numbers, but I believe one of them
keeps watch, for I have ſeveral times obſerved
that one of them did ſtrike him that was next
to him with his Tooth, and ſo it went on:
When they awake they riſe up and ſtand upon
their fore-foot, look terribly, and roar, and
ſtrike with their long Teeth into the Ice for
madneſs, and ſo draw themſelves along by the
help thereof, when they run apace, or climb
upon the Ice, as the <hi>Seales</hi> do. Their greateſt
ſtrength lyeth in their Head, and their Skin is
thickeſt about the Neck, it is thicker than that
of an Elk, and it is also a great deal firmer;
wherefore if they were dreſſed like an Elk's
Skin, they would ſerve inſtead of the beſt Buff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat.
When great multitudes of them lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſheet of Ice, and they do awake and fling
themſelves into the Sea, you muſt keep off your
Boat at a diſtance from the Ice, until the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of them are got off, for elſe they would
jump into the Boat to you, and overſet it,
whereof many Inſtances have been; then the
Harponier runs after them on the Ice, or he
darts his Harpon out of the Boat at the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe,</hi>
who runs on a little until he is tired, then
the Men draw on the Rope or Line again, and
fetch him to the Boat, where he begins to reſiſt
to his utmoſt, biting and jumping out of the
Water, and the Harponier runs his Launce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him till he is killed. When they dart the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52975:202"/>
Harpoon at them, they always take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to do it when he is precipitating himſelf
from the Ice, or when he diveth with his Head
under Water, for then his Skin is ſmooth and
extended, and therefore the Harpoon ſtriketh
through the Skin on his Back the better; but
when he lyeth and ſleepeth his Skin is looſe and
wrinkled, ſo that the Harpoon does not pierce
the Skin, but falls off. The Harpoon for a
<hi>Sea-horſe</hi> and the Launce alſo are ſhort, of the
length of one ſpan, or one and a half, and an
inch thick, and the wooden Staff thereof is
about ſix foot long; the Harpoon for a Whale
is much took weak to pierce his thick Skin
withal, yet both of them are very well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,
and of good tough Iron, and not much
hardened. When the <hi>Sea-horſe</hi> is killed, they
take his Head only and leave the reſt, this they
carry on board, where they cut out the Teeth;
the two great ones belong to the Owners or
Merchants of the Ship, but the ſmall Teeth are
not eſteem'd. I cannot but mention that we
went by a Field of Ice, where ſo many <hi>Sea-horſes</hi>
lay that the weight of them made the
Ice even with the Water, but when they were
jumped off into the Sea, we could hardly ſtep
out of our Boat upon it, ſo high was it riſen
out of the Water. It was related to me, by
them that uſed this <hi>Greenland</hi> Trade every Year,
as a certain Truth, that once when they had
no good fortune to catch Whales, they rowed
with their Boats to the <hi>Mufs Iſland,</hi> which was
full of <hi>Sea-horſes,</hi> they ventur'd upon them
couragiouſly with cutting, ſtriking, puſhing,
and ſhooting, ſo that they killed a very great
many of them; but when they ſaw that ſtill
more and more of them got together, they laid

the Arms and Legs, and about the brims there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

of the Armour. Theſe Plates lye exactly round
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:52975:205"/>
one upon the other. The Tall conſiſteth alſo
of five parts; when he expands it, it is like the
Tail of a Bird. He hath two Claws before,
the further part whereof looks ſomewhat like
the Phangs of a Tooth-drawer. He hath 18
Legs, wherof thoſe that are neareſt to the
Claws are the ſhorteſt. The firſt eight Legs
have four Joints, whereof the uppermoſt is the
longeſt, and the undermoſt the ſhorteſt: They
are not hairy at all. The ten hindmoſt Legs,
whereof the furthermoſt are the longeſt, and
the uppermoſt Joint is much thicker and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the lowermoſt long ones have but
two Joints, the Feet whereof are ſomewhat
bended under, and are hairy. On theſe hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
and undermoſt Joints grow out two ſhoots
below, on the reſt but one. He ſhoots very
ſwiftly along in the Water. He was as big as
I have delineated him, according to the Life.
They are Food for the Birds, as I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Whale's Louſe</hi> hath no reſemblance at all
to our Lice, except in the Head, and therefore
it belongs rather to the Cruſtaceous Animals.
Their Scales are as hard as thoſe of the Prawns.
They have a Head like a Louſe, with 4 Horns;
the two ſhort Horns that ſtand out before have
two knobs, like Kettledrum-ſticks; the two other
bended Horns are ſharp before. Its Head hath
almoſt th ſhape of an Acorn, is cut very deep
behind. It hath two Eyes, and but one No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtril.
The Neck is not made of ſtiff Scales, but
its Skin is like that between two Scales or
Plates of a Lobſter. It hath ſix Plates on the
Back; the foremoſt of them is ſhaped like a
Weaver's Shutle. The Tail might be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto a Shield, but it is very ſhort. On the
foremoſt Plate it hath Feet shaped like a Sythe;
they are round before, and bent, like the firſt
Quarter of the Moon; but on the inſide they
are toothed like a Saw, and at the end thereof
there is a ſharp point: On each ſide of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

wherein theſe Oars are moved; theſe they lay
in a croſs one over the other, upon their Back,

you muſt cut them in pieces before you can
pull them from the Skin. He that will have

Above, upon the plain of its Body it
hath five double rows of ſharp knobs or grains;
between each of theſe double rows is a Tingle
row of the ſome knobs, ſo that in all there is
15 rows of knobs on the whole plain. Theſe

As for the reſt, this Plain looketh like the
Back of a Spider, but if he is turned he looketh
neatly, and in this poſture is ſeen in the middle
a five-corner'd plain Star, which I take to be
its Mouth, which he can open and draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like a Purſe. Round about this Star are
ſmall black Spots, in rows, of the ſhape of a Star.
Further forwards, about the middle Star or his
Mouth a broader one is, like unto the Flower
of the Crowsfoot. From the middle Star pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
five Legs or Arms, which have no knobs
where they begin, but begin firſt to have ſome
behind the Flower like ſhaped Star, on both
ſides to the end. The knobs between the Legs
are ſoft to the touch, like the Skin of an Egg.
Their Legs are ſcaley, about three fingers
breadth long, broader at their beginning, where
they have knobs, and afterwards by degrees
they grow narrower. Between the Scales on
both ſides the Knobs come out commonly
three or four together, and look like Warts.
When he ſwims in the Water he ſpreads out
theſe Knobs on each ſide, juſt as a Bird doth his

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52975:207"/>
unto a Sail of the Windmills that the Children
run againſt the Wind withal, or to a piece of
ſuch Croſſes that are broad before, and narrow
where they meet together; that is to ſay, of the
ſhape of a Dove-tail: It feeleth rough: The
lower part of the Body is very neat; in the
middle thereof is a Star with ſix points, which
I take to be his Mouth: About the Mouth he
is ſoft, to the place where his Legs begin: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the beginning of his Legs he had ſoft
Cavities. His Legs are where they begin thick,
and have in the middle a longiſh hollow or
gutter, which feeleth ſoft; on the Brim they
are adorned with Scales that lye one over the
other, no otherwiſe than if they were a row of
Coral, but underneath the Scales are twiſted,
and have in the middle forwards ſmall black
Strokes, but the Scales lye over one another
like unto the Plaits of the <hi>Crawfiſh:</hi> Beſides,
where the Legs come out of the Body, they
ſpread themſelves double into Twigs, and are,
as is ſaid before, hollow in the middle, until
the place where they divide themſelves into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Branches, and ſo grow ſlenderer by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
The undermoſt ſmall Branches are ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
all round, but not twiſted like Ropes;
they are ſharp pointed on their ends like unto
the Feet of a Spider, wherefore the Seamen call
them Sea-ſpiders. When they ſwim in the
Water they hold their Legs together, and ſo
they row along. I had one of this ſort that
was a ſpan long, from the extremity of one
Foot to the other; but this I have delineated
is leſs. The biggeſt are the handſomoſt for
colour. They dye ſoon after they are out of
the Water, and when they are a dying they
bend their Legs towards the Mouth. The
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52975:208"/>
Body, when it is dead, ſoon breaks to pieces,
which is the reaſon that I could not keep the
great ones. See Tab <hi>P,</hi> at <hi>e. Rondeletius,</hi> in
his Book of Fiſh, hath delineated one of
the ſame ſhape, but this is not the ſame ſpecies,
for his is black; neither do I find the Plaits in
his, except he that drew it did not obſerve
them. Some of both theſe ſorts I got on the

entangled about a Rock: On this they hung,

                  <head>I. Of the Macarel.</head>
                  <p>This Fiſh is like unto a <hi>Herring</hi> in his ſhape,
but hath on his Back a large Finn, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
below it a very ſmall one. Then lower
there is another greater and broader one, but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52975:208"/>
not ſo high as the uppermoſt: Underneath this
are five ſmall ones, that are all of the ſame big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and at an equal diſtance one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Very near to the Tail there is another
leſs one; ſo that on the whole Back there is
two great ones, and ſeven little ones. Near
unto the Gills is a Finn on each ſide: under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Belly there are again on each ſide
one almoſt of the ſame bigneſs of that that is
near to the Gills. Underneath towards the
Tail is one of the ſame bigneſs of the third on
the Back. Behind this there are again five of
an equal bigneſs; and below that ſtill a leſs one;
ſo that thoſe of the lower part of the Back are
equal to thoſe of the lower part of the Belly.
Their Head is like unto that of a <hi>Herring.</hi> He hath
a great many ſmall holes on the Cover of his
Gills, and alſo underneath the Eyes. They
have a great variety of colours, that look more
glorious when they are alive than when they
are dead, for when they are a dying the colours
fade and grow pale. From his Back towards
the Side he hath black Stroaks. The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
part of his Back is blew till to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
and the other half underneath it is green,
and as if ſome blew did ſhine through it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
his Belly he is as white as Silver, and
his Finns are white every where. All the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of this Fiſh ſhine like to a Silver or Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Ground, done over with thin, tranſparent
or illuminating colours. Their Eyes are black.
It is the beautifuleſt Fiſh of all that ever I ſaw.
This that I deſcribe here was catched in the
North Sea; afterwards, on the 27th day of
<hi>June,</hi> in the Year 1673. we did catch ſome
Macarels behind <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Iſland of
<hi>St. Kilda,</hi> which were half blind; it is occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52975:209"/>
by a black Skin that groweth over their
Eyes in the Winter, and cometh off again in
the beginning of the Summer. We do not ſee
them in the Winter, for they run towards the
North: In the Summer we ſee them in the
North Sea, and I have ſeen them alſo in <hi>Spain.</hi>
We caught them after the following manner;
we faſtened a Bullet that weighed about two
or three pounds to a Line, about a Fathom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the end, whereon we had faſtened
a Hook; this Hook we baited with a piece of
a red Cloth, and ſo we flung it into the Sea,
and towed it behind our Ship, then when the
<hi>Macarel</hi> doth <hi>ſwiftly ſhoot</hi> at it, he bites
upon the Hook, and ſo is hung, which you
preſently, perceive by its pulling, as you do
when you catch any other Fiſh, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Rope of its own accord doth pull
or draw very hard, by reaſon of the Sea, ſo
that if you ſhould rowl it about your Hand, it
would benumb your Hand in a little time to
that degree, that you would not be ſenſible, if
one ſhould cut it; wherefore they tye their
Ropes to the carved Work on the Stern of the
Ship, ſo that ſometimes many of them are tyed
to the Ship by one another, when the Ship
ſails apace, but this doth hinder the Ship very
much in its ſailing, and I dare ſay two ſuch
Ropes draw as much as a Man's Strength.
They catch them alſo with <hi>Herring,</hi> with a piece
whereof they bait the Hook, at which they
bite ſooner than at a red piece of Rag of Cloth.
They eat beſt if you boil, or broil, or roaſt
them freſh as they are caught, or dry them:
They are hard to be digeſted.</p>

                  <p>It is peculiar to this Fiſh to have two Finns
on his Back, the foremoſt whereof hath very
long Strings, about two inches high above the
Back, the hindmoſt Finn of the Back is not
ſo high, but yet it goeth a great way all along
the Back and hath no ſuch Strings. He hath
no Gills, in the room of them he hath two
blowing holes in his Neck, and on each ſide of
theſe holes there are two ſhort Finns, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
theſe, on each ſide a broad one: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
his Belly he hath a long very narrow
Finn, that reaches to the Tail. His Head is
oblong, compoſed of many Bones: He hath
before on his Noſe a raiſed part: His Tail is
about an inch broad: His Body is long, thin,
and roundiſh, of a greyiſh Silver colour, and
ſhining: His Shape is likeſt to that of a young
Hay, as well the Head as the reſt of the Body.
They are caught between the <hi>Bears-Iſland</hi> and

theſe Finns are not like them of ſmall or little
Fiſhes, that are boney, joined together with a

but a ſmall noiſe, but the blowing of a Whale
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52975:210"/>
roareth that you may hear it afar off. His Eyes
are very ſmall in proportion to his bigneſs. I
have ſeen them ſixteen, eighteen, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
twenty foot long. Their Back is of a
brown colour; the Head brown and marbled;
underneath their Belly they are white. They
run very near unto the Ships, ſo that one may
puſh at them with a Stick, and they keep up
with a Ship for a long time, which other Fiſhes
do not, for when they ſee the Ships they are
afraid of them. They all ſwin againſt the
Wind, as <hi>Whales, Finn-fiſh,</hi> and <hi>Dolphins.</hi> I am
of opinion, that they endeavour to run away
from the storm, and that they find ſome Pain
or other in their Bodies ſome days before, for
you ſhall ſee ſome Fiſh tumble about ſtrangely

they ſay that they hold up their Horns, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Teeth, out of the Water, and ſo go in

on each ſide many pointed Teeth or Peggs,
like a Comb. He hath two Finns on his Back,
the uppermoſt of them is like the <hi>Butskopf</hi>'s,
the undermoſt hath behind, towards the Tail a

Belly he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>our, on each ſide two, the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
thereof towards the Head are the broadeſt
and longeſt, but the lowermoſt are ſomewhat
ſhorter, and narrower; they ſtand directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
the uppermoſt Finns of the Back.
The Tail is like unto a piece of Board, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Dyers widen of ſtretch their Stockins,
which is pointed behind and underneath. The
Tail is not divided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Towards the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Finn of the Back the Tail is thinner.
The other ſhape, from the top to the Tail, is
like a Man's naked Arm. The Noſtrils are
oblong. The Eyes ſtand high out of his Head.
Their Mouths are juſt directly underneath the
Eyes. They are in bigneſs from two to twenty

                  <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of them; they have
two Finns on their Backs, the higheſt whereof
is like to the uppermoſt of the <hi>Butskopf,</hi> but the
lowermoſt is of an equal breadth at the top and
bottom, but it is hollowed out like a Sickle:
He hath ſix Finns underneath his Belly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the foremoſt two are the longeſt, and ſhaped
like a Tongue, but the two middlemoſt are
ſomewhat broader than thoſe towards the Tail,
and of the ſame ſhape; the two laſt underneath

bottom, ſomething ſhorter than the middle
ones. The Tail is of a peculiar ſhape, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one half part of that of the <hi>Sword-fiſh,</hi> but it
is ſplit below; and the other part is like a Leaf
of a Lilly. He hath a long Noſe. The whole
Fiſh is long, round, and thin, and he is thickeſt
towards the Head: his Mouth is ſhap'd as that
of the <hi>Sword-fiſh;</hi> it is full of ſharp Teeth, three
upper and three under rows, one by the other:
his Eyes ſtand ſomething more out before than
behind, after the ſame faſhion as thoſe of the
<hi>Sword-fiſh,</hi> they are oblong, and very clear: he
hath five Gills on each ſide, as the <hi>Sword-fiſh:</hi>
his Skin is hard and thick, and rough if you
touch it or ſtrike it upwards; it is of a greyiſh
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52975:212"/>
colour; they are from one fathom long to
three: It is a very devouring Fiſh, and bites
great pieces form the <hi>Whale,</hi> as if they had been
dug out with Shovels. They devour of many
<hi>Whales,</hi> all the Fat underneath the Water, and
this is the reaſon that the Seamen ſay, <hi>They
have caught half a Whale that was dead.</hi> And
the Birds do help them alſo, and what is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

They have a large Liver, whereof they make
Oyl. Out of their Backs we cut the Fleſh, which
we hang up for ſome days in the open Air,
then we boil and roaſt it, and this taſts very
well, when we have nothing that is better.
They do not fling away the <hi>Hays</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> but
ſell them: The little ones are the beſt. They
are very eager after Man's Fleſh, and eat many
a Man that goeth to ſwim or waſh in the Sea,
whereof we have many Inſtances. They are
eaſily caught after the following manner; we
take a great Hook faſtned to a ſtrong Iron
Chain, baited with a piece of Fleſh, and let it
hang down into the Sea; the <hi>Hay</hi> as ſoon as he

                  <p>THE Fiſh properly called the <hi>Whale,</hi> for
whoſe ſake our Ships chiefly undertake
the Voyage to <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> is differing from
other <hi>Whales</hi> in his Finns and Mouth, which is
without Teeth, but inſtead thereof long, black,
ſomewhat broad, and horny Flakes, all jagged
like Hairs: he differs from the Finn-fiſh in his
Finns, for the Finn-fiſh hath a great Finn on
his Back, but the Whale, properly ſo called,
hath none on his Back; and there is two Finns
behind his Eyes of a bigneſs proportionable to
the Whale, covered with a thick black Skin,
delicately marbled with white Strokes, or as
you ſee in Marble, Trees, Houſes, or the like
things repreſented. In the Tail of one of the
Fiſhes was marbled very delicately this number
1222 very even and exact, as if they had been
painted upon it on purpoſe. This marbling
on the Whale is like Veins in a piece of Wood,
that run ſtreight through, or elſe round about
the center or pith of a Tree; and ſo go both
white and yellow ſtrokes through the thick and
the thin ſtrokes, that is like Parchment or
Vellam, and give to the Whale an incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Beauty and Ornament. When theſe Finns
are cut up, you find underneath the thick Skin
Bones that look like unto a Man's Hand;
when it is opened, and the Fingers are expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

ſtiff Sinews, which flye up and rebound again

the Sinews of great Fiſh, as of a Sturgeon, or
of ſome four footed Beaſts generally do. You
may cut pieces of theſe Sinews of the bigneſs
of your Head, they ſqueeze together when
thrown on the Ground, and ſo rebound very
high, and as ſwift as an Arrow from the String
of a long Bow. The Whale hath no other
Finns but theſe two wherewith he ſteers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as a Boat is rowed with two Oars.</p>
                  <p>Their Tail doth not ſtand up as the Tails of
almoſt any other Fiſh, but it doth lye horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
as that of the <hi>Finn-fiſh, Butskopf, Dolphin,</hi>
and the like, and it is three, three and an half,
and four fathoms broad. The Head is the
third part of the Fiſh, and ſome have bigger
Heads; on the upper and under Lip are ſhort
Hairs before. Their Lips are quite plain,
ſomewhat bended like an S, and they end un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
the Eyes before the two Finns:
Above the uppermoſt bended Lip he hath
black Streaks, ſome are darkiſh brown, and they
are crooked as the Lips are. Their Lips are
ſmooth, and quite black, round like the quarter
of a Circle; when they draw them together they
lock into one another: Within, on the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Lip is the Whale-bone, of a brown, black,
and yellow colour, with ſtreaks of ſeveral co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
as the Bones of a <hi>Finn-fiſh.</hi> The Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones
of ſome Whales are blew, and light blew,
which two are reckoned to come from young
Whales. In one of my Cutts here you may ſee
the Whale-bone in the Tab. <hi>Q</hi> marked with <hi>a.</hi>
In the other Cutt, where his Mouth is ſhut up,
you do not ſee the Whale bone. Juſt before,
on the under Lip, is a cavity or hole which the
upper Lip fits exactly into, as a Knife into a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52975:215"/>
Sheath. I do really believe, that he draws the
Water that he bloweth out through this hole,
and ſo I have been informed alſo by Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>Within his Mouth is the Whale-bone, all
hairy as a Horſe's Hair, as it is alſo in the <hi>Finn-fiſh,</hi>
and it hangs down from both ſides all about
his Tongue. The Whale-bone of ſome Whales
is ſomewhat bended like unto a Cimeter, and
others like unto a half-Moon.</p>
                  <p>The ſmalleſt Whale-bone is before, in his
Mouth, and behind towards his Throat; and
the middlemoſt is the greateſt and longeſt, it
is ſometimes about two or three Men's length,
from whence you may eaſily conjecture how
large this Fiſh muſt be. On one ſide, all in a
row, there is two hundred and fifty pieces of
Whale bone, and as many alſo on the other
ſide, which maketh five hundred in all, and
there is more over and above this number, for
they let the leaſt Whale-bone of all remain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they cannot well come at it to cut it out,
becauſe it is very narrow where the two Lips
meet together. The Whale-bone is in a flat
row one piece by the other, ſomewhat bended
within, and towards the Lips every where like
a half-Moon.</p>
                  <p>The Whale-bone is broad at the top, where
it ſticketh faſt to the upper Lip, every where
overgrown with hard and white Sinews towards
the Root, ſo that between two pieces of Whale-bone
you may put in your hand. Theſe white
Sinews look like boiled <hi>Sea-catts</hi> or <hi>Black-fiſh</hi> (in
Spaniſh called <hi>Cattula la Mar</hi>) they are of a
pleaſant Smell, ſo that we might eat of them;
they are not tough at all, but break as eaſily as
Cheeſe, but they did not taſte ſo well; when
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52975:215"/>
they putrifie or rot they ſmell horribly, juſt like
unto a foul or rotten Tooth. Where the
Whale-bone is broadeſt, as underneath by the
Root, there groweth ſmall Whale-bone, the
other greater, as you ſee ſmall and large Trees
one amongſt the other in a Wood. I believe
the ſmall Whale-bone doth not grow bigger,
as one might think that ſome of the great pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereof might come out, and that ſo this
ſmall Whale-bone might grow up again in the
room thereof, or as in Children the Hair grows
again when cut off; but it is not ſo, for this
Whale-bone is quite another ſort, for it is from
one end to t'other of an equal thickneſs and full
of long Jacks like Horſes Hair. The Whale-bone
is underneath narrow and pointed, and all
overgrown with Hair, that it may not hurt
that that is young: But without the Whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
hath a Cavity, for it is turned juſt like
unto a Gutter wherein the Water runs, where
it lyeth one over the other, as the Shields or
Plaits of <hi>Craw-fiſh,</hi> or the Pan-tiles of an Houſe,
that lye one over the other, for elſe it might
eaſily wound or hurt the under Lips. I am of
opinion that one might uſe Whale-bone in any
thing that we uſe Boards for, for they make of
Whale-bone, Boxes, Knife-hafts, Walking-ſticks,
and the like. I ſhould think that out of the
Hair of the Fiſh might be made ſomething, as
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do out of the wild <hi>Sempervive
Aloes,</hi> (by them called <hi>Savila</hi>) they prepare it
like Flax or Hemp, and ſo make Packthreads
Clothes and the like Manufactures of it.</p>
                  <p>To cut the Whale-bones out is alſo a peculiar
Trade, and abundance of Iron Tools belong
thereunto. The lower part of the Whale's
Mouth is commonly white. The Tongue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52975:216"/>
amongſt the Whale-bones; it is very cloſe
tyed to the undermoſt Chap or Lip; it is very
large and white, with black ſpots at the edges:
It is a ſoft ſpongy Fat, which cannot eaſily be
cut; it makes a great deal of work to the Cutter
(for ſo they call the Man that doth cut the Fat
into ſmall pieces with a large Knife, which
cannot well be done with other Knifes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is tough and ſoft) wherefore they fling
the Tongue away, elſe they might get five, ſix
or ſeven Barrels of Train-oyl out of it; but, as
I ſaid before, they fling it away, becauſe of its
ſoftneſs; and this is the moſt pleaſing Food for
the <hi>Sword-fiſh.</hi> Upon his Head is the Hovel or
Bump before the Eyes and Finns: At the top
of this Bump, on each ſide, is a Spout-hole,
two over-againſt one another, which are ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on each ſide like an S, or as the hole that
is cut on a Violin, whereout he doth blow the
Water very fiercely, that it roars like a hollow
Wind which we hear when the Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into a Cave, or againſt the corner of a
Board, or like an Organ-pipe. This may be
heard at a leagues diſtance, although you do
not ſee him by reaſon of the thick and foggy
Air. The <hi>Whale</hi> bloweth or ſpouts the Water
fierceſt of all when he is wounded, then it
ſounds as the roaring of the Sea in a great
Storm, and as we hear the Wind in a very hard
Storm. Behind this Bump the <hi>Whale</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more bended in than the <hi>Finn-fiſh,</hi> yet
when they ſwim you cannot well diſcern one
from the other, except you obſerve it very
exactly, for it is only the Finn on the <hi>Finn-fiſh</hi>'s
Back that diſtinguiſhes him from the <hi>Whale.</hi>
The Head of the <hi>Whale</hi> is not round at the top,
but ſomewhat flat, and goeth down ſloaping,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52975:216"/>
like unto the tyling of an Houſe, to the under
Lip. The under Lip is broader than the <hi>Whale</hi>
is in any part of the Body, and broadeſt in the
middle; before and behind it is ſomething
narrower, according to the ſhape of the Head.
In one word, all the whole Fiſh is ſhaped like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Shoomaker's Laſt, if you look upon it from
beneath. Behind the Knob or Bump where
the Finns are, between that and the Finns, are
his Eyes, which are not much bigger than thoſe
of a Bullock, with Eye-lids and Hair, like
Mens Eyes. The Cryſtal of the Eye is not
much bigger than a Pea, clear, white, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent
as Cryſtal; the colour of ſome is yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh,
of others quite white: The <hi>Seale</hi>'s are
three times as big as thoſe of the <hi>Whale.</hi> The
Eyes of the <hi>Whale</hi> are placed very low, almoſt
at the end of the upper Lip. Some bring along
with them from <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> ſome Bones, which
they pretend to be the Ears of the <hi>Whale;</hi> but I
can ſay nothing to this, becauſe I never ſaw
any; but thus much I do remember, that I
have heard them ſay that they lye very deep.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Whale</hi> doth not hear when he ſpouts the
Water, wherefore he is eaſieſt to be ſtruck at
that time. His Belly and Back are quite red,
and underneath the Belly they are commonly
white, yet ſome of them are Coal black; moſt
of them that I ſaw were white. They look
very beautiful when the Sun ſhines upon them,
the ſmall clear Waves of the Sea that are over
him gliſten like Silver. Some of them are
marbled on their Back and Tail. Where he
hath been wounded there remaineth always a
white Scar. I underſtood of one of our Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooniers
that he once caught a <hi>Whale</hi> at <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen</hi>
that was white all over. Half white I
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52975:217"/>
have ſeen ſome, but one above the reſt, which
was a Female, was a beautiful one; ſhe was all
over marbled black and yellow: Thoſe that are
black are not all of the ſame colour, for ſome
of them are as black as Velvet, others of a Coal
black, others of the colour of a <hi>Tench.</hi> When
they are well they are as ſlippery as an Eel,
but one may ſtand upon them, becauſe they are
ſo ſoft, that the Fleſh thereof giveth way to our
weight: And the outward Skin is thin, like
Parchment, and is eaſily pulled off with ones
Hands when the Fiſh grows hot. I know not
whether the Skin is thus burnt by the inward
heat of the Fiſh when he lies dry a floating
upon the Water. The Sun beams ſeem not to
have ſo great power as to dry the Skin ſo.
We found our firſt <hi>Whale</hi> was ſo much heated
by his hard ſwimming that he ſtunk alive; we
could pull off great pieces of the Skin, of the
length of a Man, which we could not do to
other Fiſhes that were not ſo much heated:
But from <hi>Whales</hi> that have been dead ſome
days, and are dry, where alſo the Sun ſhines
upon them, or when it doth not rain, one may
pull off a great deal of the Skin, but it ſtinks
baſely of Train-oyl, or Fat, that ferments thro'
the Pores of the Skin. I know not what uſe to
make of this Skin, but I have ſeen Women tye
their Flax with it about the Diſtaff.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Whale</hi> loſeth this beautiful white colour
when it groweth dry, for before there is more
black amongſt it, which maketh the white ſhew
the better, neither doth the black look ſo well
after it is dry, for it groweth then browniſh.
When you hold the Skin againſt the light, you
ſee many ſmall Pores in it, where the Sweat co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
through.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:52975:217"/>
The Yard of the <hi>Whale</hi> is a ſtrong Sinew,
and according as they are in bigneſs, ſix, ſeven
or eight foot long, as I have ſeen my ſelf.
Where this Yard is fixed the Skin is doubled,
ſo that it lies juſt like a Knife in a Sheath,
where you can ſee nothing of the Knife but
only a little of the Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t. The part of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Female is juſt ſhaped like as that of
four-legged Beaſts. At the ſides of <hi>Pudendum</hi>
ſtand out the two Breaſts, with Nipples on
them, like unto thoſe of Cows: Some of theſe
Breaſts are quite white, ſome are ſpeckled with
black and blew ſpots, like a <hi>Lapwing</hi>'s Egg.
When they have no young ones they have but
ſmall Breaſts. I am informed, that when they
couple together they ſtand upright, cloſe to one
another, with their Heads out of the Water;
which ſeemeth very probable, becauſe they
cannot keep long under Water, and chefily in
ſuch a heat. They ſay that they have but two
young ones at a time, for they have never
found more than two young ones within them.
How long they carry their young is not eaſily
determined; ſome ſay they go as long as a Cow,
but it is very uncertain, he that will believe it
may. The Sperm of a <hi>Whale,</hi> when it is freſh,
ſmells like Wheaten-flower that is boiled in
Water, when it is ſtill hot it is very white;
one may draw it out in Threads like hot Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-wax,
Glew, or the like; when it groweth
cold it turns to a Musk-colour, and ſmells ſtrong,
and little red Worms grow in it, like unto the
grey ones, that you may ſee in the Tab. <hi>P.</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with <hi>C.</hi> I have tryed ſeveral ways to keep
this Sperm ſweet and freſh, but I could never
make it like unto that <hi>Sperma-caeti</hi> which the
<hi>Apothecaries</hi> ſell in their Shops. One may dip
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52975:218"/>
of this Sperm whole Pails-full out of the Water,
for as well this as that of the <hi>Sea-horſes</hi> and <hi>Seals</hi>
ſwims upon the Sea like Fat, and we ſee abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of it in calm weather, ſo that it doth
make the Sea all foul and ſlimy. I tryed to
dry this Sperm of a <hi>Whale</hi> in the Sun, and it
lookt like Snot, and when the thin Slime was dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away from it, looked like unto <hi>Fila meteorica,</hi>
ſave only that they are thicker and more heavy.
Another parcel I boiled in Sea-water, juſt as I
took it out of the Water, until the Water was
evaporated from it, then I had ſome Sea-ſalt,
and a naſty brown Slime. The third parcel I
boiled in freſh Water, and afterwards again in
Sea-water, and the longer I kept it afterwards
the more it ſtunk, and the harder it grew. The
fourth parcel I intended to keep in the Salt
Water, with an intention to carry it along with
me to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> but it diſſolved in the Water,
like Glew, and the Water became foul and
ſtinking, ſo that I could no ways make it like
the <hi>Sperma-ceti</hi> of the <hi>Apothecaries.</hi> Where the
Yard doth begin it is four-ſquare, conſisting of
many ſtrong Sinews; if you dry them they are
as tranſparent as Fiſh-glew; out of theſe Sinews
the Seamen make twiſted Whips. Their Bones
are hard, like unto them of great four-footed
Beaſts, but porous, like unto a Spunge, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Marrow, when that is conſumed out
they will hold a great deal of Water, for the
holes are big, like unto the Wax of a Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb.
Two great and ſtrong Bones hold up
the under Lip, they lye one againſt the other,
and both of them make a Figure like unto an
Half-moon, but one alone by itſelf makes a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
like to a quarter of the Moon. Some of
theſe Bones I ſaw at <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> lying on the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52975:218"/>
                     <hi>Strand,</hi> about 20 foot long, of a very white
colour, as if they had been calcined. Our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
bring ſome of theſe along with them home,
to ſhew us how big ſome <hi>Whales</hi> are, which are
already whitened to their Hands, for thoſe that
come freſh from a Whale ſtink abominably, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the Marrow that is in them. Their
Fleſh is courſe and hard, m and it doth look like
unto that of a Bull; it is intermixd with many
Sinews; it is very dry and lean when it is boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becauſe their Fat is only between their Fleſh
and Skin: Some looks green and blew as our
Pouder'd Beef, chiefly where the Muſcles meet
together; if one lets it lye a little, it grows
black and ſtinking. The Fleſh of the Tail
boils tendereſt, and is not quite ſo dry as that
of the Body. When we have a mind to eat of a
<hi>Whale,</hi> we cut great pieces off before the Tail,
where it is four-ſquare, and boil it like other
Meat; good Beef I prefer far before it, yet
rather than be ſtarved, I adviſe to eat <hi>Whale's
Fleſh,</hi> for none of our Men dyed of it, and the
French-men did eat almoſt daily of it, they
fling it ſometimes on the tops of their Tubs,
and let it lye until it is black, and yet they eat
it for all that. The Fleſh of a <hi>Whale,</hi> as well as
that of the <hi>Sealeſ,</hi> is alone by itſelf, and the Fat
at the top thereof, between the Fleſh and Skin.
It is about ſix inches thick on the Back and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but I have alſo ſeen it a foot thick, upon a
Finn, according as they are great or little
Fiſh. The Fat of their under Lip is thicker
than two foot, and is the thickeſt of all the
<hi>Whale.</hi> The Tongue, as I have ſaid before, is
faſten'd to it, but very ſoft, but it coſts too much
labour to cut it. The Fat of ſome Whales is
much thicker than than that of others, as it is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52975:219"/>
with other Animals or Men, where one is much
leaner that another. In the Fat are little Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news,
interſperſed which hold the Oyl, as a
Sponge does Water, which one may ſqueeze
out. The other ſtrong Sinews are chiefly about
the Tail, where it is thinneſt, for with it he
turns and winds himſelf, as a Ship is turned by
the Rudder, but his Finns are his Oars, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his bigneſs he rows himſelf along
with them as ſwiftly as a Bird flies, and doth
make a long track in the Sea, as a great Ship
doth when under Sail, ſo that it remains divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
for a while.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Whales of the North Cape</hi> (they are ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becauſe they are caught between <hi>Spitzber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
and <hi>Norway</hi>) being not ſo big, therefore do
not yield ſo much Fat as thoſe of <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi>
for of thoſe of the <hi>North Cape</hi> you ſhall not fill
above ten, twenty, or thirty Cardels of Fat;
the middling ſort of thoſe of <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> yield
commonly ſeventy, eighty, or ninety, and they
are about fifty or ſixty foot long. Our biggeſt
<hi>Whale</hi> was fifty three foot long, and we cut off
him as much Fat as filled ſeventy Cardels; his
Tail was about three fathom and an half broad.
The Skipper <hi>Peter Peterſon</hi> of <hi>Frieſland</hi> informed
me, that they found a dead Whale, whereof
they did cut as much fat as filled One hundred
and thirty Cardels, his Tail was three fathom
and an half broad, but he was not much longer
than our biggeſt, as one may gueſs by the Tail
alſo, yet much thicker and fatter; from whence
one may in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, that they do not grow much
longer, but only in thickneſs or fatneſs, as we
daily ſee: Nor did I ever hear that a bigger or
fatter <hi>Whale</hi> was ever caught, and even thoſe
but ſeldom, for if there were many ſuch, our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52975:219"/>
Ships could not hold ſo much Fat as is cut from
ten, fifteen, or twenty <hi>Whales,</hi> as ſome of them
have ſometimes taken in.</p>
                  <p>Over the Fat is, beſides the uppermoſt thin
Skin already deſcribed, another Skin of about
an inch thick, proportionable to the bigneſs
of the <hi>Whale;</hi> it is coloured according to the
colour of the Fiſh; if the Fiſh be black, this
undermoſt thick Skin is ſo; if the outmoſt Skin
that is like Parchment is white or yellow, the
thick one underneath it is of the ſame colour.
This thick Skin is not ſtiff nor tough at all, ſo
that one might dreſs it like Leather, but it
dries juſt like unto the Fungus that grows on
Elder, which we call <hi>Jews-ears,</hi> which are
thick and turgid when they are green and
freſh, but brittle when they are dried; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Skin is not eſteemed at all. This and
the uppermoſt thin Skin that covers this, are
the occaſion that the <hi>Whale,</hi> which I take to
be the ſtrongeſt and biggeſt of all Creatures in
the Water, cannot make uſe of his Strength,
becauſe they are too ſoft to do much.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing to relate of the inward parts
of the <hi>Whale,</hi> but only that his Guts ſeem to
be of a Fleſh colour; they were full of Wind,
and the Dung that was within them was yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>The Food of the <hi>Whale,</hi> as it is believed, are
the ſmall Sea-Snails, the Draught whereof you
may ſee at <hi>c,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>Q,</hi> whereof I have
made mention in another place, which ſome
take for Spiders; whether theſe afford ſuch
great nouriſhment, I cannot exactly tell. Some
ſay, that they live only by the Wind, but then
methinks they muſt have nothing in them but
Wind, which I found otherwiſe. I was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52975:220"/>
by others, that about <hi>Hitland</hi> a ſmall <hi>Whale</hi>
was caught, had about a Barrel of <hi>Herrings</hi> in
his Belly. They are ſmaller <hi>Whales</hi> than thoſe
we catch at <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> but there is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in catching of them, they being leſs and
nimbler than the great ones, to whom the
Water doth not ſo eaſily give way as to theſe,
for they jump and play in the Water, and keep
their Tail commonly above Water, ſo that one
dare not come near to them to launce them.
Concerning the <hi>Whale</hi>'s Valour, we do find
that he is not very couragious, according to
his ſtrength and bigneſs, for if he ſees a Man
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a Long-boat, he goeth under Water, and
runs away. I did never ſee nor hear, that out
of his own Malice he endeavour'd to hurt any
Man, but when he is in danger; what then he
doth is of neceſſity, and then he doth not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
a man no more than a Sand, nor a Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat,
for he doth beat them all into Splinters.
His Strength may be gueſs'd by the Fiſhermen
that catch with great Nets other Fiſhes, when
they are going to draw their Nets towards the
Land, what a great Strength they muſt uſe,
which is nothing at all to be compared to his
Strength. The <hi>Whale</hi> doth ſwim ſometimes
away with ſome thouſand fathoms of Rope-line,
ſwifter a great deal than a Ship can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ail, or a
Bird can fly, ſo that it makes their Heads gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
yet a great Ship is too many for him, for
although he ſhould ſtrike againſt it with his
Tail, yet it doth him more hurt than he does
the Ship.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Whales</hi> keep, in the Spring, Weſtward
from <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> near old <hi>Greenland</hi> and the
Iſland of <hi>John Majen;</hi> then they run Eaſtwards
to <hi>Spitzbergen:</hi> After them come the <hi>Finn-fiſh,</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:52975:220"/>
and then there is no more <hi>Whales</hi> ſeen. It is
probable they go after a tolerable cold place;
for after that, I have ſeen <hi>Finn-fiſh</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Sea in the year 1671. in the Month of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and in the Year 1672. in <hi>January,</hi> and alſo
afterwards in the year 1673. in the <hi>Straights</hi> of
<hi>Gibralter</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſwims againſt the Wind, as all other
<hi>Whales</hi> or great Fiſh do. The <hi>Sword-fiſh</hi> is his
mortal Enemy, he might rather be called <hi>Comb-fiſh,</hi>
becauſe his long Tooth is on each ſide full
of Teeth or Prickles, moſt like a Comb. In
our Home-Voyage to <hi>Hamburg</hi> I ſaw an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this Enmity of a <hi>Northcaper-Whale</hi> and a
<hi>Sword-fiſh,</hi> near to <hi>Hitland,</hi> they fought and
ſtruck at one another ſo vehemently, that the
Water flew about like Duſt, ſometimes one and
ſometimes the other was uppermoſt; the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was a little ſtormy, or elſe we had ſtayed
to have ſeen the end of the Battel, ſo we were
forced to leave them.</p>
                  <p>The dead <hi>Whale</hi> killed by the <hi>Sword-fiſh</hi> ſtinks
at a great diſtance, but not preſently, and thoſe
that have been wounded ſome days before they
are caught ſmell the worſt, and drive high
above the Sea-water, when others drive even
with the Water; and ſome ſink.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Whales</hi> have, as well as other Beaſts,
their peculiar Diſtempers and Aliments, but
I can only write of what I know by Hear-ſay.
An ancient and experienc'd Harpoonier infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
me, that he did once catch a <hi>Whale</hi> that
was very feeble, and that all his Skin, but
chiefly near unto the Tail and Finns, hung like
Films, as if they were old Rags dragg'd along
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52975:221"/>
behind him, and that he was quite fean, ſo
they made but very little Train oyl of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at,
for the fat was quite white, and light withal as
an empty Honey-comb. Before a Tempeſt
they beat the Water, that it doth fly about like
upon Duſt, with their Tail; but they have
the greateſt ſtrength when they ſtrike ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as if they did mow, ſo that one might
think that they were in a great agony, and
a dying. They are mightily tormented by the
Lice, whereof I have treated more at large
above: The Draught of this Louſe you may
ſee at <hi>d,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>Q.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Wounds that are given unto the <hi>Whale</hi>
by the Harpoons, into the fat, heal up again
of their own accord, for the Salt-water cannot
ſtick on it. Many <hi>ſuch Fiſhes</hi> are caught, that
have been ſtruck by others with a Harpoon,
and are healed up again, and ſo have white
Scarrs.</p>

               <head type="sub">How they Catch the Whale.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, it is to be obſerved, that when it is like
to be a good Year to catch <hi>Whales</hi> in, there
is many <hi>White-fiſh</hi> to be ſeen before: But where
we ſee many <hi>Seales,</hi> there we do not expect to
meet with many <hi>Whales;</hi> for they ſay, that
they eat up the Food of the <hi>Whale,</hi> wherefore
the <hi>Whales</hi> will not ſtay in ſuch empty places,
but go to find out better, and ſo come to <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>
for there, at the Shoar, we ſee great
plenty of the ſmall Sea-ſnails, (you may ſee
them marked with <hi>e</hi> in the Tab. <hi>Q</hi>) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſome other ſmall Fiſh. They are caught
after the following manner: When they ſee
<hi>Whales,</hi> or when they hear them blow or ſpout,
they call in to the Ship, <hi>Fall, fall;</hi> then every
Body muſt be ready to get into the Long-boat
that he doth belong to, commonly ſix Men go
into every Long-boat, and ſometimes ſeven,
according as the Long-boats are in bigneſs, they
all of them row until they come very near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>whale,</hi> then doth the Harpoonier ariſe,
who ſits always before in the Boat, where the
Harpoon or the ſharp Iron made like unto an
Arrow fixed to a Stick, doth alſo lye on the
foremoſt Board of the Long-boat, which the
Seamen call the <hi>Staffen,</hi> that is, the broad piece
of Wood that cometh up before the Boat from
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52975:222"/>
the bottom, and ſtands up higher than all the
reſt. But when the <hi>Whale</hi> runs ſtreight down
towards the bottom underneath the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then he doth draw the Rope very hard, ſo
that the upper part of the Long-boat is even
with the ſurface of the Water; nay, he would
certainly pull it down to the bottom, if they
ſhould not give him Rope enough: This he
doth commonly where the Sea is deepeſt; and
this doth require an incredible force to draw ſo
many hundred fathoms of Rope under Water.
This giveth me occaſion to remember, that
when we on the 27th of <hi>April,</hi> in the Year
1672. did fling out our Lead, near St. <hi>Kilda,</hi>
behind <hi>Scotland,</hi> into the Sea, where it was 120
fathom deep when the Weather was calm, and
when we would pull it up again, it was ſo heavy
that 20 Men had much to do to heave it.
The Harpoonier taketh his Harpoon, and holds
the Point or the Iron thereof, together with the
Fore-runner, towards his Left hand: this is a
Rope or Line of five or ſeven fathom long,
about an inch thick, and is laid up round like
a Ring, that it may not hinder the Harpoon
when it is flung, for as ſoon as he doth fling or
dart the Harpoon this Line follows, for it is
more plyable than the reſt that are faſtened to
it, wherewith they purſue the <hi>Whale.</hi> It is made
of the fineſt and ſofteſt Hemp, and not daubed
with Tarr, but it doth ſwell in the Water, and
ſo it grows hard. The Harpoonier darts his
Harpoon with the Right hand at the Fiſh; as
you may ſee by <hi>m</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A.</hi> When the
<hi>Whale</hi> is hit with the Harpoon, all the Men
that are in the Long-boat turn themſelves about
and look before them, and they lay their Oars
nimbly upon the ſides of the Long-boat. There
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52975:222"/>
is a Man in the Long-boat, whoſe buſineſs it is
to look after the Rope; as you may ſee at <hi>N,</hi>
in the Tab. <hi>A;</hi> for in each of theſe Long-boats
there is a whole heap of Lines, between the
two Seats or Benches; this Heap is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
three, four, or five parts, and each of them
is of eighty, ninety, to one hundred fathoms
long. The firſt of them is tyed to the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner,
or ſmall Line; as the <hi>Whale</hi> runs under
the Water, they tye more and more Line to it,
and if in one Boat there ſhould not be enough,
they make uſe of thoſe that are in the other
Long boats. Theſe Ropes or Lines are thicker
and ſtronger than the Fore-runner, and are
made of ſtrong and tough Hemp, and Tarred
over. The Line-furniſher, or the man that
doth look after the Ropes, and alſo the other
Men that are in the Long-boat, muſt have great
care that the Ropes or Lines may not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
when they run out ſo ſwift, or that
they may not run towards the ſide of the Long-boat,
for then the Long-boat would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
and many Men loſe their Lives, if other
Long-boats were not near to their aſſiſtance.
The Line muſt run juſt before, in the middle
of the Long-boat, that is called the <hi>Stave</hi> by
the Seamen, and by reaſon of this ſtrong and
violent motion the Wood and Rope, would be
ſet on fire. But to prevent this, the Harpoonier
hath a wet Rag tied to a Stick (like unto a
Mop) ready at hand, wherewith he wets the
Wood without ceaſing. The other three Men
that are in the Long-boats take alſo care of the
Lines, as well when they are let out, as when
they are taken in again, and when they cannot
hold it with their Hands, they wind it about
the Staves of the Boat, and ſo they do ſtop it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52975:223"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52975:224"/>
from going any further. Another that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Steerman, ſtands behind in the Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat,
as you may ſee by <hi>o</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A,</hi> and
ſteers the Boat with an Oar, and he takes great
care, and minds the Rope, to ſee which way
it runs out, for if it doth go towards either ſide,
and doth not run juſt before over the Stave, he
ſo guides the Boat, that it may run exactly out
before. The Whale runs away with the Long-boat
as ſwift as the Wind. If the Harpoonier
can, he doth dart the Harpoon juſt behind the
Spout-hole of the <hi>Whale</hi> or in the thick Fat of his
Back, where they alſo do launce him, for that
maketh him ſpout Blood ſooner than if woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in any other place, and dye ſooner than if
you ſhould launce them into their Belly, or
through the Guts. The firſt <hi>Whale,</hi> we caught
ſpouted Blood, in ſuch a quantity, that the Sea
was tinged by it where-ever he ſwam, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the <hi>Mallemucks</hi> flock'd in great numbers,
as I have mentioned before. They alſo launce
the <hi>Whales</hi> near their privy parts, if they can
come at it, for if they are run in there it doth
pain them very much; nay, even when they
are almoſt dead, if you run in your Launce
thereabout, it cauſes the whole Body to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For the moſt part they do not much
mind where they launce or puſh them, for
there is no time to take great deliberation, but
they ſtrike at him as well as they can. But
about the Head the Harpoon can do him no
hurt, becauſe the Fat is but very <hi>thin</hi> there upon
the Bones, which the <hi>Whales</hi> know as well as we;
for when they find themſelves in danger, ſo
that they cannot eſcape the Harpoon, they
rather leave their Head than their Back unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
for there the Harpoon breaks out eaſier,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52975:224"/>
and ſo the <hi>Whale</hi> gets away, like one that hath
no mind to fight any longer. The Uſe of the
Harpoon is, to tye, as it were, the <hi>Whales</hi> with
them, that they may not run away: It is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
like an Arrow before, as you may ſee at <hi>f,</hi>
in the Tab. <hi>

                     </expan>
                  </hi> it hath two ſharp Beards, they
are ſharp at the edge, and have a broad Back,
like unto a Hatchet that is ſharp before and
blunt behind, or on the Back, ſo that it may
not cut with its Back, for elſe it would tear out
and all your Labour would be loſt. The Iron
Handle is thicker behind than before, and it is
hollow, whereinto they put the Stick, as you
may ſee in the Tab. <hi>Q,</hi> marked with <hi>h.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this hollow part, the Fore-goer is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd
or tyed, that is to ſay the foremoſt Rope,
as you may ſee in the Tab. <hi>Q,</hi> marked with <hi>i.</hi>
Thoſe are the beſt Harpoons that are made of
clean and fine Steel, and are not hardened too
much, ſo that you may bend it without ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
for oftentimes Two hundred Pounds are
loſt (for a midling <hi>Whale</hi> is eſteem'd at ſo much)
in a minutes time for want of a good and well-temper'd
Harpoon. The Wooden Stick is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
within the Iron Collet or Funnel of the
Harpoon, with Packthread wound all about
the Iron; ſomewhat higher up, about two ſpans
off, there is a hole made through the Stick, as
you may ſee marked with <hi>k,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>Q.</hi>
The Harpoon is light behind, and heavy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the point, or before, like an Arrow, that
is made heavy before with Iron, and light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
with Feathers, ſo that fling it which way
you will, it doth fall always upon the point.
Through this hole cometh a piece of Pack-thread,
wherewith the end of the Fore-runner
is faſtened to the Handle or Stick of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52975:225"/>
but this is ſoon torn off, and it ſerveth
for nothing more after the Harpoon ſticks in
the Body of the <hi>Whale;</hi> neither is the Wooden
Handle of any further uſe, and ſo it doth ſoon
come out from the Iron. When the <hi>Whale</hi> is
ſtruck with the Harpoon, all the other Long-boats
row out before, and take notice which
way the Line doth ſtand, and ſometimes they
pull at the Rope or Line (as you may ſee in
the Tab. <hi>A,</hi> marked with <hi>p.</hi>) If it is ſtiff and
heavy, the <hi>Whale</hi> doth draw it ſtill with his
might; but if it doth hang looſe, ſo that the
Long-boat is before and behind equally high
out of the Water, then the Men pull in the
Rope again, (as you may ſee in the Tab. <hi>A,</hi>
marked with <hi>q</hi>) and the Rope-giver layeth it
down in very good order (as you may ſee at
<hi>n,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A</hi>) round, and one row above
the other, that if the <hi>Whale</hi> ſhould draw on
again, he may have it ready to give him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being entangled. Here is alſo this to be
obſerved, that if the <hi>Whale</hi> runs upon the level
they muſt not give him too much Rope, for if
he ſhould turn and wind himſelf much and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
about, he might eaſily wind the Rope about
a Rock or heavy Stone, and ſo faſten it to it,
and ſo the Harpoon would come out, and all
the Labour would be loſt; which hath often
hapned, and we ourſelves loſt one that way.
The other Long-boats that are towed behind,
wherein the Men look all before them, and ſit
ſtill, and let the <hi>Whale</hi> draw them along: If
the <hi>Whale</hi> doth rowl upon the Ground, ſo that
the Long-boats or Sloops lye ſtill, they draw
their Lines in again by degrees, and the Rope-maſter
doth lay them down again in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
places, as they had been laid before. When
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52975:225"/>
they kill the <hi>Whale</hi> with Launces, they alſo pull
their Lines in again, until they come near to the
<hi>Whale,</hi> yet at ſome diſtance, that the others may
have room to launce: But they muſt have great
care, that all the Lines of every Sloop may not
be cut off together, becauſe ſome <hi>Whales</hi> ſink,
and others do ſwim even with the Water when
they are dead, which no body can tell before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
whether they will do one or the other.
The fat ones do not ſink preſently after they are
freſh killed, but the lean ones ſink immediately
after they are dead, but after ſome few days
they come up again, and ſwim on the Water:
But it would be too long a while for a Man to
ſtay until he cometh up again, and the Sea is
never ſo quiet that one can ſtay long in the
ſame place, and where the Sea is quiet, and
without Waves, there the Stream doth carry
the Ships and the Ice along together, ſo that
we ſhould be forced to leave the <hi>Whale</hi> unto
others, that would find him dead ſome days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
'T'is true, this is the eaſieſt way to catch
<hi>Whales,</hi> but it is very naſty and ſtinking work;
for long and white Maggots grow in their Fleſh,
they are flat like unto Worms that breed in
Mens Bellies, and they ſmell worſe than ever I
ſmelt any thing in my Life. The longer the
<hi>Whale</hi> lies dead in the Water, the higher he doth
ſwim above it; ſome ſwim a foot high above
the Water, others to their middle, and then
they do burſt eaſily, and give a very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
They begin immediately to ſtink, and
this encreaſes hourly, and their Fleſh boils and
ferments like unto Beer or Ale, and holes break
in their Bellies, that their Guts come out. If
any Man is enclined to ſore Eyes, this Vapour
enflames them immediately, as if Quicklime
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52975:226"/>
was flung into them. But when the live <hi>Whales</hi>
riſe and ſwim again, ſome of them are aſtoniſh'd,
others wild or ſtark mad: To thoſe that are
wild we come ſoftly or gently from behind,
as we do when we are going to trapan them;
for when the Wind is down, the Weather
calm, and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſerene, ſo that the Sea doth
not foam or roar, the <hi>Whales</hi> hear immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſtriking of the Oars.</p>
               <p>If many ſmall Ice-ſheets lye near to one
another, ſo that we cannot follow the <hi>Whale</hi>
with our Sloops or Long-boats, we fetch in
our Line with all might and ſtrength, and if
with one or more pulls we can fetch out the
Harpoon it is well, if not, we chop off the
Rope or Line. The <hi>Whale</hi> is beſt and ſureſt
ſtruck with a Harpoon when he ſpouts Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as is already ſaid above, for we do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that when they lye ſtill and very quiet,
that they then liſten, and are ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and ſometimes above Water, ſo that their
Back doth not quite dry, and before we are
aware of it he flings up his Tail behind out of
the Sea, and ſo bids us good-b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wy; as you may
ſee at <hi>s,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Whales,</hi> may eaſily
be caught when the Air is very ſerene and
clear, and the Sea quiet, and where there float
neither great nor ſmall Ice-ſheets, ſo that we
may go in between them with our Boats or
Sloops, to follow them; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or at the Ice-fields
the <hi>Whales</hi> do commonly lye and rub them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at them, perhaps by reaſon of the Lice
that bite them. Beſides, againſt the Ice-ſheets
the Sea beats, daſhes, and foams, with ſmall
curling Waves, ſo that the <hi>Whales</hi> do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
nor mind the ſtriking of the Oars, and ſo
they are eaſily ſtruck with the Harpoon. It is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52975:226"/>
very dangerous to kill a Female, chiefly when
ſhe is big with young, for they defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
very long, and are harder to be killed
than a Male one. Oftentimes the Long-boats
wait ſix or ſeven hours, nay, a whole day, for
a <hi>Whale;</hi> before they ſee one.</p>
               <p>Where great quantity of ſmall Ice is crowded
together, there it is alſo very dangerous, and
hard to come to the <hi>Whale,</hi> for he is ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that when he perceives where the Ice is
he retires thither immediately. The Harpoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier
ſtands at the Head of the Long-boat, and
doth draw on the Rope, as you may ſee at <hi>p,</hi>
in the Tab. <hi>A,</hi> to try whether it is heavy or
light; if it feels heavy, ſo that we are afraid
that it will pull the Boat under Water, then
we give him more Rope, if he runs ſtreight
out before, he draweth the Sloops after him.
If he doth run underneath a great Ice-field,
the Harpoonier taketh a Knife into his Hand,
as you may ſee at <hi>R,</hi> in the Tab <hi>A,</hi> which
they call the Chopping-Knife, and if the Ice-field
be hollow, or ſpungy, or full of holes in
the middle, ſo that the <hi>Whale</hi> can fetch breath
underneath it, and the Rope is not long enough
to follow him, and if the Ice be ſeveral miles
long, they draw the Rope in as much as
poſſibly they can, until it be ſtreight, and
then he chops it off, looſing the piece of the
Rope whereon the Harpoon is faſtened, that
ſticketh in the Body of the <hi>Whale,</hi> yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great loſs, for oftentimes they run away
with the Lines that belong to five and more
Sloops. It happens very often, that they run
to the Ice with the Long-boats, ſo that they
daſh againſt it, as if they would break it into
pieces, which alſo very often happens. But
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52975:227"/>
when the <hi>Whale</hi> riſes again, they oftentimes
fling one or two more Harpoons into him,
according as they find he is tired more or leſs,
then he dives under Water again. Some ſwim
or run even all along on the Water, and they
play with their Tail and Finns, ſo that we
muſt have great care that we may not come
too near them. When the <hi>Whales</hi> fling their
Tails about after this manner, they wind the
Line about their Tail, ſo that we need not to
fear the Harpoon tearing out, for then they
are ty'd ſtrong and firm enough with the Rope.
After they are wounded, they ſpout with all
their might and main, ſo that you may hear
them as far off as you may a Cannon;
but when they are quite tired, it cometh out
only by drops, for he hath not ſtrength enough
to force the Water up, and therefore it ſounds
as if you held an empty Mug or Bottle under
Water, and the Water runs into it. And this
ſound is a certain ſign of his feebleneſs, and
that he is going to expire. Some <hi>Whales</hi> blow
Blood to the very laſt, after they have been
wounded, and theſe daſh the Men in the Long-boats
moſt filthily, and dye the Sloops as red
as if they were painted with a red colour;
nay, the very Sea is tinged red all along where
they ſwim. Thoſe <hi>Whales</hi> that are mortally
wounded heat themſelves, that they reek while
they are alive, and the Birds ſit on them, and
eat on them while they are ſtill alive. When
the <hi>Whales</hi> blow up the Water, they fling out
with it ſome fattiſh ſubſtance that floats upon
the Sea, like Sperm, and this Fat the <hi>Mallemucks</hi>
devour greedily, of which ſeveral thouſands at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
him, ſo that a <hi>Whale</hi> often hath more At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
than a King hath Servants; as you
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52975:227"/>
may ſee by <hi>T,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A.</hi> Sometimes alſo
the Harpoons break out; then often Long-boats
of other Ships attend, and as ſoon as they
ſee that the Harpoon is come out, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing
their own into him, and the <hi>Whale</hi> is theirs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the firſt Harpoon hath almoſt killed the
<hi>whale,</hi> yet if he doth get looſe, the ſecond Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
claims him, and the firſt muſt look for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Sometimes at the ſame time two Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poons,
belonging to two ſeveral Ships are ſtruck
into the <hi>Whale,</hi> ſuch ones are divided equally,
and each one hath half; as you may ſee at
<hi>MM,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A;</hi> the other two, or three,
or more Sloops, as many as there is of them,
wait for the <hi>Whale</hi>'s coming up again, and when
they ſee that he is tired, they kill him outright
with Launces. In doing this is the greateſt
danger, for the firſt that do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing the Harpoon
into him are drawn along by the <hi>Whale,</hi> and
are at a good diſtance from him, but thoſe that
kill him with Launces are as well upon his Body
as at his Sides, according as the <hi>Whale</hi> turns
and winds himſelf, and they receive many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Blows. Here the Steerſman muſt take
care to obſerve how the <hi>Whale</hi> runs and turns
himſelf about, that the Harpoonier may reach
him with his Launces; all the other Men in the
Sloops row diligently, ſometimes forwards, and
ſometimes backwards, which they call <hi>rowing
on</hi> and <hi>ſtriking,</hi> and when the <hi>Whale</hi> lifts up
himſelf out of the Water, he commonly doth
ſtrike about with his Tail and Finns, that the
Water daſheth up like Duſt. A Long-boat he
values no more than Duſt, for he can beat it
all into ſhatters at a blow: but a great Ship is
too hard for him, and if he ſtrikes againſt it
with his Tail, he feels it more that the Ship,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52975:228"/>
for he doth ſo paint the Ship with his own
Blood, that it maketh him very feeble. A
good Steerman is next unto the Harpoonier
moſt uſeful in the Sloop; he ſteers with one
Oar, and doth look out before: the other four
Men turn their Back to the Head, and look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Stern, therefore doth the Steerman
and Harpoonier always cry, <hi>Row on,</hi> or <hi>ſtrike,</hi>
that is to ſay, row near to the <hi>Whale,</hi> or elſe
keep farther off. The Launces have a Wooden
Stick or Handle above two fathoms long, or
ſomewhat ſhorter than a Pikeſtaff; as in the
Tab. <hi>Q.</hi> you may ſee at <hi>g;</hi> the Iron thereof is
commonly a fathom long, and pointed before
like unto a Pike; it is made of Steel or tough
Iron, that it may bend without breaking: for
after you have made a deep hole in his Body
with your Launces, you poke into it with them
one way and the other way, as they do when
they poke for Eels, as you may ſee at <hi>Z,</hi> in
the Tab. <hi>A;</hi> but if he doth get one or more
out of your Hands, you take another, for every
Sloop hath at leaſt five, ſix, or ſeven, and yet
ſometimes he has them all out of three, four, or
more Boats ſticking in his Body.</p>

               <head type="sub">What they do with the dead Whale.</head>
               <p>AFter the <hi>Whale</hi> is killed they cut off his
Tail; ſome keep the Tail and Finns, and
hang them up at the outſide of their Ship, for
that defends them from the Ice when it preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
upon the Ship: The Tail hinders the Boat
in its courſe, becauſe it doth lye croſs, and that
is the reaſon why they cut it off. Before the
Tail they faſten to a piece of a Rope, and at the
other end at the Stern of the laſt Sloop, as you
may ſee in the Tab. <hi>A,</hi> marked with <hi>W.</hi> There
is in all four or five Sloops faſtened to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
behind, and ſo they row one behind the
other to the great Ship. When they have
brought the <hi>Whale</hi> to the Ship, they tye it with
Ropes faſt to the Ship; that part where the
Tail is cut off they faſten the fore-part of
the Ship, and the Head towards the Stern,
about the middle, near the great Shrowds of
the Mainmaſt on the Larboard of the Ship; it
is ſeldom that a <hi>Whale</hi> doth reach farther than
from the Poop to the middle of the Ship, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Veſſels are very ſmall; as you may
ſee at <hi>X,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Larboard is to be underſtood that ſide
of the Ship that is at your Right Hand as you
go from before towards the Stern; but that ſide
of the Ship that is on your Right Hand as you
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52975:229"/>
go from the Stern towards the Fore-part is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Star-board, becauſe you go from the Steer
forward.</p>
               <p>Whoever of the Ships Crew ſees a dead
<hi>Whale,</hi> cries out <hi>Fiſh mine,</hi> and therefore the
Merchants muſt pay him a Ducat, for his Care
and Vigilance. Many of them climb often
up into the Maſt in hopes to have a Ducat,
but in vain.</p>
               <p>When the dead <hi>Whale</hi> is thus faſtened to the
Ship, two Sloops hold on the other ſide of the
Fiſh or Whale, and in each of them doth ſtand
a Man or Boy, that has a long Hook in his
Hands, wherewith he doth hold the Boat to
the Ship, and the Harpoonier ſtands before in
the Sloop, or upon the Whale, with a Leathern
Suit on, and ſometimes they have boots on.
Underneath the Hook are ſome ſharp Nails
fixed, that they may be able to ſtand firm, for
the Whale is very ſlippery, ſo that one may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
fall, as upon ſlippery Ice. Theſe two Men
that cut the Fat off have their peculiar Wages
for it, <hi>viz.</hi> about four or five Rix Dollars.
Firſt, they cut a large piece from behind the
Head, by the Eyes, which they call the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
piece,</hi> that is as much as to ſay the Wnding-piece;
for, as they cut all the other Fat all in
rows, from the Whale towards the end, ſo they
cut this great <hi>Kenter-piece</hi> larger and wider than
all the reſt. This piece, when it is cut round
about from the Whale, reaches from the
Water to the Cradle, (that is the round Circle
that goeth round about the middle of the Maſt,
and is made in the ſhape of a Basket) from
whence you may gueſs at the bigneſs of a
Whale. A ſtrong and thick Rope is fixed to
this <hi>Kenter-piece,</hi> and the other end is fixed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52975:229"/>
the Cradle, whereby the Whale is as
it was born up out of the Water, that they may
come at it, and by reaſon of the great weight
of the Whale, the Ship leans towards that ſide.
One may judge how tough the Fat is, for in
this piece an hole is made, through which the
Rope is faſtened, yet not deep into the Fat,
wherewith they turn the Fiſh at pleaſure; as
you may ſee at <hi>K,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A.</hi> Then, as is
before ſaid, they cut another piece down hard
by this, that is alſo halled up to the Ship; as
you may ſee at <hi>L,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A;</hi> and then in
the Ship they cut it into leſs pieces about a
foot ſquare. Theſe two Men have in their
Hands, as well as thoſe that ſtand on the Whale,
long Knives, wherewith they cut theſe ſquare
pieces. Theſe Knives are, with their Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts,
about the length of a Man; and the more the
Fat of the Whale is looſened, juſt as the Hide
is flea'd from an Ox, the higher muſt they pull
up the Fat with their Pulleys, that they may
cut it the eaſier. And when they have drawn
up this Fat, the Men take it in to them into
the Ship, and looſen the Rope that is was faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto. The Rope is faſtened with a Ring,
whereinto they put a great Iron Hook, which
is faſtened to a ſtrong Tackle, and alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
before in the Ship, are fixed two other
Tackle, wherewith all the Fat is drawn up into
the Ship. In the Ship ſtand two Men, with
Hooks as long as a Man, wherewith they hold
the great piece of Fat, which the two Men cut
into ſquare pieces with their long Knives. By
them ſtands another, that hath a ſhort Hook
with a Ring in his Hands, which he thruſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the pieces of Fat that are cut ſquare, and
puts it upon the Bench or Dreſſing-board, where
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52975:230"/>
it is cut by others into leſs pieces. The two
firſt Men with their long Knives, that cut the
large pieces of Fat, ſtand near the Larboard of
the Ship, at that ſide where the Whale is fixed,
and the other Men that afterwards cut it into
leſs pieces, ſtand on the other ſide called Star-board,
as you may ſee at <hi>I,</hi> in the Tab. <hi>A.</hi>
when it is a good time to catch Whales, and
they will not loſe it, they tow ſometimes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Fiſh behind their Ship, and catch more;
and they cut only the great pieces of Fat of
them, and fling them underneath into the Ship-But
when they have no more Veſſels to put
their Fat into, they ſail into an Harbour; or if
it be calm weather, and not windy, they ſtay
in the Sea, and faſten themſelves to a ſheet of
Ice, and ſo they drive along with the Stream.
The other Men cut the Fat into ſmall pieces,
on a Table; on the further ſide of the Table is
a Nail faſtened, whereunto they faſten a Hook,
which they put into the Fat, that it may lye
ſteddy when they cut it into ſmall pieces, the
Fat is tough to cut, wherefore it muſt lye firm.
That ſide whereon the Skin is they lay under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
and ſo cut the Fat from it by pieces. The
Knives wherewith they cut the Fat into ſmall
pieces are leſs than the other, about three foot
long with their Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts. They all cut from them
that they may not be bedaubed with the Fat,
which might occaſion a ſhrinking up and lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Sinews of their Hands and Arms.
One of them cuts the ſoft and tough Fat into
ſmall pieces with a long Knife; this Man they
call the <hi>Chopper,</hi> and he is mightily daubed,
wherefore he doth hang about him all ſorts of
Rags and Clouts he can get. The Fat of ſome
Whales is white, of others yellow, and of ſome
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52975:230"/>
red. The white Fat is full of ſmall Sinews,
and it does not yield ſo much Oyl as the yellow.
The yellow Fat that looks like Butter is the
beſt. The red and watery Fat cometh from
dead <hi>Whales,</hi> for in the place where the Fat
runs out the Blood ſettles in its room, and yields
the worſt and leaſt Oyl. Before the Table is a
Gutter made of two Boards nailed together,
whereinto the ſmall or minced Fat is flung;
by it ſtands a Boy that ſhuffles the Fat by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
into a Bag that is fixed to the end of the
Gutter, and is like unto a Pudding-bag, ſo long
that it reaches down into the Ship; out of this
Bag the Fat runs down into a Tub or Wooden
Funnel, which they put upon empty Veſſels
or Cardels, as they call them, and the Men that
are below in the Ship fill them with it, and ſo
it is kept until they try it up into Train-oyl.
When the Fat is cut off from one ſide of the
<hi>Whale,</hi> before they turn him, they cut out the
Whale-bone in one entire piece, and this is ſo
heavy, that all the Ship's Crew hath enough to
do to pull it up. They make uſe, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
of a peculiar ſort of Hooks, two whereof
they fix on the ſides, and one on the middle of
it, very well provided with ſtrong Tackle, as
you may ſee in the Tab. <hi>R,</hi> and afterwards
they cut out the Whale-bone of the other ſide
of the Fiſh, and draw it up alſo with Pulleys
into the Ship, where it is cut into ſuch pieces
as they bring it hither in. The Whale-bone
doth only belong to the owners of the Ship,
and the others that run their hazard, whether
they catch few or many <hi>Whales.</hi> The reſt,
which take their Pay by the Month, receive
their Money when they come home, whether
they have caught many or none, and the Loſs
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52975:231"/>
or Gain falls upon the Merchants. The Hooks
that they crane up the Whale-bone withal are
made on purpoſe for it, like a Beam of a pair of
Scales; on each end are two ſharp points,
which they knock in between the Whale-bone;
in the middle of the Beam is faſtened a long
Handle with a Ring, whereon the Ropes are
faſtened; on this Handle there are fixed two
other crooked Hooks like Birds Claws; in the
Ring where the Ropes are faſtened is another
crooked Hook, at the top faſtened by a Ring,
ſuch a one as we make uſe of here when we
wind any thing up by a Crane; but in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
between theſe two Hooks is faſtened ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rope, which keeps the lowermoſt Hook
ſteddy; the two hindmoſt points are knocked
into the Whale-bone behind, and the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſhort ones before, which hold the Whale-bone
faſt between them when it is wound or
pulled up.</p>
               <p>The dead <hi>Whales,</hi> when the Fat is cut off of
them, they let float, and are the Food of the
Birds of Prey, when they are hungry, but
but they had rather have dead <hi>Whales</hi> that have
ſtill their Fat left on them. The white Bear
is generally not far off, whether there be any
Fat left on them or no, and look like Dogs that
only feed upon Carrion, and at that time their
white Furr is turned into a yellow colour, and
at the ſame time they ſhed their Hair, and
their Skins are worth very little. Where a dead
<hi>Whale</hi> is near we ſee it by the Birds, whereof are
many, and alſo the white Bears diſcover it, as
you may ſee at <hi>g</hi> in the Tab. <hi>B,</hi> chiefly in the
Spring, when but a few <hi>Whales</hi> are caught, for
then they are greedy of their Prey; afterwards
when many <hi>Whales</hi> float on the Sea, they have
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52975:231"/>
their Bellies full, and we do not find ſo many
by a <hi>Whale,</hi> becauſe they are diſperſed.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Trying out of the Train-oyl from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Fat.</head>
               <p>Formerly the <hi>Dutch</hi> did try out their Train-oyl
in <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> at <hi>Smerenberg,</hi> and about
the Cookery of <hi>Harlingen,</hi> where ſtill, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
all ſorts of Tools belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
are to be ſeen, whereof I have make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before. The <hi>French-men</hi> try up their Train-oyl
in their Ships, and by that means many
Ships are burnt at <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> and this was the
occaſion of the burning of two Ships in my
time. They try out their Train-oyl at <hi>Spitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen,</hi>
that they may load the more Fat in
their Ships; and they believe it to be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
for they go their Voyage upon part,
that is to ſay, they receive more or leſs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what they catch; But I do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it Wiſdom to fill up the room of the Ship
with Wood, where they might ſtow Veſſels.
But our Country-men, as I told you before, put
the Fat into the Veſſels, wherein it doth fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
juſt like Beer, and I know no inſtance
that ever any Veſſel did fly in pieces, although
they are ſtopt up very cloſe, and ſo it becometh
for the greateſt part Train-oyl in them. Of
the freſh Fat of <hi>Whales,</hi> when it is burnt out you
loſe Twenty in the Hundred, more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52975:232"/>
as it is in goodneſs. At the place
where they try up the Fat into Train-oyl, near
<hi>Hamburgh,</hi> they put the Fat out of the Veſſels
into a great wooden Trough or Tub, and out
of this two Men empty it into a great Kettle
that ſtands near it, that doth hold two Cardels
of Fat, that makes 120, 130, and ſometimes
140 Gallons: Underneath this Copper that is
made-up with Bricks they put the Fire, and ſo
they boil it, and try it up into Train-oyl, as
you try up other Fat. This Copper is very well
ſecured, as the Dyers Coppers uſe to be: it is
very broad and flat, juſt like a Frying-pan,
made of Copper. When the Fat is well tryed
or fryed out, they take it out of the Pan with
ſmall Kettles, into a great Sieve, that the liquid
only may run through, the reſt is thrown away.
This Sieve ſtands over a great Tub, which is
above half filled with cold Water, that the hot
Train-oyl may be cooled, and that what is
unclean and dirty of the Blood and other Soil
may fall to the bottom, and only the clear
Train-oyl ſwim at the top of the Water, like
other Oyl. In this great Tub or Trough is a

another as big as a Tub, out of which the Train-oyl
runs into another Tub, when it is almoſt
ready to run over, which is alſo filled with cold
Water to the middle, wherein it is more cooled,
and becomes clearer, and more refined than it
was before. In this Trough is another Spout,
through which the Train oyl runs into the
Warehouſe into a Vatt, whereout they fill it
into Cardels or Veſſels. Some have but two
Tubs. A Cardel or Hogſhead holds 64 Gallons.
A true Train oyl Barrel doth hold 32 Gallons.

               <head type="sub">Of the Finn-fiſh.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Finn-fiſh</hi> is of the length of a <hi>Whale,</hi>
but in bulk the <hi>Whale</hi> is three times as big.
They know the <hi>Finn-fiſh</hi> by the Finns that are
upon his Back, near unto his Tail, and alſo by
his vehement blowing and ſpouting up of the
Water, which the <hi>Whale</hi> doth not do. His
Knob on the Head is ſplit in length, that is at
his blowing hole, through which he forces up
the Water higher than the <hi>Whale,</hi> and with
more fierceneſs, which is not ſo high as that of
the <hi>Whale,</hi> neither is the Back bended or den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in ſo much. His Lips are of a browniſh
colour, and like a twiſted Rope. On his upper
Lip the Whale-bone hangs, as it doth on the
<hi>Whale;</hi> but whether he doth open and ſhut his
Mouth there are different Opinions: Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he cannot open his Mouth, yet this
is not true; but he doth not always run open
Mouth'd, that the Whale-bone may not hang
out of his Mouth at the ſides, as it doth in
Whales, for elſe he can open his Mouth if he
pleaſes. Within his Mouth, between the
Whale-bone, he is all over hairy, like unto
Horſes Hairs, which grows within to the
Whale-bone that is but new growing, and it is
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52975:233"/>
of a blew colour. The other Whale-bone is of
a brown colour, and dark browniſh with yellow
ſtroaks, which are eſteemed to be the oldeſt:
The blew Whale-bone cometh from young
Whales and Finn fiſhes. He is not as black as
Velvet, as the Whale is, but like a Tench.
The ſhape of his Body is long and ſmall, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he ſo fat as a Whale, wherefore we do
not much care to catch him for he doth not
pay us for our Labour. It is much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to kill him than to kill a Whale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he moves quicker, and beats about him
with his Tail, and from him with his Finns, ſo
that we dare not come near unto him with our
Sloops or Long-boats, for the Launces kill him
ſooneſt. I was informed, that once ſome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were aware of it, did fling, by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
their Harpoon into a Finn-fiſh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he drew both Boat and Men, all on a ſudden,
underneath a large Ice-ſheet before they
were aware of it, and not one of them eſcap'd.
His Tail lies flat, like unto that of the Whale.
When theſe Finn-fiſhes appear we ſee no more
Whales.</p>
               <p>The Train-oyl of the Whale is uſed by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Frize-makers, Curriers, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers,</hi>
and <hi>Soap-boilers;</hi> but the greateſt uſe
that is made of it, is to burn it in Lamps inſtead
of other Oyl.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greenland</hi> Ships carry 30 or 40 Men, and
ſometimes more, chiefly the great Ships, that
have ſix Sloops belonging to them, ſuch Ships
hold from 800 to 1000 Cardels of Fat; the
leſs. Ships have commonly fewer Cardels or
Veſſels, from 400 to 700, and have commonly
<hi>five</hi> Sloops or Boats belonging to them. There
alſo go Galliots to <hi>Spitzbergen</hi> to catch Whales;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52975:233"/>
they have three or four Sloops belonging to
them: Some put the Sloops upon the Deck of
the Ships, others hang them overboard, as they
do at <hi>Spitzbergen,</hi> when they are amongſt the
Ice, that as ſoon as they call <hi>Fall, fall,</hi> they
may immediately let down their Sloops into
the Water.</p>
               <p>Then there remains onboard in the Ships the
Steerſman, the Barber, the Chyrurgion, the
Cooper, and a Boy, to look after the Ship;
the Skipper or Commander himſelf goeth out
with the reſt of the Men, for they are all obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to go a Whale catching.</p>
               <p>In each Ship there are ſixty Launces, ſix
Sea-horſe Launces, forty Harpoons, ten long
Harpoons wherewith they ſtrike the <hi>Whales</hi>
under Water, ſix ſmall Sea-horſe Harpoons,
thirty Lines or Ropes, and each of them is
about eighty or ninety fathoms long. When
they go a hunting they take along with them
into each Sloop two, and ſometimes three Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poons,
ſix Launces, two or three Sea-horſe
Launces, three Lines, and five or ſix Men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the bigneſs of the Sloops, therein is
the Harpoonier, Line-keeper or Giver, and the
Steerſman: They all row equally, until they
come near to the <hi>Whale,</hi> except the Steerſman,
for he guides the Boat with his Rudder. They
alſo have in each Sloop a Chopping-knife, to
cut off the Rope when they cannot follow the
<hi>Whale,</hi> and a Hammer, and other Inſtruments,
as Hatchets, Drags, and ſeveral ſorts of Knives,
wherewithal they cut the <hi>Whales.</hi> Meat and
Drink is alſo given them according to the uſual
Cuſtom, he that will have better muſt take it
along with him. Lazy Fellows are in this
Voyage troubled with the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> but thoſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52975:234"/>
that fear neither Air nor Wind, and beſtir
themſelves, eſcape pretty well; elſe the <hi>Scurvy</hi>
is the common Diſtemper in this Voyage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Feavers, Impoſthumes, and other acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Diſtempers, and therefore the Chyrurgion
muſt take care to provide himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Rotz-fiſh</hi> (or <hi>Slime-fiſhes)</hi> I call theſe, that

only inſtead of Finns they have Stalks like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

other ſorts, that are quite differing in ſhape
from the others, and are called <hi>Sea-qualms</hi> by
the Seamen, as if they were a thick Scum of the
Sea coagulated together. They are alſo called
after the Latin Name <hi>Sea-nettles,</hi> becauſe they
cauſe a burning Pain like unto Nettles. I have
formerly had ſome Thoughts, that the <hi>Rotz</hi> or
<hi>Slime fiſhes</hi> might be a Seed flung out and ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied,
and that they did cauſe this burning
Pain by reaſon of their putrefaction; and ſo I did
think that they received their ſhape or form
according to the ſeveral kinds of Fiſhes from
whence they came, and that ſome did take after
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52975:234"/>
                  <hi>Thornbacks,</hi> others after <hi>Whales,</hi> and the like;

it ſhould proceed from putrefied Seed caſt away.
They cleanſe the Sea mightily, for all the filth

                  <head>I. Of the Sea-May-flye.</head>
                  <p>Theſe ſmall Fiſh are very like unto the <hi>Sea-nettles,</hi>
becauſe of their tranſparent Body, and
they alſo diſſolve like the ſame, if you hold them

about the Neck, which are likeſt unto
thoſe of the <hi>Whale.</hi> They are in their ſhape
like unto our white Rowls, broad and thick in

As for the reſt of the Body, it is very like unto
our <hi>May-flye,</hi> ſave only that the Tail or Body is
all along thicker, and only begins to be pointed
towards the end. The Head is broad and
round, ſplit in the middle; it hath ſmall horns
about the breadth of a Straw; on his Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it hath two rows of ſix red little Knobs,
three of them in each row; whether they be
Eyes or no I cannot exactly tell. Its Mouth is
divided or ſplit. From his Mouth down into
his Belly are its Guts, which one may eaſily ſee
becauſe of its tranſparency. It is of yellow
and black colour; but the colour of the whole
Fiſh is like unto the White of an Egg. He
moves in the Water juſt like a <hi>Sea-nettle.</hi> I have
drawn him here in his proper bigneſs. I am of

a little indented. The Rays ſpring out ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
from the middle of the Body, and there

ſomewhat cloſer together, and are ſplit in two.
The Body thereof is white and tranſparent, as

opens it again as he pleaſeth; but the Rays or
Spokes are browniſh red. On the end of theſe
Spokes, towards the outward circumference are
ſeveral Spots, 32 in number. In the middle of
this Plate is another ſmall Circle, and from the
circumference of that the before-named Spokes
begin. It is hollow within, which Cavity
may perhaps be his Belly, wherein I found
two or three of the ſmall Shrimps. Round
about did hang down ſeven brown ſmall
Threads, like ſpun Silk, or like unto the
Threads that flye in the Air about Autumn;
he cannot move theſe. I believe he weigh'd

beyond the middle of the whole Body. From
the middle of the Funnel come down four
others, like unto the Back bones of a Snake, and
they come down lower than the others; ſo
that all of them make eight in number. They
changed their colour as we looked upon them,
into blew, yellow, and red, with ſuch delicate
colours as a Rainbow. They looked in my
Eyes to be like unto a Fountain with eight
Streams or Spouts, wherefore we might call it
a <hi>Fountain-fiſh</hi> with eight Streams. Within him
came down from the end of the Funnel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the Body is firſt bent in ſomewhat, then it

kill but fifteen of above 1000, that lay there like
Hogs huddling together on heaps, but they

               <p>In 1610 at another Voyage with two Ships,
they killed many Bears, and ſaw divers young

               <p>The Morſs,<note place="margin">Morſſes.</note> Walruſh, Horſe-whale, Roſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
or Sea-horſe, (for ſo he is by the Ancients
often called, though of late they have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
another Fiſh not unlike him, with ſtreight
Teeth, which they call the Sea-horſe) hath a
Skin like a Sea-calf, (with ſhort and ſad yellow
Fur) a Mouth like a Lion; if any, hardly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable,
Ears, yet they hear well, and are
frighted with noiſe; (which alſo is ſaid of the
Whale, that he is driven away with the ſound
of a Trumpet) large Breaſt, short Thighs, four Feet,
and upon each Foot five Toes with ſhort ſharp
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52975:241"/>
Nails, with which they climb the Ice; and as
large as a great Ox, having a great ſemicircular
Tusk growing on each ſide of their upper Jaw,
which are very much valued, eſpecially by the
Northern People, partly for their uſes in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
as to make Cramp-rings, (which they
make alſo of the Briſtles upon his Cheeks) to
reſiſt Poiſon, and other malignant Diſeaſes,
wherein they are at leaſt equal to that called
the Unicorn's Horn; but more for their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which is equal to, if not ſurpaſſing Ivory.
The heavineſs of it makes it much ſought after
for Handles of Swords. Their Skins, being
dreſſed, are thicker than two Ox-hides, yet
light, and excellent to make Targets againſt
Darts and Arrows of the Savages. They feed
upon Fiſh and Herbs, and ſleep, if there be Ice,
upon that; where if ſurprized, the female caſts
her young ones (of which ſhe hath commonly
two at a time) into the Sea, and her ſelf after
them, ſwimming away with them in her Arms;
and if provoked, after ſhe hath ſecured them,
returning many times to ſet upon the Boat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which if ſhe can faſten her Teeth, ſhe will
eaſily ſink it. But if they be farther from the
Water, they all ariſe up together, and with their
weight and force falling upon the Ice, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to break it; as they did when ſurprized
by <hi>Jonas Pool</hi> 1610, where himſelf and divers
of his Men eſcaped drowning very narrowly;
one of them being in the Sea, the Morſſes ſet
upon him with their Teeth, but with very great
labour and hazard of his company he eſcaped
Death, though ſore wounded. Frequently alſo
they ſleep on the ſhore, and if they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
upon an high and ſteep place. They
always go in great companies, and ſet one to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52975:242"/>
keep watch; which if ſurprized aſleep, 'tis an
eaſie matter to kill all the reſt; but if he give
warning by grunting, they clap their hinder
Feet under their two Tusks, and ſo roll into
the Sea. But if they be caught on plain ground,
yet are they hardly ſlain, being both ſtrong and
fierce, and all haſting one way to the Water.
The <hi>Dutch</hi> at firſt were very much troubled to
kill them, their Shot the Beaſt valued not much,
their Hatchets and Half-pikes would not pierce
them; nor did they think they could be killed,
except ſtruck with great force in the midſt of
the Forehead. The firſt time they ſet upon
them, of 200 they could not kill one, but went
for their Ordnance to ſhoot them. Our Men,
after a little experience, found the way to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch
them with Javelins, as is before rehearſed.</p>
               <p>Some imagine this to be <hi>John Mayen's Iſland,</hi>
but it ſeems rather that is not; for the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt
point of that is in 71 d. 23 m. whereas
this is 74 d. 55 m. except the <hi>Dutch</hi> be not ſo
accurate in their Obſervations and Calculations
as were to be wiſh'd, which I much ſuſpect, <hi>v.
Nova-Zembla.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Cherry-Iſland</hi> is round, not
frequented with Whales, but Morſſes. Our
Men alſo have travelled it on Foot from North
to South, which on <hi>Mayen's Iſland</hi> cannot be
done; and though they tell many particulars
of the place, yet they never mention the great
<hi>Beerenberg. Hope-Iſland</hi> indeed is a long Iſland,
lies much what as they ſay of <hi>Mayen</hi>'s, and hath
been viſited by the Whale-fiſhers, but it is more
North than they place their Iſland. The itch
of aſcribing Diſcoveries to themſelves hath
brought (as I fear) Confuſion both in this and
many other matters of this nature.</p>

               <head>JOHN MAYEN's Iſland.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>JObn Mayen's Iſland,</hi> ſo called from the name of
the firſt Diſcoverer, (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> pretend)
ſeems by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be called <hi>Hope-Iſland,</hi> or
if not, I know not whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have
been upon it. It ſeems not to be of any great
conſequence, all that is ſpoken of it being that
it extends in length from South-weſt to North-eaſt
The farther it ſhoots out in length, the
more contracted and narrower it grows in
breadth; ſo that in the middle the diſtance is
very ſmall between both Shores. Before the
Whale-fiſhing was removed to <hi>Greenland,</hi> in the
Summer-time this Iſland was much frequented
by the Seamen whom Trade invited thither;
and the Iſland was well known to moſt of the
Northern Adventurers of <hi>Europe;</hi> but ſince the
Whales have deſerted thoſe Shores, and have
removed their Sea-quarters farther to the North,
the Seamen and Fiſhermen have been forced to
follow their Prey to <hi>Greenland.</hi> For it ſeems the
Whales, either weary of the place, or ſenſible
of their own danger, do often change their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
In the Spring time the weſtern ſide of
the Iſland is not ſo much encloſed with Ice, as
that which lies in the North, where it runs out
into the Sea, with a ſharp point behind the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Bears;</hi> for on this ſide, all the year long,
the Ice never removes from the Shore, above
ten miles; and in the Spring time ſo beſieges it,
that there is no paſſage through it. For which
reaſon the Mariners, who are bound for this
Iſland, uſe all the care they can to avoid the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52975:243"/>
Eaſtern, and to make directly to the Weſtern
Shore, there to lye while the Fiſhing-ſeaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues;
if by miſcarriage they come upon the
Eaſt-ſide, they are then forced to fetch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
about the North part of the Iſland, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they are not only expoſed to the terrible winds
that blow off from <hi>Bears-Mountain,</hi> but alſo to
the dangers of the floating Ice: for here the Sea
flows from South to North, and ebbs from North
to South. At the Northern end of the Iſland
appears the <hi>Bears-Mountain,</hi> of a prodigious
height, and ſo perpendicularly ſteep, that it is
impoſſible to climb to the top of it. This
Mountain, from the Bears there frequently ſeen,
called <hi>Beerenberg</hi> or the <hi>Bears-Mountain,</hi> at the
bottom takes up the whole ſpace beween the
Eaſtern and the Weſtern Shore; on the North
ſide it leaves a little room for leveller ground
to the Ocean; and being of prodigious height,
may be deſcryed 30 miles off at Sea.</p>
               <p>The Sea-coaſt lies thus: 1. <hi>Noords-hoeck,</hi> or
the <hi>Northern Angle,</hi> is the extream point ſhooting
out to the North. 2. <hi>Ooſthoeck</hi> is the moſt
Eaſtern point. <hi>Ysbergh,</hi> mark'd 1, 2, 3, are three
Mountains of Ice, or rather vaſt heaps of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
Snow, which diſſolved by the heat of
the Sun, falls from the top of <hi>Bears-Mountain,</hi>
but upon the Sun's retiring freezes again.
3. <hi>Zuydooſt-hoeck</hi> is the South-eaſt Angle. From
this point the Shore extends itſelf from Eaſt to
Weſt to a little Iſland, and then winds again to
the Weſt and South; in ſome places not paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by reaſon of its ſteepneſs, in others ſmooth
enough. 4. <hi>Cleyn Sand-bay</hi> or <hi>Little Sand-bay,
Eyerland,</hi> or <hi>Eggland,</hi> being certain Rocks full of
Birds; here, about a Musket ſhot from the

This Ingenious and moſt Skilful Navigator,
Capt. <hi>Theo. James</hi> was peſter'd with much Ice
in theſe North-weſt Seas in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi>
ſailing from <hi>Cape-Farewell,</hi> by the Iſland of <hi>Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi>

but they were ſoon parted by bad weather.
Capt. <hi>James</hi> continued to roving up and down
theſe Seas, and giving Names to his Diſcoveries,

Earl of Briſtol's Iſland, Sir Thomas Roe's Iſland,
Earl of Danby's Iſland, Charlton Iſland,</hi> where he
winter'd in the Lat. of 52 deg. 03 min. from

built a little Pinnace out of his Ship, in which
he paſſed over to <hi>Cary's Swans-Neſt,</hi> and ſo by

               <p>This Iſland (ſaith Capt. <hi>James</hi>) and all the

cover'd over with a white Moſs, and full of
Shrubs and low Buſhes, excepting ſome bare
Hills and Patches, where the Sand will drive
with the Wind like Duſt. 'Tis full of Trees,
as <hi>Spruce Firrs,</hi> and <hi>Juniper,</hi> which together with
the Moſs will take fire like Torches or Flax.
We found great ſtore of an Herb like <hi>Scurvy-graſs,</hi>

We ſaw ſome Deer, abundance of Foxes, a few
Bears, and ſome little Beaſts. In <hi>May</hi> there

In 1606. he ſent again four Ships and a Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
<hi>Godske Lindenaw</hi> Admiral, and <hi>James Hall</hi>

               <p>In 1607. <hi>James Hall</hi> was ſent again, but the
Seamen mutining as ſoon as he came to the
Coaſt, brought the Ship back again into <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>

               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſet out two Ships

with <hi>Norwegian</hi> and <hi>Iſelandiſh</hi> Mariners, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
before they ſaw Shore. More of their
Expeditions we know not, till 1619, when he
ſent out <hi>John Munck</hi> with two Ships. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
ſafe at <hi>Cape Farewell</hi> 60 deg. 30 min.
where their Tackle was ſo frozen, and full of
Iſicles, that they could not handle them; the

that part towards <hi>Groneland, Mare Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianum.</hi>
He arriv'd in 63 deg. 20 min. where
he winter'd, and called it <hi>Munck's Winter-harbour,</hi>
and the Country <hi>New Denmark,</hi> (it seems to be
near <hi>Digg's Iſland.</hi>) In that long Winter he
there endured, little of note happen'd, but that
in <hi>April</hi> it rained, and then came thither vaſt
quantities of Fowls, of divers ſorts, to breed in
thoſe quiet, undiſturbed places. Of all his
Company, which was forty-ſix in one Ship,
and ſixteen in the Pinnace, ſcarce ſo many
were left alive, as were able to bring the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace

If any one deſire to know what became of

into <hi>Denmark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gronelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>in</hi> Denmark.</note> the account is this: The King
commanded great care ſhould be taken of them,
appointed certain perſons to attend them, to
give them liberty enough, ſo as they prevented
their eſcape. No Neceſſary or Convenience
was wanting; their Food ſuch as they could eat,
Milk, Butter, Cheeſe, Fleſh, and Fiſh, but raw.
They could eat no Bread, nor boil'd Meat, but
nothing ſo much abhorr'd by them as Wine, or
Brandy. Their pleaſanteſt Beuvrage was Train-Oyl.
But whatever was done to, or for them,
could never take away that Melancholy and
Chagrin which they continually lived in for
the want of their beloved Country. They
could never be brought to learn much of the
<hi>Daniſh</hi> Language, or to apprehend any thing of
Chriſtian Religion. Three of them were ſent
back towards their own Country 1606. the moſt
towardly and hopeful, who might ſerve for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
and Brokers to the <hi>Danes;</hi> but two of
them, <hi>Oxo</hi> and <hi>Omeg,</hi> died in the Ship, and the
third (becauſe the <hi>Danes</hi> durſt not land or trade
by reaſon of the great numbers of Natives that
appeared in Arms on the Coaſt, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
them that had been before carried away)
was brought back into <hi>Denmark,</hi> to his former
Treatment. An Ambaſſador arriving there
from <hi>Spain,</hi> the King was pleaſed to ſhew him
thoſe Savages, and their dexterity in rowing,
which was by all the Spectators admired. The
Ambaſſador ſending them Money, one of them
had the courage to buy him Clothes after the
<hi>Daniſh</hi> Faſhion, got a Feather in his Cap, Boots
and Spurs, and all things <hi>ala cavaliere;</hi> he came
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52975:249"/>
alſo to the King, and deſired to ſerve him; but
this fervor was quickly decay'd, and the poor
man returned to his ſadneſs and complaints.
Some of them endeavoured to get to Sea in their
little Boats, but being retrieved, dyed of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
Two lived divers years at <hi>Koldingen</hi>
in <hi>Jutland,</hi> where they were employ'd in diving
for Pearl-Muſcles; in which their skill and
dexterity was ſuch, that every one that ſaw them
believed they had practiſed the ſame employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their own Country. Such fucceſs they
had, that the Governour promiſed himſelf great
Profit thereby; and that in a ſhort time he
ſhould ſell Pearls by the quart, if they continued.
But his Covetouſneſs deſtroyed his Gain; for
not content with what they fiſhed in Summer,
he alſo compelled them under the Ice in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
time; where one of them fell into ſuch a
Diſeaſe, from the cold ſo contracted, that he
dyed. After whoſe death the other never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
himſelf; but finding an opportunity, he
got his little Boat, and before he was overtaken
got to the main Sea. But being brought back,
they repreſented to him the impoſſibility of his
ever getting home to <hi>Groneland;</hi> but he ſlighted
their Advice, and told them, That he intended
to go northward ſo far, and when he was there
the Stars would direct him into his own
Country.</p>
               <p>The Country is moſtly all High-land and

reaſon of the terrible Ice and Cold, are wholly
undiſcover'd; the ſouthern conſiſt of many

ſeems to be the reaſon, that in theſe Seas are
many various and ſtrong currents, and (as <hi>Ivor

towards the Weſt and North, none of which
however have been found by our Mariners.
The Country ſeems much ſubject to Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,

Utenſils) Swords, and Heads for their Darts

Stones, till they make them as ſharp-piercing as
ours. This Horn grows in the Snout of the
Fiſh, and is his Weapon, wherewith he fears
not to fight the Whale, and to aſſault and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

with their voice, hands, and feet: wonderful
alſo affectionate one to another, and to their
Country. In one Voyage there went a <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Mariner, with black hair, flat nos'd, and other,
though not very exact, reſemblances of a <hi>Grone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander;</hi>
as ſoon as they ſaw him, they came
about him, kiſſed him, hung upon him, and
ſhewed to him all poſſible demonſtrations of
Kindneſs and Affection. And thoſe who were
in <hi>Denmark</hi> never enjoy'd themſelves, nor had
any content, but continually pined away, and
languiſh'd with Diſcontent for their condition,
and love of their country. Their Religion,
ſuch as it is, ſeems to be unto the Sun; for
when our People invited them to converſation,
bartering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they held up their hands towards
the Sun, and cried <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>otan;</hi> nor would they
come near us, till our men had done the like.
But <hi>John Munck,</hi> and divers others, having gone
farther into the country, found images, ſuch as
we make of Devils, with horns, beaks, claws,
cloven feet, <hi>&amp;c</hi> very ill made; Altars alſo and
quantities of Bones of Beaſts, as of Deer, Foxes,
Dogs, and the like, near unto them. They
ſeem alſo, as all Idolaters, given to Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Sorceries. Our men have ſeen them
lying flat upon the Earth, and muttering their
Prayers or Charms into the Ground, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Devil, whoſe proper habitation they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52975:252"/>
conceive to be under them. In ſome Diſeaſes
they tye a ſtick to a great ſtone, to which they
pay their Devotions; and if they can lift it up
eaſily and lightly, they think their Prayers are
heard, and Recovery granted. In Winter they
retire from the Sea ſide, unto the warmer Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
where they have their Houſes and Towns,
which are commonly Caves at the foot of an
hill, round like an Oven, cloſe to one another,
and paſſage in the inner parts from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
their Doors, which are low and round,
open to the ſouth; and they dig trenches alſo
to draw away the water that falls or drains from
the hill. The entrance, and ſome part of their
houſe, ſtands without the cave, which they
frame very handſomly and commodiouſly of
the ribs of Whales join'd artificially at the top,
and cover'd with Seals skins. They raiſe alſo
one part of their floor higher than another,
which they ſtrow with moſs to ſleep upon. But
in their fiſhing-time they have Tents, which
they remove from place to place in their larger
Boats. They ſet up four Poles, and cover them
with Skins, which ſerves very well in ſummer:
when fiſhing is done, they return with them to
their Houſes. Their manner of bartering, is
to make two heaps, one of ſuch things as they
deſire, the other of what they would part with;
and they ceaſe not to take away from the one
or other, till the Trade is ballanced. The
chiefeſt things of our which they valued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were
Knives, Needles, little pieces of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Their clothing is either of Birds-skins,<note place="margin">Their Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> with
the Feathers and Down upon them, or Seals,
Dogfiſh, or the like. Seals they uſe moſt in their
fiſhing, becauſe that fiſh there abounds, and are
eaſily deceived, by ſeeing one clad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their own
Livery: beſides, that theſe kind of Furs are
not ſo apt to be wet, though dip'd in Water.
They wear the hair ſides outward in ſummer,
inward in winter, and in great colds carry two
or more ſuits one upon another. They dreſs
their Skins very well, making them dry, ſoft,
and durable, and ſow them alſo very ſtrong with
Sinews of Beaſts, and Needles made of Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones.</p>
               <p>But in nothing do they ſhew ſo much Art,<note place="margin">Their Boats</note>
as in their Boats or Canoes. They are made
of that we call Whalebone, about in inch thick
and broad, and theſe not ſet like ribs, but all
along from prow to poop, faſt ſowed to one
another with ſtrong Sinews, and covered over
with Seals-skin. They are from ten to twenty
foot long, and about two foot broad, made like
a Weaver's Shutle, ſharp at both ends, ſo that
he can row either way; and in making this
pointedneſs they are of all things moſt curious,
for therein conſiſts the ſtrength of their Veſſel.
In the middle of it are the ribs, both to keep
the ſides aſunder, and to make the hole in the
covering, wherein the Rower ſits. They have
a deck made of the ſame materials, which is
cloſely faſten'd to the ſides, in the midſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is a round hole, as big as the middle of a
Man; ſo that when he goes to Sea, he ſets
himself in that hole, ſtretching out his feet for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52975:253"/>
into the hollow of the Boat; he ſtops up
the hole ſo cloſe with his frock, or looſe upper
garment, that no water can enter, tho' it were
in the bottom of the Sea. His frock is ſtrait
tyed at the hand-wriſts, and to his neck, and
his capouch ſowed alſo cloſe to it; ſo that if
the Boat be overturned or overwhelmed in the
Sea, he riſes up again, without any wet either
upon his Skin or in his Boat. They have but
one Oar, which is about ſix foot long, with a
paddle ſix inches broad at either end; this
ſerves him both to ballance his Boat and move
it; which he doth with that incredible ſceleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that one of our Boats with ten Oars is not
able to keep company with them: The <hi>Daniſh</hi>
relation ſaith, that they rowed ſo ſwift, that
they even dazled the Eyes of the Spectators;
and tho' they croſſed frequently, yet never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfered
or hit one another.</p>
               <p>Their fiſhing ordinarily is darting;<note place="margin">Their Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> their darts
are long, ſtrongly barbed, and at the other end
have Bladders faſtened to them, that when they
have ſtruck the Fiſh, he may ſpend himſelf with
ſtrugling to get under water, which yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do, and ſo is eaſily taken.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, they have greater Boats for the
removing their Tents and other Utensils, as alſo
to carry their Fiſh they have caught to their
Houſes; theſe are thirty and forty foot long,
and have ſometimes ten, and ſometimes more
ſeats for Rowers. Cardinal <hi>Bembus</hi> (in his <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi>
Hiſtory) ſaith, that in his time one of
theſe, with ſeven Perſons in it, was by ſtorm caſt
upon the coaſt of <hi>Britany.</hi> I know not whether
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52975:254"/>
it be worth mentioning, that they have Kettles
and Pans made of Stone (ſome ſay of Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone)
that endures the fire wonderfully, but
not having tools fit to hollow them ſufficiently,
they make up the edges of Whalebone.</p>

               <p>LIeth in 60 deg. more weſterly than any part
of <hi>Europe:</hi> diſtant from <hi>Iſeland</hi> leagues.
It is reported in bigneſs not to be much leſſer

mountains cover'd with ſnow, and the coaſt ſo
full of drift Ice, that it is almoſt inacceſſible.</p>
               <p>It was firſt diſcovered to us by <hi>Nicolao</hi> and
<hi>Antonio Zani,</hi> two <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen,<note place="margin">Its Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries.</note> that were
here ſhipwrack'd. They deſcribe the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
to be good Chriſtians, very civil, and to
be governed by a great Lord whoſe Name was
<hi>Zichmay,</hi> whoſe mighty conqueſts, and ſtrange
accidents may be read in <hi>Hackluit.</hi> It is not
our buſineſs to write or repeat Romances.
Thoſe men whom our Seamen (touching there
accidently) ſaw, were like in all things to the
<hi>Gronelanders,</hi> both in features of body, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of living, as much as they could judge; ſo
like, that many of them thought it continued to
<hi>Groneland;</hi> in which opinion alſo they were
confirm'd by the multitudes of the Iſlands of ice,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52975:254"/>
which coming from the north, argued land to
be that way: for many of our Mariners hold,
that ſalt water doth not freeze, but that all the
Ice they find in the Sea comes from the Bays,
and mouths of freſh-water Rivers; for the ice
it ſelf is ſweet and freſh, being diſſolved, and
ſerves to all purpoſes, as well as Spring or River
water. Beſides, the ſalt Sea (they ſay) is always
in motion, and ſo cannot freeze. But the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
who winter'd in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> took notice, that
the ſalt water freez'd, and that two inches thick
in one night.</p>
               <p>There ſeems to be good fiſhing every
where upon the coaſt. In their ſoundings they
brought up a ſort of pale Coral, and little Stones
clear as Cryſtal. They call'd it <hi>Weſt England,</hi>
and one of the higheſt mountains they called
<hi>Charing-Croſs.</hi>
