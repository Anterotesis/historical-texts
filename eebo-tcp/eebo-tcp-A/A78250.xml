            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The 48 Cities of the <hi>Levites</hi> firſt began
them, in which Jews called <hi>Archiſynago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>

In their Synagogues they diſpute and preach ſitting. The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſit it Chairs, the meaner ſort in ſeats, and the meaneſt of all

            <p>In the morning before they go to their Synagogue, the Wife
is to waken her Husband and the Parents their Children, who
after thirteen years of age are ſubject to their Laws. They are to
awaken before day, that they may make their morning prayer
whilſt the Sun is riſing, and not later, for then they ſay is the
time of being heard, from <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 19. They then frame to ſadneſs
for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and pray for the rebuilding of that City. They
ſay when they ſhed tears in the night the Stars and Planets

them, thoſe tears will blaſt it, from <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

rub his forehead with thoſe tears it will blot out certain ſins
there written, They ſay that in the beginning of the night all
the Gates of Heaven are ſhut, and that there are evil ſpirits
then ſent into the world which hurt all they meet, but after
midnight the Angels are commanded to open Heaven again, and
that the Cocks in the World hear that voyce, at which they clap
their wings and crow, at which they uſe theſe words, <hi>Bleſſed

            </p>
            <p>They uſe filthy blaſphemous words when they go out of their
chamber to the ſtool. They ſay they muſt not touch their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
before they have waſhed their hands in regard of the evil
ſpirits which have reſted in the night thereon, and that if they
ſhould touch their eyes they ſhould be blind, or if their ears, they
ſhould be deaf, the noſe dropping, the mouth ſtinking, the hands
ſcabbed, if not firſt waſhed, becauſe their hands are venomous if
not waſhed firſt, firſt they pour water three times on the right
hand, then three times on the left, then waſh them, and after the
face, and mouth, and then they ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be thou O God our God,
King of all the world, who haſt commanded us to waſh our hands.</hi>

and then bow themſelves towards the Arke in which the
book of the Law is, uſing certain words out of the Scirpture, as

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171221:3"/>
Then they begin to pray out of their Common-prayer book, in
which their prayers are in Hebrew, in meeter, and after their

earth, that all the inhabitants of the earth may know that thou art our
God. Our Father which art in Heaven be merciful unto us, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Then after ſome other ſhort prayers they go on to their Sacrifices,
and they repeat an hiſtory of Sacrifice, and a prayer of the uſe of
the Law, and how many ways it may be expounded. And then
pray for the re-edifying of the Temple, and riſing with great
joy and acclamation, they ſing a prayer of praiſe in hope
thereof.</p>
            <p>Then they read a long prayer, which they conclude with the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171221:4"/>
laſt words of the Prophet <hi>Obadiah, The Saviour ſhall aſcend into
mount Sion to judge the mount of</hi> Eſau, <hi>and the Kingdome ſhall be the
Lords;</hi> Which they ſpake in hope of the deſtruction of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
whom they call <hi>Edomites,</hi> and of their own reſtitution.</p>
            <p>And in ſome of their private writings, which it is hard for
any Chriſtian to come to the ſight of; They ſpeak very blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſay that the ſoul of <hi>Eſau</hi> entred
into the body of Chriſt, and that Chriſt and Chriſtians are no
better then <hi>Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they fall to ſinging again, and after that to prayer again
turning their heads to the four corners and winds of the world,
becauſe the letter <hi>Daleth</hi> ſignifieth four, in their repeating the
Lord is <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>Echad</hi> containing in numeral letters 245.
whereunto they add three, <hi>God our Lord is true,</hi> in all 248. ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
members in mans body, they make ſo many ſhort prayers,
ſaying a prayer ſecures each. They uſe words for charming of
evill ſpirits, and working miracles. And they have another
prayer which they call <hi>Schone Eſre,</hi> that is <hi>eighteen,</hi> conſiſting
of 18 particulars by which they think all ſin is pardoned, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
eſteem as the Papiſts have the Popes Pardons, when they
ſay it, one foot muſt ſtand on the ground as fully as the other,
from <hi>Ezek, 17. Their foot was a right foot,</hi> and in it they uſe theſe
words, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hoſts,</hi> at which they leap up
three times as high as they can; and they ſay that he that ſpeaks
a word whilſt the chief Chanter of the Synagogue ſaith this
prayer ſhall have burning coles given him to eat after his death;
And theſe 18 parts they ſay are for the 18. bones in the back
bone, at the ſaying whereof they all bend it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this follows a Prayer againſt the Jews revolted to
Chriſtianity, againſt all Chriſtians, ſaying,</hi> Theſe which are blotted
out, ſhall have no more hope, and all unbeleevers ſhall periſh in the
twinckling of an eye, and all thine enemies which hate thee, O God,
ſhall bee deſtroyed, and the proud and preſumptuous Kingdome ſhall
quickly be rooted out, broken, laid even with the ground, and at laſt
ſhall utterly periſh, and thou ſhalt make them preſently in our dayes
obedient to us.</p>
            <p>Then they pray for themſelves, and for their Proſelites, and
rebuilding their Temple, the comming of the Meſſias, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171221:4"/>
of their Kingdome, and pray for peace among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
at which they go backward three paces, bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
bending their head firſt on the right hand, and then on
the left, that they may not turn their hinder part on the Ark,
and ſo with a ſlow pace they return out of their Synagogues.</p>
            <p>The Good-wife againſt her husbands return home, ſweeps
the houſe, that nothing may (as they ſay) diſturb his holy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations,
and layeth him a book on the table, either the Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or a book of manners to read, which he doth
for about an hours ſpace.</p>
            <p>About eleven a clock his wife hath prepared his dinner,
clean meats purely dreſt, there is clean water, in which the

and muſt not keep on a ring on their finger, for fear ſome
uncleanneſs remain under it, inſomuch that <hi>Rabbin Akiba,</hi>
having but ſo much water as would ſerve either to waſh his
hands, or quench his thirſt, hee waſhed with it, and dyed for
want of more to drink: Then the maſter of the houſe cuts a
cut of the cleaneſt and beſt baked part of the bread, and then
ſetting it down layes his hands on it, giveth thanks, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that off he hath cut, dips it in ſome broth, or ſome thing on
the table, and eats it, and then takes the loaf, and cuts for the
reſt, and the like for wine, or other drink, except water. Their
bread they have in that honour, nothing muſt be ſet upon it,
and they ſay that a Spirit called <hi>Nabal,</hi> is deputed to obſerve
ſuch as (through negligence) tread it under foot, and to bring
them in to poverty. They ſay that <hi>Elias,</hi> and every mans proper
ſpirit attendeth at the Table, to hear what is ſaid if they talk
of the Law; but otherwiſe an evil Angel cometh, and cauſeth
brawls and diſeaſes. They have ſeveral bleſſings they uſe, and
when they have done, there muſt not bee one crum left in their
mouths. They pray in the place where they have eaten, or elſe
they ſhall loſe the benefit of burial.</p>
            <p>About five a clock, their Clerk, or <hi>Scholae pulſator,</hi> knocks at
their doors to give them notice of evening prayer, they go to
the Synagogue and there they pray, and then the chief Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſter
or chanter, ſings a prayer, and they all ſing the prayer of
eighteen parts uſed in the morning aforeſaid, and coming out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171221:5"/>
