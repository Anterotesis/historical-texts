            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Doth a fountaine send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</hi> But what although <hi>Scotland</hi> be <hi>Egipt</hi> and <hi>Assyria, Esaias</hi> saith, <hi>ch.</hi> 19.18. <hi>And in that day shall five Cities in the land of Egipt speake the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Canaan and sweare by the Lord of hoasts.</hi> And though we be <hi>Assyria</hi> (as M. <hi>Burton</hi> the title page saith) we like that better of the same Prophet, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>In that day shall Israel bee the third with Egipt, and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land, whom the Lord of hoasts shall blesse,</hi> saying, <hi>blessed be Egipt

            <p n="2">2.

<pb facs="tcp:62327:9"/>
against us, we must therefore lay the blame and burden of our blood upon them, especially however the rest above written be also partakers with them of their sinnes. And as the rest of our brethren, who either by silence approve, or by crying peace, peace, strengthen the arme of the wicked, that they cannot returne, in the meane time make the hearts of the righteous sad, they shall all in like manner bee guilty of our blood, and of high Treason against the King of Kings, the Lord Jesus Christ his Crown and Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I but propone to the reall conscience of M. <hi>Burton</hi> that speaketh in his dialogue: 1. If there bee not more of <hi>Christ</hi> in this one letter (if hee will read it all) then in all the virulent peeces hee hath written against his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,<note place="margin">Confor. Defor.</note> who when he suffered, did intercede for him, and lye in the ashes, and behaved themselves as one at his mothers grave.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether or not, he and his brethren who did plead against the <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> in favours of an <hi>Erastian party,</hi> doe not stirre up both <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in this very cause, to bring on a Nationall guilt on the land to inslave the free Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world, and whether in this doe they not <hi>build the sepulchres of the Prophets,</hi> and bring upon their owne heads the blood of the slaine witnesses of <hi>Christ</hi>?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether a distinction will helpe them at the barre of Gods justice, that they sided in hatred of the Presbyteriall government, and of their brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with <hi>Erastians,</hi> in opposing truths of <hi>Christ</hi> in these and the major propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, against the light of their owne conscience, in laying the headship of the Church of Christ on the shoulder of King and Parliament, and then keep in their minde, a mentall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve of the Presbyteriall Church only?</p>
            <p>Now they knew that the question betweene <hi>Erastians</hi> and us, was, whether there be a power of government distinct from the power of the Civill Magistrate in the Church of Christ: but they strike in with <hi>Erastus</hi> against Christ to reach a blow to the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>; but since that time God hath brought downe the sects lower and lower in the hearts of the godly in this Kingdome, and I hope shall lay their honour in the dust; In the same manner M. <hi>Burton</hi> saith, the
<pb facs="tcp:62327:9"/>
giving of this power to the Generall Assembly above the Parliament, incurres a <hi>premunire against the Laws of England,</hi> so saith the <hi>Erastian.</hi> But M. <hi>Burton</hi> knowes that is not the question, and that his congregationall way makes no bones of a farre higher <hi>premunire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. The <hi>Parliament</hi> hath nothing to doe at all in Church matters, more to judge of them, or to punish here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks then if they had no soules. For M. <hi>Burton</hi> saith, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>Confor. Deform. if it be true that Christ hath left such a power to any state then to a Popish state.</hi> But I deny your consequence. Christ hath given to no state a power to inact wicked Laws, or to ratifie wicked Popish constitutions, <hi>ergo,</hi> hee hath not given to a Christian state a power cumulative to bring their glory to the <hi>N. Jerusalem,</hi> and to be Christian nurse-fathers to see the bride of <hi>Christ</hi> sucke healthsome milke, it follows just as this doth. <hi>God</hi> hath not given Kings any power to butcher and destroy the sheep of <hi>Christ, ergo</hi> he hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Kings power to rule and governe a Christian people in equity and justice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Brethren put a stranger <hi>premunire</hi> on us. For would they speake out the mysteries and bottome of Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, they acknowledge not this Parliament in any other sense then they would doe a Parliaments of <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>heathen,</hi> for there be no Christian Magistrates at all to them, but such as are members of their Congregationall Church, that is, such as they conceive to be regenerated; and had they a world at their owne will, then not the twentieth man of this present Parliament, nor Judge, nor Justice of peace could be chosen Magistrates, if the congregations of <hi>England,</hi> were all of the Independent stamp.</p>
            <p>But you may say I slander them, they pray for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as a Parliament, and obey Justices of peace and the King as lawfull Magistrates.</p>
            <p>I answer, its true, so would they pray for <hi>Nero, Dominitian,</hi> and heathen Justices of peace, sent by them as lawfull Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, but not as Christian Magistrates, nor such as they would chuse to reigne over them, because in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of them, they are no lesse without the Church then heathens; then let the world be judge of their candor in contending for a power of <hi>Premunires,</hi> and in voting that
<pb facs="tcp:62327:10"/>
heathen Justices of peace and unchristian Parliaments should be above a free Generall Assembly of <hi>England,</hi> but they could not endure either Magistrates or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of the gang they are now in <hi>England,</hi> to be above one of their Congregations, though consisting of seven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are jealous of any supremacy of Generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies. But say the Congregations of <hi>England</hi> were all Independent, they would not baptise the children of the twentieth Parliament man, Judge and Justice of peace, nor of the King or most professors in <hi>England</hi> as they are now in <hi>England,</hi> nor admit them or their wives or children to the Ordinances, because they are no Church-members, and no better then Ethiopians or Indians to them; and if Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament or Justices of peace should take on them to judge or punish them for this; I beleeve, M. <hi>Burton</hi> and our brethren, would tell them, these that are without the Church, as you are, have no power to judge the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> are to judge of Church administrations, or to whom Ordinances should be dispensed, or not dispensed. Judge, if this be not a supremacy given to seven above the Parliament, and Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Kingdome, which M. <hi>Burton</hi> so much condemned in a Nationall Assembly of all the godly Ministers and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But its a fault that <hi>the Generall Assembly hath power to make rules according to the word of God, appertaining to the good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all the members of the Kirke, and abrogate Statutes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances about Ecclesiasticall matters that are found noysome and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable without the Magistrate</hi>: So did the Assembly at Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem appoint such rules as should binde <hi>Caesar,</hi> so he had been a good <hi>Constantine,</hi> and though they cannot abrogate Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Acts of Parliament by making or unmaking Acts of Parliament (our booke of discipline never mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that, as M. <hi>Burton,</hi> ignorant of the discipline of our Church, saith) yet as the Ministers of Christ, they may juridically declare, yea and preach authoritively that Acts of Parliament establishing the <hi>Masse,</hi> are unlawfull and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse lawes, commanding Idolatry, and denounce a woe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst unjust decrees and lawes, as <hi>Esay</hi> 10.1. else when M. <hi>Burton</hi> preacheth against such lawes, he then must incurre a <hi>premunire, before God, and set himselfe in a Papall throne above
<pb facs="tcp:62327:10"/>
the Parliament,</hi> and enslave the English Subjects; for he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that Statutes of Parliament that establisheth Masse, and the burning of heretickes, that is, Protestants, are to be abrogated, as well as the Generall Assembly of <hi>Scotland</hi> doth; and so M. <hi>Burton</hi> must <hi>set himselfe above Kings and Kesars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when a Synod or Church conveened in the name of <hi>Christ bindes on earth according to the word of God,</hi> Matth 18. there is no lawfull appeal from them to any Civill judicature, not because they are not men, but because they are a Court acting in the name of <hi>Christ</hi> according to his word, and <hi>Christ</hi> with them bindes or looses in heaven, yea there is no reclamation to be made, nor any appeale from one faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastor speaking in the name and authority of <hi>Christ,</hi> according to that, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, he that despiseth you, despiseth me,</hi> and there is no danger to be feared either of Papall tyranny, or Parliamentary breach, or premunire.</p>
            <p>But M. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> saith, <hi>The decisive voyces of a General<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Answ.</hi> So saith the Holy Ghost, the Churches of <hi>Antioch, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Silicia,</hi> were bound to receive and obey the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Synod so soon as they heare them, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.22, 23, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.25. as they that despise the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faithfull Pastors dead and buried, despise <hi>Christ</hi>: so saith that learned and godly man M. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and all the Churches of <hi>N.

            <p>M. <hi>Burton</hi> saith further, <hi>p.</hi> 21. that M. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> saith <hi>ch.</hi> 20.312. <hi>Gov. Chur. Scot. The acts of the Assembly oblige all the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, not present in all their members, and that because whatsoever is by these Commissioners determined and concluded is matter necessary and agreeable to Gods word, as being no lesse infallible then those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions of the Apostles,</hi> Act. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I dare appeale to the conscience of M. <hi>Burton</hi> well informed, and to all the godly, if they conceive any such thing to be my judgement to assert with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; <hi>Papists,</hi>

the infallibility of any Councells, now on earth: yea if he had read, what I have said, <hi>ch.</hi> 14. <hi>p.</hi> 209.212. I prove that the Apostles acted not in that Synod as Apostles, but as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Elders; and Doct. <hi>Whittaker</hi> and M. <hi>Cotton</hi> say the same, though M. <hi>Tho.

But the Independents now in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists</hi> side with <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesius, Grotius, Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> the enemies of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: and say that Synod, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. was an extraordinary Apostolicke meeting that obligeth not the Churches now.

            <p n="2">2. I speake not one word <hi>pag.</hi> 312. of that purpose, but <hi>pag.</hi> 322. I speake, and M. <hi>Burton</hi> both detracteth from, and addeth to, and perverteth my words, which I impute not to malice, as others doe, but to his ignorance of the Discipline of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi>; my words, <hi>ch.</hi> 20. <hi>pag.</hi> 322. are these: <hi>The acts of the Assembly oblige all the absents not present in all their members, as</hi> Act. 23 24.28.

Esai. 44.3, 4. in regard, that though the word goe before, and the word may be preached in the meane time yet the act of infusion of the new heart is no morall action of <hi>God,</hi> but as it were physicall, and it is a reall action, receaved by us by no subordinate literall action or morall apprehension of the minde, or act of the will, and therefore in this formall act of infusion, what the word doth, but by way of disposition or preparing I must professe my ignorance, though it be most true that <hi>faith commeth by hearing, and in the very mean time</hi> Act. 10.44 <hi>whilst Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fel on them which heard the word</hi>; Then if conversion be taken <hi>in congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, vel concreto</hi> in the humbling selfe disparing of a sinner and all preparatory acts; going before the infused life of <hi>Christ,</hi> and in the first operations flowing from this infused life, the word is an instrument of conversion, but I cannot see how it is any active or morall instrument in the soules lying under the Lords act of infusion of the life of <hi>Christ,</hi> except yee call it a passive instrument, because it perswades not the soule to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeve the new life: nor is the soule, being a meere patient, an apprehending, knowing, choosing, or consenting faculty under this action of omnipotency while the Lord powres in a new heart. It is true the word is thus farre the instrument, that the Spirit worketh in us the same habit of new life, and the same Spirit of grace and supplication that is promised in the word Esa. 44.3, 4. Zach. 12.10. Ezeck. 36.26, 27. and the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that the Scripture saith <hi>Christ</hi> by his merits purchased Ioh. 1.16, 17, 18. Ioh. 12.32. Revel. 1.5.

What is this to the Lords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of humane learning, arts and tongues of which the <hi>Apostle</hi>; 1 Cor. 1. speaketh not, but of their carnall abuse of these and glorying in them? and it is to begge the question, to say that this <hi>learning is carnall and fleshly,</hi> in it self, which is now the question. 2 Nor was it out of pride of humane learning, tongues, and arts that the <hi>Iewes</hi> stumbled at <hi>Christ and the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Crosse,</hi> but out of false glosses they put on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> seeking by the law salvation, Rom. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. and by this argument the <hi>Old Testament</hi> is condemned as well as arts and tongues, as an impediment to faith.</p>

                     <p>I could indeed have easily forgotten all these things, which had so much greived mee, but that I rested in hope, that by meanes of those forementioned disputations, I had performed my part, and defended my selfe. But Satan would not be

content with this, but still he brings me upon the stage, as if matters stood not so ill betwixt me and them. I am afraid that had I dyed at <hi>Smalkalden</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should have beene proclaimed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Patron of those Spirits, because they appeale to my Bookes, although they have done it behind my back, without my knowledge and against my will. Nor did they afford me so much respect, as to shew me one word or syllable of it, or to conferre with me about it. I was therfore necessitated to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent more then once <hi>M. Iohn Agricola,</hi> besides my former dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with him in the disputation it selfe, And in the presence of our Doctors and Divines (because he had beene the beginner and Master of this Game) I did let him know all my minde, that he might be throughly sensible, what a pleasure hee had done to my Spirit, which I repute also to be of good proofe.</p>
                     <p>Wherupon he humbly submitted himselfe (as much as words and behaviour could evidence) promising to intermeddle no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if hee had gone too farre, and to comply with us in the same judgement. This so overruled my beleife, that I was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. But it being otherwise construed, yea vaunted of, in pamphlets sent hither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Doctor Martin</hi> and <hi>M. Eisleben</hi> were in good tearmes; I further pressed him to publish in print, an open Recantation, there being no other remedy left, to expell this poyson from the towne of <hi>Eisleben</hi> and the country round about. To this likewise he willingly assented, &amp; offered himself. fearing he should not hit it so well, as to gaine a due approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it; he most earnestly referred the matter to my selfe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating mee to doe it, as well as I could, professing for his part that he would be well contented with it. This induced me to undertake it, &amp; now presently to performe it, especially least it should be given out,<note place="margin">

                     <p>To come then to the matter; the said <hi>I. Eisleben,</hi> Mr. of Arts, willeth me to make a recantation in his behalfe, of what he had preached, or written against the Morall Law, or Ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; and to professe that he is of the same judgement as we are here at <hi>Winterberge,</hi> as likewise at <hi>Augspurg,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of our confession and Apology tendered to the <hi>Emperour</hi>: And if hereafter he shall hold or teach the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,

he willeth me to pronounce the same to be Null and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. I could finde in my heart to commend him for stoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping so low, but it being so manifest, that he was one of my best and neerest friends, I will spare my prayses for another, least the cause should be prejudiced by it, as if I had not gone in good earnest about it. If he continue in this lowlinesse of minde, <hi>God</hi> can, and will exalt him, but if he transgresse, hee may be sure that <hi>God</hi> can as well throw him downe.</p>
                     <p>Let me therefore intreat you, good <hi>M. Doctor,</hi> that you would take this to be written not as to your selfe alone, but that you would make it knowne to others, wherever you can, especially to those that cannot read. For therefore also it is printed, that every one, who will, or can read, may peruse it, least it should be conceived that it was penned only for your sake: Since I am not able to disappoint <hi>Satan</hi> by any other meanes, who still labours by writings to traduce or misconstrue both my person and opinions.</p>
                     <p>And truly, I wonder exceedingly, how it came to be imputed to me, that I should reject the <hi>Law</hi> or ten <hi>Commandements,</hi> there being extant so many of my owne expositions (and those of severall sorts) upon the Commandements, which also are daily expounded, and used in our Churches, to say nothing of the <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Apology,</hi> and other bookes of ours.

For it is our duty to improve all manner of means (such as are divine Menaces, Promises, Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Blessings, and what ever helps we can) to bring men

to Repentance: I mean, by all the Presidents in the word, to bring them to the acknowledgement of sin, and of the Law.

                     <p>Good God! will not men endure it, when the <hi>holy Church</hi> acknowledgeth her sins, beleeves the remission of sins, askes in the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the forgivenesse of sins? But how come we to know what sin is, if there be no Law, nor conscience? And where shall we learn what Christ is, and what he hath done for us? if we could not know, what the Law is, which he hath fulfilled, or what sin is, for which he hath satisfied? And though we should not stand in need of the law for our part, but could pull it out of our hearts (which yet is impossible) notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding there is a necessity of preaching it in respect of Christ (which also is done, and must be done) that the world may know, what he hath either done or suffered for us. For who could know, what, and wherefore Christ hath suffered for us, if no body could tell, what sin was, or the law?</p>
                     <p>I conclude therefore, that the Law, will wee, nill we, must be preached, if we mean to preach Christ, though we should

                     <p>But for the godly, which desire salvation, wee must live, preach, write doe, and suffer all things.

But is it not a singular blindnes &amp; folly of theirs, to conceit that the manifestation of wrath must be something else, beside the law, which cannot possibly bee.

                     <p>I think, that I alone (to omit the Ancients) have undergone more then twenty severall stormes and sects, by which the Devill hath puft at mee.</p>
                     <p>The first was the <hi>Papacy.</hi> And I perswade my selfe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Luthers</hi> suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from Sects</note> that almost all the world knowes, by how many tempestuous winds of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Bookes,</hi> the Devill by those his instruments hath raged against me, how direfully they have torne me in peices, devour'd and brought me to nothing.

                     <p>And when I was almost freed of the feare of these devillish whirlewinds, another stormaticall devill, breakes in upon me through another hole, by <hi>Munster,</hi> and those uproares, which had neere blowne out my candle.

                     <p>As for those which have not openly in print falne upon me, since their venemous malignant papers and speeches, toucht only my person, I will not insist upon them. Only let me adde thus much, that by my owne experience (If I should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on histories) I have learned that the Church will never be at quiet for the good words sake; but must still expect more new tempests from Satan, as it hath beene from the beginning, as you may read in the Ecclesiasticke and Tripartite history, and in the books of the holy Fathers. But should I live yet a hundred yeares, and could I (by the grace of God) appease not onely the former sects, and moderne stormes, but also those, which should arise hereafter; Yet I see well, that no rest can by such endeavours be procured to our posterity, so long as the Devill lives and domineers.

so highly conceited of themselves, as if they had been the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pillars to support the <hi>Church,</hi> and as if the <hi>Church</hi> had been founded upon them; and yet see to what a shamefull end they were brought at last.

How can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? Therefore, what other fine <hi>Catastrophe</hi> could be lookt for at last, but that both horse and rider must break their necks.

That <hi>Paul</hi> in this notion compareth <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> as opposite, and so we, with him, teach that beleevers are not under the Law, in its rigor, exaction and condemnation, but under grace. 3. Yet is the Law not made void, but established by grace, in that the sinner is justified by Christs passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, not in any sort by his owne active and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obedience. And so his justification is to him passive, for both the Law is a meere patient to justifie the beleever, for it condemneth him, but justifieth him not, and he is a meere pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in being justified by the Law, for he never doth, nor can by his owne holinesse active and personall be justified; for that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse is contrary to, and swerveth from the perfect and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Law of God. 4.

                     <hi>This is our very doctrine, point blanke contrary to Antinomians.</hi> Crisp saith, <hi>Sin is taken away, as money removed out of a place, it was once in, it is no more in its being</hi> and nature there,<note place="margin">Pardoned sin is sin, and dwelleth still in iustified beleevers.</note> then if it had never been there. The beleever is as just and as clean from sinne as <hi>Christ</hi>; God cannot see sinne in a beleever, because pardoned sinne as lost the nature of sinne, and both his person and his workes are perfect and sinlesse before God. The devill cannot teach more fleshly doctrine; for we are only by justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation just by a relative righteousnesse as the prodigall banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt is just legally, and free from debt, <hi>for which is his surety hath satisfied.</hi> But the bankerupt personally, inherently, subjectively and in himselfe, is an unjust waster a theef and a robber, and hath in him still a sinfull disposition to take one new debt, except both inherent and assisting grace hinder him; there is not this injustice in the surety, far lesse can any such thing be dreamed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62327:86"/>
to be in <hi>Christ,</hi> nor is pardoned sinne taken away in its nature and being, as mony removed out of a place, its only in its law, obligation, and rigid power of condemning removed, as if it never had been; and we, with <hi>Luther,</hi> say, that sinne remaineth <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>essentially</hi> sin in the compleat being and nature of sin, both in our person and best workes after we are pardoned and justified, though God see it not as a judge therfore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us; the sting and condemning guilt of sin, not the sinne it self, in its nature and being, is removed, as a Serpent without a sting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath still the being and nature of a Serpent.

all the murthers and adulteries of beleevers, are sins onely in our <hi>sense,</hi> that is, in the apprehension of our unrenewed part, not to the light and judgement of faith, now so <hi>Antinomians</hi> follow <hi>sense.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

hath repented perfectly, he hath sorrowed for sinne perfectly, he hath obeyed perfectly for us, and all is</hi> ours, <hi>and we are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</hi> Now <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> can have no such sense as here hee would force on himselfe: For never man doubted, but perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall acts of grace, or, don by the strength of grace, are ours; but how are they ours? as <hi>we are Christs</hi>? onely as Christ acteth them for us without us. No, are they not ours? the Spirit of Jesus worketh them in us, and causeth us personally to doe and act them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>John</hi> 7.39? If Christs perfect belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, perfect repenting, and his perfect mortifying of sinne be ours, because Christ did these acts for us in the dayes of his humiliation while he was in the flesh; then are they ours before we be born, and the holy Ghost must exhort us to doe all in the strength of Christ, and to be sanctified, and to beleeve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to justification, and that we be his workmanship, to walk in good workes, that we <hi>put on the new man,</hi> that we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie sin 1640 yeares before we be born: for so many yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe Christ performed all these things for us: but we are this day exhorted to put on the new man, and to walk in good works.

                  <hi>this day, repent while it is to day, stand up from the dead to day, beleeve to day</hi>; he must mean, you need not stirre foot or hand, or any power of your soul to these acts: for Christ performed all these acts for you 1640 yeares agoe. For then he must mean Christ hath repented perfectly in me a beleever, and wrought perfect repentance free of sinne in me a sinner, and <hi>Christ</hi> hath obeyed perfectly in me a sinnerr; that is, by his merit and Spirit, <hi>Christ</hi> hath wrought in me and in my sinful person, perfect obedience, and so hath made my personall sanctification, my personall new obedience by his grace perfect, and perfectly conforme to the Law, which is most false. And when <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I am able through Christs strength to doe all things,</hi> his meaning must be, <hi>Christ</hi> worketh in me, in my sinfull soule, understanding, will, affections, and whole man, to doe all things through Christs strength perfectly, as Christ doth all things perfectly.

purer and finer Gospel mortification, then the <hi>Protestant Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galists</hi> have done in former times, as he saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pag. 61, 62. Now if his mortification be in Christ onely, and not in the sinner himselfe, nor any act of him, and a perfect mortification in Christ onely, as the meritorious cause, and also as the onely efficient, not in us, and as in Christ the onely subject not in us: then I grant he gives us a finer mortification, because what Christ doth onely and perfectly, and in himselfe, not in us, must be finer then any mortification or acts of sanctification we doe in our person, though we doe these by the Merit and Spirit of Christ working in us to will and to doe. But then <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> nill he, will he, must say, the Gospel-mortification is that whereby <hi>Christ</hi> hath perfectly mortified sin for us, and not that (which he sayth. <hi>Sparkles of glory,</hi> 324, 325.) <hi>mortification which Christ first doth in himself, and then in us through himself</hi>; and so he vindicates not himselfe. (4.) <hi>I never yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>denied gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and fruits of the Spirit of God, which appeare in faith, repentance, new obedience, mortification of sinne. I speak it in another concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and measure of light. —The Christian as the English or French, can onely speak in his own tongue or language, till the Lord be One, and his Name One amongst us. It is true,</hi> 1. <hi>Saltmarsh and Antinomians say, there are graces of Faith, Repentance, Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or rather, (as Town saith) gifts of Faith, &amp;c.</hi> But 1. they are not Gospel-mortification. Why? Gospel-mortification is perfect in <hi>Christ,</hi> saith <hi>Saltmarsh, Free Grace,</hi> pag. 84. these that are in us, are not perfect at all, nor conformable to Law and Gospel. 2. They are not commanded so, as the contrary omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions should be sinne, they are onely free and arbitrary acts of the Spirit, and of a spirit separated from the word. 3. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> denies not graces in faith, repentance, and mortification. But he denies the necessity of the things themselves, as acted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally by us; Yea, <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> saith, Confession, Repentance, are sinnes, at least infirmities or sinnes of weaknesse.

How then can <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> acknowledge grace or fruits of the Spirit, except he acknowledge grace in sinning, which were absurd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> calleth his unsound speaking, <hi>a Christian spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, till the Lord be one, and his Name One</hi>; as if the expressions of Antinomians and their Hereticall doctrine, were the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a Christian, when it is the language of the <hi>Antichrist.</hi> And if <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> failed but in expression, he should have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered his own Arguments, and the Scriptures that Mr. <hi>Gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi> alledges on the contrary, and confessed Mr. <hi>Gattakers</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was found in that point, and his own Familisticall, in his way of expression of it, at least.</p>

               <p n="2">2. When we passe from Law to Gospel, we leave shadowes, and approach nearer to the Sunne, and the night-torches of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are blown out, <hi>because the day dawneth.</hi> But that we are to admit new lights contradicent to the old, is an untruth: there
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:62327:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was ever the same truth from the beginning, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. neither Christ nor Truth weares out of fashion, the matter is not thus.</p>
               <p>It was not of old, <hi>Confesse sinne,</hi> and now <hi>it is sinne to Saints to confesse sinne.</hi> Nor was it of old, that <hi>David was justified by workes</hi>; but now <hi>Paul is justified without workes by the imputed righteousnesse of Christ.</hi> Nor was it of old, <hi>a pardoned man can sin,</hi> and is forbidden to murther; but now <hi>a pardoned man can not sin,</hi> &amp; no written law forbids a Saint to murther. Thus, we burn no, we crucifie no truths, no acts of righteousnesse, the grace of God commands them now, as then, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.12. and never bad crucifie them. Thus we wash our hands of new lights, or rather new lies, contradicent to old truths; new and clearer manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ancient <hi>Christ,</hi> are our new lights.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. There is no passing from Law to Gospel, the Law and Gospel-truths are never called <hi>Hay and Stubble,</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to silver and gold; truth is not opposed to truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God burnes that trash, law-merits we are to burn.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That hay is laid upon a golden foundation, Christ; Law or Gospel-merits are not builded on Christ: the Spirit expones not this text so as <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> doth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> his hap to misexpone all places for the last judgement, and the resurrection of the body. I dare say, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth never minded his passing from one ministration to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>the burning of the earth, and the works of it,</hi> is not mens burning of all their works. For 1. Scoffers mock the last day, and the promise of Christs comming, but not the joyfull day of their passing from their scoffing, merits, selfe-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to a new ministration of glory. 2. <hi>Peter</hi> minded a reall, not metaphoricall destroying of the world in <hi>Noahs</hi> time, not with figurative, but most reall waters, and from that of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the earth with fire really, not figuratively. 3. The whole frame of the creation here is put out of order, v. 10.11. 4. <hi>It is the day that shall come as a Thiefe in the night</hi>; which is the day of judgement, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.43, 44. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.1.2. 5. It is the day before which God will gather in his own, willing them to be saved. 6. It is called, <hi>The day of the Lord, v.</hi> 4.9, 10. I should not spend time to refute such new dreames.</p>

the law commanding intire and absolutely perfect obedience under a curse, and having no promise of the spirit and grace, to obey, and this <hi>oldnesse of the letter</hi> is the meere letter of the law, as law-holding us as the Sonnes of the old <hi>Adam</hi> under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. And the <hi>newnesse of the spirit</hi> is the grace of the Gospel inabling us to obey what the law commandeth, and whereas we cannot obey perfectly, assuring us we are under a new Husband and Surety who by his merits takes away the guilt of our sinne, for the <hi>oldnesse of the letter</hi> is opposed to the <hi>newnesse of the spirit</hi> in the Text, as two contrary states, to wit, the state of Law, and the state of Grace, which are as two contrary Husbands, the one saving, the other condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>oldnesse of the letter,</hi> or of the law is not contrary to the ordinances of scripture, Hearing, Praying, Sacraments; for then the law should condemne and forbid all these, which it doth not.</p>

be ordinances, the Apostles were Ministers of the letter to all saved, and not saved; for word, and seals, and Law, and Gospel, were written, spoken, preached, held forth by the Apostles, to both saved, and lost in the visible Church.

The old and new Testament doe remaine, and must be preached till Christs second comming. Yea, that the letter and outward ordinances are not done away, as <hi>Moses</hi> his veile, and his shaddows and types, is most evident in that <hi>John</hi> who wrote

after the ministration of the Spirit was come, and to these <hi>who have the anointing that teach them all things,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. saith expresly, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. we declare unto you (by writing) the word of life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1.

               <p n="5">5 The Gospel and new Testament Ordinances are delivered with much plainenesse of speech, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is yet to be read, and far more the new Testament is to be read and preached, as is cleare <hi>v.</hi> 14.

                  <hi>I desire we may beare one anothers burdens, and consider that God is in all his severall dispensations, and measures; and Christians are not to hasten out of any, till the Lord himselfe say, Come up higher, and the stronger are to beare the infirmities of the weak.</hi>

                  <hi>as far as Conscience will permit.</hi> But shall the Christian doe nothing for truths sake, and for the commanding law of God in Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or in unity or onenesse in externall worship? In external worship then we have no law, but please one another in love, and the law of peace, or if Conscience have any acting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it is Conscience acted by the Spirit without the word, so in all externals (if we keepe faith and love in the heart, we may live as we list,) A good loose world: there is an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in wars, in marrying, in whoring, in invading the rights of the Subjects, their power, liberty, goods, possessions, wee have no law in these, but peace &amp; pleasing one another in love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

men, as to will any to lose his life, his houses, children, brother, sister, lands, for him and the Gospel.</hi> Hee may deny God and Christ, and both Law and Gospel before earthly Judges, if hee keep a good heart to God, he failes not against Religion, or any of the first foure commands; for Religion is fettered within the circle of the minde.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p>But if conscience ought to bee the ruling principle in all we doe in acts of the second, as well as the first Table of the Law; yea in eating and drinking, 1 Cor. 10.31. the sword hath no place at all over Christians, or any at least professing Christ: these that marry many wives at once, and sacrifice their children to devills, and thrust men out of their possessions, and take them to themselves, because they, being Saints, are the only just owners of the earth, and <hi>the meeke shall inherit the earth,</hi> these that sweare a Covenant when they are low, as <hi>Familists</hi> doe professe they may, and deny their Religion before men, as <hi>H.

               <p>
                  <hi>In other things God hath put the sword in the Parliaments hands, for the terror of evill doers—If any plead exemption from it, he knows not the Gospel.</hi>

               <p>The Author and M. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> must herein renounce <hi>H.

Beacon, and others,</note> that all externalls are indifferent, by Gal. 6.15. <hi>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature,</hi> and 1 Cor. 10.29. Now by outward things <hi>Familists</hi> must meane all outward worship or Idolatry, and why not acts of saving or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our brother, the taking or not taking of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wife to please her in love, for the <hi>Law of love, of Spirit and life is more Royall and excellent, then committing</hi> Idolatry or not committing Idolatry, then murther, adultery, perjury, &amp;c. or not doing of these outward things, because the <hi>Law of love,</hi> is the cause and generall Commandement of the whole Law and above externalls; but if these be indifferent, so as we must, for love and the unity of the Spirit, do them, or not doe them; then <hi>Peter</hi> was not to be blamed by <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. for he pleased the Jews in that he did, but <hi>Paul</hi> saith in Judaizing in a lesse matter, <hi>he was to be blamed, and looked awry to the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can <hi>Familists</hi> say in externals in the first table we are to do, or not do, as the Law of love, in pleasing one another, shall permit, but in matters of the second Table before men, we are not to murther, or not murther, whore or not whore, because the Law of love cannot stand with murthering, whoring, stealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I see not but the indifferency upon the <hi>Familists</hi> ground is the same as touching both Tables of the Law.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:62327:152"/>1. Because if Christ free us from the Law as a rule of life, he freeth us from the Commandements of the second Table, as a rule of life, as from these of the first Table, because the Gospel-liberty is alike from all and every part of the Law, except we say <hi>Christ</hi> leaves us under condemnation as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching sinnes against the second Table, but freeth us from condemnation as touching Idolatry, perjury, blasphemy, Atheisme, unbeleefe, which is absurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are to please one another in love, Rom. 15. espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in acts of charity between man and man, in eating or not eating, Rom. 14. and why not in acts of adultery and murther? he that said, <hi>(Thou shalt not worship false Gods)</hi> said <hi>(Thou shalt doe no murther.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Law of loving God which is more worthy then the Law of loving our neighbour, makes the keeping of the first Table as strong a band to please God in loving him, and in keeping all his Commandements, as the Law of loving of our neighbour, if it be true, that we must obey <hi>God</hi> rather then man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But here is the mystery, there is no sinne, in relation to God, can be committed by a pardoned man, because pardon makes him he cannot sin; but for scandals sake he must not displease his brother.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we must, in outward things, please all, in love and the unity of the Spirit, then doth the Law of love oblige us to contradictory observances at one and the same time, which is unpossible: for to be circumcised, offended <hi>Paul,</hi> and beleevers of the Gentiles, and not to be circumcised, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Jewes, then doe what yee can, yee must fail against the Law of love and the vnity of the Spirit: And then <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsh</hi> and <hi>Beacon</hi> among Jewes must bee circumcised, and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that is to <hi>fall from Christ</hi>; then may wee whore or not whore, murther or not murther, to please one another in love, and professe or deny <hi>Christ</hi> before men, to please one another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The law of God and command of Christ, that must flow from the law of love, (for love is a fullfilling of the law) doth command the <hi>Apostles to teach and baptize,</hi> and command the people to heare, and be baptized, and to eate and drinke till

the Lords second comming, in remembrance of <hi>Christ</hi> crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then except we sinne against the love of God, we cannot wholly omit these outward things.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Upon this ground, <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> and <hi>Beacon</hi> doe preach, writ Books, pray, which are outward things, yet they cannot but displease their brethren the <hi>Seekers,</hi> and the most spirituall or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most carnall of the Family of love, in so doing, for they breake the unity of the Spirit in these outward things, when they ought in love to please one another, and not writ any thing, which they thinke and professe to bee a ly.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> So <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> here opens a great mystery of <hi>Familisme,</hi> which is Liberty of conscience, and salvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Religions, for if any forme of Religion, never so sound be commanded even by a Law of God, and ratified politically by a Law of man, and none left free to mens owne Spirit as to the only binding rule, though it be a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sathan, it is no <hi>lawfull Religion</hi> to <hi>Saltmarsh.</hi> Now that this is his minde is cleare from that he saith Spark. 171, 172. <hi>In books of controversie, we can but set letter to letter, and Scripture to Scripture, and argument to argument, and nothing can be judged till the day or time of more revelation of truth, till the Holy Ghost and fire sit upon each of us, trying every mans worke, and burning up that in us which is hay and stubble,</hi> in which words beside that <hi>Saltm.</hi> judgeth and condemneth himselfe in writing this same booke of <hi>Controversie</hi> in favour of the <hi>Familists</hi> condemning, in expresse words, the Protestants in all the articles of their faith, he will have no man to see truth, or to judge any otherwise, or know what he beleeves but by conjectures, <hi>till the day of revelation come,</hi> that he turne <hi>Familist</hi> and become <hi>all Spirit,</hi> and <hi>all glory</hi>; so all the Protestants that are not <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi> set but letter to letter, and are literall legalists, and have no certainty what they beleeve, and when this Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, he teacheth not by the word, <hi>setting letter to letter, and Scipture to Scripture,</hi> but by immediate inspiration, above and beyond the word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Spirit even having come upon <hi>Saltmarsh,</hi> as hee plainly saith, p. 68. And in his Epistle to the Parliament p. 2.3. does but dictate to him errors, <hi>hay and stabble</hi> that must be consumed; for if he so do, when he hath taught these toyes hee teacheth the contrary the next day, what a spirit is this?</p>

If the Scripture be not the judge of controversies, by <hi>setting letter to letter, Scripture to Scripture</hi> (understood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the naturall, and genuine grammaticall sense, which the words yeeld without constraint) then is the Scripture, as Scripture, and in its native sense, a nose of wax, and hath no native sense, but wee are to expect a higher, spirituall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorick sense, then the letter can beare, &amp; that from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

or they are in conscience perswaded of, to all the Kingdome, they should then all minister as they had received,</hi> and should be good <hi>stewards of the manifold grace of God</hi>; for so <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh, 1 Pet. 4.11. for sure <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> cannot say, the commandement of the <hi>Parliament</hi> must be required to make a Synod, if men speake their owne drunken perswasions, to M. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> they fulfill the Apostle <hi>Peters</hi> rule, <hi>Let every one minister as he hath received.</hi> Now, by this, to <hi>minister as we receive,</hi> is not to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, as <hi>we receive from the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. nor according as Ministers, <hi>Heare the word at the mouth of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Joh 6.45, 46. because the Lord or his Spirit, or the anointing cannot teach men lyes, contrary to the word of truth; but the perswasions of men often are lyes, errors, mistakes, then shall every mans erroneous conscience, and his owne dreaming spirit be the rule of his owne faith, and his teaching of others.</p>
               <p>And 2.

               <p n="3">3. Why?

                  <hi>is when the spirits of Prophets are subject to the Prophets, that is, when the gift by which any one speakes of Jesus Christ is manifested in the hearts or spirits of the Saints, when they see the truths, they minister, as they are in Jesus, and in themselves, and in them that are spirituall and truly anointed, by the same Spirit,</hi> 91, 92.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christs Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not under a stinted litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in the dayes of our Saviours conversing with them on earth (as Saltm. sayes) at which time they were the anointed of God as well as afterward.</note> Such a subjection to the Prophets hath no warrant in the Text, for it supposeth none to be Prophets, but those that are inwardly anointed, and manifest their spirit of Prophesie to the anointed only; as if the anointed may not take him, for an anointed Prophet who is only gifted and void of saving grace.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Such lying wresting of Scripture from the literall and native sense of the Spirit is the way with <hi>Origen</hi> to turn all Scripture into allegories, and types; for read the words, and they are a Propheticall threatning of death to the false teacher by his nearest bloud-friends, alluding to Deut. 13. <hi>where father and mother</hi> were to cast stones at those, dearest to them, if they should prophesie lyes, and this is to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled under the <hi>Messia's</hi> opened fountaine of his blood, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>I will cause the Prophet to cease,</hi> his father shall threaten him. <hi>Thou shalt not live, he shall be</hi> ashamed, and shall not dare to professe himselfe a <hi>false Prophet,</hi> but a <hi>herdman,</hi> and hee shall have visible wounds; these are <hi>the wounds I received in the house of my friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What sense is there here? these that begat him, that is, his cryers up that extolled his learning shall say, <hi>thou shalt not live,</hi> that is, thou shalt be a Prophet no more in request, and they shall thrust him through by strength of reason and confound him. What is it to mocke the word, if this be to expone it? his cryers up are his Disciples and seduced followers? shall they refute him and they only? not the Pastors and teachers?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This thrusting through of the false Prophet shall cause the false Prophet dissemble and deny his Religion for feare of his life, and say, <hi>I am a herdman, not a Prophet.</hi> This is the great argument that <hi>Libertines</hi> have against the coercive po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the <hi>Magistrates</hi> sword against false teachers, and here it followes upon the strong convincing arguments used against them by <hi>Libertines,</hi> as the sole and only way of extirpating heresie? and are false Prophets so afraid of arguments that

               <p n="4">4. These false teachers shew the visible wounds they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the house of their friends, and complaine of the zeale of their friends against them in delivering them up to the Magi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hence these Conclusions of the former.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Conclu.</hi> All the Saints, as Saints are not Prophets, but some only called by God thereunto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Are all Prophets?</hi> Eph. 4.11. <hi>Christ gave some to be Prophets.</hi> Obey them that are over you in the Lord. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit of prophesie is master of the man in whom he is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I was in the Spirit in the Lords day.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.7.17 1 Tim 5.17. 1 Tim. 3.1, 2, 3.4, v. 12. 1 Tim. 5.19. Rev. 1.16.

I was as a vessell casten into the sea, there is more of the sea without it, then within it. So these that are in a trance are said to fall, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.4. from themselves. Hence that question, whether these that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie doe know perfectly what they prophesie?</p>
               <p>To which I answer, there is a twofold knowledge, one naturall and conjoyned with organicall knowledge;<note place="margin">Of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of such as are under actuall vision in a trance,</note> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intellectuall and abstract.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is an evident intellectuall knowledge, and a more imperfect and darker knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:62327:169"/>Then if we speake of an organicall knowledge, the man under actuall vision knowes not whether he be in the body, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut of it, as <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. yea and <hi>Peter</hi> in a trance, not only could not see, heare or eat, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.10. but was wholly acted upon by God: but <hi>Act.</hi> 12. an <hi>Angel</hi> comes to him and loseth his chaines and <hi>causeth him gird himselfe and binde on his sandals,</hi> and he thought it had been <hi>a vision,</hi> and knew not that it was any thing but an intellectuall, visionall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, not a reall deliverance, till he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>v.</hi> 11. yet something of a trance there was, for hee was not at himselfe, then we may see and act bodily with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and walke and not know the necessity of what wee know, see or doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we speake of a weaker Propheticall sight, since the light of Prophesie can let us see in the opened speces things to come, and we may know that we know them, &amp; that they are revealed: but when the Prophets preach of new what they have seen in a vision, and prophesie to Kings and to men, they are in far other condition,<note place="margin">Prophets not ever under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall vision as Prophets, when they preach their visions to men, and in a far other case then when they are in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ly see the visions of God.</note> then when under an actual vision, because under an actual vision, I conceive they are not under the dominion of free-will. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> cannot chuse but see a seething pot toward the North, because the object naturally offers it self to the fancy, &amp; God never threatneth a Prophet under pain of punishment, to see visions, for he cannot here wink and close the eyes of his mind. <hi>Balaam</hi> could not chuse, but see the <hi>visions of God, and the goodlinesse of Jacobs tents,</hi> Num. 24. and if the Spirit thus should act the Saints to pray, praise, hear with faith, I thinke their acts should not bee acts of free obedience, nor capable of a precept, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of these acts lye faire for a threatning, rebuke, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
               <p>But when the Prophets deliver these truths that they did see in raptures and visions, they doe not ever speake these truths to men, and preach them by a Propheticall rapture, but by the Spirit of grace sometimes, or by a common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall gift, as in wicked Prophets, not that Prophets doe actually publish their visions and Prophesie, not as Prophets but as godly men, I have not that meaning, but that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inspiring impulsion of an actuall extasie doth
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:62327:169"/>
not ever lead them to preach. So God never doth command and threaten men to see the visions of God, for here there is no place for free election, but God chargeth and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to preach the truth, which he saw in a vision, Jer. 1.17. <hi>Thou therefore gird up thy loynes, arise and speake unto them all that I command thee</hi>; and he threatneth him in case of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>Be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them</hi>; and he comforteth him in the following words, 18. <hi>Behold I have made thee this day a defenced City, and an iron wall.</hi> So the Lord speaketh to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> also, <hi>c.</hi> 15.19, 20. then we need not say necessarily that <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did actually prophesie or see the visions of God, when he saith, <hi>ch.</hi> 26.15. <hi>of a truth the Lord hath sent me to you</hi>: at least there is no warrant to say that when the Prophets doe speake and publish their visions to these to whom God hath sent them to Prophesie, that they are in the act of publishing and preaching to men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same actuall and immediate impulsion of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> that they are under while they are in a trance, and actually see the visions of God, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was <hi>c.</hi> 1.11.12. when hee seeth these visions. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> only obeyeth Gods command, and relateth his visions that he had seene before, and did this by the Spirit of grace common to other belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by which he was inclined to bee faithfull in speaking, what he had heard and seene: and the like I say of <hi>Micajah</hi> in preaching to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and of all the true Prophets, who did not ever from a Propheticall instinct, utter or preach to men the things they had seene in extaticall visions, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from a principle of grace by which they were to bee faithfull to him who sent them, and durst not preach smooth things, nor conceale the visions of God. False Prophets as <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> doe out of a Propheticall impul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on both see and speake the visions of God, and are punished of God, for speaking Propheticall truths which they cannot chuse, but must speake, for they preach them not, because they are awed of God, and dare not heale the wound of the daughter of Gods people with faire words, but beside their intention as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. <hi>ch.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>And thus it is not necessary, when Prophets reveale vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that in that act of revelation, they see them to be true
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62327:170"/>
revelations, with only a Propheticall light. And because the Propheticall light is not perfect, but infused <hi>ad modum recipientis</hi> as we are capable to receive, the speces of things may be objected to the Prophets understanding, and they see them as things, but not in the spirituall signification they stand under; so <hi>Iohn</hi> saw seven starres, and seven golden Candlestickes, but knew not that the one noted the <hi>seven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Church,</hi> and the other the <hi>seven Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prophets see not really the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves present, offered to them in the visions of God, but only the speces or images ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the decree of God or some other way.</note>The way <hi>God</hi> offers the speces to the understanding is not knowne to us, but it is sutable and congruous to the nature of Spirits.

Now this Propheticall Spirit doth not act the Saints in beleeving and praying, or the like, as <hi>Antinomians</hi> would have all to be Prophets but the Spirit of grace and supplication, of which these considerations may serve to cleare truth between us and <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who runne the way of <hi>Enthusiasts.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The word and the Spirit are united as the principall and instrumentall cause, as <hi>Christ</hi> is where his word is either converting or convincing, and because the way of <hi>Christs</hi> working by the word is much in a morall way, as by a signe conveying the thing signif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the characters and letters we read, the sound of preaching wee heare, remain not, but are transient and passing away things, they are not limbs nor members of a new creation, the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or images of the word may remaine in the memory, but in the new creature there is nothing transient or corruptible such as figures, letters, signes, and sounds, as when a grain of wheat is casten into the earth, the husk passeth away and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,

               <p n="2">2.

The Kingdome of God is not in letters, nor in externalls, but in life and power. The glasse of the Physitian workes not the cure, but the oyle in it. The Doctors written directions in the sicke-mans pocket helpes him not a whit; no man shall lay the only outside of ordinances lower in the dust then we. All the obliging power is from the letter of the word, all the strengthning physicall power, by which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to act, is from the Spirit that worketh with the word, and if we speake properly, a beleever is not under an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging and morall commanding power, because the Spirit acts them in prayer or beleeving, for the naked Spirit, as the Spirit is not a morall rule to me to act by, nay it is not to me the Spirit of God; now when the Canon of Scripture is closed, but as the Law and the Testimony, goes along with it, for by the Law and testimony, I know now that it is no deluding Spirit, but the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> but all the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and morally obliging power is from the word as it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the sign and the will of God signified: for I must obey, because God intimates his will to me in the word, and I am strengthned to obey from the acting of the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Saltmarsh Sparkles of glory,</hi> pag. 245. refuteth this, in the <hi>Protestants generally.

I grant the Gospell in its letter both promiseth a new heart and a new spirit, which the Law as the Law doth not, and, when the Spirit joynes with the preached Gospel, and the Law also doth prepare the sinner for Christ, by the word of the Gospell the Spirit is given, and so the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> are <hi>Ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 3. The Law in compelling under the paine of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death to superlatively perfect obedience, hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by accident and extrinsecally conjoyned with it, as it is the Spirit of the Mediator that makes use of it to cause the broken man see his unpayable, and to him, impossible debts, and cause him heare the tinkling and noise of the fetters and chaines of hell, that he may flye to the Gospell-surety, which the same Spirit reveales to him in the Gospell. Now this is an extrinsecall use of the Law.</p>
               <p>For 1. The Law should have its intire and perfect essence and full operation in rewarding or punishing, if we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there never had beene a surety for sinners, nor a Gospell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its a Gospell-spirit that makes this use of the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove its nature, for that, which can but reveale to the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man, debts unpayable by him, and incloseth him in an eternall jayle, and gives no strength, nor way of redemption, cannot have of it selfe any influence to lead the broken man
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:62327:178"/>
to a surety. But this the Law doth of it selfe, hath not of it selfe one fourth part of an ounce of Gospell-courtesie, or grace, to bestow on the sinner.</p>
               <p>But 2. The compelling rigor of the Law, as touching perfect and eternally active and passive obedience, must bee considered in its severall branches, as it commands perfect active obedience, or as it obligeth to passive obedience, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects two sorts of persons; the man Christ, in the dayes of his flesh, and the elect Angels; or 2. fallen sinners.</p>
               <p>In the former consideration, the Law, in it selfe as the Law, eternally and immutably presseth perfect active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but gives not strength to obey, but supposeth strength to these, to whom it is first given: but if so be that these to whom it is given, have abundance of the Spirit and strength to obey perfectly, as <hi>Christ</hi> in the dayes of his flesh and the elect Angells have, the Law, in its highest rigor of commanding perfect obedience, (it is not properly rigor, though we must use the word, but strictnesse) hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive power over them; for ye cannot say that a willing man, or a man delighting to obey <hi>God,</hi> is compelled to obey <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we speake of man fallen in sinne, who is unable to performe perfect active obedience, the Law stands over him in a highest pitch of morall compulsion: for whether he be willing to obey or have the Spirit, or be unable and void of the Spirit, the Law standeth above him exacting a summe of ten thousand talents from him, that cannot pay the hundreth part of halfe a talent, or an halfpenny, as he ought.</p>
               <p>And the man, out of <hi>Christ</hi> and under the Law, is still compelled in both active and passive obedience; the letter of the Law and this ministration of death without the Spirit hailes and draws him, as the literall prisoner fettered by a extremely exacting Law void of all Spirit, and conferring no saving strength on him to doe or suffer, the penalty of the Law.</p>
               <p>And for the beleever in Christ, the rigor of the Law is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, not that the Law, as the Law, requireth lesse of him then absolutely perfect obedience, but because in what hee comes short in performing of new obedience, from a new

principle, to wit, a Gospell-spirit in him, he is pardoned in Christ, and the rest is accepted for Christs sake, as if it were obedience.</p>
               <p>Now in this new obedience, the Spirit so oyleth the wheeles of free-will as obedience, in its kinde, is as free, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, delightfull, being sweetned with the love of God, as if there were not an awing Law, but a sweetly alluring and heart-drawing free love, so that the beleever obeyes with an Angell-like obedience; then the Spirit seemes to exhaust all the commanding awsomenesse of the Law, and supplyes the Lawes imperious power with the strength and power of love; if we suppose there had been no Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Christ absolute obedience, yet if we suppose a meer directing light,<note place="margin">How morall compulsion of the Law is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted by the freenesse of a Gospel-spirit of love.</note> without any compelling, to shew him what is good and agreeable to Gods commanding will, so did <hi>Christ</hi> obey perfectly from a principle of love, and so doth the justified beleever give obedience, though imperfect, yet sincere to what is Gods will? then it followeth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The higher and larger measure of willingnesse, or the more superlatively the will be bended, the light of a divine Law shining on the minde and will, the more of the Spirit, (because the Spirit is essentially free, <hi>Ps.</hi> 51.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17.) the more freenesse: and the more freenesse, the more renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will in the obedience: and the more renewed will the lesse constraint, because freenesse exhausteth constraint, and especially when constraint looketh toward eternall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Law compelleth, under pain of eternall death, those that are under Law-obligation,<note place="margin">Threatning had influence on the will of the first Adam, not of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Angels.</note> to obey.

these, to wit, that <hi>Christ God-man dyed not for sinners, as Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists teach,</hi> and <hi>that he rose not for our righteousnesse, that he justifieth not the ungodly that beleeve in him; and that there were not eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but only two saved in the arke.</hi> For this were,</p>

                  </note> that was not in God toward that person from eternity: but the truth is, God first createth a lovely, and love-worthy object, and then out of that love that createth being, and the lovely object, hee goeth on to continue the former act of loving and delighting in that object, and rendreth it more lovely. Creatures cannot cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the object of their love, but find it created to their hand, and expect to have some perfection added to them in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love, with that excellent thing they love, and they are often deceived; and ever their love hath a cause, and hire, and reward in the thing loved. Now, when it is said, that God <hi>loveth all that he hath made,</hi> then he created his owne lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and his owne love. 2.

its rise in time. If then <hi>Antinomians</hi> say, we make our time-holinesse a cause and condition of eternall love, they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this objection themselves; for imputed righteousnesse which they make the cause of eternall love will stand against them, more then against us. For wee say, both imputed and inherent righteousnesse are meere conditions, no causes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love, and that not simply, but as they are protracted and continued, to carry us on to glory; yea imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is no more a cause of eternall love, being onely a thing temporary, and not eternall, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> nor inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; so must all these be expounded. <hi>The Lord</hi>

Nor can <hi>Antinomians</hi> deny but temporall punishments, as well as eternall are threatned in the law.</p>

                  </note> the former is removed; the justified man by no Law, or Law-obligation, is to eschew Adultery, as a sinne against God. 1.

Onely by an obligation Physicall, and of the Spirit, such as we call an obligation of naked courtesie, if he forbeare, it is an act of love and arbitrary freedome, but if hee commit it, it is not sinne, because it is in him against no Law-obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no more then an <hi>Englishman</hi> committing felony against the Lawes in <hi>England,</hi> (it is the <hi>Antinomians</hi> owne comparison) or killing a Swan in <hi>Thames,</hi> which is forbidden by the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> does faile against the Lawes of <hi>Spaine.</hi> So his sin is against love, not Law, as if the Law commanded not all love, and love with all the heart; and as if these two were contrary, and the Law and the Gospel did involve two contrary, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory wills in God; and the Lord should be changeable and unconstant in Law and Gospel; and his Adultery should bee contrary to men and Christian conversation onely, not to God.</p>

               <p>Secondly, it is needlesse to make comparisons between assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance resulting from inherent graces, and the immediate voice and speaking of the Spirit; as if the former were our owne spirits reasoning, the latter onely the testimony of the Spirit, for we judge both to bee the testimony of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; as it is the same love sealed to the Spouse from the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromes owne word, and seale, and hand-writing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to her by his Bracelets, Rings, Jewels, and love-tokens that he sendeth to her, nor are there for that two loves, two love-tokens, two Bridegromes. For say that the love-tokens are true, not counterfeit, and that they carry with them the warme and lovely characters, and undenyable expressions of

the true Bridegromes soule-love, and that they came not from a stranger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Antinomians</hi> say, they may be bastard and fained love-tokens, and come from another lover then Christ; Yet the Lord Jesus manifesteth himselfe, and gives evidences of his love by them, no lesse then by the Spirits immediate testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>But we thinke, and can prove the Saints passing, even in their speaches, prayers, and confession to God, their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themselves, and of their owne sincere walking, as is cleare, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3, 1, 2, 3. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5, 8. <hi>Isai.</hi> 26.8, 9. <hi>Job</hi> 23.11, 12. <hi>chap.</hi> 31.1, 2 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.

The inference (say they) breeds no certaine and infallible assurance, but probable onely, and conjecturall evidence. (4) If these works were not done in faith, and known by us to be so done; I should grant they could give but an uncertaine and controverted evidence; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> say, wee separate them from faith and saving grace, and that thus separated, they beare testimony, that wee are in Christ, which is a calumny of theirs, not our Doctrine.</p>

But the promise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Christ, the free grace of God to us, are the onely pillars of our faith, and our works of grace are the ropes by which the ship and passengers are drawne to the <hi>rock that is

higher then themselves,</hi> but they are not the rocke; they are not the formall objective Sunne-light, by which we passe our judgement and determination of Christ the Mediator, his sweetnesse and power to save, nor the causes of the soules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting on the bloud of attonement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Sunne-light is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall reason and <hi>medium</hi> without, of our judging of colours and their beauty. They are onely land-marks, by which we may the better judge of our state, and not the shoare; the land-marke onely sheweth how neere wee are to shoare; by them we know, that we know and beleeve in Christ. Finally, they are rather negatives against unbeliefe, then positive eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of faith, and serve for incouragements that we cast not away our confidence. For if I doubt of my state, whether I be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, and in Christ, or no, I cannot but doubt of my actions, if I doubt if the tree be a naturall Olive, I cannot but thinke the fruit must be but wild Olives; and when we shall be unclothed with our darkenesse of body, we shall not need such crutches to walke by Faith, for sight shall leade us.</p>

There is no condemnation to a soule once in Christ, and justified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. then there can be no re-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, or second receiving of a soule into the state of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified person, from the state of an ungodly man, as if he had fallen from the former state, and there can bee no second deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from eternall wrath, to be inflicted for a new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted sinne.</p>
               <p>Yet doe I not see that one and the same justification nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, because it is never retracted, is therefore a successive and graduall worke that groweth more and more, as sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth; for so predestination to glory, which is negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one and the same should bee a graduall growing worke; for as no shaddow of change can fall on God, so neither can Predestination be retracted.</p>
               <p>Yet is there no cause to deny that sinnes are dayly pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and remitted as they are committed; for God is said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinnes dayly, when he reneweth the sense of the once pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed act of attonement, and applyeth what he once did to the feeling and comfort of the beleever, for we never taught that Faith is a cause, or so much as an instrument or condition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Christ doth not on the Crosse, by the power of his
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62327:249"/>
bloud take away sinnes, now he that denyeth that God by his Spirit reneweth the lively apprehension of this act of attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, must deny that a beleever can oftner then once lay the weight of his soule, in a filiall recumbencie on God, and with adherence to Christ crucified for pardon of sinne; which were to abolish the dayly exercise of our faith on Christ crucified. 2. God forgiveth sinnes, when he removeth the temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and fatherly rod inflicted for sinne.

               <head>CHAP. LX. How sinnes are remitted before they bee committed, how not, and the <hi>Antinomian</hi> error in this point.</head>
               <p>BUt then it may bee said, doe <hi>Antinomians</hi> soundly affirme that sins are remitted before they be committed? To which I answer, taking remission in a good sense, not in theirs; its true, a beleever when he is justified, is freed from condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for these sinnes that are not yet committed: that is, he is put in such a condition, as he shall never come to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yea, not for these sinnes hee shall hereafter commit: as when a forfeited Father is relaxed from treason, and his lands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, the Pardon extendeth to the heire in the mothers womb, and not yet borne, yea, possibly not begotten; but this is neither a justifying of the unborne heire, nor a pardoning of the treason, nor a relaxing of the punishment, in a strict and right downe sense; he that is not, and is not capable of guiltinesse and treason, such as is a child, neither begotten, nor borne, is not capable of pardon. But in the <hi>Antinomian</hi> sense, we judge it abominable, that sinnes are removed, before they bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. 1. Because <hi>Antinomian</hi> remission is the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the being of sinne, and the extirpation of his nature, root, and branch: for so it cannot be sinne, nor can it be against the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62327:250"/>
Law of God, nothing is capable of the grace of free pardon, neither the sinne, or the poore sinner; but by the <hi>Antinomian</hi> way, the Adulteries, and Murthers of the beleevers, when committed, are neither against Law, nor the Commandement of God, for they are freed from all commanding and obliging power, of either Law or Gospel; so as they cannot sinne or offend God, in contravening of either. 2. It is against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, that the being or nature of Adultery, can bee remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and made nothing, and yet when it is committed, it should offend humane society, and raise an evill report on the name of God and the Gospel. For that which is meere nothing, and hath neither being, nor nature, can neither offend God nor man. But neither Law of God, nor Gospel, doth forbid the Murthers of a beleever, but onely of an unbeleever, by the <hi>Antinomian</hi> way. 3. Their remission of sinne, before the commission thereof, chargeth confession of committed sinnes with sinnefull lying, craving of pardon with unbeliefe, fearing of sinne with distrust; sorrow for, or feeling of sinne with a worke of Legall bondage, and of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> as <hi>Libertines</hi> did, because these committed sinnes are meere fancies against no Law of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Nothing is concluded against justification by faith; but it presumeth a beleever the humblest <hi>nothing</hi>; that is, to be so proud
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62327:251"/>
that he cannot looke out to Christ for salvation, physick, and to be washen, he is so filthy, sicke, wounded, and polluted: a beleever thinketh not himselfe too good, and too holy a sinner to be washt and made faire; like some, in whom pride and want contest; begge they must for extreame necessitie, and begge they cannot, for extreame hautinesse, because they beg not in Silks and Purple.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Argument presupposeth a faith of the sinners owne creating, which is a bastard, and cannot owne, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ, and a condition of the same nature. In <hi>Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ungodly,</hi> Christ both works the condition, and that which is called the hire (though indeed no money, no price, is Faiths money and price) and giveth both; as in effectuall calling, Christ is both without doores knocking, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.20. and within doores opening, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.19. yet he never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in, but upon condition we open, and the condition is his owne worke; he commeth in to no soule in a miracle, when the doores are shut, for by his grace he removeth the <hi>handles of the barre</hi>; so in justification, hee both offereth imputed righteousnesse, so the sinner beleeve, and he works beliefe, and bringeth of his owne, when he comes to sup with us; for repentance we give it not the roome of Faith, as <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> doe.</p>

not damned, and he that beleeveth is not saved, which is down right against the Gospel.</p>

               <p>Object. 8. <hi>Should sinners refuse to receive bloud freely, and of grace holden forth, because their vessels are not cleane enough for it, when it is such a bloud as makes the vessels clean for it selfe?</hi>

In all his dealing with God (saith hee) and so before ever he come to Christ, or at his first beleeving, he beleeveth his sonne-ship, that is, being a hogge, or a limbe of the devill, he beleeves himselfe to be an heire of heaven: we say, he first puts on the relation that he lived in, so in the womb, to wit, <hi>of the sonne of the Devil, an heire of wrath.</hi> 2. <hi>Hee beleeves his sinnes as debts payed and cancelled,</hi> (saith he) What? ere ever he come to Christ in the Spirit of adoption, hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth remission, that is, hee putteth on the wedding garment first, and then commeth to Christ, who onely must give him fine lyning, the righteousnesse of the Saints.

His words are cleare in the first place, (saith he) <hi>He beleeves Sonne-ship, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled debts, — and now he comes, — and calles God Father, and here begins all faith.</hi> — What? when hee considered himselfe as a Sonne, and all his debts cancelled, had he no faith? <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> is affraid, if the sinner stand a farre off, and looke to God with a rope about his necke, that he bee hanged and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed eternally.</p>

               <p n="2">2. How will <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> prove God was not <hi>Adams</hi> God, till he should worke out his dayes worke of Legall service per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and winne his wages, without a slip or sinne?

God commandeth as a Law-giver in the Gospel, all that eternall righteousnesse which hee commandeth in the Law; for neither the Gospel, nor Christ dissolveth one tittle or jot of the eternall Morall Law of God, but hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, not as a condemning Judge, the curse is removed from the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Not the Law it selfe, nor the authority, majestie, nor spirituall holynesse of the Law, or Lawgiver; and so God both commandeth in the Gospel, as a God, and Law-giver, even <hi>as our God a consuming fire</hi> to such as are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace, and as a Father to his owne in Christ.</p>
               <p>Diff. 3. <hi>The Law</hi> (saith <note place="margin">Saltmarsh <hi>ibid</hi> 148.</note> hee) <hi>commandeth, by promises and threatnings, blessings and cursings, the Gospel rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth then commandeth, and rather by promises; and exhorts rather then bids, and reasons us to duty, rather then inforceth, and rather drawes us, then drives us, and setting forth promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and priviledges, and prerogatives, done on Gods part, and Christs part for us, rather argues us to doing, and working, and loving reflections againe, and Christ is chiefly proposed to us for holinesse, obedience, mortification, newnesse of life.

But (I pray) why doth not <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> speake accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, in setting downe the differences between the Law, and Gospel (For they are the very hinges of the controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Antinomians</hi> and us:) he speaketh doubtfully, neither denying nor affirming, but the Gospel commandeth, onely he saith, <hi>it rather perswades and argues, then commands.</hi> If hee meane, it commandeth not the same way that the Law doth,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62327:257"/>
that is, that we give personall perfect obedience, of our own purse and stocke, without the grace of a Mediator, under pain of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting burning, then he should not have said, it <hi>rather perswades, nor commands,</hi> which is as much, as it commands, but swaies more to the perswading hand, but thus it commands not at all any in Christ, it speaks its commands, and issueth forth royall mandats, as a King to his owne Subjects, that is, to these onely that are under the Law, not to these under Gospel-grace.</p>

Because the Law-giver, in the Gospel, gives up all his authority as Law-giver, to command beleevers, as well as he resigneth his Law-giving Authority to curse and condemne beleevers: for the same way that God by no Law can condemne and curse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Christ was condemned, and made a curse for them; so neither can the Lord command by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a Law-giver, any duty in the ten Commandements to a beleever, as a beleever.

So 1. as an arbitrary command is not properly a command, but rather a will-counsell and free advise, that one friend giveth to another; so that the friend refusing the counsell, sinneth against no Law; just so is it here. <hi>Antinomians</hi> may say, <hi>Beleevers sinning against Gospel-hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, (for commands of God they are not) sinne against the love, and deepest, and broadest grace of God, which is a higher offence, then to sinne against a Law of God, and so its not arbitrary to them to obey.</hi> I answer. 1. Sinne is no sin, if it be not now under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> a transgression of the Morall Law; but wee are no more under the Law, say <hi>Saltmarsh, Crisp, Towne,</hi> and <hi>Denne,</hi> then an <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> can fail against the Lawes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>where there is no Law</hi>; to the same purpose, saith <note n="e" place="margin">

If offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against the love of Christ be a greater sinne then offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding against the Law, then it is a sinne; but this is false, for sure if it were a sinne in them, God who seeth all, should see it to be a sinne in them; now this God cannot doe, <hi>for there is no more sinne in a beleever,</hi> (say <note n="f" place="margin">

                  </note> as that Christ should first woe and sue us to a condition, in which by some preparing grace, we might earne, and as hirelings, worke our selves into a meriting condition, and make our selves first Gods people, and first chuse Christ, and provoke free grace; so as, in all reason, and congruitie, God must, if he be rationall, joyne in league, and article himselfe to be our God. Why? We have first arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled our selves, by the condition of honest hirelings, to be his people.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is as much as Christ will never covenant, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be our husband, while we first make our selves, by some

preparing grace, his married Spouse. For sure this is a Marriage-covenant; we must first make our selves his people, and then, for shame, he must be our God: as if Marriage-love bred first in our breast, and stood upon this poore legge, the grace of man to God, not the grace of God to lost man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We teach that faith in Christ is both a condition of grace on our part, but not Antecedent and preparatory to the Covenant, and also a grace promised, when the new heart is articled to us; so that Christ bringeth into the covenant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, his righteousnesse, his free grace, and the condition of Faith that receives him; just as if the heire of a King should offer to marry a Maid of low birth, upon condition she weare about her necke on the Marriage day, a gold chaine, having in it a rich Diamond of the Crowne, and withall should oblige himselfe, under his hand and seale, in the Marriage-contract, both to bestow this chaine on her freely, and to infuse a Spirit of grace and love, to close in her heart with such a lover, and to yeeld consent to the match, and to adorne her selfe with this chaine. Just so doth the Prince of life here, and its a vaine thing to parallel this covenant of grace with other cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor did ever any man before <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> dreame, that Law-obedience was an Antecedent condition of the Covenant of works, with <hi>Adam,</hi>

But <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> (if I mistake not) hath a third meaning, that meere commands from the authority of God, the Law-giver, can worke but a Legall and counterfeit conversion; this is most false. We have a grave controversie with <hi>Papists,</hi> touching the formall object of Divine Faith. Whether it bee the testimony of the Church, as Papists say, or the authority of God speaking in his Word, as we teach. Now we hold that the testimony of the Church, is but the testimony of men, and can produce but an humane faith, not a Divine; but the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of God himselfe, speaking in the Scriptures, can onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a supernaturall and divine faith, when the Holy Ghost fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the Word, and rendereth it lively. If then we beleeve divine truths, and Scripturall commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because <hi>so saith the Lord,</hi> in his Word, either Law or Gospel, this is a divine and supernaturall faith; so to beleeve upon Gods meere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as Law-giver, not because naturall reason so dictateth, nor because the Church, or man so saith, nor because the times favour the Gospel, (as the seed is received with a sort of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that falleth on stony ground) is divine Faith, and is not contrary, but sweetly complyeth with faith grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the love of Christ, and wrought by the grace of God in the Gospel; <hi>Antinomians</hi> dreame that these two are contrary, when they are not so.</p>

                  </note> eschewed. Now naturall Legall converts, cannot goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all for salvation, and in reference to it, its cleare, when gold is a mans end, as in the covetous; pleasure the end in the voluptuous, honour the end in the ambitious; if all acts about the meanes, or that may thwart the attaining of the end, bow not to this end; its not so in Legall converts. 3. When the end is attained but in hope and assurance, the minde is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and quieted, Legall converts are not so satisfied. 4. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall converts order salvation to and for themselves, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of it, not the holinesse, to please themselves, not to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, because heaven is a Honey-combe, that very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beleeving an eternity, desires to sucke. 5. <hi>Severe and strict walking,</hi> in our sense, is walking in all duties, by the light and conduct of saving grace, and the faith of the elect of God, which wee contend for against most <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who are but loose livers, and cannot fall on a Legall convert.</p>

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62327:265"/>2. Nor can yee say, by the same reason, that a naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, a desire of a name, lest they should be reputed covenant-breakers, moved these in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> to act, for so none could have been tearmed, <hi>men according to Gods heart,</hi> nor <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and upright men,</hi> as <hi>David Job, Ezechiah, Noah,</hi> because upon this <hi>Antinomian</hi> ground, they were all but fine hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
               <p>If I mistake not, <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> condemneth all who have taken the Covenant in the three Kingdomes; and are moved for feare of the oath of God, to stand to it, as <hi>Legalists, and Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament Spirits:</hi> The Covenant that <hi>Asa, Josiah,</hi> caused the people to stand too, was a Law-bondage, that we are not now obliged to; and upon the same grounds to keepe faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise upon lawfull contracts and oathes between King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or made to God to keepe Marriage-covenants, contracts, legues, and bargaines betweene man and man, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be of the Law of Nature; must all be the proper service of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and contrary to the Gospel: to keepe my lawfull promise made to a man, to pay my debt, because I promised, when I borrowed money. To keepe the Covenant of God made in Marriage, because it is an outward covenant, is to doe <hi>because of some Covenant</hi>; and to be in Law-bondage, and to doe, as being under the power of outward principles; and <hi>Paul</hi> must writ to <hi>Philemon,</hi> as under the bondage of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>

                  </note> to thinke our sinnes are too many for Christ to pardon, and we too foule for Christ, out of free grace to wash is indeed a Spirit of bondage: but that is not the <hi>Antinomians</hi> sense.

Then nothing falleth under a Gospel-commandement, but beleeving; now I would hold <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> at this, that nothing is a commandement, or a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded dutie but that which if we contravene, it maketh us guilty of sin before God, and in his Court, if he would actually enter in judgement with us: so then the Gospel as the Gospel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth not brotherly love, meeknesse, patience, temperance, and forbideth not rebellion to Rulers; murther the hating of our brother, adulterie, robbing, stealing, lying, idolatrie, swearing; so as these should be acts of obedience, or of sinfull disobedience to God; but as acts arbitrary, and of meer cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and simply free to beleevers, and to be done or omited, onely as the immediate rapture of the Spirit, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement obliging to obedience rewardable, or to sinne punishable by Law doth act and draw them, for the Law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none of these to a beleever who is under no Law; if I mistake, I crave pardon, for I cannot make sense of their commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but in this sense: one thing I complaine of <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> by any sect; They seeme to mee confused, and obscure, and to dissemble; because they have not yet set downe in right

                  </note> that which I perswade my self is their minde; that the beleever cannot sin, his adulterie, and his murther is no adulterie, no murther: except they difference between these two. <hi>The beleever is free of all sinne as Christ himselfe,</hi> and <hi>the beleever doth and can truly sinne, lie, murther, deceive, &amp;c.</hi> And between these, sin is wholy removed out of the beleever, no sinne <hi>dwelleth in him,</hi> and the <hi>beleever daily sinneth</hi>; nor are they plaine whether the Gospel command chastitie, and forbid adultery, and command the loving of our brother, and forbid murthering, and hating of our brother; as acts arbitrary, and meerly free: or whether no Law command, or forbid, such things to beleevers; nor any Gospel at all, so as to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene them were sin. Yea, nor so is beleeving the onely worke commanded in the Gospel; for by their way, faith is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as a cause, or merit of righteousnesse and life, which we also thinke, nor as a condition, or necessarie duty at all, more then other duties: For the Elects sinnes were all removed, either from eternity, or their first conception, or Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering on the crosse (<hi>Antinomians</hi> fall out among themselves touching this poynt) so their unbeliefe, and finall impenitency cannot be sinnes.</p>
               <p>Nor can Christ as God, or Law-giver, command beleeving, for the notion of Law, or Law-giving under penalty of sinne, and curses, is contrarie to Christs <hi>Gospel-love</hi>; so Christ must renounce his office of Law-giving, and his authoritie, as God to command faith and forbid unbeliefe; and must onely as <hi>Mediator</hi> put on love and counsell; and advise us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: as one friend doth another, so as wee have no command obliging us (except wee would sin) to beleeve, for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of love, being contra-devided from a command of Law, to <hi>Antinomians</hi> obligeth neither to sinne nor to wrath, if it be disobeyed.</p>

                  </note> that as many as are sinners, are sinners spiritually stung, and sinne-sick, and sinners in their owne sense and feeling, as sinners in the Texts alledged, are opposed to these that neede not the Physitian, and to the righteous, who sure are not the sinners, and the sicke that the Physitian Christ came to cure, and to call to repentance. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> cannot cull out a Text in all the Scripture, so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to his tenent as these, for the Title of his Chapter, or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which is L I. is this. <hi>Jesus Christ offered to sinners, as sinners,</hi> that is, to all sinners, and to men, because they are sinners, under the reduplication of sinners, then the Text must beare. <hi>Christ came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance,</hi> that is, in the <hi>Antinomian</hi> glosse, <hi>Christ came not to call sinners, but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Repentance,</hi> for sure the Righteous, that is, the selfe-righteous and proud Pharisees, who thought themselves no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but righteous, and whole; were sinners, and obstinate, and proud, and malicious sinners, and truely needed the Physitian no lesse then Publicans; but in their owne apprehension and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling conceit, they were neither sinners, nor sicke, nor unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.

This then is no Gospel-way,

                  <hi>in the eyes of men, by good works, in sanctification, in which we are agents, and glorifie God by the Spirit, by which wee are partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>and it is done in a grosser manner, by declaring God glorified before men by our good works,</hi> Math. 5. <hi>and greatly inclineth to the glorifying of man; by this Abraham hath to glory and rejoyce in holy works, but not before God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. We are not meere passive in beleeving, for then should we not be commended for beleeving, nor should wee know, rely, and trust in an all-sufficient Saviour, in beleeving on him, though there be a passion in beleeving. 2. These ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Sanctification abase all holy walking and works of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, calling holy walking; 1. glorifying of <hi>God out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and before men, in a fleshly manner.</hi> Whereas God see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and acknowledgeth it in his owne sight, sincere, unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, perfect in its kind, with perfection of parts, not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; they would have all Sanctification finer hypocrisie. <hi>I know thy works</hi> (saith <note n="b" place="margin">Revel. 2.9.</note>

Abraham, walke before mee, and bee thou perfect, saith the Lord.</hi> How many of the good Kings <hi>did right in the sight of the Lord?</hi> Its true; our best works are polluted with sinne, and in the matter of justification cannot endure the strict Law-censure of the Judge of the world, <hi>if God narrowly</hi>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62327:274"/>
odds with holy walking, that they will have all the sincere works of the Saints wrought by the grace of God, to bee in their substance before God, plaistered hypocrisie: and yet in the justified, these hypocriticall works are no sinne, there being no more sinne in the justified, nor any thing contrary to a Law, which the Lord can see as a sinne more then in Jesus Christ. So here is holy, sanctified, and lawfull sinne, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent hypocrisie, and holy, and harmlesse corruption and flesh. 3. A declarative glorifying of God in the eyes of men, not of God, must argue the beleever to be lawlesse, and a <hi>Libertine</hi> before men, and that he needeth not before men, and in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with wife, brother, children, neighbours in his words, promises, covenants, buying, selling, works of his calling, doe all as in the sight and presence of God, for if he walke right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously in his conversation with men, hee is behinde Gods backe, the Lord seeth him not; if he walke unjustly, in forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, uncleannesse, cousening, lying, God seeth not these to be sins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why doe <hi>Antinomians</hi> exclude from works of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the worke of beleeving? Are we not to doe all good works in faith, as well as for the glory of God? and are we not to eat and drinke in faith? <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 22.23. are they not bastard works, that come not from such a root as faith? As the fruit is ill, if the tree be ill; and so we must glorifie God <hi>primarily, immediatly,</hi> in the sight of God, passively, in this declarative, and active, and secondary glorifying of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Antinomians</hi> exclude a third sort of glorifying God, to wit, in private, when neither God seeth them, nor men, but they are done in a secret closet; as praying, praysing, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and soliloquies of the soule with God, almes given in private, that men see not, nor doe the poore know of it; this is neither passive, nor active glorifying of God, and so the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision is lame, except <hi>Antinomians</hi> will have us comming with our secret prayers and almes to the streets, and cause a trumpet to be blowne, as <hi>Pharisees</hi> doe?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The gloryfying of God by men that see our good works incline of it self to no glorifying of man, more then <hi>Abrahams</hi> giving glory to God, but onely as we either trust to our good works, or vainely conceit we are justified by our good works, and then being abused, they incline to glorifie men, and make us
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62327:274"/>
vainely rejoyce and boast in them before God. So if <hi>Abraham</hi> should thinke his act of beleeving, were his onely righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before God, his beleeving in God should be as fleshly a glorifying of man, as any his works of Sanctification.</p>

But take Sanctification for holy walking in the strength of the grace of justification, and grace inherent in us; so we say, Justification and Sanctification ought not to bee separated, but both concurre to make us Saints; the one as the cause, the other as the unseparable effect.

                  <hi>M. Towne</hi> hath much of this stuffe, through his whole Booke.</p>
               <p>Much like to this is the doctrine of <hi>Henry Nicholas</hi> in his Epistle to two Daughters of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> Ar. 7. <hi>While the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles dayly went about with Christ, and had the word of the Father dayly amongst them, understood not the Spirit of the the Lord,</hi> (till the day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> that hee descended on them) <hi>how should then the multitude of these (which now say, they are Christians, and yet neither have, nor know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit nor Word, but go on with their fleshly prudencie in the Literall Scripture, and set forth the same with their fleshly hearts, before the simple people, as it seemeth best unto them, and say even so very stoutly, We have the word of the Lord, whereas it is but their owne word, wherein they, with their own prudencie are genered and begotten) feele, either perceive the same? — They reject the word of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 8. <hi>Here giveth the Prophet a distinction or diversitie betweene the word
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:62327:279"/>
of the Lord, and the witnessing of an unregenerate man, which he bringeth forth out of the Letter of the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>H. Nicholas</hi> maketh a time when the <hi>Apostles</hi> were under the teaching of the Father, when they were unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not pardoned, but led with the Letter of the Scripture, and a time when they were under the teaching of the Holy Ghost, and were regenerated. So the <hi>New England Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,</hi> Rise, raigne, Er. 41. say, <hi>There be distinct seasons of the working of the severall persons, so the soule may bee said to bee under the Fathers, and not the Sonnes, and so long under the Sonnes worke, and not the Spirits.</hi> And just so <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsh</hi> Free grace, pag. 113. <hi>The Fathers before Christ, might conceive themselves rather not destroyed, then saved, and rather not damned, then redeemed, — but now is fulnesse of the Spirit, and of free grace,</hi> (pag. 115.) <hi>discovered,</hi> And <hi>Denne,</hi> Doctrine of <hi>John Baptist,</hi> p. 51. <hi>The knowledge of both actuall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall remission, was no Article of the Jewish Creed; but now</hi> (55.) <hi>is remission past and done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Here <hi>H. Nicholas</hi> makes a difference <hi>betweene the word of God as it is in the Letter,</hi> and the word as it is in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as betweene the word of man; to wit, <hi>which is in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the word of the Lord, <hi>which is in the Spirit.</hi> So doth <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> betweene the interpreting of the <hi>Word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">H. Nicholas <hi>maketh two words of God, one false, and in the letter, another true, and in the Spirit.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>in the Letter, and in the consequence,</hi> which darkneth the Gospel, and the yeelding of the sense of the Scripture, in the Spirit, which must, by opposition, <hi>cleare the glory of the Gospel,</hi> Shaddowes fleeing away, pag. 8. So doth <hi>Cornwell, Confer. with J. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> pag. 17. say, <hi>A conclusion following from the strength of humane reasoning, is but a humane, not a Divine Faith</hi>; now we judge the litterall sense of the word to be the very meaning and kindly sense of the Holy Ghost, and doe hold that the word hath not two sundry senses, and that the letter of the Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are not contrary, but subordinate; though the one, that is, the letter of the word may be without the Spirit, and then the Letter is a dead thing, to the heardned hearer, not in it selfe; but yet should not the Letter of the Scripture, and outward ordinances, or prophecying, be despised more then the Spirit should be quenched.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>N. Nicholas</hi> here maketh two sort of regenerated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Some regenerated by the Letter of the word, these have
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:62327:279"/>
but their owne word, not the word of the Lord; others are regenerated by the Spirit, and these have the word of God. So the <hi>New England Familists, Er.</hi> 13. and <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> Free grace 177.178. as if one Spirit breathed in all the three, tell us <hi>of a legall conversion by the outward Commandement, Letter, and terrors of the Law and Gospel, and such are but hypocrits, and others converted by the Spirit</hi>; Protestants halfe, not the Spirit, and the word, but conjoyne them; for the Spirit is the Father, and principall cause of the second birth, and the Word the seed and instrument; but their way is to abolish Word, Seales, and all Ordinances, as Legall things.</p>
               <p>It is true, this wretched man seems to give enough to outward ordinances, for he saith, Epist. to the two Maides, <hi>They be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means set forth by God, to direct people to the inward righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous life of Christ in the Spirit.</hi> Yet in the Epistle,<note place="margin">H.

For (saith <hi>H. Nicholas) No man doth rightly, according to the truth of the holy Scriptures, nor according to the spirituall understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the godly wisdome deale in it, or use the true God-services of the holy word (it becommeth not likewise that any man should take in hand to busie himselfe thereabout) but only the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elders in the godly wisdome which walk in the house of love.</hi> And in the Epistle, <hi>Let no man</hi> (saith he) <hi>boast himselfe in any of the works of righteousnesse, or take on the same to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither to condemnation, before that hee in the Spirit of Christ, through the love of the Father, be renewed in all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of life, not that I meane in the Elementish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall righteousnesse, which the man setteth forth or occupieth out of his owne prudency, but I meane in that righteousnesse which according to the heavenly truth is in the being of Christ, and is set forth through the Spirit of God.</hi> So this abominable wretch maketh all reading, or hearing, or beleeving the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be Elementish, carnall righteousnesse, and that wee are to doe no good works to obtaine salvation, nor to eschew any evill to be freed from condemnation, but to study an inward righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, <hi>in being Goded and Christed, and in communicating with the essence and godly being.</hi>

                  <hi>M. Towne</hi> also maketh the Law a sort of directorie of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as doth <hi>H. N.

And <hi>Saltmarsh will have us not to borrow one beame of directing light from the Law,</hi> so as he seemeth to stomach, and to bee angry, that the old Testament, but especially the ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, are printed in the Bible. Yet what ever direction of walking wee have from the Law, I find them in all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, grudging at any Law or Gospel written, because wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, speaking, vocall covenants, are the dead and killing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fruitlesse, and livelesse, and that the Spirit immediatly act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is all our rule.</p>

Then by this Argument, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is tyed to nothing, as an obliging rule, either of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or holy walking, but to that which doth effectually quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and sanctifie; so neither Commandement of Law nor Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel without the Spirit, is the beleevers rule, but onely the Spirit, and the Spirit effectually quickening, and actually sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, then the Spirit must onely be our rule, and we must one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be obliged to be ruled, and to lye under the actings of the Spirit as dead creatures. When then we neither beleeve nor repent, nor abstaine from whooring, robbing, lying, because the Spirit acteth not, we sinne not, for sinne is against some obligation; <hi>Antinomians</hi> will not say, we are obliged by any Law, old or new, to have the actuall breathings of the Holy Ghost, when we omit good, and commit evill, then the holy Spirit must immediatly, and onely act good in us, and his non-acting immediatly, must be the only cause of beleevers murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, whooring, lying; and is there not then a Spirit in all under the Gospel, working in them all good, and by no working, causing all the sinnes they commit?

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Major is doubtsome, and the Assumption false. 1. For civill Reformation as civill, is not spirituall formally, but onely materially and objectively spirituall. But to say, that Ecclesiasticall Reformation should be spirituall, as spirituall is opposed to externall and outward, and onely spirituall, and in the heart; Satan could not fancie a more wicked untruth to destroy all godlynesse and holynesse, as it appeares in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, in the duties of the first and second Table, for Gospel-reformation, as touching Gods part, is inward, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, invisible, done by him that is Lord of soule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but this is but the halfe, though the choisest halfe of Reformation; but as touching mans part, it is externall, and also spirituall, and done by the Preaching of the Word, and discipline of the Church. For sure the Apostles and Elders, <hi>Acts chap.</hi> 15. Reformed the Churches of <hi>Antioch, Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, Syria, and Silicia,</hi> and that spiritually, and externally (for these are not contrary) when they send to them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, not to bee circumcised, <hi>nor to keepe the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Law</hi>; but <hi>to abstaine from bloud and things strangled,</hi> as at that time scandalous, and <hi>from fornication,</hi> as a sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Morall Law, because they that held the contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, were, <hi>lying Teachers, and perverted soules</hi>; and so deformed with a spirituall deformity, the Churches of God, as <hi>Del</hi> and Familists now doe.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Now the Assumption, <hi>That Ecclesiasticall reformation is carnall as done by men, and not spirituall,</hi> is most false, for carnall it may bee in some part, and in some

sense, that is, standing in outward, externall Commandements, and yet spirituall, given by the Law-giver, an infinite Spirit, tying and obliging the Spirits of men, and leading to a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all end; so the Ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> are carnall, not sinnefull, not unlawfull, vicious, fleshly, as <hi>Del, pag.</hi> 2.3.4. foulely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the sense and meaning of his owne Text he preached on, expoundeth it, in opposition to <hi>Gospel-reformation,</hi> which is spirituall, lawfull, not fleshly and sinnefull. For then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Ceremoniall Law had been sinnefull and unlawfull to the Jewes, and God must have given Commandements to the Jewes, which were sinnefull and unlawfull judgements, and statutes, and ordinances,<note place="margin">

                  </note> which is the blaphemy of old <hi>Manicheans</hi>; So the Reformation done by the Gospel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and by lawfull Assemblies holding forth the truth, and condemning contrary errors, is carnall, that is, externall, and wrought <hi>by flesh and bloud: Del</hi> meaneth, by the word car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, the corruption of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>bloud,</hi> as the phrase is taken, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.17. which is a manifest untruth; it is wrought by men consisting of flesh and bloud in a carnall, that is, in an externall, outward, audible, and visible manner, and yet spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; also it is in that very externall Reformation, is according to the Word of God, who is a Spirit. 2. It layes an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the consciences, and spirits of men, both actively to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, in that outward way (though God must make it effectuall by an inward reformation) it leadeth men, even as it is exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, to a spirituall end, obedience to God in Christ, according to the rule of the Gospell. The Church and men take not on them to reforme hearts, but instrumentally, by going about an outward reformation, by Planting, Sowing, Watering, and labouring the Lords husbandrie, his Church.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Del</hi> citeth <hi>Esai</hi> 61.1. to prove that the Word is the onely meanes of conversion. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, —he hath annointed me to Preach good tydings to the poore.</hi> If <hi>Del</hi> meane that this Spirit and anointing on Christ, is the Word of God, Christ should say, <hi>The Scripture of God is upon me, and he hath anointed mee to Preach, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>God hath Scriptured me, and gifted me with the knowledge of the written Gospel, excluding all Law or dueties, to preach the Gospel to the poore.</hi> Now <hi>Del</hi> cannot for shame, give us so Literall a Christ.

to be the <hi>Word</hi>; which cleareth, that he acknowledgeth no word of Scripture for a meanes of inward reformation. For hee saith, <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. <hi>The Word whereby Christ reformes, is not the Word without us, as the Word of the Law is, but the Word within us, as it is written, the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and this is the word of Faith.</hi> So this is just <hi>David Georgius,</hi> and <hi>Henry Nicholas,</hi> their internall <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thysiasticall word,</hi> that is, the Spirit, excluding all Law and Gospel that are but written, Inkie, and dead Letters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, doth all; the Scripture is nothing. Now the Law, or Word written in the heart, spoken of <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. is the very <hi>new heart and the Spirit, or the heart of flesh.</hi> Ezech. 36.26, 27. <hi>the circumcised heart,</hi> Deut. 30.6. <hi>the new creature, the Lord Jesus formed in the heart by Faith,</hi> Gal. 4.19.

Now except <hi>Del</hi> would say, Christ onely worketh inward reformation by inward reformation onely, (for this <hi>inward word</hi> is inward reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) he cannot make sense of this inward word, excluding the Law and outward Word both of Law and Gospel, as he doth.

the sinner from sinnes condemnation, in justification fully, and in sanctification by degrees, not fully, while we be perfected in glory. Christ can well dwell in the heart by faith, where sinne dwelleth as an underling, but not where it dwelleth as a King and Tyrant in its full dominion, which dominion is not removed formally by justification, (though the state of justification, and the full dominion of sinne, cannot stand together in the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) but properly, and formally, by sanctification.

               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Antinomian</hi> dead faith is against confession of sin, because we must know, and beleeve, we have sinne, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it; this was Gods challenge to a heardned people. <note n="p" place="margin">Ier. 2.35.</note>

to come, as well as the past sinnes, are pardoned, and abolished, and so that they are no sinnes before ever they bee committed; what feare then, what holy care, what challenges of conscience can be required to an <hi>Antinomian</hi> lying faith, to eschew and feare these sinnes ere they be committed? For its the act of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sense (say <hi>Antinomians</hi>) to apprehend them as sinnes, then sure they cannot lawfully be apprehended as ills to bee feared and eschewed, if it bee a lying apprehension to thinke that, that is a snare to my feet, which is no snare at all, but a boggle to affright a childe, it must be a lying apprehension to conceive, that a fancied snare to be an evill to bee shunned and declined. If the Whore be no Whore, the <hi>Antinomian</hi> needs not <hi>eschew the going neere her house,</hi> for feare the house fall on him, as <hi>Salomon</hi> intimateth, <hi>Prov. chap.</hi> 5. And surely, the justified <hi>Antinomian</hi> may goe on in Adulteries and blouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he act them, and feed his lusts without feare; for if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive these to be sinnes, it is his lying sense, and deceiving rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for faith is to beleeve the just contrary, that they are no sinnes, and so not to bee eschewed as sinnes; because an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedated pardon doth no lesse abolish their being, and nature before they bee committed, (in which case they are remitted, and so nullities and shaddowes before God) then a pardon doth utterly abolish their being, when they are committed in the <hi>Antinomian way.</hi>
