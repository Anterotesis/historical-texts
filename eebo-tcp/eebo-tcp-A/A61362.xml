         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Compoſer of theſe Statutes,
do Onerate and Charge the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of you the Lord Provoſt, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats,

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37614:28"/>
and that by the Bowels of our Lord
JESUS CHRIST, who one day will
come to Judge the Quick and the
Dead, and take a particular account of
every one of you for this particular
Stewardſhip, wherewith you are truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by the Zeal and Honour of our
Reformed Religion, which by this Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Work of the Founder, is Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and Vindicated from the Calumnies
of the Adverſaries to our Holy Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

his Fellow-Citizens ought to carry to
the Pious Memory, and laſt Will of
of the Religious Founder, your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

For the Clearing of your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and your own particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
in that great Day of the LORD,
let none of you who Read theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
nor your Succeſſors, who in after
Ages ſhal come to Read them, offer to
Fruſtrat the Pious Founder of his Holy
Intention, either by taking directly or
indirectly from this Hoſpital, any thing
which he in his Piety hath Doted unto
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37614:28"/>
it, or by altering of it, or beſtowing
it upon any other uſe, though you ſhal
conceive it to be far more Pious, or
Profitable; Or to go about to alter any
of theſe Statutes and Ordinances, after
they ſhal be once delivered up unto you,
compleatly Subſcribed and Sealed, as
you will anſwer the contrary, at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
of your Perrils, in the Day of
the Lord JESUS, to whom, (being
fully aſſured of your Godly Care, and
Zealous Conſcience in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,)
with His Father, and the Holy
Ghoſt, Three Perſons, but One undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Eſſence of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> as for all
other Their Bleſſings, ſo in particular,
for the great Charity of this moſt Pious
and Religious Founder, be Aſcribed, as
is moſt due, all Praiſe, Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from Age to Age. AMEN.</p>
