            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>REligious Broyles to ſuch a height are grown,</l>
            <l>All the ſweet ſound of Poetry they drown.</l>
            <l>Were <hi>Orpheus</hi> here, his Lute might charm our Beaſts,</l>
            <l>Our Maſtiffs, not our Robble, or our Prieſts.</l>
            <l>Good Heaven! Sirs! are there no other ways</l>
            <l>To damn the Pope, but damning all our Plays?</l>
            <l>To our Religion 'tis no Praiſe at all,</l>
            <l>That, if our Wit muſt ſtand, our Faith muſt fall.</l>
            <l>All parties in a Play-Houſe may agree,</l>
            <l>The Stage is priviledg'd from Piety.</l>
            <l>'Tis pleaſant, Sirs, to ſee you fight and brawl</l>
            <l>About Religion, but have none at all.</l>
            <l>Moſt fiercely for the Road to Heav'n contend,</l>
            <l>But never care to reach the Journeys end.</l>
            <l>Though you loſe Heaven, you will keep the Way,</l>
            <l>The Pope ſha'n't have you, though the Devil may.</l>
            <l>Theſe things ſuch buſineſs for the Criticks find,</l>
            <l>They're not at leaſure Poetry to mind,</l>
            <l>Well for the Poet 'tis they're ſo employ'd;</l>
            <l>Elſe this poor Work of his wou'd be deſtroy'd.</l>
            <l>For by his feeble Skill 'tis built alone,</l>
            <l>The Divine <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> did not lay one Stone.</l>
            <l>Beſides this Tragedy a Rod will prove,</l>
            <l>To whip us for a Fault, we too much Love,</l>
            <l>And have for ages liv'd, call'd Civil Strife.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, like a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Wife,</l>

                  <l>Now I have Royal Virtue, <hi>Edward</hi> none;</l>
                  <l>And therefore I muſt Reign, and he be ruin'd.</l>
                  <l>Oh! my Lord, this is a confounding principle.</l>
                  <l>If Kings may loſe their Rights for want of Virtue,</l>
                  <l>And Subjects are the Judges of that Virtue;</l>
                  <l>Then Kings are Subjects, and all Subjects Kings:</l>
                  <l>And by that Law that Subjects may deſtroy</l>
                  <l>Their Kings for want of Virtue, other Subjects</l>
                  <l>May think thoſe Subjects Rogues, and cut their throats.</l>
                  <l>Thus <hi>Babel</hi> might be builded, but no Kingdom.</l>
