            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>Jack,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THough your diſeaſe be in the number of thoſe that are better cured with time then precept, yet ſince it is lawful for every man to practiſe upon them that are forſaken and given over (which I take to be your ſtate) I will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to preſcribe to you; and of the innocence of the Phyſick you ſhall not need to doubt, ſince I can aſſure you I take it daily my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>To begin Methodically, I ſhould enjoyn you Travel; for Abſence doth in a kind remove the cauſe (removing the object) and anſwers the Phyſitians firſt Recipez, vomiting and purging; but this would be too harſh, and indeed not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35597:34"/>
to my way. I therefore adviſe you to ſee her as often as you can, for (beſides that the rarity of viſits endears them) this may bring you to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe her, and to diſcover little defects, which though they cure not abſolutely, yet they quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the fury of the Feaver: As neer as you can let it be unſeaſonably, when ſhe is in ſicknes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; for that will let you know ſhe is mortal, and a Woman, and the laſt would be enough to a wiſe man: If you could draw her to diſcourſe of things ſhe underſtands not, it would not be amiſſe.</p>
                  <p>Contrive your ſelf often into the Company of the cryed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>up Beauties; for if you read but one book, it will be no wonder if you ſpeak or write that ſtile; variety will breed diſtraction, and that will be a kind of diverting the humour.</p>
                  <p>I would not have you deny your ſelf the little things (for theſe Agues are eaſier cured with Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets than abſtinence) rather (if you can) taſt all: for that (as an old Author ſaith) will let you ſee
<q>
                        <l>That the thing for which we wooe,</l>
                        <l>Is not worth ſo much ado.</l>
                     </q>
But ſince that here would be impoſſible, you muſt be content to take it where you can get it. And this for your comfort I muſt tell you <hi>(Jack)</hi> that Miſtreſſe and Woman differ no otherwiſe then Frontiniack and ordinary Grapes: which though a man loves never ſo well, yet if he ſurfet of the laſt, he will care but little for the firſt.</p>
                  <p>I would have you leave that fooliſh humour
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35597:35"/>
                     <hi>(Jack)</hi> of ſaying you are not in love with her, and pretending you care not for her; for ſmothered fires are dangerous, and malicious humors are beſt and ſafeſt vented and breathed out. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue your affection to your Rival ſtill, that will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you from one way of loving, which is in ſpite; and preſerve your friendſhip with her wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for who knows but ſhe may help you to the remedy.</p>
                  <p>A jolly glaſſe and right Company would much conduce to the cure; for though in the Scripture (by the way it is but <hi>Apocrypha)</hi> Woman is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſtronger than Wine, yet whether it will be ſo or not, when wit is joyned to it, may prove a freſh queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Marrying (as our friend the late Ambaſſador hath wittily obſerved) would certainly cure it; but that is a kind of live Pigeons laid to the ſoals of the feet, a laſt remedy, and (to ſay truth) worſe than the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>(Jack)</hi> I remember I promiſed you a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not a Treaty; I now expect you ſhould be juſt, and as I have ſhewed you how to get out of love, ſo you (according to our bargain) ſhould teach me how to get into it. I know you have but one way, and will preſcribe me now to look upon Miſtris <hi>Howard;</hi> but for that I muſt tell you afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that it is love as in Antipathy; The Capers which will make my Lord of <hi>Dorſet</hi> go from the Table, another man will eat up. And <hi>(Jack)</hi> if you would make a viſit to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> you ſhall find,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35597:35"/>
that there are rarely two there mad for the ſame thing.</p>

                  <p>The loſſe of a Miſtris (which kills men onely in Romances, and is ſtill digeſted with the firſt meat we eat after it) had yet in me raiſed up ſo much paſſion, and ſo juſt a quarrel (as I thought) to Fortune for it, that I could not but tempt her to do me right upon the firſt occaſion: yet <hi>(Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame)</hi> has it not made me ſo deſperate but that I can ſit down a loſer both of that time and money too, when there ſhall be the leaſt fear of loſing you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>And now, ſince I know your Ladyſhip is too wiſe to ſuppoſe to your ſelf impoſſibilities, and therefore cannot think of ſuch a thing, as of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me abſolutely good; it will not be without

ſome impatience that I ſhall attend to know what ſin you will be pleaſed to aſſigne me in the room of this: ſomething that has leſſe danger about it (I conceive it would be) and therefore if you pleaſe <hi>(Madam)</hi> let it not be Women: for to ſay truth, it is a dyet I cannot yet relliſh, otherwiſe then men do that on which they ſurfetted laſt.</p>

                  <p>I Thank Heaven we live in an Age in which the Widdows wear Coulers, and in a Country where the Women that loſe their Husbands may be truſted with poiſon, knives, and all the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coals in <hi>Europe,</hi> notwithſtanding the preſident of <hi>Sophonisba</hi> and <hi>Portia:</hi> Conſidering the eſtate you are in now, I ſhould reaſonably imagine meaner Phyſitians then <hi>Seneca</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter comfort. It is ſo far from me to imagine this accident ſhould ſurprize you, that in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it ſhould not make you wonder; it being not ſtrange at all that a man who hath lived ill all his time in a houſe, ſhould break a Window, or ſteal away in the night through an unuſual Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern: you are now free, and what matter is it to a Priſoner whether the fetters be taken off the ordinary way or not? If inſteed of putting off handſomly the chain of Matrimony, he hath rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke it, 'tis at his owne charge, nor ſhould it coſt you a tear; Nothing <hi>(Madam)</hi> has worſe Mine
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35597:37"/>
than counterfet ſorrow, and you muſt have the height of Womans Art to make yours appear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially when the ſpectators ſhall conſider all the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>The ſword that is placed betwixt a contracted Princeſſe and an Ambaſſador, was as much a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the onely difference was, that that ſword laid in the bed, allowed one to ſupply its place; this Huſband denied all, like a falſe Crow ſet up in a Garden, which keeps others from the fruit it cannot taſte it ſelf: I would not have you ſo much as enquire whether it were with his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or his Cloak-bag ſtrings, nor ingage your ſelf to freſh ſighs by hearing new relations.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniſh Princeſſe <hi>Leonina</hi> (whom <hi>Balzac</hi> delivers the Ornament of the laſt Age) was wiſe; who hearing a Poſt was ſent to tell her her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was dead, and knowing the Secretary was in the way for that purpoſe, ſent to ſtay the Poſt till the arrival of the Secretary, that ſhe might not be obliged to ſhed tears twice. Of ill things the leſſe we know, the better. Curioſity would here be as vain, as if a Cuckold ſhould enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were upon the Couch or a Bed, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cavalier pulld off his Spurrs firſt or not.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe it is a juſt ſubject for our ſorrow to hear of any that does quit his ſtation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave that placed him there; and yet as ill a Mine as this Act has: 't was <hi>a-la-Romanſci,</hi> as you may ſee by a line of Mr. <hi>Shakeſpears,</hi> who bringing in <hi>Titinius</hi> after a loſt battel, ſpeaking to

                  <p>'Tis true, I think Cloak-bag ſtrings were not then ſo much in faſhion; but to thoſe that are not Sword-men, the way is not ſo deſpicable; and for my owne part, I aſſure you Chriſtianity high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governs me in the minute in which I do not wiſh with all my heart that all the diſcontents in his Majeſties three Kingdoms would find out this very way of ſatisfying themſelves and the world.</p>

                  <p>Change I confeſſe (to them that think all at once) muſt needs be ſtrange, and to you hateful, whom firſt your owne nature, and then cuſtome
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35597:38"/>
another nature, have brought to delight in thoſe narrow and uncouth waies we found you in. You muſt therefore conſider that you have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of thoſe neer conjunctions of which death is the onely honourable divorce; and that you have now to pleaſe another as well as your ſelf; who though ſhe be a Woman, and by the patent ſhe hath from nature, hath liberty to do ſimply; yet can ſhe never be ſo ſtrongly bribed againſt her ſelf, as to betray at once all her hopes and ends, and for your ſake reſolve to live miſerably. Examples of ſuch loving folly our times afford but few; and in thoſe there are, you ſhall find the ſtock of Love to have been greater, and their ſtrengths richer to maintain it, than is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yours can be.</p>
                  <p>Woman (beſides the trouble) has ever been thought a Rent-charge, and though through the vain curioſity of man it has often been incloſed, yet has it ſeldom been brought to improve or become profitable; It faring with marryed men for the moſt part, as with thoſe that at great charges wall in grounds and plant, who cheaper might have eaten Mellons elſewhere then in their owne Gardens Cucumbers. The ruines that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, ſickneſſe, or the melancholy you ſhall give her, ſhall bring; muſt all be made up at your coſt: for that thing a huſband is but Tenant for life in what he holds, and is bound to leave the place Tenantable to the next that ſhall take it. To conclude, a young Woman is a Hawk upon
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35597:39"/>
her wings; and if ſhe be handſome, ſhe is the more ſubject to go out at check; Faulkners that can but ſeldom ſpring right game, ſhould ſtill have ſomething about them to take them down with. The Lure to which all ſtoop in this world, is either garniſht with profit or pleaſure, and when you cannot throw her the one, you muſt be content to ſhew out the other. This I ſpeak not out of a deſire to increaſe your fears which are already but too many, but out of a hope that when you know the worſt, you will at once leap into the River, and ſwim through handſomly, and not (weather-beaten with the divers blaſts of irreſolution) ſtand ſhivering upon the brink.</p>
                  <p>Doubts and fears are of all the ſharpeſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and are ſtill turning diſtempers to diſeaſes; through theſe falſe Opticks 'tis, all that you ſee is like evening ſhaddows, diſproportionable to the truth, and ſtrangely longer then the true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Theſe (when a handſome way of living and expence ſutable to your Fortune is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you) makes you in their ſtead ſee want and beggery: thruſting upon your judgement impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities for likelyhoods, which they with eaſe may do (ſince as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) they betray the ſuccors that reaſon offers.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that all here below is but diverſified folly, and that the little things we laugh at Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for, we do but act our ſelves in great; yet is there difference of Lunacy, and of the two, I had much rather be mad with him, that (when he had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35597:39"/>
nothing) thought all the Ships that came into the Haven his; Than with you, who (when you have ſo much comming in) think you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; This fear of loſing all in you, is the ill iſſue of a worſe Parent, deſire of getting in you; So that if you would not be paſſion-rent, you muſt ceaſe to be covetous: Money in your hand is like the Conjurers Divel, which, while you think you have, that has you.</p>
                  <p>The rich Talent that God hath given, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lent you, you have hid up in a napkin, and Man knows no difference betwixt that and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures kept by ill Spirits, but that yours is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to come by. To the guarding of theſe golden Apples, of neceſſity muſt be kept thoſe never ſleeping Dragons, Fear, Jealouſie, Diſtruſt, and the like; ſo that you are come to moralize <hi>AEſop,</hi> and his fables of beaſts are become prophecies of you; for while you have catcht at the ſhadow, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain riches; you have loft the ſubſtance, true content.</p>
                  <p>The deſire I have ye ſhould be yet your ſelf, and that your friends ſhould have occaſion to bleſſe the providence of miſfortune, has made me take the boldnes to give you your own Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; and to ſhew you your ſelf out of your own glaſſe: And though all this tells you but where you are, yet it is ſome part of a cure to have ſearcht the wound. And for this time we muſt be content to do like Travellers, who firſt find out the place, and then the neereſt way.</p>

                  <p>THat you have overcome the danger of the Land and of the Sea, is news moſt welcom to us, and with no leſſe joy receiv'd amongſt us than if the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had the ſecond time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Tilley,</hi> and again paſt the <hi>Meine</hi> and the <hi>Rhine.</hi> Nor do we in this look more upon our ſelves and private intereſts, then on the publike, ſince in your ſafety both were compriſed. And though you had not had about you the affairs and ſecrets of State, yet to have left your own perſon upon the way, had been half to undoe our poor Iland, and the loſſe muſt have been lamented with the tears of a whole Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But you are now beyoud all our fears, and have nothing to take heed on your ſelf, but fair Ladies. A pretty point of ſecurity; and ſuch a one as all <hi>Germany</hi> cannot afford. We here converſe with Northern Beauties, that had never heat enough to kindle a ſpark in any mans breaſt, where hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had been firſt ſo merciful, as to put in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing either fair or good in this part of the world; and I cannot name the thing can

                  <p>TO perſwade one that has newly ſhip-wrackt upon a Coaſt to imbarque ſodainly for the ſame place again, or your Lordſhip to ſeek that content you now enjoy in the innocence of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, among the diſorders and troubles of a Court, were I think a thing the King himſelf (and Majeſty is no ill Orator) would find ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to do. And yet when I conſider that great ſoul of yours, like a Spider, working all inwards, and ſending forth nothing, but like the Cloiſter'd Schoolmens Divinity, threads fine and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: if I thought you would not ſuſpect my being ſerious all this while, for what I ſhould now ſay, I would tell you that I cannot but be as bold with you as your Ague is, and for a little time, whether you will or not entertain you ſcurvily.</p>
                  <p>When I conſider you look (to me) like—I cannot but think it as odd a thing, as if I ſhould ſee <hi>Van Dike</hi> with all his fine colours and Penſills about him, his Frame, and right Light, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in order, and yet his hands tyed behind him: and your Lordſhip muſt excuſe me if upon it I be as bold.</p>
                  <p>The wiſeſt men, and greateſt States have made no ſcruple to make uſe of brave men whom they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35597:51"/>
had laid by with ſome diſgrace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor have thoſe brave men ſo laid by, made ſcruple, or thought it a diſgrace to ſerve again, when they were called to it afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Theſe general motives of the State and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, I will not ſo much as once offer up to your Lordſhips conſideration, though (as 'tis fit) they have ſtill the upper end: yet, like great <hi>Oleoes,</hi> they rather make a ſhew then provoke Appetite. There are two things which I ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to propound to you, as ends; ſince the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the wiſe men of the world have not been aſhamed to make them theirs: and if any has been found to contemn them, it hath been ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuſpected that either they could not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attain to them, or elſe that the readieſt way to attain to them was to contemn them. Theſe two are <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Wealth:</hi> and though you ſtand poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of both of them, yet is the firſt in your hands like a ſword, which, if not through negligence, by miſchance hath taken ruſt, and needs a little clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it would be much handſomer a preſent to poſterity, if you your ſelf in your life time wipe it off.</p>
                  <p>For your <hi>Eſtate</hi> (which it may be had been more had it not been too much) though it is true that it is ſo far from being contemptible, that it is Nobly competent, yet muſt it be content to undergo the ſame fate greater ſtates (Common-wealths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) have been &amp; are ſubject to: which is, when it comes to be divided in it ſelf, not to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35597:51"/>
Both <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Eſtate</hi> are too fair and ſweet <hi>Flowers,</hi> to be without <hi>Prickles,</hi> or to be gathered without ſome ſcratches.</p>
                  <p>And now (my Lord) I know you have nothing to urge but a kind of incapability in your ſelf to the ſervice of this State; when indeed you have made the onely bar you have, by imagining you have one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſſe (though) had <hi>vice</hi> ſo large an Empire in the Court, as heretofore it has had, or were the times ſo dangerous that to the living well there, wiſe <hi>conduct</hi> were more neceſſary then <hi>vertue</hi> it ſelf; Your Lordſhip would have reaſon (with <hi>AEſops</hi> countrey-mouſe) to undervalue all change of condition; ſince a quiet-mediocrity is ſtill to be preferred before a troubled ſuperfluity: but theſe things are now no more: and if at any time they have threatned that Horizon, like great clouds, either they are fallen of themſelves to the ground, or elſe, upon the appearing of the Sunne (ſuch a Prince as ours is) they have vaniſhed, and left behind them clear and fair daies. To deſcend to parts, envie is ſo leſſen'd, that it is almoſt loſt into vertuous emulation, every man truſting the Kings judgement ſo far, that he knows no better meaſure of his own merit, then his reward. The lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle word behind the back, and undoing whiſper, which, like pulling of a ſheat-rope at Sea, ſlackens the ſail, and makes the gallanteſt ſhip ſtand ſtill; that that heretofore made the faulty and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent alike guilty, is a thing, I beleeve, now ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35597:52"/>
forgot; or at leaſt ſo unpractiz'd, that thoſe that are the worſt, have leiſure to grow good, before any will take notice they have been otherwiſe, or at leaſt divulge it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, <hi>Faction</hi> there is, but 'tis as true, that it is as winds are, to clear, and keep places free from corruption; the oppoſitions being as harmleſſe, as that of the meeting-tides under the bridge, whoſe encounter makes it but more eaſie for him that is to paſſe. To be a little pleaſant in my inſtances; The very women have ſuffered reformation, and wear through the whole Court their faces as little diſguiſed now, as an honeſt mans actions ſhould be, and if there be any have ſuffer'd themſelves to be gained by their ſervants, their ignorance of what they granted may well excuſe them from the ſhame of what they did. So that it is more then poſſible to be great and good: and we may ſafely conclude, if there be ſome that are not ſo exact, as much as they fall ſhort of it, juſt ſo much they have gone from the great Original, God; and from the beſt Copies of him on earth, the King and the Queen.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, If thoſe accidents or diſaſters which make men grow leſſe in the world (as ſome ſuch, my Lord, have happened to you) were ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable as death, or, when they were once ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon us, there were no cure for them; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of others would ſatisfie me for yours; but ſince there have been that have delivered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their ills, either by their good <hi>Fortune,</hi>

                  <p>THat it is fit for the King to do ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary at this preſent, is not onely the opinion of the wiſe, but the expectation. Men ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him more now then at other times: for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie in an Eclipſe, like the Sun, draws eyes that would not ſo much as have looked towards it, if it had ſhined out, and appeared like it ſelf. To lie ſtill now, would, at the beſt, ſhew but a calmneſſe of mind, not a magnanimity; ſince in matter of government, to think well (at any time, much leſſe in a very active) is little better then to dream well. Nor muſt he ſtay to act till his people deſire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis thought nothing reliſhes elſe: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath nothing reliſht with them, becauſe the King hath for the moſt part ſtayed till they have deſired; done nothing but what they have or were petitioning for. But, that the King ſhould do, will not be ſo much the queſtion, as what he ſhould do. And certainly, for a King to have right coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel given him, is at all times ſtrange, and at this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35597:53"/>
preſent impoſſible. His party for the moſt part (I would that were modeſtly ſaid, and it were not all) have ſo much to do for their own preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they cannot (without breaking a law in nature) intend anothers. Thoſe that have courage have not perchance innocence, and ſo dare not ſhew themſelves in the Kings buſines; and if they have innocence, they want parts to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſiderable; ſo conſequently the things they undertake. Then, in Court, they give much counſel, as they beleeve the King inclin'd, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his good by his deſires: which is a kind of ſetting the Sun by the Dial, Intereſt which cannot er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, by paſſions which may.</p>
                  <p>In going about to ſhew the King a Cure, now a man ſhould firſt plainly ſhew him the diſeaſe. But to Kings, as to ſome kind of Patients, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies proper to tell how ill they be: and it is too like a Countrey clown not to ſhew the way, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he know from whence, and diſcourſe of things before.</p>
                  <p>Kings may be miſtaken, and Councellors cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; but true intereſt alone (ſaith <hi>Monſieur de Rohan)</hi> cannot erre. It were not amiſſe then to find out the Intereſt: for ſetting down right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples before concluſions, is weighing the ſcales before we deal out the commodity.</p>
                  <p>Certainly the great intereſt of the King is, <hi>A u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his People,</hi> and whoſoever hath told him otherwiſe (as the Scripture ſaith of the divel) <hi>was a ſeducer from the firſt.</hi> If there ever had been any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35597:53"/>
one Prince in the whole world that made a felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this life, and left fair Fame after death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the love of his Subjects, there were ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to deſpiſe it.</p>
                  <p>There was not among all our Princes a greater Courtier of the People then <hi>Richard</hi> the third, not ſo much out of fear, as out of wiſedom. And, ſhall the worſt of our Kings have ſtriven for that? and ſhall not the beſt? (it being an Angelical thing to gain love.)</p>
                  <p>There are 2. things in which the people expect to be ſatisfied; <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Justice:</hi> nor can this be done by any little acts, but by Royal and Kingly reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall think that by dividing the factions (a good rule at other times) he ſhall maſter the reſt now, he will be ſtrangely deceived: for in the beginning of things That would do much, but not when whole Kingdoms are reſolv'd. Of thoſe now that lead theſe parties, if you could take off the major number, the leſſer would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and do the ſame things ſtill: nay, if you could take off all, they would ſet up one, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</p>
                  <p>And of how great conſequence it is for the King to reſume this right, and be the author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, let any body judge: ſince as <hi>Cumneus</hi> ſaid, thoſe that have the art to pleaſe the People, have commonly the power to raiſe them.</p>
                  <p>To do things ſo that there ſhall remain no jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, is very neceſſary, and is no more then real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35597:54"/>
reforming, that is, pleaſing them. For to do things that ſhall grieve hereafter, and yet pretend love (amongſt lovers themſelves, where there is eaſieſt faith) will not be accepted. It will not be enough for the King to do what they deſire, but he muſt do ſomthing more: I mean (by doing more) doing ſomthing of his owne, as throwing away things they call not for, or giving things they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected not. And when they ſee the King doing the ſame things with them, it will take away all thought and apprehenſion that he thinks the things they have done already ill.</p>
                  <p>Now if the King ends the differences, and takes away ſuſpect for the future, the caſe will fall out to be no worſe then when two duelliſts enter the Field, where the worſted party (the other having no ill opinion of him) hath his ſword given him again (without further hurt after he is in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers power.) But otherwiſe it is not ſafe to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what may follow: for the people are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally not valiant, and not much Cavalier. Now it is the nature of Cowards to hurt where they can receive none. They will not be content (while they fear and have the upper hand) to fetter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Royalty, but perchance (as timorous ſpirits uſe) will not think themſelves ſafe while that is at all. And poſſibly, this is the preſent ſtate of things.</p>
                  <p>In this great work (at leaſt to make it appear perfect and laſting to the Kingdom) it is neceſſary the Queen really joyn; for if ſhe ſtand aloof, there will ſtill be ſuſpicions: it being a received opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35597:54"/>
in the world, that ſhe hath a great intereſt in the Kings favor and power. And to invite her, ſhe is to conſider with her ſelf, whether ſuch great vertues and eminent excellencies (though they be highly admired &amp; valued by thoſe that know her) ought to reſt ſatisfied with ſo narrow a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the eſtimation of a few? And whether it be not more proper for a great Queen to arrive at univerſal honour, and love, then private eſteem and value.</p>
                  <p>Then, how becomming a work, for the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſoftnes of her Sex, is compoſing of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and uniting hearts? and how proper for a Queen, reconciling King and People?</p>
                  <p>There is but one thing remains, which whiſper'd abroad, buſies the Kings mind much (if not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs it) in the midſt of theſe great Reſolutions, and that is, The preſervation of ſome ſervants, whom he thinks ſomwhat hardly torn from him of late: which is of ſo tender a nature; I ſhal rather propound ſomething about it, then reſolve it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Quaere</hi> will be, Whether as things now ſtand (Kingdoms in the ballance) the King is not to follow nature, where the conſervation of the more general ſtill commands and governs the leſſe. As Iron by particular ſympathy ſticks to the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, but yet if it be joyned with a great body of Iron, it quits thoſe particular affections to the loadſtone, and moves with the other, to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the common Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond will be, Whether, if he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35597:55"/>
thoſe miniſters, they can be of any uſe to him hereafter? ſince no man is ſerved with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prejudice, then he that employs ſuſpected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, or not beloved, though able and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The third is, Whether, to preſerve them, there be any other way then for the King to be firſt right with his people? ſince the rule in Philoſophy muſt ever hold good, <hi>nihil dat quod non habet.</hi> Before the King have power to ſave, he muſt have power.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Whether the way to preſerve this power be not to give it away? For the people of <hi>England</hi> have ever been like wantons, which pull and tugg as long as the princes have pull'd w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th them, as you may ſee in <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. King <hi>John, Edw.</hi> 2. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, all the troubleſom and unfortunate reigns; but when they have let it go, they come and put it into their hands again, that they may play on: as you may ſee in Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will conclude with a prayer (not that I think it needs at this preſent: Prayers are to keep us from what may be, as well as to preſerve us from what is) <hi>That the King be neither too inſenſible of what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, nor too reſolved from what is within him.</hi> To be ſick of a dangerous ſicknes, and find no pain, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be with loſſe of underſtanding (Tis an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſme of <hi>Hippocrates)</hi> and on the other ſide, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniaſtrie</hi> is a ſullen Porter, and (as it was wittily ſaid of Conſtancy) ſhutts out often-times, Better things then it lets in.</p>

this upon excellent grounds; for it was both the eaſiest and beſt way of converting: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being tedious, and almoſt uſeleſſe: for but few among thouſands are capable of it, and thoſe few not capable at all times of their life, Judgement being required.

                  <head>A Diſcourſe by Sir <hi>John Suckling,</hi> Knight.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the truths <hi>(my Lord)</hi> which we receive, none more reaſonably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our belief, then thoſe which by <hi>all</hi> men, at <hi>all</hi> times have been aſſented to. In this number and higheſt I place this great one, that there is a <hi>Deity;</hi> which the whole world hath been ſo eager to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, that rather then it would have none at all, it hath too often been contented with a very mean one.</p>
                  <p>That there ſhould be a great Diſpoſer and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of things, a wiſe Rewarder and Puniſher of good and evil, hath appeared ſo equitable to men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by inſtinct they have concluded it neceſſary; Nature (which doth nothing in vain) having ſo far imprinted it in us all, that ſhould the envie of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors deny the ſecret to Succeders, they yet would find it out. Of all thoſe little ladders with which we ſeale heaven, and climb up to our Maker, that ſeems to me not the worſt, of which man is the firſt ſtep. For but by examining how I, that could contribute nothing to mine owne being, ſhould be here, I come to ask the ſame queſtion for my Father, and ſo am led in a direct line to a laſt Producer, that muſt be more then man. For <hi>if man
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35597:59"/>
made man, Why died not I when my Father died?</hi> ſince ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that <hi>Maxime</hi> of the Philoſophers, <hi>the cauſe taken away, the effect does not remain.</hi> Or if the firſt man gave himſelf being, why hath he it not ſtill? Since it were unreaſonable to imagine any thing could have power to give it ſelf life, that had no power to continue it. That there is then a God, will not be ſo much the diſpute, as what this God is, or how to be worſhipped, is that which hath troubled poor mortals from the firſt, nor are they yet in quiet. So great has been the diverſity, that ſome have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thought God was no leſſe delighted with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in his ſervice, then he was pleaſed with it in his works. It would not be amiſſe to take a ſurvey of the world from its cradle; and with <hi>Varro,</hi> divide it into three Ages: the <hi>Unknown,</hi> the <hi>Fabulous,</hi> and the <hi>Hiſtorical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt was a black <hi>night,</hi> and diſcovered <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> the ſecond was a weak and glimmering <hi>light,</hi> repreſenting things imperfectly and falſly: the laſt <hi>(more clear)</hi> left handſom monuments to poſterity. The <hi>unknown</hi> I place in the age before the Flood, for that Deluge ſwept away things as well as men, and left not ſo much as footſteps to trace them by. The <hi>fabulous</hi> began after the Flood; in this time Godheads were cheap, &amp; men not knowing where to chooſe better, made Deities one of another. Where this ended, the <hi>hiſtorical</hi> took beginning: for men began to ingrave in pillars, and to commit to Letters, as it were by joynt conſent: for the three great <hi>Epoches</hi> or Termes of Accompt were
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35597:59"/>
all eſtabliſhed within the ſpace of 30. yeers: The <hi>Grecians</hi> reckoning from their <hi>Olympiades:</hi> The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> from the building of their City: and the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonians</hi> from their King <hi>Salmonaſſar.</hi> To bring into the ſcale with Chriſtian Religion any thing out of the firſt Age, we cannot; becauſe we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it.</p>
                  <p>And the ſecond was ſo <hi>fabulous,</hi> that thoſe which took it up afterwards, ſmil'd at it as ridiculous and falſe (which though was eaſier for them to do then to ſhew a true.) In the <hi>hiſtorical,</hi> it improved, and grew more refined: but here the <hi>Fathers</hi> entred the field, and ſo cleerly gained the victory, that I ſhould ſay nothing in it, did I not know it ſtill to be the opinion of good wits, that the particular Religion of Chriſtians has added little to the general Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the World. Let us take it then in its <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter eſtate,</hi> and look upon it in that age which was made glorious by the bringing forth of ſo many admirable ſpirits, and this was about the 80. <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad,</hi> in the year of the world 3480. for in the ſpace of an 100. yeers, flouriſhed almoſt all that <hi>Greece</hi> could boaſt of, <hi>Socrates, Plato, Ariſtotle, Architas, Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Pythagoras, Epicurus, Heraclitus, Xenophon, Zeno, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Demoſthenes, Parmenides, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates, Theophraſtes, Empedocles, Tymaeus,</hi> with divers others, Orators and Poets. Or rather (for they had their Religion one from another, and not much different) let us take a view of it in that Century in which Nature (as it were to oppoſe the Grecian inſolence) brought forth that happy birth of <hi>Roman</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:35597:60"/>
wits: <hi>Varro, Cicero, Caeſar, Livie, Saluſt, Virgil, Horace, Vitruvius, Ovid, Pliny, Cato, Marcus Brutus,</hi> and this was from <hi>Quintus Servilius</hi> his Conſulſhip to that of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> 270. yeers after the other. And to ſay truth, a great part of our Religion, either directly or indirectly hath been profeſſed by Heathens; which I conceive not ſo much an exprobation to it, as a confirmation; it being no derogating from truth, to be warranted by common conſent.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, the Creation of the world is delivered almoſt the ſame in the <hi>Phoenician</hi> ſtories with that in <hi>Moſes;</hi> from this the <hi>Grecians</hi> had their <hi>Chaos,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the beginning of his <hi>Metamorphoſis.</hi> That <hi>All things were made by God,</hi> was held by <hi>Plato,</hi> and others; that <hi>darknes was before light,</hi> by <hi>Thales;</hi> that the <hi>Stars were made by God,</hi> by <hi>Aratus;</hi> that <hi>life was infuſed into things by the breath of God, Virgil;</hi> that <hi>Man was made of duſt, Heſied,</hi> and <hi>Homer;</hi> that <hi>the firſt life of man was in ſimplicity and nakednes,</hi> the <hi>AEgyptians</hi> taught: and from thence the Poets had their <hi>Golden Age.</hi> That <hi>in the firſt times mens lives laſted a thouſand yeers, Beroſus,</hi> and others: that <hi>ſomthing divine was ſeen amongſt men, till that the greatnes of our ſins gave them cauſe to remove, Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35597:60"/>

                        </gap>a,</hi> the earth. They concluded thoſe to be vices which we do; nor was there much difference in their vertues; onely Chriſtians have made ready beleef the higheſt, which they would hardly allow to be any. They held rewards for the good, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for the ill; had their <hi>Elizium,</hi> and their <hi>hell;</hi> and that they thought the pains <hi>eternal</hi> there, is evident, in that they beleev'd from thence was no return. They proportion'd ſufferings hereafter, to offences here; as in <hi>Tantalus, Siſyphus,</hi> and others, among which that of Conſcience) the worm that never dies) was one, as in the Vultures gnawing of <hi>Promotheus</hi> heart, and <hi>Virgils</hi> uglieſt of Furies thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in <hi>Pirithous</hi> ear, was not obſcurely ſhown; and yet neerer us, they held the number of the Elect to be but ſmall, and that there ſhould be a laſt day in which the World ſhould periſh by fire. Laſtly they had their Prieſts, Temples, Altars.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen now the <hi>Parallel,</hi> let us enquire whether thoſe things they ſeem to have in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with us, we have not in a more excellent manner, and whether the reſt in which we differ from all the world, we take not up with reaſon. To begin then with their <hi>Jupiter</hi> (for all before were but little ſtealthes from <hi>Moſes</hi> workes) how much more like a Deity are the actions our ſtories declare our God to have done, then what the Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Authors deliver of theirs? How excellently
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35597:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
elevated are our deſcriptions of him? Theirs look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as if they knew that power onely by their fears, as their Statues erected to him declare: for when he was <hi>Capitolinus,</hi> he appeard with thunder; when <hi>Latiaris,</hi> beſmear'd with blood; when <hi>Feretrius,</hi> yet more terrible: We may gheſſe what their conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions were, by the worſhip they gave him: How full of cruelty were their ſacrifices? it being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved almoſt through the whole world, <hi>that gods were pleaſed with the blood of men:</hi> and this cuſtom neither the <hi>Grecian</hi> Wiſdom, nor <hi>Roman</hi> Civility aboliſhed, as appears by ſacrifices to <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the ceremonies of <hi>Liber Pater,</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> how obſcene? and thoſe daies which were ſet a part for the honour of the gods, celebrated with ſuch ſhews as <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf was aſhamed to be preſent at. On the contrary, our ſervices are ſuch as not only <hi>Cato,</hi> but God himſelf may be there: we worſhip him that is the pureſt Spirit, in purity of ſpirit; and did we not beleeve what the Scriptures deliver from himfelf, yet would our reaſon perſwade us that ſuch an Eſſence could not be pleaſed with the blood of beaſts, or delighted with the ſteam of fat: and in this particular, Chriſtians have gone beyond all others except the Mahometans; beſides whom there has been no Nation that had not ſacrifice, and was not guilty of this pious cruelty.</p>
                  <p>That we have the ſame vertues with them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true; but who can deny that thoſe vertues have received additions from Chriſtianity, conducing to mens better living together? revenge of injuries
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35597:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> both took himſelf, and allowed by the Law to others; <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> placed it in vertues quarter: We extol patient bearing of injuries; and what quiet the one, what trouble the other would give the world, let the indifferent judge. Their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice only took care that men ſhould not do wrong: ours that they ſhould not think it, the very cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſeverely forbidden: and this holds too in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, deſire of a woman unlawfully being as much a breach of the commandement, as their enjoying, which ſhew'd not only the Chriſtians care, but wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to prevent ill, who provided to deſtroy it where it was weakeſt in the Cradle, and declared, He was no leſſe then a God which gave them theſe Laws; for had he been but man, he never would have provided or taken care for what he could not look into, the hearts of Men, and what he could not puniſh, their thoughts. What Charity can be produced anſwerable to that of Chriſtians? Look upon the Primitive times, and you ſhall find that (as if the whole World had been but a private Family) they ſent from Province to Province, and from Places farre diſtant, to Releeve them they never ſaw nor knew.</p>
                  <p>Now for the happineſſe which they propoſed: if they take it as the Heathens underſtood it, it was an <hi>Elizium,</hi> a place of bleſſed ſhades, at beſt but a handſom retirement from the troubles of this World: if according to the duller Jewes, Feaſtings and Banquettings; (for it is evident
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35597:62"/>
that the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who were great obſerver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the Moſaical Law, had but faint thoughts of any thing to come) there being in <hi>Moſes</hi> books no promiſes but of Temporal bleſſings, and (if any) an obſcure mention of eternity. The Mahometans are no leſſe ſenſual, making the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of youth, high Feaſts, a woman with great eyes, and dreſt up with a little more fancie, the laſt and beſt good.</p>
                  <p>Then the hell; How gentle with the Heathens? but the rowling of a ſtone, filling of a ſieve with water, ſitting before Banquets, and not daring to touch them, exerciſing the trade and buſineſſes they had on earth; with the Mahometans, but a Purgatory acted in the grave, ſome pains inflicted by a bad Angel, and thoſe qualified and mitigated too, by an aſſiſting good one. Now for the Jewes, as they had no hopes, ſo they had no fears; ſo that if we conſider it rightly, neither their puniſhments were great enough to deter them from doing ill, nor their rewards high enough to invite men to ſtrictnes of life; for ſince every man is able to make as good a heaven of his own, it were unreaſonable to perſwade him to quit that certain happines for an uncertainty: whereas Chriſtians with as much more noble conſideration both in their heaven and hell took care not onely for the body but the ſoul, and for both above mans apprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrangeſt, though moſt Epidemical diſeaſe of all Religions, has been an imagination men have had, that the impoſing painful and difficult things
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35597:62"/>
upon themſelves, was the beſt way to appeaſe the Deity, groſly thinking the chief ſervice and delight of the Creator to conſiſt in the tortures and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Creature. How laden with chargeable and unneceſſary Ceremonies the Jews were, their feaſts, circumciſions, ſacrifices, great Sabbaths, and little Sabbaths, faſts, burials, indeed almoſt all their worſhip, ſufficiently declare: and that the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans are much more infected, appeares by the cutting of the <hi>Praepuces,</hi> wearing iron rings in the skin of their Fore parts, launcing themſelves with knives, putting out their eyes upon the ſight of their Prophets Tombe, and the like. Of theſe laſt we can ſhew no patterns amongſt us: for though there be ſuch a thing as whipping of the body, yet it is but in ſome parts of Chriſtendom, and there perchance too, more ſmil'd at then practis'd. Our Religion teacheth us to bear afflictions patiently when they fall upon us, but not to force them upon our ſelves: for we beleeve the God we ſerve, wiſe enough to chuſe his owne ſervice, and therefore preſume not to adde to his commands. With the Jews it is true we have ſomthing in common, but rather the names then thinges: Our Faſts being more the medicines of the body, then the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, ſpiritual, as our Sabbaths; both good mens delight, not their trouble.</p>
                  <p>But leaſt this diſcourſe ſhould ſwell into a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſuch as would make it look rather like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which I had labour'd to get, then an accompt which I alwaies carry about me; I will now briefly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35597:63"/>
examine, whether we beleeve not with reaſon thoſe things we have different from the reſt of the world. Firſt then, for the perſwaſion of the truth of them in general: let us conſider what they were that conveigh'd them to us: men (of all the world) the moſt unlikely to plot the cozenage of others, being themſelves but ſimple people, without ends, without deſignes, ſeeking neither honour, riches, nor pleaſure, but ſuffering (under the contrary) ignominy, poverty, and miſery; enduring death it ſelf, nay courting it: all which are things diſtaſteful to nature, and ſuch as none, but men ſtrangely aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, would have undergone. Had they feigned a ſtory, certainly they would not in it have regiſtred their owne faults, nor deliver'd him whom they propounded as a God, ignominiouſly crucified: add to this the progreſſe their doctrine made abroad, miraculous above all other either before or ſince: other Religions were brought in with the ſword, power, forcing a cuſtom, which by degrees uſurp'd the place of truth: this even power it ſelf oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. For the Romans (contrary to their cuſtome which entertained all Religions kindly) perſecuted this: which by its owne ſtrength ſo poſſeſſed the hearts of men, that no age, ſex, or condition, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to lay down life for it. A thing ſo rare in other Religions, that among the Heathens, <hi>Socrates</hi> was the ſole martyr: and the Jews (unleſſe of fome few under <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Antiochus)</hi> have not to boaſt of any. If we caſt our eyes upon the healing of the blind, curing the lame, redeeming from the grave,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35597:63"/>
and but with a touch or word, we muſt conclude them done by more then humane power, and if by any other, by no ill; Theſe buſie not themſelves ſo much about the good of man: and this Religion not only forbids by precept the worſhip of wicked ſpirits, but in fact deſtroys it whereſoever it comes. Now as it is clear by Authors impartial (as being no Chriſtians) that ſtrange things were done, ſo it is plain they were done without impoſture. Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhun the light; Theſe were all acted openly, the very enemies both of the maſter and diſciples daily looking on. But let us deſcend to thoſe more principal particulars, which ſo much trouble the curious wits: theſe I take to be the <hi>Incarnation, Paſsion, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the firſt, That man ſhould be made without man, why ſhould we wonder more at it in that time of the world, then in the beginning? much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, certainly, it was here, becauſe neerer the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way; Woman being a more prepared matter then earth. Thoſe great truths, and myſteries of ſalvation would never have been received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miracles; and where could they more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely be ſhown, then at his entrance into the world, where they might give credit to his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actions and doctrine? So far it is from being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my reaſon to think him thus borne, that it would be againſt it to beleeve him otherwiſe; it being not fit that the Son of God ſhould be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced like the race of men. That humane nature may be aſſumed by a Deity, the enemy of Chriſtians,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35597:64"/>
                     <hi>Julian,</hi> confirms; and inſtances (himſelf) in <hi>AEſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius,</hi> whom he will have deſcend from heaven in mortal ſhape, to teach us here below the Art of Phyſick. Laſtly, That God has liv'd with men, has been the general fancy of all Nations: every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular having this tradition; that the Deity at ſome time or other converſed amongſt men. Nor is it contrary to reaſon to beleeve him reſiding in glory above, and yet incarnate here: So in man himſelf, the ſoul is in heaven when it remains in the fleſh, for it reacheth with its eye the Sun; why may not God then being in heaven, be at the ſame time with us in the fleſh? ſince the ſoul without the body would be able to do much more then with it, and God much more then the ſoul, being the ſoul of the ſoul. But it may be urged as more abſtruſe, how all in heaven, and all in earth? Obſerve man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as you have done ſeeing) Is not the ſame ſpeech, at the inſtant it is uttered, all in every place? Receives not each particular ear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alike, the whole? and ſhall not God be much more Ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary then the voice of man? For the <hi>Paſsion</hi> (to let alone the neceſſity of ſatisfying divine Juſtice this way, which, whoſoever reads more particularly our Divines, ſhall find rationally enforced) we find: the Heathen had ſomething neer to this (though, as in the reſt, imperfect) for they ſacrificed ſingle men for the ſins of the whole City or Countrey. <hi>Porphyrius</hi> having laid this foundation: <hi>That the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme happines of the ſoul is to ſee God,</hi> and that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee him unpurified, concludes, That there muſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35597:64"/>
be a way for the <hi>cleanſing of Mankind;</hi> and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find it out, he tells that Arts and Sciences ſerve but to ſet our wits right in the knowledge of things, and cleanſe us not enough to come to God: the like judgment he gives of purging by <hi>Theurgie,</hi> and by the myſteries of the Sun; becauſe thoſe things extend but to ſome few, whereas this clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ought to be univerſal for the benefit of all mankind: in the end reſolves that this cannot be done, but by one of the three <hi>In-beings,</hi> which is the word they uſe to expreſſe the Trinity by. Let us ſee what the divineſt of the Heathens (and his Maſter <hi>Plato)</hi> delivers, to admiration, and as it were <hi>Prophetically,</hi> to this purpoſe. <hi>That a truly juſt man be ſhewn</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is neceſſary that he be ſpoil'd of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, ſo that he muſt be accounted by others a wicked man, be ſcoffed at, put in priſon, beaten, nay be crucified:</hi> and certainly for him that was to appear the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt example of patience, it was neceſſary to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the higheſt tryal of it, which was an <hi>undeſerved death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> I conceive the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to lie not ſo much upon our Lord, as us; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with eaſie Reaſon imagined, that he which can make a body, can lay it down, and take it up again. There is ſomthing more that urges and preſſes us: for in our eſtate we promiſe our ſelves hereafter, there will be no need of Food, Copulation, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement, to what purpoſe ſhould we have a mouth, belly, or leſſe comely parts? it being ſtrange to imagine God to have created man, for a moment
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35597:65"/>
of time, a body conſiſting of particulars, which ſhould be uſeleſſe to all eternity. Beſides, Why ſhould we deſire to carry that along with us which we are aſhamed of here, and which we find ſo great a trouble, that very wiſe men (were it not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) would throw it off before it were worn out? To this I ſhould anſwer, that as the body is partner in well or ill doing, ſo it is but juſt it ſhould ſhare in the rewards or puniſhments hereafter: and though by reaſon of ſin we bluſh at it here, yet when that ſhall ceaſe to be, why we ſhould be more aſhamed then our firſt Parents were, or ſome in the laſt diſcover'd parts of the World are now, I cannot underſtand. Who knowes but theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſightly parts ſhall remain for good uſe, and that putting us in mind of our imperfect eſtate here, they ſhall ſerve to increaſe our content and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes there? What kind of thing a glorified body ſhall be, how chang'd, how refin'd, who knowes? Nor is it the meaneſt invitement to me now, to think that my eſtate there, is above my capacity here. There remaines that which does not onely quarrel with the likelyhood of a Reſurrection, but with the poſſibility; alleadging, that man corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted into duſt, is ſcattered almoſt into infinite, or devoured by an irrational creature, goes into ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and grows part of it; then that creature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance is made like food to another: And truly did we doubt of Gods power, or not think him omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, this were a <hi>Labyrinth</hi> we ſhould be loſt in: but it were hard, when we ſee every petty Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35597:65"/>
in his little ſhop bring into one body things of the ſame kind, though ſcatter'd and diſorder'd; that we ſhould not allow the great Maker of all things to do the ſame in his owne Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>There remains onely the miſtery of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> to the difficulty of which, the poverty and narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of words have made no ſmall addition.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> plainly ſaies the word <hi>Perſon</hi> was taken up by the Church for want of a better; <hi>Nature, Subſtance, Eſſence, Hypoſtaſis, Suppoſitum,</hi> and <hi>Perſona,</hi> have cauſed ſharp diſputes amongſt the Doctors: at length they are contented to let the three firſt and three laſt ſignifie the ſame thing. By all of them is underſtood ſomthing <hi>Compleat, Perfect,</hi> and <hi>Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:</hi> in this onely they differ, that <hi>Nature, Subſtance, Eſſence</hi> are <hi>communicable ad quid,</hi> and <hi>ut quo</hi> (as they call it) The other are not at all: but enough of this; Thoſe that were the immediate Conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it to us, wrapt it not up in any of theſe terms. We then hold God to be one, and but one, it being groſſe to imagine two omnipotents, for then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would be ſo; yet ſince this good is perfectly good, and perfect goodnes cannot be without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love, nor perfect love without communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor to an unequal or created, for then it muſt be inordinate; We conclude a Second <hi>Coeternal</hi> though <hi>Begotten:</hi> nor are theſe contrary (though they ſeem to be ſo) even in created ſubſtances, that one thing may come from another, and yet that from whence it comes, not be before that which comes from it; as in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Light.</hi> But
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35597:66"/>
in theſe high myſteries, ſimilitudes may be the beſt Arguments. In Metaphyſicks they tell us, that to the conſtituting of every being, there is a <hi>Poſſe ſui eſſe,</hi> from whence there is a <hi>Sapientia ſui eſſe,</hi> and from theſe two proceedeth an <hi>Amor ſui eſſe:</hi> and though theſe three be diſtinct, yet they make up one perfect being. Again, and more familiarly; There is a hidden Original of waters in the earth, from this a ſpring flows up, and of theſe proceeds a ſtream: this is but one eſſence, which knows nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a before, nor an after, but in order, and (that too) according to our conſidering of it: the Head of a Spring is not a Head, but in reſpect of the Spring; for if ſomthing flow'd not from it, it were no Original, Nor the Spring a Spring if it did not flow from ſomthing, nor the Stream a Stream but in reſpect of both: Now all theſe three are but one Water, and though one is not the other, yet they can hardly be conſidered one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now, though I know this is ſo far from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that it is but an imperfect inſtance (perfect being impoſſible of infinite by finite things) yet there is a reſemblance great enough to let us ſee the poſſibility. And here the eye of Reaſon needed no more the ſpectacles of Faith, then for theſe things of which we make ſympathy the cauſe, as in the Load-ſtone, or antipathy, of which every man almoſt gives inſtance from his owne nature: nor is it here ſo great a wonder that we ſhould be ignorant; for this is diſtant and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſence; theſe neer and ſubject to it; and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35597:66"/>
it were ſtranger for me to conclude that God did not work <hi>ad extra,</hi> thus one and diſtinct within himſelf, becauſe I cannot conceive how begotten, how proceeding; then if a Clown ſhould ſay the hand of a Watch did not move, becauſe he could not give an account of the wheels within. So far is it from being unreaſonable, becauſe I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, that it would be unreaſonable I ſhould: For why ſhould a created ſubſtance comprehend an uncreated, A circumſcribed and limited, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſcrib'd and unlimited? And this I obſerve in thoſe great Lovers and Lords of Reaſon, quoted by the Fathers, <hi>Zoroastres, Triſmegiſtus, Plato, Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Plotinus, Proclus, Amelius,</hi> and <hi>Avicen,</hi> that when they ſpoke of this myſtery of the Trinity, of which all writ ſomething, and ſome almoſt as plainly as Chriſtians themſelves, that they diſcuſſed it not as they did other things, but delivered them as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which they had received themſelves, without diſpute.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of Chriſtian Profeſſion compared with others: I ſhould now ſhew which (compar'd within it ſelf) ought to be preferred: but this is the work of every pen, perhaps to the prejudice of Religion it ſelf. This excuſe (though) it has, that (like the chief Empire) having nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, no other Religion to oppoſe or diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, it hath been forced to admit of Civil wars, and ſuffer under its owne excellency.</p>
