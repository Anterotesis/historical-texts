            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Firſt, of the ſtrength and force of the poiſon of ſinne.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O bee plaine in words, certaine in ſence, and ſhort in writing, I will briefly deſcribe the ſtrength of the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin. It is a ſpirituall poiſon, <hi>The breach of Gods Law, 1 Ioh. 3.4.</hi> The which whoſoeuer committeth is of the Diuell, <hi>1 Iohn 3.8.</hi> Yea, it is the vile, and moſt damnable thing in the world. The onely <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> which no man without the diſpleaſure of Almighty GOD, could euer taſte, or touch in the leaſt degree. For, <hi>Via peccati ingredientes contaminat, progredientes obſtinat, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredientes exterminat.</hi> Sinne in the
<pb facs="tcp:15642:3"/>
firſt entrance defileth, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe hardeneth, and at his going out deſtroyeth. It cauſeth all thoſe that commit it to diſhonour God, to crucifie Chriſt a freſh, and to greeue the Holy Ghoſt: It makes the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to moure, and all Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to groone and ſigh vnder the burthen of it, <hi>Rom. 8.22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the very excrement of the Diuell, that old Serpent; the age of it is almoſt as old as the worlde: for ſcarce was there a world, but it was a priſoned worlde with ſinne; and almoſt no ſooner was there a man, but hée was infected with this poiſon. And ſo ſtrong was this poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, euen at the firſt committing of ſinne, that it made all the worlde mourne for her mallidy, the which neither <hi>Ghiron, Eſculapius,</hi> nor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> could euer heale: No, if all the Angels and men both of heauen and earth were in one, they could neuer heale it.</p>
            <p>Our poyſoned ſoules could not
<pb facs="tcp:15642:3"/>
bee cured without a <hi>Mithradate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of the beſt bloude that euer was in the worlde, euen the moſt pretious bloud of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> the onely begotten Sonne of God. So this ſpirituall poyſon can bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes cured, but by a ſpirituall <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi>; this moſt deadly poyſon muſt haue the moſt <hi>ſoueraine anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote</hi>; onely here is the difference, that as hel giueth the poyſon, ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen giues the helps.</p>
            <p>There is no ſinne ſo ſmall, that hath not coſt the Sonne of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a ſea of ſorrowes. O what a hell (thinke wee) was <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> in for our ſinnes, when hee ſwet both water and bloud, and prayed thrice moſt feruently to haue that bitter cup paſe from him? Yea hee brake out into this ſundring voice, and cried to God his Father. <hi>Quare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliquiſti me?</hi> Why hath thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</p>
            <p>Whoſe bloudy ſweat came trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe to the ground <hi>Luke 22.44.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15642:4"/>
In the which (no doubt) he felt the force and ſtrength of ſinne, the wrath of God againſt it, the Iuſtice of God requiring puniſhment for it, the power of the Law pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing condemnation to it; the force of death, the tyrannie of Satan, and the torment of hell, which was forcible enough to haue drawne ſtreames of teares out of the drieſt eye that euer was in the head of man, and to haue excited a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſorrowfull groanes out of the hardeſt heart that euer GOD made.</p>
            <p>Oh, was the ſtrength of ſinne ſo great, that it cauſed <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſhed dropps of blood for our ſinnes, and cannot we ſhed forth one teare for the ſame?</p>
            <p>Oh, I beſeech you, let the horror of it be alwayes freſh in our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the meditation thereof im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our hearts, that wee may remember thoſe grieuous dropps of that moſt precious blood,
<pb facs="tcp:15642:4"/>
which <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſhedde for our ſakes, for our ſinnes, for our ſoules, and for our ſaluation. Let vs loue him for it, thanke him for it, and ſerue him for it, all the dayes of our liues. So that our hands may tremble and ſhake for feare, and our whole body may quake with terror of it, when any euill imagination is hatched in our hearts, or any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deede ſhould be acted with our hands, that we may be euer terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from nouriſhing ſinne in our boſome, whoſe condition is ſo vile and baſe. For ſuch is the nature of ſinne, enter where it will, it is the heart it aimes at, and it will not ſtay vntill it comes there: becauſe ſinne and Sathan loue no veniſon but the heart, no fowle but the breaſt, and no fiſh but the ſoule. The heart is the throne where ſinne would raigne, and the ſoule it ſelfe is the ſeate where ſinne would ſit. And therefore, the more ſinne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to poyſon that part, the more
<pb facs="tcp:15642:5"/>
ſhould wee ſtriue to preſerue it.</p>
            <p>If our heart bee Gods throne then is hee a moſt vile traytor to God and himſelfe, that ſuffers ſin, Gods great enemy, that proud, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, aſpiring Tyrant, to ſit in the ſeat, and tyrannize in the throne of the Soueraigne Maieſtie of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>Thus wee may ſee, that the very ſubiect and ſeat of ſinne is the heart and ſoule of man, that moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pretious part, which God made like to himſelfe, and for the which the Sonne of God was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>
            <p>And as ſinne delights to ſit and captiue both the heart and ſoule of man, ſo the longer it raignes there the worſe it is; for as in good things the elder the better; ſo in the euill of ſinne, the elder the worſe, and the more they will grow in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Aske one of the holieſt men, hee that had feweſt ſinnes; <hi>They are more in number</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>than the
<pb facs="tcp:15642:5"/>
haires of my head. Oh who can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his errours? Pſalme 40.12. Pſal. 19.12. Or who can tell how oft he offendeth?</hi> Yea, ſinne is growne ſo foule, ſo great, and is ſo ſcattered abroad into ſo many mens hearts, that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Totus mundus in maligno poſitus eſt:</hi> The whole world lyeth plungeth in wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeake more of the euill of ſin, it appeareth in thrée things; Firſt in the deformity. <hi>For God doth loath it.</hi> Secondly, in the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>For the Diuell doth loue it.</hi> Thirdly, in the generall contagious poyſon and leproſie thereof: (as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith) the whole world is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted therewith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, how mans ſoule became infected therewith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the beginning, God ſuruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his workes with the eyes of his wiſedome, after they had paſſed the hand of his power, his Iuſtice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb facs="tcp:15642:6"/>
this infallible ſentence, <hi>Geneſis 1.31, Loe they were all very good.</hi> How then came it to paſſe, that mans ſoule became poyſoned? And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayth in another place, <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo. Mat. 19.8. Salomon ſayth, God made man righteous, Eccleſ. 7.29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwere whereof our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Philoſophy ſheweth vs, that our poyſoned ſoules which defile our whole nature came from the fault and fall of <hi>Adam</hi>; and from the curſe of the earth through <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> tranſgreſſion. For the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that Roaring Lyon, in whom the full perfection of malice lies, knowing how to moſt hurt, hath poyſoned the <hi>Fountaine, Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue:</hi> &amp; the <hi>Fountaine</hi> once poiſoned, then the ſtreames iſſuing from the ſame are ſure and moſt certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The which <hi>Dauid</hi> confeſſeth in the perſon of all regenerate men, <hi>I was ſhapen in wickedneſſe, and in ſin hath my mother conceived me, Pſ. 51.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15642:6"/>Thus our ſpirituall poyſon came into the ſoule and body of man by the ſubtiltie of Sathan, that arch-enimy of man-kinde. For he being once an Angell in Heauen, a goodly creature, would needes become a God, and conſequently a Creator. Now, a Creator muſt needes make ſomething, and therefore here we may behold his worke; Lo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, it is euen ſinne, for ſinne is the true creature, and onely worke of the Diuell. And as he is a ſpirit, ſo hee hath ſociety with the ſpirits, as bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creatures haue with our bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, How the ſoule of man poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſinne, may be cured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſoule of man that is poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſinne, muſt begin to be cured in this life, but it cannot bee perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this life: For whatſoeuer is begunne here in grace, in the life to come ſhall be perfected in glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15642:7"/>And for this great cure, we ought diligently to obſerue three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, wee muſt know our ſelues, what eſtate wee are in, that wee may ſee how wee are poyſoned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, wee muſt vſe the remedy to cure the poyſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we muſt take our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine in due time.</p>
            <p>Therefore, hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare; and that hath eyes to ſee, let him ſee, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerue what ſalue hee muſt take to cure this poyſon of ſinne. The firſt and principall thing is to take this precept of the philoſopher, <hi>Noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce teipſum,</hi> Know thy ſelfe; It is the firſt thing to bee done to this cure, and the beginning of all grace: For in vaine is the medicine miniſtred, where the diſeaſe is diſſemblingly couered, and kept vnknowne.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, whoſoeuer thou bée that feeleſt thy ſelfe to bee infected with this poiſoning ſinne, and art inwardly touched with any care of
<pb facs="tcp:15642:7"/>
thine owne ſaluation, and doeſt groane with earneſt deſire to ſtand in fauour againe with God; thou muſt ſeriouſly enter into thy ſelfe, and make a true ſuruey of thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, that thereby thou mayſt know how ſinne hath poiſoned thée both in greatneſſe and danger. For vntill thou knoweſt thy ſinnes, and how they haue infected thy ſoule, that thy conſcience may bee conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by them, thou canſt neuer bee cured. No man can rightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his owne ſinnes, no man can truly confeſſe his fayth, no man can duly vſe the Sacraments, that doth not firſt earneſtly try and examine his owne conſcience: That is, throughly to try, narrowly to ſearch, and dilligently to prooue, who, and what manner of perſon hee is, and in what caſe hee feeleth himſelfe, how deeply his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is poyſoned with ſinne. And withall, to know how, and which
<pb facs="tcp:15642:8"/>
way hee may come into fauour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with God. To the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, <hi>Let euery man proue his worke, Gal. 6.4.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Proue your ſelues whether you be in the faith, 2. Cor. 12.5.</hi> Examine your ſelues, and bee ſorrowfull for your ſinnes; not for ſome ſinnes, but for all ſinnes wherewith you are infected and poyſoned: And that not for an houre, nor a day, nor for a weeke, nor a moneth; but mourne for your miſdeedes, and bee ſorrie for your ſinnes continually, euen ſo long as you liue.</p>
            <p>Wee muſt doe as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> did, when he had conſidered his wayes, and found they were euill, <hi>He euer after turned his feet vnto the teſtimonies of the Lord. Pſ. 119.56</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So muſt euery one doe, that mindeth to bee cured from the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſinne; examine his owne conſcience, and make his heart ſmart for his ſinne, by aggrauation thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15642:8"/>The Church of God confeſſeth not her ſinnes lightly, but with wonderfull griefe. <hi>Dan. 9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, wee muſt vſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to cure the poyſon of ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As by nature wee hate euery thing that hurteth vs, how much more by grace ſhould wee abhorre ſinne that woundeth vs? Amongſt all the workes of the Diuell, there was none ſo mighty and malicious as the poiſoning and deſtroying the ſoules of men by ſinne.</p>
            <p>So for to cure our ſoules from this deadly poiſon, our Sauiour <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> that heauenly Phyſition, hath accordingly giuen vs a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proportionable to our malady, out of his glorious ſtore-houſe of the holy Scriptures If we will he cured from the poyſon of ſinne, we muſt take <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>vertuous phyſicke</hi> hee giues vs by a liuely fayth; but wee muſt keepe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him, and it, by holineſſe of life. Theſe two, faith and holineſſe
<pb facs="tcp:15642:9"/>
are the two bonds of our <hi>vnion with Chriſt:</hi> Faith brings <hi>Chriſt</hi> to vs, and holineſſe keepes him with vs, and vs with him. <hi>If any man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) heare my voyce, and open the doore, I will come into him, and will ſtay with him, and hee with me.</hi> Thus by faith we take this heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phyſicke, and by holineſſe wee kéepe it. Wherefore, all thoſe which formerly obeyed ſinne, if they will be cured from the poiſon thereof, by faith and holineſſe of life, they muſt now withſtand it. They which were wont to yeelde vnto it, muſt now ſtriue againſt it: they which were wont to delight in it, muſt now lament it: they which did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly let ſinne raigne and captiue their ſoules in them, muſt now raigne ouer it, quench it, and ſubdue it, and flie from it, as from the moſt venemous ſting of a Serpent. If the filthy and ſtinking poyſon of their ſinnes cannot moue them, let the ſhortneſſe and vncertainty of
<pb facs="tcp:15642:9"/>
their liues dampe them. If the ſhortneſſe of their lines cannot, let the ſmall number of them that ſhall be ſaued fray them. If that cannot, tell Death terrifie them. If Death cannot, let the day of iudgement ſhake them. If all theſe cannot, then will the torments of hell for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more torment them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, wee muſt take our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For common experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, that <hi>Tempus eſt pretioſum, breue, &amp; irreuocabile,</hi> Time is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, ſhort, and irreuocable, <hi>Qui non oſt hodiè, cras minús aptus erat,</hi> He that is not ready to receiue this Heauenly phyſicke to day, will bee leſſe ready to morrow. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take this time while wee haue it, for we haue no time but this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time; the time paſt is not ours, it is gone, and cannot bee recalled the time to come is not, for beeing not come, it may bee it neuer ſhall come: Onely the preſent houre is
<pb facs="tcp:15642:10"/>
ours, let vs take and make good vſe of it.</p>
            <p>So that now, euen now is the time to take this wholeſome and brauenly phiſicke to purge away our ſinnes; while wee are here in this life, the time is in our hands. Now the doore is open, but after this life it will be ſhut. Therefore now while the Goſpell ſhineth, now while <hi>Chriſt</hi> calleth, now while he ſpeaketh, now while hee kneek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, let vs amend our former liues; let vs now therefore heare Gods word, let vs now obey him, let vs make this day our day to returne vnto God. And although we could neuer bee mooued by reading any booke heretofore, or by hearing Gods word preached hitherto, yet let vs now be moued at the laſt, and with good <hi>Ezechias,</hi> let vs be afraid of Gods threatning, ſorrow afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, examine our conſciences, and mourne for our ſinnes, let vs clenſe and purge our hearts and ſoules
<pb facs="tcp:15642:10"/>
from this poiſon, and let vs neuer drinke, nor taſte that deadly dregs againe. Let vs walke no more ſo inordinately in it, wallow no more in the filthie mire of it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey no more the luſt of it, nor giue our members any more to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to fight for it: But with all our power let vs oppoſe it, reſiſt it, and manfully with all our force fight againſt it. Oh let vs ſhake off our ſinnes, baniſh them, ſend our deareſt darlings packing, and neuer pittie them, neuer loue them, neuer be led by them, for they would poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our ſoules moſt deadly vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall deſtruction.</p>
            <p>To conclude, God grant that we may all, and euery one of vs forſake our ſinnes in time, before it bee too late; and as <hi>Phyſitions</hi> doe heale many ſore maladies with ſharpe medicines: ſo giue grace O eternall and moſt <hi>gracious God,</hi> that theſe my labours (though they ſeeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauery, and ſharpe to the wicked)
<pb facs="tcp:15642:11"/>
may yeelde ſuch ſound and godly <hi>Phiſicke,</hi> that they may become a ſalue to cure, and preſerue the ſoules of the godly, in their zeale of thy glory.</p>
            <p>And furthermore grant O ſwéet <hi>Ieſus,</hi> that it may offer and miniſter all ſuch ſpirituall <hi>Phyſicke</hi> vnto the ſoules infected with the poyſon of ſinne, that it may be a meanes to withdraw them from the ſame. And that the ſalue, which is here preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto ſuch as are ſicke, and almoſt paſt recouery, may worke ſo effectually one them, that it may both ſtrengthen, helpe, and heale them of that damnable poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherewith they are ſo deadly infected.</p>
            <p>This GOD grant, without whoſe helpe all the labour of man is in vaine. And thus both from the poyſon of ſinne, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due for the ſame, the Lord deliuer vs all, euen for his deare Sonne Chriſt Ieſus his ſake, our
<pb facs="tcp:15642:11"/>
onely <hi>Saviour,</hi> To whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all honour, glory, praiſe, power, and dominion, both now, and for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
