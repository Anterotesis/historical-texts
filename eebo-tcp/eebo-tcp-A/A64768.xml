            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WEll-fare the <hi>Dode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedron!</hi> I have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the <hi>Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> by a <hi>Cast</hi> of <hi>Constellated Bones,</hi> and <hi>Deuz Ace</hi> tels me this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Truth</hi> (sayd the witty <hi>Aleman</hi>) was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded into <hi>Exile,</hi> and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Lie</hi> was seated in her <hi>Throne.</hi> To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the <hi>Tenor</hi> of this <hi>Sentence, Truth</hi> went from amongst <hi>Men,</hi> but she went <hi>all alone, poore</hi> and <hi>naked.</hi> She had not travail'd very far, when standing on a high mountain, she perceiv'd a <hi>great Train</hi> to passe by: In the middest of it was a <hi>Chariot</hi> attended with Kings,
<pb facs="tcp:115898:10"/>
Princes and Governors, and in that a stately <hi>Donna,</hi> who like some <hi>Queen regent,</hi> commanded the rest of the Company. Poor <hi>Truth,</hi> shee stood still whiles this <hi>pompous Squadron</hi> past by, but when the <hi>Chariot</hi> came over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her, the Lady <hi>Lie</hi> who was there <hi>seated,</hi> took notice of her, and causing her <hi>Pageants</hi> to stay, commanded her to come neerer. Here she was scornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, <hi>whence she came? whither she would goe?</hi> and <hi>what about?</hi> To these Questions she answered as the <hi>Custome</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> is, very <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>plainly:</hi> Whereupon the Lady <hi>Lie</hi> commands her to wait upon her, and that in the <hi>Reare,</hi> and <hi>Tayle</hi> of all her <hi>Troop,</hi> for that was the <hi>known place</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> Thanks then not to the <hi>stars,</hi> but to the <hi>Configurations</hi> of the <hi>Dice!</hi> they have acquainted mee with my <hi>future fortunes,</hi> and what <hi>praeferment</hi> my <hi>Book</hi> is like to <hi>attain</hi> to.

of this <hi>durty Reare</hi> be very <hi>nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and able to spoile a stronger sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach than mine. It hath been said of old, <hi>Non est Planta veritatis super ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, Trueth</hi> is an <hi>herb,</hi> that grows not here <hi>below:</hi> and can I expect that these <hi>few seeds,</hi> which I scatter thus in the <hi>storm</hi> and <hi>tempest,</hi> should thrive to their <hi>full eares,</hi> and <hi>Harvest?</hi> But Reader, let it not trouble thee to see the <hi>Truth</hi> come thus behind, it may be there is more of a <hi>Chase</hi> in it, than of <hi>Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> and her <hi>Condition</hi> not altogether so <hi>bad,</hi> as her <hi>Station.</hi> If thou art one of those, who draw up to the <hi>Chariot,</hi> pause here a little in the <hi>Reare,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou dost <hi>addresse</hi> thy self to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotel</hi> and his Lady <hi>Lie,</hi> think not thy <hi>Courtship</hi> lost, if thou doest <hi>kisse</hi> the <hi>lips</hi> of poor <hi>Truth.</hi> It is not my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>jest</hi> with thee, in what I shall <hi>write,</hi> wherefore <hi>read</hi> thou with a <hi>good Faith,</hi> what I will <hi>tell</hi> thee with a <hi>good Conscience.</hi> God, when hee first made

               <hi>Man,</hi> planted in him a <hi>spirit</hi> of that <hi>Capacitie,</hi> that he might <hi>know All,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto a most <hi>fervent Desire</hi> to <hi>know,</hi> lest that <hi>Capacitie</hi> should be <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi> This <hi>Truth</hi> is evident in the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie</hi> of <hi>Man:</hi> For <hi>little Children</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever they can speak, will <hi>stare</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>any thing,</hi> that is <hi>strange</hi> to them; they will <hi>crie,</hi> and are <hi>restless</hi> till they get it into their <hi>hands,</hi> that they may <hi>feele</hi> it, and <hi>look</hi> upon it, that is to say, that they may <hi>know what it is</hi> in some <hi>Degree,</hi> and according to their <hi>Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi> Now some ignorant Nurse will think they doe all this, out of a desire to play with what they see, but they themselves tell us the Contrarie; For when they are past <hi>Infants,</hi> and begin to make use of <hi>Language,</hi> if any <hi>New thing</hi> appeares, they will not desire to <hi>play</hi> with it, but they will <hi>ask</hi> you, <hi>what it is?</hi> for they desire to <hi>know;</hi> and this is <hi>plain</hi> out of their <hi>Actions;</hi> for if you put any <hi>Rattle</hi> into their <hi>hands,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115898:11"/>
they will <hi>view it,</hi> and <hi>studie it</hi> for some short Time, and when they can know <hi>no more,</hi> then they will <hi>play</hi> with it. It is well known, that if you hold a <hi>candle</hi> neer to a <hi>little Child,</hi> hee will (if you praevent him not) put his <hi>finger</hi> into the <hi>flame,</hi> for hee desires to <hi>know</hi> what it is, that <hi>shines</hi> so bright; but there is some thing more than all this, for even these <hi>Infants</hi> desire to <hi>improve</hi> their <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Thus when they <hi>look</hi> upon any <hi>thing,</hi> if the <hi>sight</hi> informes them not <hi>sufficiently,</hi> they will, if they can, <hi>get</hi> it into their <hi>hands,</hi> that they may <hi>feel</hi> it: but if the <hi>touch</hi> also doth not <hi>satisfie,</hi> they will <hi>put</hi> it into their <hi>Mouthes</hi> to <hi>taste</hi> it, as if they would <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Things</hi> by more <hi>senses</hi> than <hi>one.</hi> Now this <hi>Desire</hi> to <hi>know</hi> is born with them, and it is the <hi>Besi,</hi> and most <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious part</hi> of their <hi>Nature.</hi> It is to be observed, that when <hi>men</hi> come to their <hi>full Age,</hi> and are <hi>serious</hi> in their <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions,</hi> they are <hi>ashamed</hi> to <hi>Erre,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115898:12"/>
because it is the <hi>proprietie</hi> of their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to <hi>Know.</hi> Thus wee see that a <hi>Philosopher</hi> being taken at a <hi>fault</hi> in his <hi>Discourse,</hi> will <hi>blush,</hi> as if he had <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> something <hi>unworthy</hi> of <hi>himself,</hi> and truly the very <hi>Sense</hi> of this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi> prevailes so farre with some, they had rather <hi>persist</hi> in their <hi>Error,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> it against the <hi>Truth,</hi> than <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> their <hi>Infirmities;</hi> in which <hi>respect</hi> I make no Question but many <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetics</hi> are <hi>perversly ignorant.</hi> It may bee they will scarcely hear, what I speak, or if they hear, they will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand: howsoever I advise them not wilfully to <hi>prevent,</hi> and <hi>hinder</hi> that glorious <hi>end</hi> and <hi>perfection,</hi> for which the very <hi>Author,</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> created them.

For without Controversie the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> instituted, and left behind them certaine <hi>Elements</hi> or <hi>Signes,</hi> as <hi>Water, Oile, Salt</hi> and <hi>Lights,</hi> by which they signisied unto us some great, and reverend <hi>Mysteries.</hi> But our <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> mistaking these things for superstitious, turn'd them all out of Doores. But verily it was ill done: for if the <hi>shadow</hi> of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> healed, shall not these <hi>shadowes</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> doe much more? The <hi>Papist</hi> on the contrary knowing not the <hi>signification</hi> of these <hi>Types,</hi> did place a certain <hi>Inhaerent holiness</hi> in them, &amp; so fell into a very dangerous <hi>Idolatrie.</hi> I omit many Things which he invented of his own, as <hi>Images, Holy Lambes,</hi> and <hi>Reliques,</hi> adding these <hi>dead Bones</hi> to the Primitive, and beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Bodie</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Now to draw up the <hi>Paralell:</hi> The <hi>Magicians,</hi> they also instituted certain <hi>Signes,</hi> as the <hi>Clavis</hi> to their <hi>Art,</hi> and these were the same with the former, Namely <hi>Water, Oile, Salt</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> by which they tacitly discovered unto us their <hi>Three Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which fills and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115898:21"/>
actuats all Things. The common Man peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Books, but not their Sense, took <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, Common Water, Oile,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> and began to <hi>Consecrat,</hi> and <hi>exorcise</hi> them, to make up his damnable and Devilish <hi>Magic.</hi> The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> had a <hi>Maxim</hi> amongst themselves, <hi>Quod nulla vox operatur in Magiâ, nisi prius Dei voce formetur,</hi> That no word is efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in <hi>Magic,</hi> unless it be first animated with the word of God. Hence in their Books there was frequent mention made of <hi>Verbum,</hi> and <hi>Sermo,</hi> which the Common Man interpreting to his own Fansie, invented his <hi>Charmes,</hi> and <hi>Vocabula,</hi> by which he promised to do wonders. The <hi>Magicians</hi> in their writings did talk much of <hi>Triangles</hi> and <hi>Circles,</hi> by which they intimated unto us their more <hi>secret Triplicitie,</hi> with the <hi>Rotation</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her <hi>Week,</hi> to her <hi>Sabaoth.</hi> By this <hi>Circle</hi> also, or <hi>Rotation</hi> they affirmed that <hi>Spirits</hi> might be <hi>bound,</hi> meaning that the <hi>Soul</hi> might be <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to the <hi>Body.</hi> Presently upon this the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Man fansied his <hi>Triangles</hi> and characters, with many strange <hi>Cobwebs</hi> or <hi>Figures,</hi> and a <hi>Circle</hi> to Conjure in; but knowing not what <hi>Spirit</hi> that was, which the <hi>Magicians</hi> did bind, he laboured, and studied to bind the <hi>Devill.</hi> Now if thou wilt question mee, who these <hi>Magicians</hi> were? I must tell thee, They were
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115898:22"/>
                  <hi>Kings,</hi> they were <hi>Priests,</hi> they were <hi>Prophets:</hi> Men that were acquainted with the <hi>Substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, Spiritual Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and did deal, or dispense the outward <hi>Typicall part</hi> of it to the <hi>People.</hi> Here then wee may see how Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic came to be out of Request; For the <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Common Divines,</hi> who knew not these <hi>Secrets,</hi> perusing the Ceremonial, Superstitious <hi>Trash</hi> of some <hi>Scriblers,</hi> who praetended to <hi>Magic,</hi> praescribed against the <hi>Art</hi> it self as <hi>Impious,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian,</hi> so that it was a <hi>Capital sin</hi> to professe it, and the Punishment no lesse than <hi>Death.</hi> In the Interim those few who were Masters of the <hi>Science,</hi> observing the first Monitories of it, buried all in a deep Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But God having suffered his <hi>Truth</hi> to be obscured for a great time, did at last stirr up som <hi>resolute,</hi> and <hi>active spirits,</hi> who putting the Pen to paper, expell'd this <hi>Cloud,</hi> and in some measure discover'd <hi>the Light.</hi> The Leaders of this brave Body, were <hi>Cornelius Agrippa, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banius Gallus,</hi> the <hi>Philosopher, Johannes Trite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, Georgius Venetus, Johannes Reuclin,</hi> called in the Greek <hi>Capnion,</hi> with severall others in their severall Dayes.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115898:22"/>
with much more Content and Advantage, I think it not enough to have discover'd the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses</hi> and <hi>misfortunes</hi> this <hi>Science</hi> hath suffered, unless I indeavour withall to demonstrate the <hi>Antiquitie</hi> of it.

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Art,</hi> or rather this <hi>Mysterie</hi> is to bee considered severall wayes, and that because of its severall <hi>Subjects.</hi> The <hi>Primitive, Original Existence</hi> of it is in <hi>God</hi> himself: for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the <hi>practice,</hi> or <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> working in the <hi>matter,</hi> uniting

                  <hi>Principles</hi> into <hi>Compounds,</hi> and resolving those <hi>Compounds</hi> into their <hi>Principles.</hi> In this <hi>Sense</hi> wee seek not the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it, for it is <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> being a <hi>Notion</hi> of the <hi>Divine Wisdome,</hi> and Existent before all Time, or the Creation of it. Secondly, we are to Consider it in a <hi>Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative Sense,</hi> as it was imparted, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Man, and this properly was no <hi>Birth,</hi> or <hi>Beginning,</hi> but a <hi>Discoverie,</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Art.</hi> From this <hi>Time</hi> of its <hi>Revelation,</hi> wee are to measure the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of it, where it shall be our Task to demonstrat upon what <hi>Motives</hi> God did reveale it, as also to <hi>whom,</hi> and <hi>when.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Eye</hi> discovers not beyond that <hi>stage,</hi> wherein it is <hi>Conversant,</hi> but the <hi>Eare</hi> receives the Sound a great way off. To give an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euc'd Testimonie of Actions more Ancient than our selves, is a thing impossible for us, unlesse wee could look into that <hi>Glass,</hi> where all <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences</hi> may bee seen, Past, Present, and to Come. I must therefore build my <hi>Discourse</hi> on the <hi>Traditions</hi> of those <hi>Men,</hi> to whom the <hi>Word,</hi> both <hi>Written</hi> and <hi>Mysticall</hi> was intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and these were the <hi>Jewes</hi> in Generall, but more particularly their <hi>Cabalists.</hi> It is not my Intention to rest on these <hi>Rabbins</hi> as <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> but I will iustifie their Assertions out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and intertain my Reader with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115898:23"/>
                  <hi>Proofes,</hi> both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane.</hi> Finally, I will passe out of <hi>Judaea</hi> into <hi>AEgypt</hi> and <hi>Graece,</hi> where againe I shall meet with these <hi>Mysteries,</hi> and prove that this <hi>Science</hi> did stream (as the <hi>Chimists</hi> say, their <hi>Salt-Fountain</hi> doth) out of <hi>Jurie,</hi> and <hi>watered</hi> the whole <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the constant Opinion of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> That before the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> there was a more plentifull and large <hi>Communion</hi> between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth, God</hi> and the <hi>Elements,</hi> than there is now in our Days. But upon the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the first Man. <hi>Malcuth</hi> (say the <hi>Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>) was cut off from the <hi>Ilan,</hi> so that a <hi>Breach</hi> was made between both <hi>Worlds,</hi> and their <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> of <hi>Influences</hi> discontinued. Now <hi>Malcuth</hi> is the <hi>Invisible Archetypall Moone,</hi> by which our <hi>visible Caelestiall Moone</hi> is governed, and impraegnated: And truly it may be that upon this <hi>Retreate</hi> of the <hi>Divine Light</hi> from <hi>Infe riors,</hi> those <hi>Spots</hi> and <hi>Darknes,</hi> which we now see, succeeded in the <hi>Body</hi> of this <hi>Planet,</hi> and not in her alone, but about the <hi>Sun</hi> also, as it hath been discovered by the <hi>Telescope.</hi> Thus (say They) <hi>God</hi> to punish the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> withdrew himself from the <hi>Creatures,</hi> so that they were not <hi>feasted</hi> with the same <hi>measure</hi> of <hi>Influences</hi> as <hi>formerly.</hi> For the <hi>Archetypall Moone</hi> which is placed in the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <q>That is: In the Beginning of the Creation of the world God did descend, and cohabitat with Things here below, and when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Habitation was here below, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth were found to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Vital Springs and Chanels were in their perfection, and did flow from the Superior to the Inferior World, and God was found to fill all Things both Above, and Beneath.

                  <hi>Because thou hast eaten of the Tree, whereof I commanded I hee saying, Thou shalt not eate of it: Cursed is the Ground for thy sake, in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row shalt thou eate of it all the Dayes of thy Life, Thornes and Thistles shall it bring forth unto Thee, and Thou shalt eate the Herb of the Field. In the sweat of thy face shalt Thou eate Bread, untill thou returne unto the Ground, for out of it wast thou taken, for Dust Thou art, and to Dust shalt thou returne.</hi> This is the <hi>Curse,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> was so sensible of it, that he <hi>acquainted</hi> his <hi>posterity</hi> with it.

                  <hi>work, and Toyle of our Hands, because of the Ground, which the Lord hath cursed.</hi> And this indeed was accomplished in some sense after the Floud, as the same Scripture tells us. <hi>And</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 8. v. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord said in his Heart, I will not Againe curse the Ground any more for Mans sake.</hi> Here now we are to consider two Things:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115898:25"/>
First, The <hi>Curse</hi> it self, and next the <hi>Latitude</hi> of it. To manifest the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Curse,</hi> and what it was, you must know, that <hi>Good</hi> essentially is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Evill</hi> is <hi>Darknes.</hi> The <hi>Evill</hi> properly is a <hi>Corruption</hi> that immediatly takes place upon the <hi>Removall</hi> of that which is <hi>Good.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> having removed his <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> from the <hi>Elements,</hi> presently the <hi>Darknes</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> of the <hi>Matter</hi> praevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, so that the <hi>Earth</hi> was neerer her <hi>first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie,</hi> and by Consequence lesse <hi>fruitfull</hi> and <hi>Vitall. Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> that is <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darknes,</hi> are the <hi>two Extremes</hi> which Consummat <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill.</hi> But there are some <hi>mean Blessings</hi> which are but, <hi>in ordine,</hi> or disposing to <hi>Heaven,</hi> which is their <hi>last per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and such were <hi>these Blessings,</hi> which God recalled upon the Transgression of the first Man. Againe there are some <hi>Evills,</hi> which are but <hi>'Degrees</hi> conducing to their <hi>last Extremitie,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> and such was this <hi>Curse</hi> or <hi>Evill,</hi> which succeeded the Transgression. Thus our Saviour under these <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> and <hi>Cursed</hi> comprehends the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darknes: Come you Blessed, and Goe you Cursed.</hi> In a word then, The <hi>Curse</hi> was Nothing else but an <hi>Act repealed,</hi> or a <hi>Restraint</hi> of those <hi>Blessings</hi> which <hi>God</hi> of his meer <hi>Goodnes,</hi> had <hi>formerly communicated</hi> to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115898:25"/>
his <hi>Creatures:</hi> And thus I conceive there is a very faire and full <hi>Harmonie</hi> between <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Cabalists.</hi> But to omit their Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though great and high, we are not to seek in this point <hi>for</hi> the <hi>Testimonie</hi> of an <hi>Angel.</hi> For the <hi>Tutor</hi> of <hi>Esdras,</hi> amongst his other Mysterious Instructions, hath also this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <note place="margin">Cap. 7. V. 11, 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>When Adam transgressed my Statutes, then was that decreed, which now is done. Then were the Entrances of this World made Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, full of sorrow, and Travell: They are but few and Evill, full of perils, and very painfull. But the Entrances of the Elder World, were wide and sure, and brought forth Immortal Fruit.</hi> Thus much for the <hi>Curse</hi> it self: Now for the <hi>Latitude</hi> of it, It is true that it was intended <hi>Chiefely</hi> for <hi>Man,</hi> who was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Cause</hi> of it, but <hi>Extended</hi> to the <hi>Elements</hi> in <hi>Order</hi> to him, and <hi>for his sake.</hi> For if God had excluded him from <hi>Eden,</hi> and Continued the <hi>Earth</hi> in her <hi>Primitive Glories,</hi> he had but turned him out of <hi>one Paradise</hi> into <hi>Another,</hi> wherefore he fits the <hi>Dungeon</hi> to the <hi>Slave,</hi> and sends a <hi>Corruptible Man</hi> into <hi>a Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible World.</hi> But in Truth it was not <hi>Man,</hi> nor the <hi>Earth</hi> alone that suffered in this <hi>Curse,</hi> but all other <hi>Creatures</hi> also; For saith God to the Serpent, <hi>Thou art Cursed above all Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and above every Beast of the Field,</hi> so that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115898:26"/>
Cattel <hi>and</hi> Beasts also <hi>were</hi> cursed <hi>in</hi> some measure, <hi>but this</hi> Serpent above <hi>Them all. To this also agrees the</hi> Apostle <hi>in his</hi> Epistle <hi>to the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 8. v. 20.</note> Romans, <hi>where he hath these words.</hi> For the Creature was made subject to Vanitie, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but by Reason of him, who hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the same in hope. Because the Creature it self also, shall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, into the Glorious Liberty of the Children of God. <hi>Here by the</hi> Creature <hi>he understands not</hi> Man, <hi>but the</hi> inferior species, <hi>which he distinguisheth from the</hi> Children <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>though he allows them</hi> both <hi>the</hi> same Liberty. <hi>But this is more plaine out of the subsequent Texts, where he makes a clear</hi> Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <hi>between</hi> Man, <hi>and the</hi> whole Creation. For we know (<hi>saith he</hi>) that the whole Creation groaneth, and travaileth together in paine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now. And not only They, but our selves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, which have the first fruits of the spirit, even we our selves groane within our selves, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our Body. <hi>Here we see the</hi> first Fruits <hi>of the</hi> spirit, <hi>referred to</hi> Man, <hi>and why not some</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond subordinat fruits of it <hi>to the</hi> Creatures in General? <hi>for as they were</hi> cursed <hi>in the</hi> Fall <hi>of</hi> Man, <hi>for</hi> Man's sake, <hi>so it seems in his</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution <hi>they shall be also</hi> blessed <hi>for</hi> his sake. <hi>But of this enough. Let us now summe up and</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:115898:26"/>
consider the <hi>several inconveniences</hi> our first <hi>Parent</hi> was <hi>Subject</hi> to, for they will be of some use with us hereafter. First of all, he was <hi>eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> from the <hi>presence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>exposed</hi> to the <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Tentations</hi> of the <hi>Devill.</hi> He was <hi>altered</hi> from <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>Bad,</hi> from <hi>Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> to <hi>Corruptible: In the Day</hi> (saith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) <hi>Thou eatest thereof, Thou shalt dye the Death.</hi> He was excluded from a <hi>glorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radyse,</hi> and confin'd to a <hi>base world,</hi> whose <hi>sickly infected Elements</hi> conspiring with his <hi>own Nature,</hi> did assist and hasten that <hi>Death,</hi> which already began to reign in his <hi>Body.</hi> Heaven did mourn over him, The Earth, and all her Generations about him. He look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself as a <hi>Felon,</hi> and a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>guilty</hi> of that <hi>Curse</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> which succeeded in the <hi>world</hi> because of his <hi>fall,</hi> as we have sufficiently proved out of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall</hi> and <hi>Cabalisticall</hi> Traditions. He was <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and therefore <hi>hopeles</hi> of <hi>Life aeternal,</hi> and for this <hi>Temporal present Life,</hi> he was not acquainted with the <hi>Provisions</hi> of it. The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements</hi> of <hi>Husbandrie</hi> were not as yet known, there was neither House nor Plow, nor any of those manuall Arts, which make up a <hi>worldly providence.</hi> He was exposed to the Violence of Rains and Winds, Frosts and Snows, and in a word deprived of all Comforts <hi>Spiritual,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:115898:27"/>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115898:27"/>
indeed are very high in the <hi>Point,</hi> and thus they deliver themselves. God (say they) having made fast the <hi>Doores</hi> of his <hi>Paradyse,</hi> and turn'd out <hi>Adam,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Dearest</hi> of his <hi>Creatures,</hi> did notwithstanding the <hi>Present Punishment,</hi> retaine his <hi>former Affection</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him still. For <hi>God</hi> is said to <hi>love</hi> his <hi>Creatures</hi> not that there is any thing <hi>lovely</hi> in <hi>Them</hi> without their <hi>Creator,</hi> but in that hee <hi>desires</hi> their <hi>perfection:</hi> That is to say he would have <hi>them Conformable</hi> to <hi>himself,</hi> and <hi>fitt</hi> to receive his <hi>Image</hi> or <hi>Similitude,</hi> which is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Impress</hi> of his <hi>Beauty.</hi> Now to restore this <hi>Similitude</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> was impossible unlesse <hi>God</hi> should <hi>reassume</hi> that to <hi>himself</hi> which was now fallen <hi>from</hi> him. So transcendent, and almost incredible a Mercie had God trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd up in his <hi>secret Will,</hi> being resolved to <hi>unite</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> to his <hi>Own,</hi> and so vindicat him from <hi>Death,</hi> by taking him into the <hi>Deitie,</hi> which is the true <hi>Fountain</hi> and <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>Life.</hi> This <hi>Will</hi> (say the <hi>Cabalists</hi>) was first revealed to the <hi>Angels,</hi> and that by <hi>God himself</hi> in these words; <hi>Ecce Adam sicut unus</hi>

which God had with the blessed Angels in the Inner-Chambers of Heaven. Now that the same Scripture should speak one thing in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and another in the <hi>Mysterie,</hi> is not strange to mee, how difficult soever it may seem to another. For verily this Text may not concern the <hi>first Adam,</hi> who knowing Evill by <hi>Committing it,</hi> could not be <hi>like God</hi> in respect of <hi>that Knowledge,</hi> which made him <hi>sinfull,</hi> and altogether <hi>unlike him.</hi> For God (if I may so expresse it) knows the <hi>Evill</hi> onely <hi>speculatively,</hi> in asmuch as <hi>nothing can escape his Knowledge,</hi> and therefore is not <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>Evill:</hi> For as <hi>Tritemius</hi> hath well observed, <hi>Scientia Mali non est Malum, sed usus;</hi> The <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>Evill</hi> is not <hi>Evill,</hi> but the <hi>practice</hi> of it. It remains then, that this Speech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the <hi>Second Adam, Christ Jesus,</hi> who <hi>knew</hi> the <hi>Evill,</hi> but did not <hi>commit</hi> it, and therefore was <hi>like one of us,</hi> that is like <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> knowing <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill,</hi> and yet no way <hi>guiltie</hi> of the <hi>Evill.</hi> This primitive and Compendious <hi>Gospell</hi> was no sooner imparted to the <hi>Angels,</hi> but they became <hi>Ministers</hi> of it, the <hi>Law</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>being ordained in their hands,</hi> till <hi>Christ</hi> should take it into <hi>his own</hi> and their <hi>Administration to Man</hi> took Beginning with this <hi>Oracle.</hi> Thus (say the <hi>Cabalists</hi>) <hi>Raziel</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> was presently
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115898:28"/>
dispatch'd to communicat the <hi>Intelligence</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to acquaint him with the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of both <hi>world, AEternall,</hi> and <hi>Temporall.</hi> For as he could not obtain the <hi>Blessings</hi> of the <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall World,</hi> unless by a <hi>true faith</hi> hee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the <hi>Three AEternall Principles</hi> of it, so neither could he fully injoy the <hi>benefits</hi> of this <hi>Temporall World,</hi> unless hee truly <hi>understood</hi> the <hi>Three Visible substances</hi> whereof it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists. For there are <hi>Three above,</hi> and <hi>Three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, Three</hi> (as St. <hi>John</hi> saith) <hi>in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Three</hi> on <hi>Earth;</hi> The <hi>Inferior</hi> bear witness of the <hi>Superior,</hi> and are their only <hi>proper Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> They are <hi>Signatures</hi> and <hi>Created Books,</hi> where wee may reade the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Trinitie.</hi> But to proceed in our former Discourse: The <hi>Cabalists</hi> doe not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attribute a <hi>Guardian</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> but to every one of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> allowing Them their <hi>Praesidents</hi> and <hi>Tutors</hi> both to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi> Them in their wearisome and worldly <hi>Peregrinations.</hi> A <hi>Doctrine</hi> in my Opinion not more <hi>Religious</hi> than <hi>Necessary,</hi> how Prodigious soever it may seem to some Phantastic, insiped <hi>Theologicians.</hi> For Certainly it is impossible for us to find out Mysteries of our selves, wee must either have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his <hi>Ministers,</hi> whereher they bee <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Angels.</hi> And thus wee see out of the

                  <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> how their <hi>Cabala,</hi> and our <hi>Magic</hi> came first into the world.

               <p>The first <hi>Harvest</hi> I read of, was that of <hi>Cain,</hi> and the first <hi>Flocks,</hi> those of <hi>Abel.</hi> A Shepheards life in those Early Dayes was no difficult Profession, it being an Imployment of more <hi>Care,</hi> than <hi>Art,</hi> but how the Earth was plow'd up before the sound of <hi>Tubal's</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, is a piece of Husbandrie unknown in these Dayes. Howsoever it was a Labour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and not without Retribution. <hi>Cain</hi> hath his <hi>Sheaves,</hi> as well as <hi>Abel</hi> his <hi>Lambs:</hi> both of them receive, and both acknowledge the Benefit. I find established in these <hi>Two</hi> a certain <hi>Priesthood,</hi> they attend both to the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>first Bloud</hi> was shed by <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> by <hi>Murther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now so dull am I, and so short of <hi>Syllogismes,</hi> those strange <hi>Pumps,</hi> and <hi>Hydragogues,</hi> which lave the <hi>Truthex Puteo,</hi> like <hi>Water,</hi> that all my <hi>Reason</hi> cannot make these Men <hi>Levits</hi> without <hi>Revelation.</hi> For I desire to know how came they first to <hi>Sacrifise,</hi> and by whom were they <hi>initiated?</hi> If you will say, by <hi>Adam:</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:115898:29"/>
The Question indeed is deferr'd, but not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed For I would know further In what <hi>Schoole</hi> was <hi>Adam</hi> instructed? Now that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to invent these <hi>Shadowes</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> of himself, I will undertake to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate and that by invincible Reason, which no Adversarie shall dare to contradict.</p>
               <p>It is most certain that the <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi> of Man in Matters of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> consist in the <hi>Thing signisied,</hi> and not in the <hi>Signe</hi> it self. For the Material Corruptible <hi>shadow</hi> is not the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> but the Spiritual, aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Prototype,</hi> which answers to it, and makes the dead figure <hi>Effectual.</hi> The <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the Old <hi>Testament,</hi> and the <hi>Elements</hi> of the <hi>New,</hi> can be no way <hi>acceptable</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> but inaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they have a <hi>Relation</hi> to <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who is the great, perfect <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered up once for all. It is plain then that <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were <hi>first instituted</hi> upon <hi>supernatural grounds,</hi> for <hi>in Nature</hi> there is no reason to be found, why <hi>God</hi> should be <hi>pleased</hi> with the <hi>Death</hi> of his <hi>Creatures.</hi> Nay the very <hi>Contrary</hi> is written in that <hi>Book,</hi> for <hi>Death</hi> both <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Violent</hi> proceeds not from the <hi>pleasure,</hi> but from the <hi>displeasure</hi> of the <hi>Creator.</hi> I know the learned <hi>Alkind</hi> builds the <hi>efficacie</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> on <hi>a Sympathie</hi> of parts with the <hi>great world;</hi> for there is in every Animal a portion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115898:30"/>
of the <hi>star-fire;</hi> which <hi>fire</hi> upon the Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Compound is united to the <hi>General fire</hi> from whence it first came, and produceth a <hi>sense,</hi> or <hi>Motion</hi> in the <hi>Limbus</hi> to which it is <hi>united.</hi> This indeed is true, but that <hi>Motion</hi> causeth no <hi>Joy</hi> there, and by Consequence no <hi>Reward</hi> to the <hi>Sacrificer:</hi> for I shall make it to appeare elsewhere that the <hi>Astral</hi> Mother doth <hi>mourn,</hi> and not <hi>rejoyce</hi> at the <hi>Death</hi> of her <hi>Children.</hi> Now if wee look back on these <hi>two first Sacrificers,</hi> we shall find <hi>Abel</hi> and his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> accepted, which could not be, had he not offerr'd it up as a <hi>Symbol,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of his <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> To drive home my Argument then, I say, that this knowledge of the <hi>Type,</hi> in <hi>whom</hi> all <hi>offerings</hi> were <hi>acceptable,</hi> could not bee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any <hi>humane Industrie,</hi> but by <hi>sole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> For the <hi>Passion</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> was an <hi>Ordinance</hi> wrapt up in the <hi>secret will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and he that would know it, must of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie bee of <hi>his Councell.</hi> Hence it is called in Scripture the <hi>Hidden Mysterie,</hi> for the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of it, was not to bee received from any, but onely from <hi>him,</hi> who had both the <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>ordain</hi> it. But if you will tell mee (like the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Praedicables</hi>) that men sacrifised at first by the <hi>Instinct</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and without any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Porphyr. de Sacrif.</note> to the <hi>Type,</hi> I shal indeed thank you for my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115898:30"/>
mirth, whensoever you give mee so just a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to laugh. It remains then a most <hi>firme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Foundation</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was first <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed</hi> concerning the <hi>Passion,</hi> and in <hi>order</hi> to <hi>that,</hi> he was <hi>taught</hi> further, to <hi>Sacrifise,</hi> and offer up the <hi>Blouds</hi> of <hi>Beasts</hi> as <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droms</hi> of the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> the <hi>Altars</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> being but <hi>steps</hi> to the <hi>Cross</hi> of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> Now if it be objected that severall Nations have sacrifised, who did not know God at all, much less the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>Prototype</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of all <hi>Oblations:</hi> To this I answer, that the <hi>Custome</hi> of <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing</hi> was <hi>communicated</hi> to <hi>Heathens</hi> by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> from the <hi>first Man:</hi> who having instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his own <hi>Children,</hi> they also delivered it to their <hi>Posteritie,</hi> so that this <hi>Vizard</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> remained, thought the <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of it was lost. And thus in my Opinion it sufficiently appears, that the first men did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifise, not by <hi>Nature</hi> as <hi>Prophrrius</hi> that Enc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of our Religion would have it, but some by <hi>Revelation,</hi> others by <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>Tradition.</hi> But now I think upon it, I have Scripture to confirme me concerning this <hi>Primitive Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> for <hi>Salomon</hi> numbring those <hi>serverall Blessings</hi> which the <hi>Divine Wisdome</hi> imparted to the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> amongst the rest speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies her <hi>Indulgence</hi> to <hi>Adam.

(saith hee) <hi>the first formed Father of the world, that was created alone, and brought him out of his Fall.</hi> Here I find <hi>Adam</hi> in some measure <hi>restored,</hi> and how could that bee, but <hi>by discovering</hi> unto him the <hi>Great Restorative Christ Jesus,</hi> the <hi>second Adam</hi> in <hi>whom</hi> he was to <hi>believe?</hi> for without <hi>Faith</hi> he could not have been <hi>brought out of his Fall,</hi> and without <hi>Christ revealed,</hi> and <hi>preached</hi> unto him, hee could have <hi>no Faith,</hi> for hee knew not <hi>what</hi> to <hi>believe.</hi> It remaines then that hee was <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> for as in these <hi>last dayes</hi> wee are taught by the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi> so in those <hi>first times</hi> they were taught by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>ministring Angels.</hi> These were their <hi>Tutors,</hi> for of them they <hi>heard</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and verily wee are told that <hi>faith</hi> comes by <hi>hearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is now (as I think) sufficiently proved, that <hi>Adam</hi> had his <hi>Metaphysics</hi> from Above: our next Service (and perhaps somewhat diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult) is, to give some probable. if not Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative reasons, that they came not alone but had their <hi>Physics</hi> also to attend them.

Not so my friend: he hath created <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic,</hi> and brings it out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> but the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenist</hi> knowes it not; Hee it is, that pitties our afflictions, he is the good <hi>Samaritane</hi> that doth not pass by us in our miseries, but poures <hi>Oile</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> into <hi>our wounds;</hi> This I know very well and I will prove it out of his own Mouth.

thereof. This Discourse I confesse, is somewhat remote from that I first intended, namely that Philosophie was revealed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> as well as <hi>Divinitie,</hi> but some <hi>Pates</hi> are <hi>Blocks</hi> in their own wayes, and as I told you formerly, will not believe that <hi>God</hi> dispenseth with any <hi>Naturall secrets;</hi> This made mee produce these few <hi>Instances</hi> out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Praeparatives</hi> to the <hi>Proposition</hi> it self, and if hee be any thing <hi>ingenious,</hi> to the <hi>Reader.</hi> His <hi>Compliance</hi> to my <hi>Principles</hi> I expect not, nay I am so far from it, hee may <hi>suspend</hi> his <hi>Charitie.</hi> Let him bee as rigid as Justice can make him, for I wish not to <hi>praevaile</hi> in any thing but the <hi>Truth,</hi> and in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> thus I begin.</p>
               <p>You have been told formerly, that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were instructed in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> by their father <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Cain</hi> having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> his <hi>Priesthood</hi> descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Seth,</hi> and this is confirm'd by those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> which attended his <hi>Posteritie,</hi> for <hi>Enoch, Lamech,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> were (all of them) <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> It troubles you perhaps that I attribute a <hi>Priesthood</hi> to <hi>Abel</hi> but I have besides his own practice, <hi>Christs</hi> Testimonie for it, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts <note place="margin">Luke cap. 11. ver. 15 &amp; Math. 23. 35.</note> the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Abel</hi> amongst <hi>that</hi> of the persecuted <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Wisemen.</hi> Now to conclude that these men had <hi>no Knowledge</hi>

in <hi>Philosophie,</hi> because the <hi>Seripture</hi> doth not <hi>mention</hi> any <hi>use</hi> they made of it, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>denies</hi> something, but <hi>proves</hi> nothing. To shew the vanitie of this Inference, I will give you an <hi>Example</hi> out of <hi>Moses</hi> himself. Wee know very well there are <hi>no Prophecies</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> extant, neither doe wee read any where, that ever hee did <hi>Prophesie,</hi> but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he was a <hi>Prophet.</hi> For God reproving <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> who had taken <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> from him supposing she had been his <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> hath these words; <hi>Now therefore restore <note place="margin">Genel. 20. 7.</note> the Man his Wife, for hee is a Prophet, and hee shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live.</hi> Hence wee may learn, that the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes mention the <hi>secret perfections</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> in the <hi>public Character</hi> of the <hi>Person.</hi> Truly I should not be so impudent, as to expect your assent to this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> if the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were <hi>silent</hi> in every <hi>Text,</hi> if I did not find there some infallible steps of <hi>Magic,</hi> such as may lead me without a <hi>Lanthorn</hi> to the <hi>Archives</hi> of the <hi>Art</hi> it self. I know the <hi>Troup,</hi> and <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult</hi> of other <hi>Affaires</hi> are both the <hi>Many,</hi> and the <hi>Maine</hi> in the <hi>Historie</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> But in the whole <hi>Current,</hi> I meet with some <hi>Acts</hi> which may not be numbred amongst the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> but are <hi>performances extraordinarie,</hi> and speak their <hi>Causes</hi> not <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

                  </hi> Jacob acted by, and to tell him that his hopes were effected. But I shall not insist long on any <hi>particular,</hi> and therefore I will paste from this <hi>Dream</hi> to another. <hi>Joseph</hi> being seventeen years old, an Age of some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, propounds a <hi>Vision</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> not loosly and to no purpose, as wee tell one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of our dreams, but expecting, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, an <hi>Interpretation,</hi> as knowing that his <hi>Father</hi> had the <hi>skill</hi> to <hi>expound</hi> it. The wise <hi>Patriarch</hi> being not <hi>ignorant</hi> of the <hi>Secrets</hi> of the two <hi>Luminaries,</hi> attributes <hi>Males</hi> to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Females</hi> to the <hi>Moon,</hi> then allowes a third <hi>Signification</hi> to the <hi>minor starrs,</hi> and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answers his sonne with a Question: <hi>What is this Dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I, and thy Mother, and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down our selves to thee, to the Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, I think no man will deny but the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of <hi>Dreams</hi> belongs to <hi>Magic.</hi> and hath been ever <hi>sought</hi> after as a <hi>piece</hi> of <hi>secret Learning.</hi> True it is, when the <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> receives his knowledge <hi>immediatly</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, then it falls not within the <hi>Limits</hi> of a <hi>Naturall Science;</hi> but I speak of a <hi>Physicall Exposition</hi> as this was, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on certain <hi>abstruse Similitudes,</hi> for hee

As for <hi>Jacob's</hi> first practice, which wee have formerly mention'd, namely the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation</hi> of his <hi>speckled Flocks,</hi> it is an effect so purely <hi>Magicall</hi> that our most obstinat <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries</hi> dare not Question it. I could cite one place more, which referrs to this <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and points at the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Magic,</hi> but being annex'd to this discourse, it would disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver too much, I shall therefore leave it to the Search of those, who are Considerable Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, if not Masters in the Art. The summ of all is this: Man of himself could not attain to true Knowledge it was God in meer mercie did instruct him. To confirm this, I shall desire the Reader to Consider his own Experience. Wee have in these our dayes many <hi>Magicall Books</hi> extant, wherein the <hi>Art</hi> is discovered both truly, and plainly. Wee have also an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> who studie those books, but after the Indeavours of a long life not one in Ten Thousand understands them. Now if wee with all these <hi>Advantages</hi> cannot attain to the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> shall we think those <hi>first fathers</hi> did, who had none of our <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to assist them, nor any <hi>learned man</hi> upon

Earth to instruct them? Could they doe that <hi>without means,</hi> which wee cannot doe <hi>with means,</hi> and those too <hi>very considerable?</hi> The <hi>Peripaterties</hi> perhaps will tell me their <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism</hi> is the Engine that can perform all this. Let 'em then in <hi>Barbara</hi> or <hi>Baroco</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the <hi>first matter of the Philosopher's</hi> stone. But they will tell mee there is no such thing. Behold I tell them again, and assure them too on my Salvation, <hi>there is,</hi> but in Truth their <hi>Logic</hi> will never find it out.

but not withstanding in those very <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> there remained some <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>first Truth.</hi> Hence comes it to passe, that all parties <hi>agree</hi> in the <hi>Action,</hi> but not in the <hi>Object.</hi> For Example: <hi>Israel</hi> did <hi>Sacrifise,</hi> and the <hi>Heathen</hi> did <hi>Sacrifise,</hi> but the <hi>One to God,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> to his <hi>Idol;</hi> Neither were they onely <hi>Conformable</hi> in some <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of <hi>Divinitie,</hi> but the <hi>Heathens</hi> also had some <hi>Hints</hi> left of the <hi>Secret Learning,</hi> and <hi>Philosophie</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> as wee may see in their <hi>false Magic,</hi> which consisted for the most part in <hi>Astrologicall Observations, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, Charmes,</hi> and <hi>Characters.</hi> But it is my Designe to keep in the <hi>Rode,</hi> not to follow these <hi>Deviations,</hi> and <hi>misfortunes</hi> of the <hi>Art,</hi> which notwithstanding want not the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>Argument,</hi> the <hi>Existence</hi> of Things being <hi>proved</hi> as well by their <hi>Miscariage,</hi> as by their <hi>Successe.</hi> To proceed then, I say, that during the <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> this <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> was delivered by tradition from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to his <hi>Child,</hi> and indeed it could be no otherwise, for what was <hi>Israel</hi> in those Dayes, but a <hi>privat Familie?</hi> Notwithstanding when God appointed them their Possession, and that this <hi>private house</hi> was multiplied to a <hi>Nation,</hi> then these <hi>secrets</hi> remained with the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Tribes,</hi> as they did formerly with the <hi>Father</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:115898:39"/>
of the <hi>Familie.</hi> These <hi>Elders,</hi> no doubt, were the Moysaicall <hi>Septuagint,</hi> who made up the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> God having Selected some from the rest, to be the <hi>stewards,</hi> and <hi>Dispensers</hi> of his <hi>Mysteries.</hi> Now that <hi>Moses</hi> was acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the <hi>abstruse Operations,</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> is a Truth I suppose which no man will resist. That the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated of the same Instruction and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with him is plain out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> where wee read, That <hi>God took of the spirit that</hi>

                  <hi>was in Moses, and gave it to the Seventy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But lest any Man should deny that, which wee take for granted. namely the <hi>Philosophie</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> I shall demonstrate out of his own Books, both by <hi>reason,</hi> as also by his <hi>practice,</hi> that hee was a <hi>Natural Magician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First of all then it is most absurd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore improbable, that hee should <hi>write</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> who was no way skill'd in the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> both which must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie be known before wee should undertake to write of the <hi>Creation.</hi> But <hi>Moses</hi> did write of it, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Now I desire to know what hee hath written, <hi>Truth</hi> or a <hi>Lie;</hi> if <hi>Truth,</hi> how dare you denie his <hi>Knowledge?</hi> if a <hi>Lie</hi> (which God forbid) why will you <hi>believe him?</hi> You will tell mee perhaps he hath done it onely in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Termes:</hi> and I could tell you that <hi>Aristotle</hi>

hath done no otherwise: but think you in good earnest that hee <hi>knew</hi> no more, than what hee did <hi>write?</hi> There is nothing you can say in this point, but wee can disprove it, for in <hi>Genesis</hi> he hath discovered many particulars, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those <hi>Secrets</hi> which have most <hi>Relation</hi> to this <hi>Art.</hi> For Instance; hee hath Discovered the <hi>Minera of Man,</hi> or that <hi>Substance</hi> out of which <hi>Man,</hi> and all his <hi>fellow-Creatures</hi> were <hi>made.</hi> This is the first <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers stone: Moses</hi> calls it sometimes <hi>Water,</hi> sometimes <hi>Earth;</hi> for in a certain place I read. thus; <hi>And God said, Let the waters bring</hi>

This is the true <hi>Damascen Earth,</hi> out of which <hi>God</hi> made man: you then that would be <hi>Chimists,</hi> seem not to be <hi>wiser</hi> than <hi>God,</hi> but use that <hi>subiect</hi> in your <hi>Art.</hi> which <hi>God</hi> himself makes use of in <hi>Nature.</hi> He is the best <hi>workman,</hi> and knowes what <hi>matter</hi> is most <hi>fit</hi> for his <hi>work,</hi> hee that will imitate him in the Effect, must first imitate him in the Subject.

I shall now speak of his <hi>Practice,</hi> and truly this is it which no <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> nor any other <hi>Logicall Quibble</hi> can wave, nothing but <hi>Experience</hi> can refell this <hi>Argument,</hi> and thus it runs. <hi>And Moses took the Calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and grinded it to powder, and strew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it vpon the water, and made the Children of Israel drink of it.</hi> Certainly here was a strange kind of <hi>Spice,</hi> and an <hi>Art</hi> as strange as the

                  <hi>Spice</hi> it self.

I am sure here was <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> could never have brought the <hi>Calf</hi> to this passe had he not plowed with our <hi>Heyfer.</hi> But of this enough: if any man think hee did it by <hi>common fire,</hi> let him also doe the like, and when he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, hee may sell his powder to the <hi>Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> If I should insist in this place on the <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall Ceremoniall Law</hi> with its severall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>shadows</hi> and their <hi>Significations;</hi> I might lose my self in a <hi>Wilderness</hi> of <hi>Mysteries</hi> both <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Naturall;</hi> For verily that whole <hi>System</hi> is but one <hi>vast Skreen,</hi> or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Majestic Umbrage</hi> drawne over <hi>two Worlds, Visible,</hi> and <hi>Invisible.</hi> But these are things of a higher speculation than the Scope of our present Discourse will admit of.

Now when the <hi>Cabalist</hi> speaks of the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Three Mothers,</hi> he brings in <hi>Ten secret Principles,</hi> which I think ten men have not understood since the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> such Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence doe I find in most Authors, when they undertake to discourse of them. The <hi>first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> which sits <hi>in Retrocessu suo fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano,</hi> in his primitive, Incomprehensible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, like <hi>Water</hi> in its <hi>Subterraneous Chanel,</hi> before it <hi>springs.</hi> The <hi>Second Principle</hi> is the <hi>Voice</hi> of that <hi>first Spirit,</hi> this breaks forth like a <hi>Well-spring,</hi> where the <hi>Water flowes</hi> out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and is <hi>discovered</hi> to the <hi>eye,</hi> They call
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115898:43"/>
it <hi>Spiritus ex Spiritu.</hi> The <hi>third Principle</hi> is <hi>Spiritus ex Spiritibus,</hi> a <hi>Spirit</hi> which <hi>proceeds</hi> both from the <hi>first Spirit,</hi> and from his <hi>Voice.</hi> The <hi>Fourth Principle</hi> is <hi>Aqua de Spiritu,</hi> a <hi>Certain Water</hi> which proceeded from the <hi>Third Spirit,</hi> and out of that <hi>Water</hi> went <hi>Aire</hi> and <hi>Fire.</hi> But God forbid that I should speak any more of them publickly, it is enough that wee Know the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> and to <hi>whom</hi> wee ought to <hi>ascribe</hi> it. The <hi>Cabalist</hi> when hee would tell us what <hi>God</hi> did with the <hi>Three Mothers,</hi> useth no other phrase than this, <hi>Ponderavit Aleph cum omnibus, &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia cum Aleph, &amp; sic de Singulis,</hi> He weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (saith he) <hi>Aleph</hi> with All, and All with <hi>Aleph,</hi> and so he did with the other <hi>Mothers.</hi> This is very plain, if you consider the <hi>various mixtures</hi> of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and their <hi>Secret Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions.</hi> And so much for the <hi>Physicall part</hi> of the <hi>Cabala,</hi> I will now shew you the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicall.</hi> It is strange to Consider what <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> there is amongst all the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Wisdom.</hi> This proves infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that there is an <hi>Universall Schoole-master,</hi> who is <hi>Present</hi> with all <hi>Flesh,</hi> and whose <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> are ever <hi>Uniforme,</hi> namely the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Cabalists</hi> agree with all the world of <hi>Magicians,</hi> That <hi>Man</hi> in spirituall Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is both <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Patient.</hi> This is plain:

it the Testimonies of <hi>Thomas Obecinus,</hi> a most learned <hi>Franciscan,</hi> and <hi>Petrus a Valle,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who travailed both of them into those parts. Now that the learning of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> I mean their <hi>Cabala,</hi> was <hi>Chimicall,</hi> and ended in true <hi>Physicall performances,</hi> cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proved than by the <hi>Booke</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> wherein hee layd down the <hi>Secrets</hi> of this <hi>Art</hi> in Indifferent plaine Termes and Figures, and that for the Benefit of his unhappy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, when by the wrath of God they were scattered over all the World. This <hi>Book</hi> was accidentally found by <hi>Nicholas Flammel</hi> a <hi>French-man,</hi> and with the help of it hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at last to that <hi>miraculous Medicine,</hi> which Men call the <hi>Philosophers stone.</hi> But let us hear the <hi>Monsieur</hi> himself describe it.</p>
               <p>There fell into my hands (<hi>saith he</hi>) for the Summ of two Florens, a gilded Book, very old, and large; It was not of Paper, nor Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as other books bee, but it was made of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate rindes (as it seemed to mee) of Tender young Trees: The Cover of it was of Brasse, well bound, all ingraven with Letters, or strange figures, and for my part, I think they might well bee Greek Characters, or some such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient language. Sure I am, I could not read them, and I know well they were not Notes, nor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115898:45"/>
Letters of the Latine, nor of the Gaule, for of them I understood a little. As for that which was within it, the Bark leaves were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven, and with admirable diligence written, with a point of Jron in faire and neat Latin letters coloured. It contained thrice Seven leaves for so were the leaves counted at the top and alwayes every Seventh leafe was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any writing, but instead thereof upon the first seventh leaf there was painted a Virgin, and Serpents swallowing her up; In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Seventh a Crosse where a Serpent was Crucified; and in the last Seventh there were painted Deserts, or Wildernesses, in the middest whereof ran many faire Fountains from whence there issued forth a Number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, which ran up and down here and there. Upon the first of the Leaves was written in great Capitall letters of gold ABRAHAM THE JEW, PRINCE PRIEST LEVIT, ASTROLOGER, AND PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHER, TO THE NATION OF THE JEWES, BY THE WRATH OF GOD DISPERSED AMONG THE GAULES SENDETH HEALTH.</p>
               <p>After this it was filled with great Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, and Curses (with this word Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha, which was often repeated there) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115898:46"/>
every person that should cast his eyes upon it, if hee were not Sacrificer or Scribe. Hee that sold me this Booke, knew not what it was worth, no more than I, when I bought it. I believe it had been stolne or taken by violence from the miserable Jewes, or found hid in some part of the Ancient place of their Habitation. Within the Booke, in the Second leafe hee comforted his Nation, counselling them to fly Vices, and above all Idolatrie, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with sweet patience the Comming of the Messiah, who should vanquish all the Kings of the Earth, and should reigne with his people in glorie aeternally. Without doubt this had been some wise, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man. In the third leafe, and in all the other writings that followed to help his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nation to pay their Tributes to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours, and to doe other things, which I will not speak of, hee taught them in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon words the Transmutation of Mettals; hee painted the Vessels by the sides and hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them of the Colours, and of all the rest, except the first Agent of the which he spake not a word but onely (as he said) in the fourth and fifth leaves he had iutirely painted it, and figured it with very great Cunning and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship: for though it was well, and Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115898:46"/>
figured and painted yet no man could ever have been able to understand it, without being well skill'd in their Cabala, which goeth by Tradition and without having well studied their Bookes. The Fourth and fifth leafe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was without any writing all full of faire Figures inlightned or as it were inlightned, for the work was very Exquisit. First hee painted a young man, with wings at his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles having in his hand a Caducean Rod wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then about with two Serpents, wherewith hee strooke upon a Helmet which covered his head; hee seemed to my small judgement to be <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi> the Pagan Gad. Against him there came running, and flying with open wings, a great old man, who upon his head had an Houre-glasse fastned, and in his hands a Hooke or Sithe like Death, with the which in terrible and furicus Maner, he would have cut off the feet of <hi>Mercurie.</hi> On the other side of the fourth Leafe, hee painted a faire Flower on the top of a very high Mountaine, which was sore shaken with the North wind; it had the Root blew the Flowers white and red, the leaves shining like fine Gold; And round about it the Dragons and Grisfons of the North made their nests. On the Fifth leafe shere was a faire Rose tree flowred in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115898:47"/>
of a Sweet Garden, climbing up against a hollow Oake, at the foot whereof boyled a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of most white water, which ran headlong down into the Depths, notwithstanding it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed first among the hands of infinite people, who digged in the Earth, seeking for it; but because they were blind, none of them knew it, except here and there One, which considered the weight. On the last side of the fife leafe, was painted a King, with a great Faucheon, who caused to bee kill'd in his presence by some Souldiours a great Multitude of little Infants, whose Mothers wept at the Feet of the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Souldiours. The Bloud of these Infants was afterwards gathered up by other Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and put in a great vessell, whereto the Sun and the Moone came to bathe themselves. And thus you see that which was in the first five leaves; I will not represent unto you that which was writien in good and Intelligible La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin in all the other written leaves, for God would punish mee because I should commit a greater wickednesse than he, who (as it is sayd) wished that all the men of thn world had but one head, that hee might cut it off at one Blow. Thus farre <hi>Nicholas Flammel.</hi>

I could now passe from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> from the <hi>Old Testament</hi> to the <hi>New:</hi> not that I would interpret there, but request the Sense or the Illuminated.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115898:48"/>

               </p>
               <p>That is: <hi>A stone erected to the praise, and aeternal Remembrance of the Law of Light, and Truth, brought out of Judaea, and published in China.</hi> After this followed the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Monument,</hi> being a <hi>Relation,</hi> how the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> was brought by one <hi>Olo puen</hi> out of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and afterwards by the assistance of God planted in <hi>China.</hi> This happened in the yeare of our Lord six hundred, and thirtie six. <hi>Kim Cim,</hi> the Author of this <hi>Historie,</hi> in the very beginning of it, speaks <hi>mysteriously</hi> of the <hi>Creation;</hi> Then he mentions three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sixty five <hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who succeeded one another, all of them striving who should get most <hi>Proselyts.</hi> Some of their vaine <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> he recites, which indeed are very <hi>suitable with the Rudiments,</hi> and <hi>Vagari's</hi> of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi>

                  <hi>Philosophers.</hi> Lastly he describes the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi> of <hi>Christianitie,</hi> with their <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Excellencie</hi> of their <hi>Law.

To be short, <hi>Olo puen</hi> was admitted to the Court by <hi>Tai cum veu huamti</hi> King of <hi>China,</hi> here his Doctrine was thoroughly sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, examin'd, and sifted by the King himself, who having found it most true and solid, caus'd it to be proclam'd thorough his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Now upon what this <hi>Doctrine</hi> was <hi>founded,</hi> and what <hi>aestimat</hi> the <hi>King</hi> had both of it, and it's <hi>professor,</hi> we may easily gather from the <hi>words</hi> of his <hi>Proclamation.</hi> First then, where he mentions <hi>Olo puen,</hi> he calls him <hi>Magnae virtutis Hominem,</hi> a man of great virtue or power; it seems he did something more than prate and preach, could confirme his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> did theirs, not with <hi>words</hi> only, but with <hi>works.</hi> Secondly the Proclamation speaking of his Doctrine,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115898:49"/>
runs thus, <hi>Cujus intentum docendi nos a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentis examinantes, invenimus Doctrinam ejus admodum excellentem, &amp; sine strepitu ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriori, fundatam principaliter in Creatione Mundi:</hi> That is, The Drift of whose tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching we have examin'd from the very Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, we find his Doctrine very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, without any worldly noyse, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded on the Creation of the world. And againe in the same place, <hi>Doctrina ejus non est multorum verborum, nec supersicie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus suam fundat Veritatem:</hi> His Doctrine is but of few words, not full of <hi>noyse</hi> and <hi>notions,</hi> neither doth he build his Truth on <hi>superficial probabilities.</hi> Thus we see, the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> (which to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Philosopher are fables and Impossibilities, but in the <hi>Booke</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> plaine evident <hi>Truths</hi>) were proved, and demonstrated by the <hi>Primitive Apostles</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> out of the <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>world.</hi> But instead of such Teachers, we have in These our Dayes <hi>two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical Goblins,</hi> a <hi>Schoole-Man,</hi> and a <hi>Saint</hi> forsooth.

I am a Goddesse (<hi>saith hee, speaking in the person of Nature</hi>) for Beauty and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction famous, born out of our own proper Sea, which compasseth the whole Earth, and is ever restlesse. Out of my Breasts I poure forth Milk and Bloud; Boyle these two, till they are turned into Silver and Gold. O most excellent Subject! out of which all things in this world are generated, though at the first sight thou art Poyson, adorn'd with the name of the <unclear>flying</unclear> Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. Thou art the first Matter, the seed of Divine Benediction, in whose Body there is Heat and Rain, which notwithstanding are hidden from the wicked, because of thy Habit, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin vestures which is scatter'd over all the world. Thy Parents are the Sun and Moone, in Thee there is Water and Wine, Gold also and Silver upon Earth, that mortall man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. After this manner God sends us his Blessing and Wisdome with Raine, and the Beams of the Sun, to the eternall Glory of his Name. But consider ô Man, what Things God bestows upon thee by this means. Torture the Eagle till shee weeps, and the Lion bee weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and bleed to death. The Bloud of this Lion incorporated with the Teares of the Eagle, is the Treasure of the Earth. These Creatures use to devoure and kill one another, but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their love is mutuall, and they put on the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115898:69"/>
Proprietie, and Nature of a Salamander, which, if it remains in the fire without any detriment it cures all the Diseases of Men, Beasts and Metals. After that the Ancient Philosophers had perfectly understood this Subject, they diligently sought in this Mysterie for the Center of the Middlemost Tree in the Terrestrial Paradyse, entring in by Five liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Gates. The first Gate was the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true Matter, and here arose the first, and that a most bitter Conflict. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was the Praeparation by which this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was to bee praepared, that they might obtain the Embers of the Eagle, and the Bloud of the Lyon. At this Gate there is a most sharp fight, for it produceth water and bloud, and a Spirituall bright Body. The Third Gate is the Fire, which conduceth to the Maturitie of the Medicine. The Fourth Gate is that of Multiplication and Augmentation in which Proportions and Weights are Necessarie. The fifth and last Gate is Projection. But most glorious, full rich, and high is hee who attains to the fourth Gate, for hee hath got an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Medicine for all Diseases. This is that great Character of the Book of Nature, out of which her whole Alphabet doth arise.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115898:70"/>
The fifth gate serves onely for Metals. This Mysterie existing from the Foundation of the World, and the Creation of <hi>Adam</hi> is of all others the most ancient, a knowledge which God Almighty by his Word breathed into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a miraculous power, the blessed fire of Life, the Transparent Carbuncle, and red Gold of the Wise men, and the Divine Benediction of this life. But this mysterie, because of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and wickednesse of men, is given onely to few, notwithstanding it lives, and moves every day in the sight of the whole world, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the following parable. I am a poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Dragon, present every where, and to bee had for nothing. My water and my fire dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve and Compound; out of my body thou shalt draw the Green, and the Red Lyon: but if thou doest not exactly know mee, thou wilt with my Fire destroy thy five Senses. A most perniei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quick poyson comes out of my Nostrils, which hath been the Destruction of many. Separate therefore the Thick from the Thin artificially, unlesse thou dost delight in extreme Povertie. I give thee faculties both Male and Female and the Powers both of Heaven and Earth. The Mysteries of my Art are to bee performed magnanimously, and with great
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115898:70"/>
Courage, if thou wouldest have mee overcome the Violence of the Fire, in which Attempt many have lost both their Labour and their Substance. I am the Egg of Nature known onely to the Wise, such as are pious and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, who make of mee a little world. Ordain'd I was by the All-mighty God for men, but (though many desire mee) I am given onely to few that they may relieve the poore with my Treasures, and not set their mindes on Gold that perisheth. I am call'd of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers <hi>Mercurie:</hi> my husband is Gold (Philosophicall.) I am the old Dragon that is present every where on the face of the Earth; I am Father and Mother; Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and Ancient; weak and yet most strong; Life and Death; Visible and Invisible; Hard and Soft; Descending to the Earth and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to the Heavens; most high and most low; light and heavy; In mee the Order of Nature is oftentimes inverted, in Colour, Number, Weight and Measure. I have in mee the light of Nature, I am dark and bright, I spring from the Earth, and I come out of Heaven, I am well known, and yet a meer Nothing, all Colours shine in mee, and all Metals by the Beams of the Sun.

and thou shalt affirme thou doest justly keep back those things, whose Revelation belongs to his honour.

The truth is, hee had some <hi>Pride</hi> to the <hi>Justice</hi> of his <hi>Spleen,</hi> and in many places hee hath err'd of purpose, not caring what <hi>Bones</hi> hee threw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Schoole-men;</hi> for hee was a Pylot of <hi>Guadalcana,</hi> and sayl'd sometimes in his <hi>Rio de la recriation.</hi> But I had almost forgot to tell thee that. which is all in all, and it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Difficultie in all the <hi>Art,</hi> namely the <hi>fire.</hi> It is a <hi>close, ayrie, circular, bright fire;</hi> the Philosophers call it their <hi>Sun,</hi> and the <hi>glasse</hi> must stand in the <hi>shade.</hi> It makes not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>vapour,</hi> no not so much as to <hi>sweat,</hi> it <hi>digests</hi> onely with a <hi>still, piercing, vitall heat.</hi> It is <hi>continuall,</hi> and therefore at last <hi>alters</hi> the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and <hi>corrupts</hi> it; The <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Regiment</hi> of it is very <hi>Scrupulous,</hi> but the best rule to know it by, is that of the <hi>Synod: facite ne Easianus volet ante Insequentem;</hi> Let not the Bird fly before the Fowler: make it sit whiles you give fire, and then you are sure of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115898:78"/>
your Prey. For a Cloze, I must tell thee, the Philosophers call'd this <hi>Fire</hi> their <hi>Balneum,</hi> but it is <hi>Balneum Naturae.</hi> a Naturall Bath, not an <hi>Artificiall</hi> one, for it is not any kind of <hi>Water,</hi> but a certain <hi>subtill temperate moysture</hi> which compasseth the <hi>Glasse,</hi> and feeds their <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Fire.</hi> In a word without this <hi>Bath</hi> nothing in the world is generated. Now that thou mayst the better understand what <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> is requisit for the work, consider the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> or any other <hi>Creature</hi> whatsoever. It is not <hi>Kitchin fire,</hi> nor <hi>feaver</hi> that works upon the <hi>Sperm</hi> in the Womb but a most <hi>temperate, moyst, natural heat,</hi> which proceeds from the <hi>very life</hi> of the <hi>Mother.</hi> It is just so here; Our <hi>Matter</hi> is a most <hi>delicate Substance,</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> like the <hi>Animal sperme,</hi> for it is almost a <hi>living thing,</hi> nay in very truth it hath some <hi>small portion</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> for <hi>Nature</hi> doth produce some <hi>Animals</hi> out of it. For this very reason the <hi>least violence</hi> destroyes it, and <hi>prevents</hi> all <hi>generation,</hi> for if it be <hi>over-heated</hi> but for some few minutes, the <hi>white,</hi> and <hi>red Sulphurs</hi> will never <hi>essentially</hi> unite, and <hi>coagulat.</hi> On the Contrary, if it <hi>takes cold</hi> but for half an hour, the work being once well begun, it will never <hi>sort</hi> to any <hi>good purpose.</hi> I speak out of my own Experience, for I have (as they phrase it) given my self a Box on the Eare, and that twice
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115898:78"/>
or thrice, out of a certain confident Negligence, Expecting that, which I knew well enough, could never bee. Nature moves not by the <hi>Theorie</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> but by their <hi>practice,</hi> and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> can performe no <hi>Miracles,</hi> unlesse the <hi>hands</hi> supplie them. Bee sure then to know this <hi>fire</hi> in the first place, and accordingly bee sure to make <hi>use</hi> of it. But for thy better Securitie, I will describe it to thee once more. It is a <hi>drie, vaporous humid fire;</hi> it goes round about the <hi>Glasse,</hi> and is both <hi>
                     <unclear>equall</unclear>
                  </hi> and <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall.</hi> It is <hi>restlesse,</hi> and some have call'd it the <hi>white philosophicall Coale.</hi> It is in it self <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> but the <hi>praeparation</hi> of it is <hi>Artificiall,</hi> it is a <hi>heat</hi> of the <hi>Dead</hi> wherefore some call it their <hi>unnatural, Necromantic fire.</hi> It is no part of the <hi>Matter,</hi> neither is it <hi>taken</hi> out of it, but it is an <hi>external fire,</hi> and serves onely to <hi>stirr</hi> up, and strengthen the inward oppressed <hi>fire</hi> of the <hi>Chaos.</hi> But let us hear <hi>Nature</hi> her self, for thus shee speaks in the Serious <hi>Romance</hi> of <hi>Mehung.

Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber now what I have told thee formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Earth;</hi> what a generall <hi>Hospitall</hi> it is, how it receives all things, not onely <hi>Beasts</hi> and <hi>Vegetables,</hi> but proud and glorious <hi>Man:</hi> when Death hath ruin'd him, his courser parts stay here, and know no other Home. This <hi>Earth to Earth,</hi> is just the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi;</hi> Metalls (say they) and all things may bee reduc'd into that whereof they were made.

This <hi>Chaos</hi> hath in it the <hi>foure Elements,</hi> which of themselves are <hi>contrarie Natures,</hi> but the wisdome of God hath so placed them that their very <hi>order</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles them. For Example, <hi>Ayre</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> are <hi>Adversaries,</hi> for one is <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moyst,</hi> the other <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>drie.</hi> Now to reconcile these <hi>two,</hi> God placed the <hi>Water</hi> between them, which is a <hi>middle Nature,</hi> or of a <hi>mean Complexion</hi> between both <hi>Extremes.</hi> For she is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moyst,</hi> and as shee is <hi>cold,</hi> shee partakes of the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>drie,</hi> but as shee is <hi>moyst,</hi> she partakes in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Ayre,</hi> which is <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moyst.</hi> Hence it is, that <hi>Ayre</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> which are <hi>Contraries</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:115898:84"/>
in <hi>Themselves,</hi> agree and imbrace one another in the <hi>water,</hi> as in a <hi>middle Nature</hi> which is <hi>proportionate</hi> to them both, and <hi>tempers</hi> their <hi>Extremities.</hi> But verely this <hi>Salvo</hi> makes not up the <hi>Breach,</hi> for though the <hi>water</hi> reconciles <hi>two Elements</hi> like a friendly <hi>Third,</hi> yet shee her self <hi>fights</hi> with a <hi>Fourth,</hi> namely with the <hi>Fire:</hi> For the <hi>Tire</hi> is <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>drie,</hi> but the <hi>water</hi> is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moyst,</hi> which are clear <hi>Contraries.</hi> To prevent the <hi>Distempers</hi> of these <hi>two,</hi> God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the <hi>Ayre</hi> between them, which is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moyst;</hi> and as it is <hi>hot,</hi> it agrees with the <hi>fire,</hi> which is <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>drie;</hi> but as it is <hi>moyst,</hi> it agrees with the <hi>water,</hi> which is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moyst;</hi> so that by <hi>mediation</hi> of the <hi>Ayre,</hi> the other <hi>two Extremes,</hi> namely <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>water</hi> are made <hi>friends,</hi> and <hi>reconciled.</hi> Thus you see, as I told you at first, that <hi>Contrarie Elements</hi> are united by that <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Textare</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Wise God</hi> hath placed them.
