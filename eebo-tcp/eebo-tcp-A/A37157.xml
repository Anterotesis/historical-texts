            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
TRANSLATOR
TO HIS
FRIEND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have twice read over the Book you were so kind to
lend me last Week; but I found that part of it, which
treats of <hi>Money,</hi> deserving a more particular Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
for all the Discourse of late has been almost
only of <hi>Coin.</hi> Many of those who pretend to understand
this nice Affair, have printed their Sentiments about it; and
such as are Strangers to it, are, or should be very desirous of better
Information. I must reckon my self, and so must you, Sir, in
the number of the latter; for neither my Years, nor Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the Schools. (which I left but t'other day) will allow
me to be Master enough of a thing, whereof the Knowledg de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
so much upon Business, and more acquaintance with the
World than I can boast of. And indeed I benefited little
(tho most willing to learn) by all the Pieces written upon this
Subject, till Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> was pleas'd to favour the Publick with
his Thoughts upon it. It seems as impossible for that great
Man to write obscurely, as to publish any thing he does not
thorowly understand. He has by this, and his other Treatise
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:55019:3"/>
concerning <hi>Lowering the Interest of Money,</hi> given a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Demonstration that <hi>Business</hi> and <hi>Observation</hi> are not
incompatible with the speculative part of <hi>Philosophy:</hi> but if
you compare his Book too, with what others have said of <hi>Coin,</hi>
you have there a Demonstration how ridiculous it is to write
from <hi>abstracted</hi> or Closet-Notions of what must be only learn'd
by <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Conversation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What he has printed therefore gave me entire Content; but
I'm infinitely pleas'd with my good fortune in meeting with the
Discourse I borrowed from you: for it is not only very methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
digested, as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s is, but also both these learned
Gentlemen (notwithstanding one of 'em wrote above an Age
ago) are of the same mind, and sometimes make use of the
same Terms about the intrinsick Value and debasing of Coins.
So all those who reason exactly concerning any thing, must be
necessarily of the same Opinion, and often agree too in their
Expressions. What pleas'd me further, was to find so ample
and satisfactory an account, within so narrow a Compass, of the
Origin of Money; of its Essence, Names and Importance; of
the Persons who first invented it, with the Place and Time;
likewise an Account of the evil Consequences of debasing or raising
of Money, and their proper Remedies: add to this the Origin
of Fairs, fo Markets, and, in one word, of all Commerce or
Traffick in general.</p>
            <p>Signor <hi>Davanzati</hi> was every way qualified to perform his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
being famous for natural and acquir'd Parts, not only
conversant in Trade, and one of the best Arithmeticians of his
time; but likewise an able Politician, as appears by his admir'd
Translation of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and his own original Compositions. He
compil'd a compendious Treatise concerning the Nature and
Knowledg of <hi>Exchange,</hi> reducing (according to the Writer of
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:55019:3"/>
his Life) a most obscure and intricate Matter to great Clearness
and Facility. He did in like manner, at the request of the
Consul M. Baccio Valori, (continues the same Author) read
<hi>a publick Lecture upon Coins, full of Political Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and containing all that can be desired on so vast a
Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Lecture</hi> was the following <hi>Discourse,</hi> which I have been
at the pains to translate; and my only design now in the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, is to share with others the Benefits, I think, may be
receiv'd by it. I never imagin'd the end of my Creation was to
be serviceable only to my self; I could not learn, I'm sure, any
thing so unworthy from your Familiarity or Example: and I
could give but an ill account of my time, if, having sometimes the
Happiness of keeping good Men company, I should not entertain
more exalted and generous Notions. Truly I'm so far from
desiring to live meerly to my self, and from preferring a solitary
Life, that I set no value upon all the Books and Leisure in the
World, further than they contribute to render me fit for <hi>Business</hi>
and <hi>Society,</hi> especially the Service of God and my Country.
Those Creatures, who perhaps are not to be blam'd for shutting
themselves up all their days, I judg as useless and contemptible as
the Worms that help 'em to consume their Papers.</p>
            <p>My design then being to do what good I could, I shall not
think it lost, if young Persons, at least, get any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by it; which, in this (or in any other respect) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail of, if avoiding <hi>Idleness</hi> as some dangerous Precipice,
they seriously apply themselves to <hi>Business</hi> and <hi>Vertue:</hi> Otherwise
(as the Writer of our Author's Life says extremely well) <hi>they
are sure to be despis'd in their inglorious Lives, and their
Names shall be forgotten when they are dead.</hi>

This Piece, I confess, appears a little too late, however it is
not my fault; for it was by pure accident, as you can witness,
that I came to know of it, and almost as soon I send it abroad in
this new Dress. Besides, if all things be well consider'd, that
part of it which concerns <hi>base Coin,</hi> is now as useful as ever;
and the Knowledg of the rest cannot be unseasonable at any
time. But I have no Apology to make, except to you, Sir, for
presuming to inscribe such a Trifle, and that too but a <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to one who so well deserves from the World and me. I
shall only offer, that I am not willing to lose any opportunity of
shewing my Gratitude and Respect; for if herein I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
any fault, my Intentions being sincere, I know you'll
grant an easy Pardon to,</p>

            <head>A DISCOVRSE upon Coins, by
Signor Bernardo Davanzati, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Florence; being publickly spoken
in the Academy there, Anno 1588.</head>
            <p>1. THE Sun and Internal Heat do separate, as it
were by Distillation, the best Juices and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the Bowels of the Earth; which
being percolated into proper Veins and Mines,
and there congeal'd, grown solid, and ripen'd, they are in
time made <hi>Mettals:</hi> whereof the most rare and perfect are
<hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> resembling the two great Luminaries of the
World in Splendor and Colour. Fire nor Rust will not
consume them; they are not subject to be destroy'd by
Moths, Worms, or Rottenness; nor do they waste much by
use. They may in Wire or Leaves be extended to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Fineness, and have something in 'em that is Divine;
at least certain <hi>Indian</hi> People think so, who fast when they
are digging for <hi>Gold,</hi> and forbid themselves the Company
of Women, with all other Pleasures, out of an old Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</p>
            <p>2. Now, <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> contribute very little in their
own nature to our Lives, for which all Earthly Things
seem to have been created. Yet Men, as if they would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55019:5"/>
make <hi>Nature</hi> asham'd of this, have agreed to make those
Metals of equal value to all other things, to make 'em the
Price and Measure of all, and the Instruments of changing
and exchanging whatever can be found good in this World.
We may therefore call 'em the second Causes of a happy
Life, seeing that by their means we enjoy all those Benefits
which render it so. This is likewise the Reason why many
have made 'em their Gods, seeing 'em perform almost Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities.
There is not a Rock so hard, said a wise and
warlike King, but an <hi>Ass</hi> loadn'd with <hi>Gold</hi> may force it.
The known Fable of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s descending into <hi>Danaë</hi>'s Lap
in a shower of Gold signifies nothing else, but the Miracles
which Gold can work. We may conclude as much of the
Story of <hi>Gyges</hi> a <hi>Lydian</hi> Shepherd, who walking in a
Cave is said to have taken a Gold Ring from the Finger of
a dead Man he found there, and, putting it upon one of
his own, he presently becomes invisible, goes into the King's
Bed-Chamber, enjoys the Queen, by whose Assistance he
next murders her Husband, and seizes the Kingdom to
himself.</p>
            <p>3. Considering therefore the mighty Power and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of <hi>Gold</hi> in Human Affairs; and since <hi>Socrates,</hi> leaving
Divine and Natural Things to the Care of the Gods,
taught that Morality and Matters of Practice did only
belong to us, I esteem it not a mean Subject, nor unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
nor out of my Province (most courteous Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks)
to discourse now before you of Gold, of Silver,
and other Coins. But it shall be with much brevity after
our <hi>Florentine</hi> manner, especially because I come hither to
day under a great Infirmity, my old and hereditary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
which has not only render'd me feeble and uneasy,
but likewise for many Years a Stranger to Books and Study.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55019:5"/>
I must therefore beg your Attention, because I naturally am,
and shall this day be purposely sparing of my words.</p>
            <p>4. Our Mortal Body being design'd a Habitation for the
Divine and Immortal Soul, was fram'd, as became the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of so great a Lady, of a most noble, delicate, and
tender Constitution; but withal naked and expos'd to the
Injuries of Seasons, and Animals. It could not therefore
but stand in need of several things, which no body can
procure by himself alone; and this is the reason why we
live together in Cities, to help one another by various Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations,
Offices, and Degrees. But no Person is born fit
for all sorts of Business, some having a Genius for one
thing, and some for another; nor can any Climate indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
produce all the Fruits of Earth, being in very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Situations with respect to the Sun and Stars. Hence
it is that one Man labours and toils not for himself alone,
but also for others, and they reciprocally for him. So one
City helps another, and one Country parts with its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities
to another, in lieu whereof it is from thence again
suppli'd with what it wants. And thus all the good things
of Nature and Art are communicated and enjoy'd by the
means of Human Commerce or <hi>Traffick,</hi> which at first
was but simple <hi>Barter,</hi> or changing of one Commodity
for another, as it still continues in the unciviliz'd parts of
the World.</p>
            <p>5. Now it was a difficult thing to know who stood in
need of what you could spare, or who had an overplus
of what you wanted; and so to transport, preserve, or
divide them, as that both Parties might be accommodated.
But Necessity, the Mother of Inventions, taught Men to
pitch upon a certain place, where many meeting from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55019:6"/>
Parts with their Commodities, might the more easily
supply one another; and this was the Origin of <hi>Fairs</hi> and
<hi>Markets.</hi> Their Eyes were open'd by this Convenience to
discover a greater, that as they had chosen a particular
place, so they might appoint some one thing that should
bear an equivalent value to all others; and that every thing
might be given or receiv'd for a certain quantity thereof,
as if it had been the <hi>Medium</hi> or Fountain of the universal
Value of things, their separate Substance, or Idea.</p>
            <p>6. The first Money that the Antients wrought was
<hi>Copper,</hi> and was by common Consent preferr'd to this high
Office. So whatever superabounded to any Person, he
gave it for as much Copper as was compar'd with, or judg'd
equal to it; this Copper he afterwards gave for other
things wanting to him, or otherwise he kept it by him in
his Coffer, as a Security for the Supply of his future Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.
And this was the Original of <hi>selling</hi> and <hi>buying,</hi>
which we <hi>Tuscans</hi> still call <hi>comparing,</hi> in our Language
<hi>comperare.</hi> Afterwards the greater Excellency of <hi>Gold</hi> and
<hi>Silver</hi> did set them off, and occasion'd them to be made
Money. They were at the beginning us'd in unwrought
Pieces as they came to hand; but, as Additions are easily
made to Inventions, they were next weigh'd, then stamp'd,
and so became Money.</p>
            <p>7. When, where, or by whom <hi>Money</hi> was first coin'd
is not agreed upon by Writers. <hi>Herodotus</hi> says in <hi>Lydia,</hi>
others in <hi>Naxos, Strabo</hi> in <hi>Aegina;</hi> some in <hi>Lycia</hi> by King
<hi>Erichthonius; Lucan</hi> says in <hi>Thessaly</hi> by King <hi>Jonus.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
learn that there was any Money in use before the
Flood: but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> speak plainly of it afterwards.
<hi>Abraham</hi> purchas'd a Field from <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite</hi> for four
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55019:6"/>
hundred Shekels of Silver, currant Money with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.
<hi>Joseph</hi> was sold by his Brethren for twenty pieces
of Silver. And <hi>Moses</hi> laid upon the <hi>Israelites</hi> by Poll half
a Shekel, that is, four Drachms of Silver. <hi>Theseus,</hi> who
reign'd in <hi>Attica</hi> about the time of the <hi>Judges</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi>
coin'd Silver-Money with the Stamp of an Ox upon it,
to invite those to manure and till the Ground, who till
then liv'd at random in the Woods. When <hi>Janus</hi> King
of <hi>Latium</hi> receiv'd <hi>Saturn</hi> fled by Sea from his Son <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
who drove him from his Throne, (that was in the so well
govern'd, and so much celebrated Golden Age) <hi>Janus,</hi> I
say, did in the Memory of this Favour coin Copper Money,
which had stamp'd upon it the Prow of a Ship. The first
Money among the <hi>Romans</hi> was a piece of Copper, without
any coining, of a Pound Weight, call'd by them <hi>Aes gravis,
As Assis,</hi> and <hi>Pondo. Servius Tullius</hi> stamp'd a Sheep upon
it, as one of his Domestick Animals; the Riches of the
Antients consisting then in their Flocks, by them call'd <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culium</hi>
or <hi>Pecunia,</hi> whence Money was so nam'd. In the
Year of <hi>Rome</hi> 383, Silver was there coin'd, and Gold sixty
two Years after. When the Florentines defeated the Forces
of <hi>Siena</hi> at Mount <hi>Alcino</hi> in the Year 1252, they coin'd a
Dram of fine Gold into a <hi>Florin,</hi> which was so well receiv'd
in the World, that all People would coin such Pieces, and
call them <hi>Florins</hi> too.</p>
            <p>8. The <hi>Latin</hi> Names of Money are <hi>Moneta, Pecunia,
Nummus:</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> Names are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:
And ours <hi>Pecunia, Danari, Danaio.</hi> 'Tis call'd <hi>Moneta,</hi>
because the Stamp of it does admonish us of its Name, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and Fineness. The Denomination of Money is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
deriv'd from the Stamp, as some old Coins were call'd
<hi>Bigati,</hi> from the Figure of a Cart drawn by two Horses;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55019:7"/>
               <hi>Philippi,</hi> from the Head of King <hi>Philip; Sagittarii,</hi> from an
Archer; and <hi>Armati,</hi> from the Impress of an arm'd Man.
A Judg having receiv'd a thousand of the latter for passing
an unjust Sentence, did in his own excuse roguishly play
upon the words, saying, that he could not resist a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>arm'd Men.</hi> The Mark or Letter X gave a Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the <hi>Roman Denarius,</hi> which was worth ten <hi>Asses.</hi>
Our <hi>Florin</hi> was so call'd from the Flower-de-Luce, which
by Allusion shews it to be <hi>Florentine,</hi> as a Rose does <hi>Rhodian</hi>
Money. The Stamp denotes oftentimes some Matters of Fact,
as the Prow of a Ship the abovementioned Humanity of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi>
and a Yacht sunk, with this Motto <hi>Quare dubit asti,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
the vanquish'd Fortunes of <hi>Clement</hi> the VIIth. <hi>Pecunia</hi>
is deriv'd, as we said before, from <hi>Pecus;</hi> and <hi>Nummus</hi> from
the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies a Statute, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
appointed by Law, such as Money is, being made
the Queen of all things. It was call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for its Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and Goodness, seeing that by it we receive all that
is good and beneficial, call'd in <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Lastly, it
was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which betokens the small Money that
runs amongst the common People. We of <hi>Florence</hi> make
use of the <hi>Latin</hi> words; and from <hi>Denarius,</hi> which amongst
the <hi>Romans</hi> was a particular Piece, we call Money in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Danari</hi> or <hi>Danaio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Thus far have we discours'd of the Time, Place, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
Authors, Names, and Advantages of Money.
'Tis now time to give its Essential Definition. <hi>Money</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>is Gold, Silver, or Copper coin'd by publick Authority at
pleasure, and by the Consent of Nations made the Price and
Measure of things, to contract them the more easily.</hi> I said
<hi>Gold, Silver or Copper,</hi> because People have chosen those
three Mettals to make Money of. If the Prince (by which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55019:7"/>
word is understood whoever governs and protects the State,
be it one or many, few or all:) I say, if the Prince makes
Money of Iron, Lead, Wood, Cork, Leather, Paper, Salt, or
the like, (as it has sometimes happen'd) it will not be receiv'd
out of his Dominions, as not being coin'd of the Matter
generally agreed upon. It could not then be universal
Money, but a particular Tally, Countermark, Note or
Bill from the Prince, obliging him to pay so much good
Money when he is able. And this has been frequently
practis'd for want of Money, when the Publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck Good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
it. The <hi>Romans</hi> call'd the Masters of their Mint
the <hi>Triumvirs,</hi> appointed to oversee the fining and coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Copper, Silver, and Gold. <hi>Vlpianus, Pomponius,</hi>
and others learned in the Civil Law, expresly affirm that
no Money is good, but what is of Gold, of Silver, or
Copper: wherefore <hi>Mark Antony</hi> was reproach'd, amongst
his other Crimes, for coining of base Silver mixt with
Iron.</p>
            <p>10. I said in the Definition <hi>coin'd by publick Authority,</hi>
because few Metals are found altogether pure. To make
Money therefore of equal Value, it is necessary to reduce
the Metal to a certain degree of Fineness, to cut it into
pieces of equal Weight, and to put a known Stamp upon it
as a Mark of its being good Money, that every one may
not be oblig'd upon all occasions to try or essay it. This
notwithstanding must not be done by private Men, who
may be suspected of Fraud, but by the Prince, who is the
Father of all. Wherefore no Person may coin his own
Metal, be it never so good, without incurring the Penalty
due to Counterfeiters and Forgers. But he is to carry it
to the publick Mint, where it is receiv'd, weigh'd, essay'd,
mark'd, melted, allay'd, beaten, made into equal Pieces,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55019:8"/>
adjusted, coin'd, and render'd every way according to
Law.</p>
            <p>11. It was likewise said in the Definition <hi>at Pleasure:</hi>
For tho the Law requires Money to be coin'd, yet whether
this or that way, that is, round or square, broad or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
more or less pure, with this or that Stamp, under
one Denomination or another, these are all Accidents, and
left entirely to the Magistrate's Discretion. It suffices that
he touch not the Substance of it, which he has no Power
to do: that is, he may coin no Money but of the three
known Metals, nor set a false Price upon the Pieces, as
it must needs happen, if, after trying of 'em, they should be
found not to consist of fine Metal enough answerable to
their Names. Should the People be thus cheated under
the publick Faith that ought to protect them, they might
say as the Wolf did once to the Shepherd who devour'd
the Sheep, If I had done this, good Mr. Shepherd, you
would cry, help, help, and raise the Country to pursue
me.</p>
            <p>12. It was said in the Definition, <hi>By the Consent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made the Price and Measure of things;</hi> because Men
have agreed to fix that Value upon those Metals, for they
have no such Privileges from Nature. A Natural Calf is
far more noble than a Golden one, yet how much inferior
in Price? An Egg that was bought for half a Grain of
Gold, kept Count <hi>Vgolino</hi> alive in the Castle for ten days,
which all the Treasure in the Universe could not do. What
does more nearly concern our Lives than Corn? never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
ten thousand Grains thereof are sold for one of
Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:55019:8"/>
13. But how comes it that things so valuable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are worth so little Gold? From what Root springs
it, that one thing is worth just so much of another, rather
than so much; worth this rather than that quantity of
Gold? Let us examine whether this be the Effect of Chance
or not. All Men labour to become happy, and they think
to find this Happiness in the Satisfaction of all their Wants
and Desires, to answer which all Earthly Things were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very good. Now all these by the Consent of Nations
are worth all the Gold (comprehending also the Silver
and Copper) that is wrought in the World. All Men
then do passionately covet all the Gold, to buy up all things
for the Satisfaction of all their Wants and Desires, and so
to become happy. The Parts follow the nature of the
whole. How much therefore of the Happiness of a Man,
City, or Country, is caus'd or occasion'd by any thing, just
so much it is worth of their Gold or Labour: But it causes
as much Happiness as it answers of their Desires or Wants,
as Drink is pleasing proportionable to the degree of Thirst.
The Will takes its measure from the Appetites and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and Want takes its measure from the Nature, Season,
Climate, and Place; from the excellency, rarity, or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of any thing, with perpetual Variation.</p>
            <p>14. To be always acquainted with the Rule and Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical
Proportion which things bear among themselves
and with Gold, it were necessary to look down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or some exalted Prospect upon all the things that
exist, or are done upon the Earth; or rather to count their
Images reflected in the Heavens as in a true Mirror. Then
we might cast up the Sum and say, There is on Earth just
so much Gold, so many Things, so many Men, so many
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55019:9"/>
Desires: As many of those Desires as any thing can satisfy,
so much it is worth of another thing, so much Gold it
is worth. But here below we can scarce discover those
few things that are round about us, and we prize 'em ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as we see 'em more or less desir'd at any time, or
in any place; whereof the <hi>Merchants</hi> do carefully inform
themselves, and for that reason they know the Prices of
things better than all others.</p>
            <p>15. It will not be amiss to illustrate what we have here
said by some Examples. Water is excellent, said <hi>Pindar,</hi>
and we could not well live without it: But because every
one may have enough of it for nothing, <hi>Jeremy</hi> had reason
to lament that it could not be procur'd without Price. A
Mole is a vile and despicable Animal, but in the Siege of
<hi>Cassilino</hi> the Famine was so great, that one was sold for 200
<hi>Florins;</hi> and yet it was not dear, for he that parted with
it dy'd of Hunger, and he that bought it out-liv'd the
Siege. So <hi>Esau</hi> threw away his Birth-right, and <hi>Esop</hi>'s Cock
contemn'd the Jewel. On the contrary, <hi>Apitius,</hi> whom
<hi>Pliny</hi> calls a <hi>bottomless Gulf,</hi> spent two Millions and a half
of Gold upon his Gut; and, finding but the fourth part
of a Million in his Coffers, he poison'd himself for fear,
as he said, of starving: And that, says <hi>Martial,</hi> was the
daintiest bit that ever he swallow'd. <hi>Aristotle</hi> knew how
to spend his Money better; for he gave for some few
Books of <hi>Speusippus</hi> the Philosopher, a little after he was
dead, 20250 <hi>Ducats of the Sun:</hi> So I reduce the antient
<hi>Talents,</hi> after <hi>Budaeus,</hi> to our modern Money, that I may
be the better understood. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great gave <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>
himself forty eight thousand for writing the <hi>History of
Animals.</hi> And <hi>Virgil</hi> receiv'd ten <hi>Sesterces</hi> a piece for the
twenty Lines in the sixth of his <hi>Aeneids,</hi> wherein he laments
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55019:9"/>
the Death of <hi>Marcellus;</hi> this makes of our Money 4250
<hi>Florins.</hi> The Vanity of Mankind has set excessive Rates
upon Vessels, precious Stones, Statues, Pictures, and other
trifling Curiosities; because they find as much Satisfaction
in these, as in the quantity of Gold they give for them.
Thus the Inhabitants of <hi>Peru</hi> did at first barter Ingots
of Gold for Looking-glasses, Needles, little Bells, and the
like; because they put a high Esteem upon those things
then new to them, and drew more Satisfaction from 'em,
than from the Gold and Silver wherewith they abounded.
And when all the Gold in those Countries shall be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
into ours, (which must quickly happen, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
those rich Navigations begun <hi>Anno</hi> 1534, and then
returning with less than a Million of Gold, the Spoils of
<hi>Cucco</hi> and K. <hi>Atabalipa,</hi> but now bring from 16 to 18 Millions
at a time, which has rais'd the Price of things one third, a
sign that we have more Gold) I say, that when all the
Gold in the <hi>Indies</hi> is brought into <hi>Europe,</hi> because then it
will become a Drug, we must either find out something
more rare to make Money of, or else return to the old
way of <hi>bartering.</hi> And let so much suffice concerning the
Essence of Money.</p>
            <p>16. Some maintain that <hi>Money</hi> was a very ill Invention,
for this reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Desire of other things could
not be so great, nor the cause of so many Evils as is the
Thirst of Gold; because so much of those could not be
laid up and preserv'd, as there may be treasur'd of this. I
answer with <hi>Epictetus,</hi> that every thing has two Handles,
and may be well or ill taken and us'd; as <hi>Reason, Physick,</hi>
and <hi>Law</hi> are often abus'd to the Destruction of Mankind;
but are they for all this prohibited in the Common-wealth?
Have all the <hi>Philosophers</hi> pluck'd out their Eyes like <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55019:10"/>
because the sight of many things takes off the Mind
from Contemplation? All Steel, as they say, makes its own
Rust, and we must learn how to scour it. Money was an
excellent Invention, and an Instrument of doing infinite
good; if any makes an ill use of it, 'tis not the Thing but
the Person that is to be blam'd and punish'd.</p>
            <p>17. Some grave and famous Authors have call'd Money
the <hi>Sinews of War and Government;</hi> but, in my Opinion, it
may be more properly stil'd the <hi>second Blood</hi> thereof. For
as <hi>Blood,</hi> which is the Juice and Substance of Meat in the
natural Body, does, by circulating out of the greater into
the lesser Vessels, moisten all the Flesh, which drinks it up
as parch'd Ground soaks Rain Water; so it nourishes and
restores as much of it as was dri'd up and evaporated by
the natural Heat: In like manner, Money, which we said
before was the best Juice and Substance of the Earth, does,
by circulating out of the richer Purses into the poorer, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
all the Nation, being laid out upon those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there is a continual Consumption for the Necessities of
Life. From the poorer it returns again into the richer Purses;
and thus circulating without Intermission, it preserves alive
the <hi>Civil Body</hi> of the Common-wealth. Hence it may be
easily conceiv'd that every <hi>State</hi> must have a quantity of
<hi>Money,</hi> as every <hi>Body</hi> a quantity of <hi>Blood</hi> to circulate
therein. But as the <hi>Blood</hi> stopping in the Head or the
larger Vessels puts the <hi>Body</hi> naturally into a Consumption,
Dropsy, or Apoplexy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so should all the <hi>Money</hi> be
only in a few Hands, as in those of the rich for Example,
the <hi>State</hi> falls unavoidably into Convulsions, and other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Distempers. Thus it was very near happening at
<hi>Rome,</hi> when by reason of the multitude of accus'd Persons,
of Condemnations, Slaughters and Confiscations, all the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55019:10"/>
Money was like to come into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> had not <hi>Tiberius</hi>
distributed two Millions and a half of <hi>Gold</hi> into the Banks,
whence it was to be lent to Debtors upon double Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for three Years, without any Expence or Interest. We
ought therefore to set a high Value upon this <hi>living Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of the Common-wealth, and to preserve it from those
Mischiefs which usually befal it, when not carefully look'd
after; such as Counterfeiting, Monopolizing, Simony,
Usury, and the like, already decri'd, and known every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
But, passing by these, I shall now confine my
Discourse only to one, not so much taken notice of, and
indeed neglected from the beginning; I mean <hi>debasing of
Coin,</hi> which increases more and more every day. I design
to shew the Causes, the Damage, the Scandal, the Remedy
of this Evil, and so to conclude.</p>
            <p>18. The Root of this, as of all other Evils, is <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,</hi>
which has found out many occasions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
for <hi>debasing</hi> of Money. But this is the chief, that
Money, being once out of the Mint, does in time, by too
much handling, and frequent counting, grow lighter; or
that a Grain, for Example, is taken off it by some illegal
Practice; the People in the mean while either take no
notice of so small a matter, or care not, and so the Money
passes: Hereupon the dishonest Coiner says to his Lord,
Since your Money, Sir, is one Grain lighter, 'tis fitter you
should get by it, than that others clip it; and so a Grain is taken
off it. The neighbouring <hi>States</hi> seeing this, diminish theirs
likewise. Some time after they fall to it again, and take off
another Grain, and then another, and so on. Thus for sixty
Years past this Worm has consum'd above the third part
of the Silver in <hi>Europe;</hi> and it must at last (if this Practice
continue) be brought to nothing, or to those Nail-heads,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55019:11"/>
which, perhaps, was the Iron-Money that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> gave
the <hi>Spartans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. The <hi>Damage</hi> is manifest, because <hi>by how much Money
is debas'd whether in Allay or Weight, by so much are lessen'd
the publick Revenues, and the Credit and Estates of private
Men, who so far receive less Gold or Silver.</hi> And he that
has but little Money, can buy but few things, which are
the only true Riches: for <hi>no sooner is Money debas'd but all
things grow dear:</hi> And there is Reason for it, because (as
<hi>Carafulla,</hi> who was no Fool, delivers the Etymology of
the word) <hi>vendo</hi> to <hi>sell</hi> comes from <hi>venio</hi> to <hi>come,</hi> and <hi>do</hi>
to <hi>give;</hi> for things are <hi>given</hi> in sale, because you expect
there should <hi>come</hi> to you in Exchange so much Metal as is
wont, or is believ'd to be in the Money; and not <hi>so many
Stamps, or Denominations, or Pieces.</hi> If that same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Silver be at present in one hundred and nine pieces,
which us'd before to be in a hundred only, must not one
hundred and nine be now paid for that which formerly cost
but a hundred?</p>
            <p>20. Threescore Years ago our <hi>Florin</hi> was worth seven
<hi>Livres,</hi> now 'tis exchang'd for ten; And why? because
<hi>there was at that time as much good Silver in those seven
Livers, as there is now in ten:</hi> So that at present seven
<hi>Livers</hi> cannot purchase a whole <hi>Florin,</hi> but only seven
parts in ten. The other three parts are vanish'd, and by
so much are lessen'd the publick Revenues, with the Estates
of private Men. Now here may be perceiv'd how great
an Injury Princes do to themselves; for tho they gain
once by robbing the poor People of what is taken from
the Money, yet they lose by it ever after, <hi>being forc'd to
receive their Revenues in the same Coin.</hi> Hence spring Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55019:11"/>
and Confusions; because the People do, by the
Novelty of the Coins and Prices which measure things,
become, in a manner, Strangers in their own Country;
and not less confounded than if the Weights and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Measures were alter'd, with which they were wont
to contract for Corn, Liquor, Cloth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what
worse thing can be done to the Common-wealth than
every day to change the Laws, Coins, Offices, Customs,
and, as it were, to renew the Members of it? To make
muddy, or rather to poison the common Fountain of the
City?</p>
            <p>21. More Confusions still follow upon debasing of
Money; for <hi>when Silver is debas'd, the Price of Gold must
consequently rise,</hi> as it was said before of our <hi>Florin</hi> rais'd
from seven to ten <hi>Livers:</hi> Otherwise the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
between Silver and Gold, which at this time is
that of one to twelve or thirteen, could not hold; for
<hi>all the Gold would be bought up, and carried where it was
worth more Silver.</hi> Great Difficulties therefore, and
Quarrels would happen about the payment of Legacies,
Taxes, Rents, Profits, and of all Debts contracted when
the Money was good. A Debtor of a Gold <hi>Florin</hi> of
seven <hi>Livres</hi> would say to his Creditor, Sir, here are
seven <hi>Livres</hi> which I ow'd you. The Creditor answers,
You must pay me ten <hi>Livres;</hi> for a Gold <hi>Florin,</hi> which
you promis'd to pay me, is now worth so much: and
if this pleases you not, pay me a Gold <hi>Florin,</hi> flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluc'd,
and stamp'd, as when we bargain'd. The Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
replies, If I give you a <hi>Florin</hi> of seven <hi>Livers,</hi> as
<hi>the Proclamation sings,</hi> I do enough: If the Prince has
debas'd the Money, it is a common Storm, and we are
all in the same Ship: Complain not of me, but of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55019:12"/>
Prince. And truly the People have reason to complain
of him, being involv'd in such cruel Difficulties and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
as even the wise know not how to be deliver'd
from: for some of 'em are for maintaining the Law in this
case, others the Intention of it; some are for the Rigor,
and others for the Equity of it.</p>
            <p>22. But how shall the Prince help debasing the Money?
Suppose it be made bad by his Neighbours, by Time, or
evil Practices; that all the good be spirited or exported,
and after vanishing a while, it appears again made worse;
must the City be fill'd with foreign, base, and clipt Money,
and the People be plagu'd with it, as if they were to
feed upon mouldy Bread? I answer, that no such Money
is to be suffer'd by any means: That every one may
be secure from being cheated, let it be quickly remov'd,
but by just and discreet Methods. Let there be certain
Persons appointed to receive it, and to pay the just value
thereof, without making any Gain or Profit by it. So eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one will bring it to be chang'd, and obey most readily,
when they perceive they are to suffer none, or a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
Loss. Thus a great Master in Politicks or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd
in the 5<hi>

               </hi> Book of his Laws, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should not take the bad Money from those who
brought it from Abroad, but might justly pay it after the
manner of the Country.</p>
            <p>23. There can be no danger, <hi>that your Money, for
being too good, should be exported and recoin'd:</hi> for I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
it is not bestow'd upon him that carries it Abroad;
but paying for it after the rate of good Money, he
leaves (as we say) his Skin behind him; and if it be
made bad, it passes and is exchang'd only for bad Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55019:12"/>
A hundred <hi>Livres</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> go for a hundred
and six of those of <hi>Lucca:</hi> he that takes by Exchange
an hundred <hi>Livres</hi> in <hi>Florence,</hi> does but labour in vain.
We don't find therefore that <hi>Lucca,</hi> nor any other City
are emptying <hi>Florence</hi> of its Money to re-coin it, since
the Exchange has every way levell'd and made it
equal.</p>
            <p>28. It is not fit then, that because others debase their
Money, you do so too. Rather let what has been once
receiv'd, always pass, because so the People are in no
danger of losing, of being cheated, or offended. The
<hi>Egyptians</hi> cut off both their Hands who falsified the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Weights and Measures. But what greater falsifying
can there be than diminishing the Money, that is, basely
to pilfer People of their Goods? <hi>Rome</hi> being straitn'd
by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and drain'd of Money, they coin'd their
<hi>Assis</hi> of one Ounce, that weigh'd twelve before. But
this was done by publick Advice in that Extremity, which
being over, all matters were settl'd as formerly. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
had it continu'd, does it not follow, <hi>that as Money
was brought down from twelve to one, so the Prices of things
would be rais'd from one to twelve?</hi> The old Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
that us'd to sell her dozen of Eggs for an
<hi>Assis</hi> of twelve Ounces, seeing it look now so deform'd,
and reduc'd to one Ounce, would have said, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
either give me an <hi>Assis</hi> of twelve Ounces, or twelve
of those paultry ones that weigh but one Ounce; or
I'll give you an Egg apiece for your <hi>Asses;</hi> chuse which
you will.</p>
            <p>25. Remove then all the thoughts of <hi>debasing the Coin,</hi>
and pluck up the Seeds of this Mischief. Let not the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55019:13"/>
               <hi>Mint</hi> gain by any means; for truly 'tis a most scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
business to lessen other Peoples Metal that is sent
thither to be coin'd. <hi>Greediness</hi> is a Crime that was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
by God with the Death of <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest in
<hi>Shilo,</hi> and with that of his two Sons <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi>
his Ministers, who cut off, for their own Tables, the best
of every Offering brought them to sacrifice. The Gentiles
did better, who eat all the Victim except the Fat that
run out of it, as if the Gods would have the Soul only
for their share, so <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi> say:
<q>
                  <l>Gnarus ut accepto veneretur carmine Divos;</l>
                  <l>Omentum in Flamma pingue liquefaciens.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>26. Now to take away all Temptation of Gain, to
wash off all the Marks of it, and to make this Matter cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable,
plain, and safe, <hi>command that Money pass according
to its intrinsick Value,</hi> that is, for as much Gold or Silver
as there is in it; and <hi>that Money of the same Allay be worth
as much in Bar, as when it is coin'd:</hi> so that the Metal,
like an amphibious Animal, may without any Expence
indifferently pass from Bullion into Coin, and from Coin
into Bullion. In a word, let the Mint deliver out the
same Metal in Money that it receiv'd in to coin. Would
you have then, some will say, the Mint to bear all the
Expence? Yes certainly; many eminent Civil Lawyers
contend that the Publick must be at the Charge of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
this <hi>Blood</hi> in the Common-wealth, as they pay
the Souldiers, and the Salaries of Magistrates for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Liberty and Justice. Others think it equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
that Money should pay its own <hi>Minting,</hi> by being
<hi>made somewhat worse, and yet of more Value than so much
Bullion,</hi> like Vessels, Furniture, or other things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55019:13"/>
any Labour is bestow'd. So, very often the
Workmanship is of greater Value than the Materials,
as those two Beakers of Silver wrought by <hi>Mentor,</hi>
which <hi>Lucius Crassus</hi> the Orator bought for 2500 <hi>Florins</hi>
of Gold, yet never drunk out of them afterwards.
And the Husbands of our time can tell whether the
Embroideries and other little Trangums of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
cost 'em more than the Clothes they are to set
off.</p>
            <p>26. After all, the old Custom of Money's paying
its own <hi>Coinage,</hi> (the People looking on and suffering
it) pleads Prescription, and the Prince is in Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. I shall not dispute with my Masters; but
I may say that if the <hi>Mint</hi> ought not to bear this
Charge, yet it should be made as easy as possible,
and the Stamps be rather less beautiful. But why
should not we return (as some desire it) to the old
way of <hi>casting Money?</hi> for it has all the Advantages
that can be wish'd. Two Stamps of Steel can mark
both sides of a Piece in two Molds of Copper, so
that two Men without any more Expences than Waste,
Boiling, and Coals, may in one day coin any great Sum in
pieces of equal Weight and Fineness, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
more apt to discover clipping or counterfeiting.
For Money that is made of false Metal, if it be of
any ordinary Body, cannot escape being found out by
its Weight in the Scales; and if it be broader or nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower,
thicker or thinner than it should be, it cannot
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpose upon the Eyes. Nor had it been more than
Justice, if Officers were appointed to see it melted,
allay'd, and cast before the People within those Iron
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55019:14"/>
Grates, ordain'd for that purpose by our good and wise
old Citizens, after the Example of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
perform'd all this nice business of Money in the
Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> the Doors being set wide open, <hi>that the
People might freely see what so nearly concern'd them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>27. Who does not perceive that by such means as
these we might eradicate those pernicious Weeds of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
Fraud, and Gain; which being only lopt, never
fail to grow again, and to debase the Coin? Lastly, I
shall add as a <hi>Corollary,</hi> that <hi>Traffick</hi> has so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and difficulty in it upon the account of this blessed
Money, that it would be better perhaps to do without
it, and to pass our Gold and Silver by Weight and Size,
as they did in the Primitive Times, and is still us'd in
<hi>China,</hi> where they always carry about them their Shears
and Scales, and have nothing to fear but the <hi>Allay,</hi> which
by <hi>Vse</hi> and the <hi>Touchstone</hi> is easily discover'd.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Generation of Metals; the Excellency
of Gold and Silver; the Origin of buying and selling,
with that of Money; when, why, and by whom Money
was first invented and us'd; of the Names, of the Essence,
and the Importance thereof; of its debasing, and the
Causes of it, with the Damages and Scandals that are
the Consequences of it, and their proper Remedies; let
it suffice, most patient Auditors, to have discours'd those
few things, by me thought convenient for this time and
place; not for your Instruction, Gentlemen, but for your
Entertainment.</p>
