            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Brief Discourse of a Passage by the
North-Pole to Japan, China, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AMong the many Essaies that have been made to find
a neer Passage to <hi>Iapan, China,</hi> &amp;c. the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
and likely hath as yet (in my opinion) been
over-seen, or at least not attempted. And therefore I
shall hereby communicate my Conceptions to Publick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
or censure. It is that a Passage may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be about the <hi>North-Pole.</hi> And the Reason inducing
me to conceive so, is, That we have no certainty from all
the Discoveries that have been made of any Land lying
within 8 degrees about the <hi>Pole:</hi> But on the contrary, that
I have credibly been informed by a Steer-man of a <hi>Dutch
Greenland</hi> Ship, that there is a free and open Sea under the
very <hi>Pole,</hi> and somewhat beyond it. And I for my own
part give credit to his Relation, and do conceive that any
sober ingenious Man would do the like, did he know in
what an honest manner, and by what an un-interessed acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
I hapned to hear it; For thus it was: Being about
22 years ago in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> I went into a Drinking-house
to drink a cup of Beer for my thirst, and sitting by the
publick Fire, among several People there hapned a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to come in, who seeing a Friend of his there, who he
knew went in the <hi>Greenland</hi> Voyage, wondred to see him,
because it was not yet time for the <hi>Greenland</hi> Fleet to
come home, and ask'd him what accident brought him
home so soon: His Friend (who was the Steer-man afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
in a <hi>Greenland</hi> Ship that Summer) told him that their
Ship went not out to Fish that Summer, but only to take in
the Lading of the whole Fleet, to bring it to an early Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, said he, before the Fleet had caught Fish e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110254:3"/>
to lade us, we, by order of the <hi>Greenland</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Sailed into the <hi>North-Pole,</hi> and came back again. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
(his Relation being <hi>Novel</hi> to me) I entred discourse
with him, and seem'd to question the truth of what he said.
But he did ensure me it was true, and that the Ship was then
in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and many of the Seamen belonging to her
to justifie the truth of it: And told me moreover, that they
sailed 2 degrees beyond the <hi>Pole.</hi> I askt him, if they found
no Land or Islands about the <hi>Pole?</hi> He told me No, there
was a free and open Sea; I askt him if they did not meet
with a great deal of Ice? He told me No, they saw no Ice.
I askt him what Weather they had there? He told me fine
warm Weather, such as was at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in the Summer
time, and as hot. I should have askt him more questions,
but that he was ingaged in discourse with his Friend, and
I could not in modesty interrupt them longer. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Steer-man spoke matter of fact and truth, for he
seem'd a plain honest and unaffectatious Person, and one
who could have no design upon me.</p>
            <p>But though I believe this story, yet methinks I hear
many object against it, and are apt to urge three seeming
Reasons to prove it false, or at least some particulars
of his Relation. And first, That it cannot be warm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Pole,</hi> because that about <hi>Greenland,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parts less Northerly, the Sea is so full of great Bodies
of Ice, that Ships can hardly sail for it. Secondly, Or if
warm, yet not so warm as at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in the Summer
time, because the farther Northerly the colder Weather.
Thirdly, Or if they were under the <hi>Pole,</hi> that they could
not tell how to come back, but that they might as well go
farther from, as return nearer to home, because the <hi>Needle</hi>
pointing always North, they must needs lose themselves in
the <hi>North-Pole,</hi> where it must indifferently respect all points
of the Horizon alike.</p>
            <p>One Answer may serve to the first and second Objection;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110254:3"/>
That it cannot be warm under the <hi>North-Pole,</hi> &amp;c. If we
consult the Experience of Travellers and Navigators, we
are told that between the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> nay under the <hi>Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial</hi>
is generally as moderate Weather as here in <hi>England</hi>
in Summer time. Why may it not then be as warm under
the <hi>Pole,</hi> as here or at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in the Summer time? The
small height the Sun hath there can be no exception, for
then we having the Sun in its Summer Solstice in lesser Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
than between the Tropicks, it must needs be much
colder here, which is contradicted. But one Reason why
it is as warm here as between the Tropicks, is, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Tropicks the Sun remains scarce above 12 hours
of 24 above the Horizon to warm it, when as here it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
almost 17 hours of 24 above the Horizon, and
therefore leaves a greater impression of heat upon it: And
the farther Northward we go the longer it remains above
the Horizon, and less under the Horizon every 24 hours, till
we come within the Arctick Circle, where the Sun remains
for half a year together, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Summer above the
Horizon, and never sets: And therefore though his beams
are not so perpendicular yet they must needs cause a great
degree of heat upon the Horizon.</p>
            <p>And if it be argued that it is so cold about <hi>Greenland,
&amp;c.</hi> and the Seas so full of Ice that Ships can hardly sail
for it, yet cannot that Argument prove that it is so about
the <hi>Pole:</hi> Because the Ice is made about shoars of Land,
but never in open Sea, and comes there only by strength
of Currents, or high Winds, which does indeed carry it
some small distance from the shoar. But as this Relator said
there is under the Pole a free and open Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
void of Ice, in Summer time at least. Besides, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
tells us, that all Land-briezes are colder than those
that come from Sea, and therefore it may be cold about
<hi>Greenland,</hi> because of the Land, and yet warm under the
<hi>Pole,</hi> where the Sea is open, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:110254:4"/>
The third Objection is, that if they were under the <hi>Pole,</hi>
they could not tell how to come back, because of the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
the <hi>Needle</hi> should bear to every point of the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I examined not my Relator upon this Argument,
though when I was parted from him I was sorry I did
not. But it is easie to apprehend how to guide a Ship
either forward or backward by an Observation of the
Sun a little before you enter the <hi>Pole:</hi> for by finding in
or near what Meridian it is, or upon what part of the Ship
it bears, whether on Head or Stern, on Starboard or Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
you may measure Time near enough with a Glass,
to know several daies after in or near what Meridian the
Sun is at any known or estimate time, and consequently
know how to proceed forwards, or come back with your
Ship. Or if the <hi>Moon</hi> have North Latitude you may do
the same by the Moon. But if the <hi>Pole</hi> were Traded,
in short time it might be found by Variation of the <hi>Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi>
for there is doubtless Variation in it, and in all the
Meridians about it several Variations.</p>
            <p>Thus far it appears there is a free and open Sea in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time (at least) about the <hi>North-Pole.</hi> But I shall add
another Relation of one <hi>Iames Ben,</hi> whose Father lived
about five years ago in Crown-Court in <hi>Russel-street</hi> in
<hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and himself lives now in <hi>Wapping.</hi> This
Mr. <hi>Ben</hi> sailed to <hi>Iapan</hi> with the <hi>Dutch</hi> as a Carpenter of
the Ship, and he told me that that Year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1668. he was
newly come home from <hi>Iapan:</hi> I askt him how long they
were under way home from thence? He told me he could
not well tell, because when they set out from <hi>Iapan</hi> the
Captain commanded the Steer-man to sail due North,
and they did sail from thence about 400 <hi>Dutch</hi> Miles,
which is almost 27 degrees due North. I askt him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they met with no Land or Islands? as I had done
before the <hi>Dutch Greenland</hi> Steer-man: He told me No,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110254:4"/>
they saw no Land, but that there was a free and open
Sea so far as they Sailed, nor any sign of Land appeared.
I askt him why they sailed so far Northward? He told me
he could not tell, only the Captain commanded it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But I suppose the <hi>East India</hi> Company commanded the
Captain either to make a Discovery of Land to encrease
Trade, or to satisfie themselves with the knowledge of an
open Sea, that when they saw Reason they might expedite
their Voyages between <hi>Holland</hi> and those parts that way.
I was thus Inquisitive with him, because ever since I heard
the former Relation of the <hi>Greenland</hi> Steer-man, I harped
at a Passage through or about the <hi>North Pole</hi> to <hi>Iapan,
China,</hi> &amp;c. and by these two Discoveries it appears very
probable that there is so, and that it is passable in Summer
time.</p>
            <p>I come to a third Relation, not only of the probability,
but of the certainty of a Passage found by the <hi>Russians</hi>
this last year, as it came to the hands of the Secretary of
the <hi>Royal Society</hi> from <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> by a Correspondent of
his; which in <hi>Transact.</hi> Numb. 101. run in these words:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <head>A Letter, and Map, not long since sent to the Publisher, by an

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Herewith send you what I have received out of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi>
which is a New Mapp of <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> and <hi>Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats,</hi>
as it hath been discover'd by the express order of the
<hi>Czar;</hi> and drawn by a Painter, called <hi>Panelapoetski,</hi> who
sent it me from <hi>Mosco</hi> for a Present: by which it appears,
That <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> is not an Island, as hitherto it hath been
believed to be; and that the <hi>Mare glaciale</hi> is not a Sea,
but a <hi>Sinus</hi> or Bay, the waters whereof are sweet, which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110254:5"/>
is the same with what the <hi>Tartars</hi> do also assure us, who
have tasted those waters in the very midst of the <hi>Sinus.</hi>
The <hi>Samojeds</hi> as well as the <hi>Tartars</hi> do unanimously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that passing on the back of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> at a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
distance from the shore, Navigators may well pass
as far as <hi>Iapan.</hi> And 'tis a great fault in the <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Dutch,</hi> that seeking to get to <hi>Iapan</hi> on the South-side of
<hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> they have almost always passed the <hi>Weigats.</hi>
The letter <hi>O</hi> in the great River <hi>Oby</hi> marks the place of a
Cataract or Fall of waters. The letter <hi>K</hi> denotes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of <hi>Zembla</hi> with the Continent. The River mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<hi>L,</hi> runs toward <hi>China,</hi> called <hi>Kitaie:</hi> which is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where navigable, by reason of the rocks and other
inconveniencies that obstruct the passing of Vessels. <hi>Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats</hi>
it self is very difficult to pass, because of the great
quantity of Ice, conrinually falling into it out of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
