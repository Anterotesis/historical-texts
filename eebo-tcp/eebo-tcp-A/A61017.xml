            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

so great Love to
<hi>Reason,</hi> that, this
<hi>RATIONALE</hi>
may even for its
<hi>Name,</hi> hope for acceptation, which it
will the sooner have, if the Reader
know, that the Author vents it not for
a full and just, much less a publick
and authentick Piece, but as his own
private Essay (wholly submitted to
the censure of our Holy Mother <hi>The
<pb facs="tcp:99745:4"/>
Church,</hi> and the Reverend Fathers
of the same, and) composed on purpose
to keep some from moving that way,
which, it is feared, some will say, it
leads to. The Authors design was not,
by <hi>Rhetorick</hi> first to Court the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
and then by their help, to
carry the <hi>understanding.</hi> But quite
contrary, by <hi>Reason</hi> to work upon the
<hi>Judgment,</hi> and leave <hi>that</hi> to deal
with the <hi>affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Poor <hi>Liturgy</hi> suffers from
two extreams, one sort says, <hi>it is old
superstitious Roman Dotage.</hi>
The other, <hi>it is Schismatically
New.</hi> This Book endeavours to shew
particularly, what Bishop <hi>JEWEL</hi>
(Apol. p. 117.) says in general,
1. <hi>That it is agreeable to PRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITIVE
USAGE,</hi> and so,
not <hi>Novel. 2. THAT IT IS
<pb facs="tcp:99745:5"/>
A REASONABLE SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VICE,</hi>
and so, not <hi>Superstitious.</hi>
As for those that love it, and suffer for
the love of it, this will shew them
<hi>Reasons,</hi> why they should suffer on,
and love it still more<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and more. To
end, if the Reader will cast his Eye
upon the sad Confusions in point
of prayer, (wherein are such
contradictions made as God Almighty
cannot grant) and lay them as <hi>Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish</hi>
under these <hi>Fundamental
Considerations;</hi> First, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Set Forms</hi> (of Petition, Blessing,

Secondly, How much of the
Liturgy <hi>is very Scripture;</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
How admirable a Thing <hi>Unity,
Unity</hi> in Time, Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is; Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:99745:5"/>
How many Millions of poor souls
are in the world; ignorant, infirm by
nature, age, accidents, (as blindness,
deafness, loss of speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which
respectively may receive help by <hi>Set
Forms,</hi> but cannot so well (or not
at all) by extemporary voluntary effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and then upon all these will build
what he reads in this Book; he will,
if not be convinced to joyn in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with, yet perhaps be so sweetned,
as more readily to pardon those, who
still abiding in their former judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

do use <hi>THE ANCIENT

RATIONALE
upon the

            <p>THe COMMON-PRAYER-BOOK
contains in it many holy
Offices of the Church: As Prayers,
Confession of Faith, holy Hymns,
Divine Lessons, Priestly Absolutions and
Benedictions: all which are <hi>Set</hi> and <hi>Prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
not left to private mens fancies to make
or alter; so was it of old ordained CON.
CARTHAG. Can. 106. <hi>It is ordained that the
Prayers, Prefaces, Impositions of hands which
are confirmed by the Synod, be observed and
used by all men.</hi> These and no other. So is our
<hi>English</hi> Can. 13. The COUNCIL of MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEVIS
gives the reason of this Constitution,
Can. 12: <hi>[Lest through ignorance or careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
any thing contrary to the Faith should be
vented or uttered before God, or offered up to
him in the Church.]</hi>

And as these Offices are set and prescribed,
so are they moreover appointed to be <hi>one</hi> and
the same throughout the whole National
Church. So was it of old ordained, CON.

according to our Lords general rules,
by those to whom he hath left a Commission
and power to order and govern his Church,
is the right publick Service and worship of
God, commanded by himself in his Law; for
though God hath not immediately and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
appointed <hi>this publick worship,</hi> yet
he hath in general commanded a publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the second Commandment. For where
it is said, <hi>Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor
worship them,</hi> by the rule of contraries, we are
Commanded to bow down to God and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Him. A public worship then God must
have<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by his own Command; and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of the Church, have prescribed this
form of worship, for that publick service and
worship of God in this Church, which being
so prescribed, becomes Gods service and
worship by his own Law, as well as the Lamb
was his sacrifice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>For the clearer understanding of this, we
must know, that some Laws of Gods, do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some humane act to pass and intervene,
before they actually bind: which act of man
being once passed, they bind immediately.
For example, <hi>Thou shalt not steal,</hi> is Gods
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99745:9"/>
Law, which Law cannot bind actually, till
men be possest of some goods and property;
which property is not usually determined by
God himself immediately, but by the Laws
of him, to whom he hath given Authority to
determine it. <hi>God hath given the earth to the
children of men,</hi> as he gave Canaan to the
Israelites in general; but men cannot say this
is mine, till hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ane Laws or acts determine
the property, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> could not claim
a property on this or that side <hi>Iordan,</hi> till
<hi>Moses</hi> had assigned them their several porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
But wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n their portions were so assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they might say, this is mine, by Gods, as

God, Law too, that says, <hi>Thou shalt not steal.</hi>
In like manner; God hath in general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a publick worship and service, but
hath not, under the Gospel, assigned the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
form and method; That he hath left
to his Ministers and Delegates, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of the Church to determine agreeable to
his general rules; which being so determin'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
is Gods service and worship not only by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
but even by divine Law also: and all
other publick services whatsoever, made by
private men, to whom God hath given no
such Commission are <hi>strange worship, Lev.</hi> 10.
1. Because not Commanded; for example, As
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99745:9"/>
under the Law, when God had appointed a
<hi>Lamb</hi> for a burnt-offering, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
was the right daily worship, <hi>The savour
of rest,</hi> because Commanded, and all other
sacrifices whatsoever, offered up in the place
of that, though of far more value and price
than a Lamb, suppose 20. Oxen, would have
been strange Sacrifice; so now, the publick
worship of God prescribed as we have said,
by Those to whom he hath given Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is the only true and right publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and all other forms and methods offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in stead of that, though never so exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawn, are strange worship, because not
Commanded. It is not the elegancy of the
phrase, nor the fineness of the Composition
that makes it acceptable to God, as his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and service, but obedience is the thing
accepted. <hi>Behold to obey is better than sacrifice,
or any fat of Rams, 1 Sam. 15. 22.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This holy service offered up to God by the
Priest, in the name of the Church, is far more
acceptable to Almighty God, then the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of any private man.</p>
               <p>For, First, it is the service of the whole
Church, to which, every man that holds Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with that Church, hath consented to
and said Amen, and agreed, that it should be
offered up to God by the Priest in the name
of the Church, and, if <hi>what any two of you shall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99745:10"/>
agree to ask upon earth, it shall be granted,</hi>
S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 19. How much more, what is
ask'd of God or offered up to God by the
common vote and joynt desire of the whole
body of the Church?</p>
               <p>Besides, this publick service and worship
of God is Commanded by God, (i. e. by
those whom he hath impowr'd to command
and appoint it) to be offered up to him in the
behalf of the Church, and therefore must
needs be most acceptable to him, which is so
appointed by him: For, what he Commands
he accepts most certainly. Private devotions
and services of particular men which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by themselves, for themselves, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
accepted, sometimes refused by God,
according as the persons are affected to vice
or virtue; but this publick worship is like
that Lamb, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. commanded to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by the Priest for others, for the Church,
and therefore accepted, whatsoever the Priest
be that offers it up. And therefore, King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
prayes, Psal. 141. 2. <hi>Let the lifting up of
my hands be an evening Sacrifice,</hi> i. e. as sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted as that Evening Sacrifice of the
Lamb, which no indevotion or sin of the
Priest could hinder, but that it was most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
accepted for the Church, because com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be offered for the Church, S. <hi>Chrys.</hi>
Hom. in Psal. 140.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99745:10"/>
This publick service is accepted of God,
not only for those that are present and say
<hi>Amen</hi> to it, but for all those that are absent
upon just cause, even for all that do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
Communion with it and the Church,
for it is the Common service of them all,
Commanded to be offered up in the names of
them all, and agreed to by all of them to be
offered up for them all, and therefore is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
for all them, though presented to God
by the Priest alone (as the Lamb offered up
to God, by the Priest, <hi>Ex.</hi> 29. was the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the whole Congregation of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel,) <hi>a sweet smelling savour,</hi> a
<hi>savour of rest,</hi> to pacifie God Almighty daily,
and to continue his favour to them, and make
him dwell with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 42, 45.</p>
               <p>Good reason therefore it is, that this sweet
smelling savour should be daily offered up to
God <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening,</hi> whereby God
may be pacified and invited to dwell amongst
his people. And whatsoever the world think;
thus to be the <hi>Lords Remembrancers</hi> putting
him in mind of the peoples wants. <hi>Esay</hi> 62.
<hi>Being as it were the Angels of the Lord,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding
for the people, and carrying up the
daily prayers of the Church in their behalf,
is one of the most useful and principal parts
of the Priests office. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, who
in the 1 Ep. <hi>Tim.</hi> chap. 2. Exhorts Bishop
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99745:11"/>
                  <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he should take care, <hi>First of all,</hi>
that this holy service be offered up to God. <hi>I
exhort first of all, that prayers, and supplications,
intercessions and giving of thanks</hi> be made for
all men. <hi>For KINGS,</hi> &amp;c. <q>
                     <hi>What is the
meaning of this</hi> first of all? <hi>I will that this
holy service be offered up daily, and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
know, how we observe this rule of</hi> S. <hi>paul,
offering up daily this holy sacrifice Morning
and Evening.</hi>
                  </q> S. <hi>Chrys. upon the place.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi>
in the first Chapter of this Epistle at the 18.
verse, had charged his son <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>war a
good warfare, to hold faith and a good conscience,</hi>
and presently adds, <hi>I exhort therefore, that first
of all prayers</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be made,</hi> as if he had said,
you cannot possibly hold faith and a good
conscience in your Pastoral office, unless,
<hi>First of all,</hi> you be careful to make and offer
up prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this is the first thing to
be done and most highly to be regarded by
you. Preaching is a very useful part of the
Priests office; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi>
to <hi>preach the word, be instant in season, out
of season.</hi> And the more because He was a
Bishop, and to plant and water many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the Infancy of Christianity among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Seducers and Temptations: But yet <hi>First
of all</hi> he exhorts, that this daily office of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
prayers to the throne of grace in the
behalf of the Church, be carefully lookt to.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99745:11"/>
This charge of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Tim.</hi> holy Church
here laies upon all those that are admitted into
that holy office of the Ministery, that they
should offer up to God this holy sacrifice of
prayers, praises and thanksgivings, this <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of rest, daily, Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening:</hi>
And would all those whom it concerns, look
well to this part of their office, I should not
doubt, but that God would be as gracious
and bountiful to us in the performance of
this service, as he promised to be to the Jews
in the offering of the Lamb <hi>Morning</hi> and
<hi>Evening, Exod.</hi> 29. 43, 44. He would meet
us and speak with us, that is graciously an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
our petitions: he would dwell with us,
and be our God, and we should know, by
comfortable experiments of his great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
blessings, that he is the Lord our God.</p>

this is to prepare their hearts (which it does

And this Absolution is an Act of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

<hi>Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. Which power of remitting sins</hi> was
not to end with the Apostles, but is a part of
the Ministry of Reconciliation, as necessary
now as it was then, and therefore to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
as long as the Ministery of Reconciliation,
that is, to the end of the world. <hi>Ep.</hi> 4. 12, 13.
When therefore the Priest absolves, God
absolves, if we be truly penitent: Now this
remission of sins granted here to the Priest,
to which God hath promised a confirmation
in heaven, <hi>is not the act of Preaching,</hi> or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing,
or admitting men to the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
For all these powers were given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this grant was made. As you may see

(though promised, S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 19.) till <hi>Now,</hi>
that is, after the Resurrection. As appears

that then it was given: And secondly, by

which he could not properly have used, if
they had been endued with this power before.
Therefore the power of Remitting, which
here God authorizes, and promises certain
assistance to, is neither Preaching nor Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
but some other way of Remitting,
namely, that which the Church calls Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if it be so, then to doubt of the
effect of it (supposing we be truly penitent,
and such as God will pardon) is to question
the truth of God: and he that under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of reverence to God denies or despises
this power, does injury to God in slighting
his Commission, and is no better than a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatian,</hi>
saies S. <hi>Ambrose l. 1. de Poenit. cap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>After the Priest hath pronounced the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
<hi>the Church seasonably prayes, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we beseech him to grant us true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and his holy spirit,</hi>
                  </hi> &amp;c. For as repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is a necessary disposition to pardon, so
as that neither God will, nor man can absolve
those that are impenitent; So is it in some
parts of it, a necessary consequent of pardon;
and he that is pardoned, ought still to repent,
as he that seeks a pardon. Repentance, say
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99745:14"/>
Divines, out to be continual. For whereas
Repentance consists of three parts, as the
Church teaches us in the Commination. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
or lamenting of our sinful lives. 2.
Knowledging and confessing our sins. 3. An
endeavour to bring forth fruits worthy
of penance, which the Ancients call satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Two of these, Contrition and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are requisite after pardon. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of sin though pardoned, must always
be grievous to us. For, to be pleased with
the remembrance of it, would be sin to us:
and for Satisfaction or amendment of life,
and bringing forth fruits worthy of penance,
that is not only necessary after pardon, but
it is the more necessary, because of pardon,
for divers reasons; as first, because imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after pardon, the Devil is most busie
to tempt us to sin, that we may thereby lose
our pardon, and he may so recover us again
to his captivity, from which, by pardon we
are freed: And therefore in our Lords pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
assoon as we have begg'd pardon, and
prayed <hi>Forgive us our trespasses,</hi> We are
taught to pray, <hi>And lead us not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
suffer us not to fall into sin again; which
very method holy Church here wisely inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
immediately after pardon pronounced,
directing us to pray for that part of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which consists in amendment of life,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99745:15"/>
and for the grace of Gods holy Spirit ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
us thereunto. Again, Repentance in
this part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> an endeavour of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life, is the more necessary upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
granted, because the grace of pardon, is
a new obligation to live well, and makes the
sin of him that relapsed after pardon the
greater, and therefore the pardoned had need
to pray, for that part of repentance and
the grace of Gods holy Spirit, that both his
present service and future life may please
God: that is, that he may observe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
rule given to him that was newly cured
and pardoned by him, that he may go away
and <hi>sin no more, lest a worse thing happen to

               <p>
                  <hi>There be three several forms of Absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Service. The first is that which is
used at Morning Prayer.</hi> Almighty God the
Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
hath given power and commandment to his
Ministers to declare and pronounce to his
people being penitent, the Absolution and
Remission of their sins. He pardoneth and
Absolveth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second is used at the Visitation of the
Sick.</hi> Our Lord Iesus Christ who hath
left power to his Church to absolve all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
which truly repent, of his great
mercy forgive thée: and by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99745:15"/>
committed to me, I absolve thée,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Third is at the Communion.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God our heavenly Father, who of
his great mercy hath promised forgiveness
of sins to all them that with hearty repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and true faith turn to him. Have
mercy upon you: pardon and forgive
you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All these several Forms, in sence and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
are the same; For as when a Prince hath
granted a Commission to any servant of his,
to release out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Prison all penitent offenders
whatsoever, it were all one in effect, as to
the Prisoners discharge, whether this servant
sayes, by virtue of a Commission granted to
me, under the Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

here I shew, I release this prisoner. Or thus,
The Prince who hath given me this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
He pardons you. Or lastly, The
Prince pardon and deliver you; the Prince
then standing by and confirming the word of
his Servant. So is it here all one as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sins in the penitent, whether the
Priest Absolves him after this form; Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God who hath given me and all Priests
power to pronounce pardon to the penitent,
<hi>He pardons you.</hi> Or thus, By vertue of a
Commission granted to me from God <hi>I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
you.</hi> Or lastly; <hi>God pardon you,</hi> namely,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99745:16"/>
by me his servant according to his promise,
whose sins ye remit, they are remitted. All
these are but several expressions of the same
thing, and are effectual to the penitent by
virtue of that Commission mentioned Saint
<hi>Ioh. 20. Whose sins ye remit, they are remitted.</hi>
Which Commission in two of these forms is
expressed, and in the Last, <hi>viz.</hi> that at the
Communion is sufficiently implyed and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
For the Priest is directed, in using this
form, <hi>to stand up and turn to the people. Rubr.
immediately before it.</hi> Which behaviour cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
signifies more than a bare prayer for
the people (for if it were only a prayer for
the people, he should not be directed <hi>to stand
and turn to the People</hi> when he speaks, but to
God from the people) this gesture of stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and turning to the people signifies a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of God to the people by the mouth of
his Priest, a part of his Ministery of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
a solemn application of pardon to
the penitent by Gods Minister, and is in sense
thus much, Almighty God pardon you by
me. Thus the Greek Church, from whom
this form is borrowed, uses to express it and
explain it. Almighty God pardon you, <hi>by me
his unworthy</hi> Servant, or Lord, pardon him,
<hi>for thou hast said, whose sins ye remit, they are
remitted;</hi> sometime expressing, always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
Gods Commission: So then in which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99745:16"/>
form soever of these the Absolution be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
it is in substance the same; an act
of authority by virtue of Christs Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
effectual to remission of sins in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</p>
               <p>Of all these Forms, the last, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Service
was most used in Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times by the Greek and Latin Church,
and scarce any other form to be found in their
Rituals or Eccles. History till about four
hundred years since, say some Learned Men.
But what then? is another Form unlawful?
Hath not the Church power to vary the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and to signifie Christs power gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her, provided the expression and words
be agreeable to the sense of that Commission?
But it may easily be shown that those other
Forms are not novelties. For even of old in
the Greek Church, there was used as full a
Form as any the Church of <hi>England</hi> uses:
It's true it was not written, nor set down in
their Rituals, but delivered from hand to
hand down to these times, and constantly used
by them in their private Absolutions. For
when the Penitent came to the Spiritual Man,
(so they call'd their Confessor,) for Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,

               <head>The LORDS PRAYER.</head>
               <p>THen follows the LORDS PRAYER.
The Church of Christ did use to begin
and end her Services with the Lords Prayer,
this being the Foundation upon which all other
Prayers should be built, therefore we begin
with it; that so the right Foundation being
laid, we may justly proceed to our ensuing
requests; <hi>Tertul. de orat.</hi> c. 9. And it being
the perfection of all prayer, therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
our prayers with it. S. <hi>Augustine Ep.</hi>
59. Let no Man therefore quarrel with the
Churches frequent use of the Lords Prayer.
For the Church Catholick ever did the same.
Besides, if we hope to have our prayers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of the Father only for his Sons sake,
why should we not hope to have them most
speedily accepted, when they are offered up
in his Sons own words?</p>
               <p>Both in this place and other parts of the
Service, where the Lords prayer is appointed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99745:17"/>
to be used, the Doxology, <hi>For thine is the
Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi> is left out. The reason is given
by Learned Men, because the Doxology is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o part of our Lords Prayer. For though in
S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. it be added in our usual Copies,
yet in the most ancient Manuscripts it is not
to be found, no nor in S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Copy, S. <hi>Luke</hi>
11. and therefore is thought to be added by
the Greek Church, who indeed use it in their
Liturgies (as the Jews before them did,) but
divided from the Prayer as if it were no part
of it. The Latin Church generally say it as
this Church does, without the Doxology fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
S. <hi>Lukes</hi> Copy, who setting down
our Lords Prayer exactly, with this <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi>
when you pray say, not after this
manner, as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it, but say, <hi>Our
Father, &amp;c.</hi> leaves out the Doxology: and
certainly it can be no just matter of offence
to any reasonable Man, that the Church uses
that Form which S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us was exactly
the prayer of our Lord.</p>
               <p>In some places, especially among those Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a most wise order of the Church
in assigning this place to these Verses: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
before the <hi>Psalms, Lesson</hi> and <hi>Collects:</hi>

when we meet together in the Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods Honour, the Church, to be
thankful to him, and speak good of his Name.
We must crave of God Almighty first par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of our sins, and then that he would put
a New Song in our mouths that they may
shew forth his praise. And because without
Gods Grace we can do nothing, and because
the Devil is then most busie to hinder us,
when we are most desirously bent to serve
God: therefore follow immediately those

being compos'd by the Spirit of God, which
cannot erre: whereas other Books of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Devotions are, for the most part,
compos'd by private men, subject to error
and mistake, whose fancies, sometimes wild
ones, are commended to us for matter of
devotion, and we may be taught to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme,
while we intend to adore; or at
least, to abuse our devotion when we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to the throne of grace, and offer
up an unclean Beast instead of an holy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
May we not think that this amongst
others hath been a cause of the decay of
right and true devotion in these latter
dayes, namely, the neglect of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Book, and preferring Mens fancies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it? I deny not but that Collects and
other parts of Devotion which the consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

especially the most divine <hi>Prayer</hi> of our

<hi>Davids</hi> Psalms disused, but used frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and made as they were by <hi>Athanasius</hi> and
S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> a great, if not the greatest part
of our private devotions, which we may
offer up to God as with more safety, so
with more confidence of acceptation being

Psalms too hard for him to understand,

trial awhile, and spend that time in them,
which he spends in humane compositions,
let him study them as earnestly, as he does
books of less concernment; let him pray
the holy Spirit that made them, to open his
eyes, to see the admirable use of them;
let him intreat holy and learned guides
of Souls to direct him in the use of them, and

for this manner of Singing by course.</p>
               <p>First, that we may thus in a holy emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

which our LORD seeing and
hearing, is not a little pleas'd. <hi>Ter. l. 2. ad ux.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that one relieving another
we may not grow weary of our service. S.
<hi>Aug. l. Conf.</hi> 9. c. 7.</p>
               <p>When we say or sing these Psalms, we
are wont to <hi>stand,</hi> by the erection of our

up of our souls to God, while we are serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in these holy employments.</p>
               <p>At the end of every Psalm, and of all the
Hymns, (except TE DEUM, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is nothing else almost, but this, <hi>Glory
be to the Father, &amp;c.</hi> enlarg'd, hath not
this Doxology added) we say or sing <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be to the Father, and to the Son, and
to the holy Ghost;</hi> which was the use of
the ancient Church, never quarrel'd at by
any till <hi>Arius,</hi> who, being prest with this
usage as an argument against his Heresie of
making the Son inferiour to the Father, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to corrupt this Versicle, saying
[<hi>Glory be to the Father by the Son, in the
Holy Ghost. Theodoret,</hi> Hist. l. 2. c. 24.] The
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99745:22"/>
Church on the contrary was careful to
maintain the ancient usage, adding on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against <hi>Arrius, <hi>As it was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,

of Glory, have any use in the Church of
God, can we place it more fitly, than
where it now serves as a close, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Psalms and Hymns, whose proper
subject and almost only matter, is a dutiful
acknowledgment of Gods excellency and
glory by occasion of special effects?</p>
               <p>As an Hymn of Glory is fit to conclude
the Psalms, so especially this Christian
Hymn, wherein as Christians (not as Jews
and Pagans) we glorifie God the Father,
Son, and holy Ghost; by which Christian
conclusion of <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, we do, as it
were, fit this part of the Old Testament
for the Service of God under the Gospel,
and make them Evangelical Offices.</p>

to shew the harmony of them: for what
is the Law but the Gospel foreshewed:
what other the Gospel, but the Law ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled?
That which lies in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as under a shadow, is in the New,
brought out into the open Sun: things
there prefigured are here perform'd. Thus
as the two Seraphims cry one to another,
<hi>Holy, holy, holy, Esay</hi> 6. 3. So the two Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Old and New, faithfully agreeing,
convince the sacred truth of God. First,
one out of the Old Testament, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of the New, observing the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of the holy Spirit, who first publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Old, then the New; first the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of the Law, then of the Gospel,
<hi>Which method of their reading either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
did tend, or at the least wise doth
fitly serve, that from smaller things the mind
of the hearers may go forward to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

               </p>
               <p>A wise constitution of the Church it is,
thus to mingle Services of several forts, to
keep us from wearisomness. For whereas
devout Prayer is joyned with a vehement
intention of the inferior powers of the soul,
which cannot therein continue long without
pain, therefore holy Church interposes still
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99745:23"/>
somewhat for the higher part of the mind,
the understanding, to work upon, that both
being kept in continual exercise with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
neither might feel any weariness, and
yet each be a spur to other. For Prayer
kindles our desire to behold God by specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
and the mind delighted with that
speculation, takes every where new inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
to pray; the riches of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of heavenly wisdom continually stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up in us correspondent desires to
them; so that he which prayes in due sort,
is thereby made the more attentive to hear,
and he which hears, the more earnest to
pray.</p>

Rubr. 2. before <hi>Te Deum.</hi> Turning himself
so as he may best be heard of all, that is,
turning towards the people, whereby it
appears that immediately before the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he lookt another way from the people,
because here he is directed to turn towards
them. This was the ancient custom of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the Priest who
did officiate, in all those parts of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which were directed to the people,
turn'd himself towards them, as in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
See the Rubr. before Absol. at
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99745:24"/>
the Communion. <hi>Then shall the Priest
or Bishop if present, stand and turning
himself to the people say, &amp;c.</hi> So in the
Benediction, reading of the Lessons, and
holy Commandments: but in those parts
of the office which were directed to God
immediately, as Prayers, Hymns, Lauds,
Confessions of Faith, or Sins, he turn'd
from the people; and for that purpose in
many Parish-Churches of late, the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Pew
had one Desk for the Bible, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the people to the Body of the
Church, another for the Prayer-Book
looking towards the East or upper end of
the Chancel. And very reasonable was
this usage; for when the people were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to, it was fit to look towards them;
but when God was spoken to, it was fit to
turn from the people. And be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ides, if there
be any part of the World more honourable,
in the esteem of Men, than another, it is fit
to look that way when we pray to God in
publick, that the turning of our bodies
towards a more honourable place, may
mind us of the great honour and majesty of
the person we speak to. <q>And this reason
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> gives of the Churches an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
custom of turning to the East in
their publick prayers, because the East is
the most honourable part of the World,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99745:24"/>
being the Region of Light, whence the
glorious Sun arises,</q> 
                  <hi>Aug. l. 2. de Ser. Dom.
in Monte</hi> c. 5. That this was the constant
practice of the Church to turn toward the
East in her publick prayers may suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
appear by S. <hi>Augustin</hi> in the place last
cited, where he sayes, <hi>Cum ad orationes
stamus, ad Orientem Convertimur; When
we stand at our prayers, we turn towards
the East.</hi> And by <hi>Epiphan.</hi> l. 1. haer. 19. c. 19.
who there detests the madness of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor
<hi>Elzaeus,</hi> because that <hi>amongst other
things he forbad praying toward the East.</hi>
And the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to conform to the ancient practices,
as far as conveniently she can, as may be
seen in many passages of her Canons and
other places, did observe the same custom
in her prayers, as appears by the placing
of the Desk for the Prayer-book above
mentioned, looking that way, and as may
be collected from this Rubrick, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
the Priest in the reading of the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to turn to the people, which supposes
him, at prayer and the Psalms to look
quite another way, namely, as in reason
may be concluded, that way which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church uses to do for divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
and amongst other, for that which
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> hath given, because That was
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99745:25"/>
                  <hi>the most worthy part of the World,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
most fit to be lookt to when we come
to worship God in the Beauty of Holiness.
Again, another reason may be given of
turning from the people towards the upper
end of the Chancel in our Prayers, because
it is fit in our prayers to look towards that
part of the Church or Chancel, which is
the highest and chief, and where God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
his most gracious and mysterious
presence, and that is the holy Table and
Altar, which anciently was placed towards
the upper or East end of the Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cel. This
is the highest part of the Chancel, set apart
to the highest of Religious Services, the
consecration and distribution of the holy
Eucharist, here is exhibited the most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and mysterious presence of God that
in this life we are capable of, the presence
of his most holy Body and Blood. And
therefore the Altar was usually call'd the
Tabernacle of Gods Glory, His Chair of
State, the Throne of God, the Type of
Heaven, Heaven it self. As therefore the
Jews in their Prayers lookt towards the
principal part of the Temple, the Mercy-Seat,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 28. 2. So the Christians in their
prayers turned towards the principal part
of the Church, the Altar, of which the
Mercy-Seat is but a type. And as our Lord
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99745:25"/>
hath taught us in his Prayer, to look up
towards Heaven when we pray, saying,
<hi>Our Father which art in Heaven;</hi> not as
if God were there confin'd, for he is every
where, in Earth as well as in Heaven, but
because <hi>Heaven is his Throne,</hi> whereas
<hi>Earth</hi> is but <hi>his Foot-stool;</hi> so holy Church
by her practice teaches us in our publick
and solemn prayers to turn and look, not
towards the inferior and lower parts of the
Footstool, but towards that part of the
Church which most nearly resembles Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the holy Table or Altar. Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to this practice, was the manner of the
Jews of old, for at the reading of the Law
and other Scriptures, he that did Minister,
turned his face to the people, but he who
read the prayers, turned his back to the
people, and his face to the Ark. Mr.
<hi>THORNDYKE</hi> of <hi>Relig. Assem.</hi>
pag. 231.</p>
               <p>For the choice of these Lessons and their
Order, holy Church observes a several
course.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Morning and Evening
prayers she observes only this: to begin
at the beginning of the year with <hi>Genesis</hi>
for the first Lesson, and S. <hi>Matthew</hi> for
the Second in the Morning: and <hi>Genesis</hi>
again for the First, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:99745:26"/>
for the Second Lesson at Even, and
so continues on till the Books be read over,
but yet leaving out some Chapters, either
such as have been read already, upon which
account she omits the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> being for
the most part the same with the book of
<hi>Kings</hi> which hath been read already; and
some particular Chapters in some other
Books: having been the same for the most
part read either in the same book or some
other: or else such as are full of Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
or some other matter, which holy
Church counts less profitable for ordinary
hearers, Only in this she alters the order
of the books, not reading the prophet
<hi>Esay,</hi> till all the rest of the books be done:
Because the Prophet: <hi>Esay</hi> being the most
Evangelical Prophet, most plainly prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying
of Christ, is reserved to be read a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before ADVENT.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Sundayes</hi> somewhat another course
is observed; for then <hi>Genesis</hi> is begun to
be read upon <hi>Septuagesima Sunday;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then begins the holy time of penance
and mortification, to which <hi>Genesis</hi> is
thought to suit best, because that treats of
our misery by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of
Gods severe judgment upon the world for
sin: Then we read forward the books as
they lye in order, yet not all the books,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99745:26"/>
but only some choice Lessons out of them.
And if any Sunday be, as they call it, <hi>a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
day;</hi> that is, if it hath the history
of it expressed in Scripture, such as <hi>Easter,
Whit sunday,</hi> &amp;c. then there are peculiar and
proper Lessons appointed for it.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Saints dayes</hi> we observe another or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
for upon them (except such of them
as are especially recorded in Scripture, and
have proper Lessons) the Church appoints
Chapters out of the moral books, such as
<hi>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiasticus</hi> and
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> for first Lessons, being excellent
instructions of life and conversation, and
so fit to be read upon the daies of holy
Saints, whose exemplary lives and deaths,
are the cause of the Churches Solemn
Commemoration of them, and Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of them to us. And though some of
these books be not, in the strictest sense,
Canonical, yet I see no reason, but that
they may be read publickly in the Church,
with profit and more safety, than Sermons
can be ordinarily preacht there. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Sermons are but humane Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and many of them not so wholsome
matter, as these which have been viewed
and allowed by the judgment of the Church
for many ages past to be Ecclesiastical and
good, nearest to divine of any writings.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99745:27"/>
If it be thought dangerous to read them
after the same manner and order that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Scripture is read, lest perhaps by
this means they should grow into the same
credit with Canonical: It is answered,
that many Churches have thought it no
great hurt, if they should, but our Church
hath sufficiently secured us against that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
whatsoever it be, by setting different
marks upon them, styling the one Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
the other Apocryphal. As for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Lessons, the Church in them goes on
in her ordinary course.</p>

them into <hi>Millaine,</hi> to ease the peoples sad
minds and to keep them from weariness,
who were praying night and day for their

all Hymns almost to be called <hi>Ambrosiani,</hi>
because that by him they were spread over

were scarce any Priests left to administer to

the Hymns and Lauds of God were lost out of

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99745:28"/>
These Hymns are to be said or sung; <hi>but
most properly to be sung; else they are
not so strictly and truly called Hymns, that
is, Songs of praise; and not only by the

<hi>sayes S.</hi> Aug. in the Hymns and holy Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
being enforc'd thereunto by the sweet
voices of thy Melodious Church: <hi>by reason
of</hi> the proneness of our affections to that which
delights, it pleas'd the wisdom of the Spirit
to borrow from melody that pleasure, which
mingled with heavenly mysteries, causes the
smoothness and softness of that which touches
the ear, to conveigh as it were by stealth,
the treasure of good things into mens minds:
to this purpose were those harmonious tunes
of Psalms devised. <hi>And S.</hi> Basil. <hi>in Psal.</hi> By

or else two <hi>Psalms.</hi> And very fitly doth
the Church appoint sacred. Hymns after
Lessons: For who is there, that hearing
God speak from Heaven to him for his
fouls health, can do less than rise up and
praise him? and what Hymns can be fitter
to praise God with for our salvation, than
those which were the first gratulations,
wherewith our Saviour was entertained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world? And such are these. Yet as
fit as they are, some have quarrell'd them,
especially at <hi>Magnificat,</hi> [<hi>My soul doth
magnifie the Lord,</hi>] and <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi>
[or, <hi>Lord now lettest thou thy servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99745:29"/>
in peace.</hi>] The <hi>Objections</hi> are these:
That the first of these was the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
Hymn for bearing Christ in her womb:
The latter old <hi>Simeons,</hi> for seeing and
holding in his arms the blessed Babe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of which can be done by us now, and
therefore neither can we say properly these
Hymns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The answer</hi> may be, that bearing Christ
in the womb, suckling him, holding him in
our arms, is not so great a blessing, <hi>as
the laying up his holy word in our hearts.
S. Luke 11. 27. by which Christ is formed in
us, Gal. 4. 19.</hi> and so there is as much
thanks to be returned to God for this as
for that, He that does the will of God
taught in his word, may as well say. <hi>My
soul doth magnifie the Lord</hi> as the holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin;
for <hi>Christ is formed in him,</hi> as well
as in the Virgins womb. S. <hi>Matth. 12. 50.
Whosoever doth the will of my Father which
is in heaven, the</hi> same <hi>is my brother, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and mother.</hi> And why may not we
after the reading of a part of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
say, <hi>Lord now lettest thou thy servant
depart in peace,</hi> as well as old <hi>Simeon?</hi> for
in that Scripture by the eye of Faith, we
see that salvation which he then saw, and
more clearly reveal'd. We have then the
same reason to say it, that old <hi>Simeon</hi> had,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99745:30"/>
and we should have the same spirit to say it
with.</p>
               <p>There can nothing be more fitting for us,
as we have said, than having heard the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and the goodness of God therein
Preach't unto us, to break out into a Song
of Praise and Thanksgiving, and the Church
hath appointed two to be used (either of
them) after each Lesson, but not so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
but that the Former Practice of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
Churches and Reason may guide
us in the choice: For the <hi>Te Deum, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus,
Magnificat,</hi> and <hi>Nunc Dimittis</hi>
being the most expressive-Jubilations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings
for the redemption of the world,
may be said more often than the rest, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on Sundayes and other Festivals of
our Lord, excepting in <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Advent,</hi>
which being times of Humiliation, and
Meditations on Christ as in expectation, or
his sufferings, are not so fitly enlarged with
these Songs of highest Festivity, (the
custom being for the same reason in many
Churches, in Lent, to hide and conceal all the
glory of their Altars, covering them with
black to comply with the season) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in these times may be rather used the
following Psalms than the foregoing Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
as at other times also, when the
Contents of the Lesson shall give occasion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99745:30"/>
as when it speaks of the enlargement of the
Church by bringing in the Gentiles into
the Fold of it, for divers passages of those
three Psalms import that sense.</p>
               <p>And for the Canticle <hi>Benedicite,</hi> [<hi>O all
ye works of the Lord]</hi> it may be used not
only in the aforesaid times of Humiliation,
but when either the Lessons are out of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
or set before us the wonderful han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-work
of God in any of the Creatures,
or the use he makes of them either ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or miraculous for the good of the
Church: Then it will be very seasonable
to return this Song, <hi>O all ye works of the
Lord, bless ye the Lord, praise him, and
magnifie him for ever:]</hi> that is, ye are
great occasion of blessing the Lord, who
therefore be blessed, praised, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

               <head>The APOSTLES CREED.</head>
               <p>The <hi>Creed</hi> follows. At ordinary Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and Holy-daies, the Apostles Creed is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
which Creed was made by the
Apostles upon this occasion, sayes <hi>Ruffinus</hi>

a Commandment from our Lord to
Teach all Nations, and withal being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99745:31"/>
to tarry at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> till they

they agreed upon this <hi>Creed</hi> as a
Rule of Faith, according to the analogy of
which, they and all others should reach, and
as a <hi>word of distinction,</hi> by which they should
know friends from foes. For as the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadites</hi>

the <hi>Berjamites,</hi> by the word <hi>Shibboleth,
Iudges</hi> 12. 6. And as Souldiers know their

who were enemies; who were right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
who false, by this <hi>word of Faith:</hi>

Ephes. 6. <hi>Faith is rightly called a Shield,
S. Chrys.</hi> in loc. <hi>For as a Shield is carried
before the body, as a wall to defend it, so is
faith to the soul; for all things yield to that:
This is our victory whereby we overcome the

need look well to our faith, and be careful
to keep that entire; and for that purpose
it is not amiss to rehearse it often, and
guard our soul with it.</p>

soul from fear: If you be tempted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
guard your soul with the Creed,
say, I believe in Jesus Christ his only Son
our Lord, who was crucified, &amp;c. for us
men and our salvation; that may secure

tempted to presume and grow careless, take
up again this shield of Faith, see. Christ
in the Creed coming to judgment, and
this terrour of the Lords, will perswade
men, In a word, the Creed is a guard and
defence against all temptations of the world,
all the fiery darts of the Devil, all the filthy
lusts of the flesh: Therefore, <hi>above all,
take the shield of Faith,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
be sure to guard your soul Morning and
Evening with the Creed, thy symbol of
the most holy Faith. Besides, This solemn
rehearsing of our Creed, is a plighting of
our faith and fidelity to God, before De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
Angels, and Men; an engaging and
devoting of our souls in the principal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and powers of it, our reason and
understanding and will, wholly to God the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99745:32"/>
Father, Son, and holy Ghost, to believe
in the ever blessed Trinity, whatsoever
flesh and blood shall tempt to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which is an high piece of loyalty to
God; and cannot be too often perform'd.
It is that kind of Confession, that S. <hi>Paul</hi>
says is necessary to salvation, as well as
believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. For it is there said
Verse 9. <hi>If we confess with our mouth,</hi> as
well as, <hi>if we believe with the heart, we
shall be saved;</hi> it is that kind of Confession
that our Lord Christ speaks of, S. <hi>Matt.</hi>
10. 32. <hi>Whosoever shall confess me before
men, him will I confess also before my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which is in Heaven.</hi> And therefore
since it is a service so acceptable, it cannot
be thought unreasonable for the Church
to require it Morning and Evening. The
Creed follows soon after the Lessons and
very seasonably; for in the Creed we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that Faith, that the Holy Lessons
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Creed is to be said not by the Priest
alone, but <hi>by the Priest and people together.</hi>
Rubr. <hi>before the Creed.</hi> For since Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Faith in publick before God,
Angels and men is so acceptable a service
to God, as is shewn; Fit it is that every
man as well as the Priest, should bear his
part in it, since every man may do it for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99745:33"/>
himself as well, nay, better than the Priest
can do it for him, for as every man knows
best what himself believes, so it is fittest to
confess it for himself, and evidence to the
Church his found Belief, by expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
of that Creed and every particular
thereof, which is and alwayes hath been
accounted the Mark and Character, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

Heretick or Infidel.</p>
               <p>We are required to say the Creed <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

by minding the people what they are about,
namely such holy Services, as without

performed, and therefore when they are
about these Services, the Priest minds
them of it by saying, <hi>The Lord be with
you;</hi> And again, it is a most excellent and
seasonable Prayer for them, in effect thus
much, The Lord be with you, to lift up
your Hearts and raise your Devotions to

thee, that He, without whom nothing is

while thou art exercised in these Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Services, which must be performed
with the Spirit; according to S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi>
14. 15. Thus the Priest prayes and wishes
well to the people, and they pray and wish
well to the Priest. And such mutual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations
and Prayers as this and those that
follow, where Priest and people inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
pray each for other, are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
expressions of the Communion of
Saints, Both acknowledging thus, that they
are all one body, and each one members
one of another, mutually caring for one
anothers good, and mutually praying for
one another, which must needs be, if well
considered, and duly performed, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Incentives</hi> and provocations to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and love one of another; and (as S.
<hi>Chrys.</hi> observes hom. 3. in <hi>Col.</hi>) if these
solemn mutual Salutations were religiously
performed, it were almost impossible that
Priest and people should be at Enmity.
For can the People hate the Priest that
blesses them, that prayes for them, <hi>The
Lord be with you,</hi> or, <hi>Peace be with you?</hi>
which was anciently the Bishops Salutation,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99745:35"/>
in stead of the Lord be with you. Or can
the Priest forget to love the People that dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prayes for him, <hi>And with thy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Let us pray.</q>
               <p>These words are often used in ancient
Liturgies, as w<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll as in ours, and are an
Excitation to prayer, to call back our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
and recollect our scattered thoughts,
and to awaken our Devotion, bidding us
mind what we are about, namely, now
when we are about to pray; to pray in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that is, heartily and earnestly. The
Deacon in ancient Services was wont to call
upon the people often <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Let

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, still
more vehemently, and the same vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and earnest devotion which the manner
of these old Liturgies breathed, does our
Church in her Liturgy call for, in these
words, <hi>Let us pray;</hi> that is, with all
the earnestness and vehemency that we may,
that our prayers may be such as S. <hi>Iames</hi>
speaks of, active, lively spirited prayers,
for these are they that avail much with
God. And there is none of us but must
think it needful thus to be call'd upon and
awakened; for thoughts will be wandring,
and devotions will abate and scarce hold
out to the prayers end, though it be a short
one; that well said the old Hermit, (whom
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99745:35"/>
                  <hi>Melanc.</hi> mentions in his discourse <hi>de Crat.)
There is nothing harder than to pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These words, <hi>Let us pray;</hi> as they are
an Incitation to prayer in general, so they
may seem to be sometimes an Invitation to
another Form of petitioning, as in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
and other places: it being as much as
to say, Let us collect our alternate suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
by Versicles and Answers into Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
or Prayers. In the Latin Liturgies
(their Rubricks especially) <hi>Preces</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes</hi>
seem to be thus distinguished, that
<hi>Preces</hi> or Supplications were those alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Petitions, where the people answered
by responsive Versicles; <hi>Oratio,</hi> or prayer
was that which was said by the Priest alone,
the people only answering, <hi>Amen.</hi>

a most pathetick Petition of mercy to

was uttered by those primitive good men,

God the Son have mercy, God the holy

unworthy to serve thee: Have mercy, in

a more suitable preparation to prayer than
this humble Petition of Mercy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement

there no Prayer whereto greater prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>It is noted that the Priest in the holy

sometimes to <hi>stand.</hi> The Reason of this
we shall here once for all enquire.</p>
               <p>The Priest or Minister being a man o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
like infirmities with the rest of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
a sinner, and so standing in
need of grace and pardon, as well as the
rest, in all confessions of sins, and penitential
prayers, such as the <hi>Litany</hi> is, directed
to beg his pardon and grace upon his
knees. He being moreover a Priest or
Minister of the most high God, that hath
received from him an office and authority,
sometimes <hi>stands,</hi> to signifie <hi>that his office</hi>
and authority: which office of his may
be considered, either in relation to God,
or the people. As it relates to God, so
he is Gods Embassador. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. to
whom is committed the <hi>Ministery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi>
in which respect he is to
<hi>Teach, Baptize, Consecrate the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,
Bless and Absolve the penitent;</hi>
and in all these acts of Authority, which
he does in the name and person of Christ, he
is to <hi>stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As his office relates to the people, so he
is in their stead, for them appointed by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99745:39"/>
God to offer up gifts and sacrifices to God,
particularly the sacrifice of praise and
thanksgiving, together with their prayers;
so we read, <hi>Heb. 5. 1. Every high priest
or priest</hi> (so the words are promiscuously
used, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 3. 4.) <hi>taken from among men,
is ordained for men,</hi> or in their stead, <hi>in
things pertaining to God, to offer both gifts
and sacrifices for sins.</hi> Which definition
of a Priest, belongs not only to a Priest
of the Law, but also to a Priest or Minister
of the Gospel. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
proves that our <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> who
was after the order of <hi>Melchisede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k,</hi> not
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> a Priest of the Gospel, not of
the Law, ought not call himself, v. 5. but
was <hi>appointed by God,</hi> and moreover, that
he <hi>ought to have gifts and sacrifices to offer,</hi>
Heb. 8. 3. <hi>because every high Priest, or
Priest, is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
These arguments of S: <hi>Paul</hi> drawn
from this definition are fallacious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding,
unless this be the definition
of a Gospel-Priest as well as a Legal. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then that we must not conclude. S. <hi>Pauls</hi>
arguments to be unconcluding, we must
grant, that the Ministers of the Gospel are
appointed by God to offer up the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of prayers and praises of the Church
for the people, thus to stand betwixt God
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99745:39"/>
and them and to shew this his office, in
these services he is directed to <hi>stand.</hi> By
this we may see what advantage it is to the
people, that their prayers are offered up
by a Priest. For God having appointed
him to this office, will certainly assist and
accept his own constitution: and though
the Minister be wicked, or undevout in
his prayers, yet God, that will punish this
neglect in himself, will certainly accept of
his office for the people. Upon this ground
probably it was that God sent <hi>Abimelech</hi>
to <hi>Abraham</hi> to pray for him, for he was a
Prophet, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 7.</p>

               <head>The Collects.</head>
               <p>The Collects follow, which are thought
by divers to be so called, either because
they were made by the Priest, <hi>super col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectam
populi,</hi> over, or in behalf of the
Congregation, meeting, or collection of
the people; or rather, because the Priest
doth herein <hi>collect</hi> the Devotions of
the people, and offer them up to God;
for though it hath been the constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
from the beginning, for the people
to bear a vocal part by their Suffrages and
Answers in the publick service of God
(which for that very reason was by the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99745:40"/>
Ancients called <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> as may be
gathered out of <hi>Iustin Martyr. Apol.</hi> 2.
8. <hi>Aug.</hi> Epist. 118. and others:) yet
for the more renewing and strengthning
of their earnestness, importunity, and as
it were wrestling with God, and hope of
prevailing, they desired that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their devotions should
in the close be recommended to God by
the Priest, they all joyning their assent
and saying <hi>Amen</hi> to it. And that is the
reason why in many of the Collects, God
is desired to hear the petitions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(to wit, those that the people had
then made before the Collect) that they
come in at the end of other devotions,
and were by some of old called <hi>Missae,</hi> that
is to say, Dismissions, the people being
dismissed upon the pronouncing of them
and the Blessing, the Collects themselves
being by some of the Ancients called Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
and also <hi>Sacramenta,</hi> either for that
their chief use was at the Communion, or
because they were uttered <hi>Per Sacerdotem,</hi>
by one consecrated to holy Offices.</p>
               <p>But it will not be amiss to enquire more
particularly what may be said for these
very Collects which we use, they being of
so frequent use and so considerable a part
of the Devotion of our Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:99745:40"/>
And first concerning their Authors and
Antiquity, we may observe, that our
Church endeavouring to preserve, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Spirit, but the very Forms (as much
as may be, and in a known tongue) of
ancient Primitive Devotion, hath retained
these very Collects (the most of them)
among other precious Remains of it:
for we find by ancient testimony that they
were composed or ordered, either by <hi>S.
Ambrose, Gelasius,</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great,
those holy Bishops and Fathers of the
Church; and therefore having daily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up to Heaven like Incense from
the hearts and mouths of so many Saints in
the Ages since their times, they cannot but
be very venerable, and relish well with us,
unless our hearts and affections be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
temper.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the object of these Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,
they are directed to God in the
Name of Jesus Christ our Lord, for so
usually they conclude, and very fitly: For
Christ is indeed the Altar upon which all
our prayers are to be offered, that they
may be acceptable; <hi>Whatsoever ye shall
ask the Father in my Name he will give it
you,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 23. And so it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of old: <hi>Itaque Orationes nostras
vitam &amp; Sacrificia, &amp; omnia nostra offeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99745:41"/>
tibi Pater assiduè per Dominum nostrum
Iesum Christum,</hi> &amp;c. Bernard de <hi>Amore Dei</hi>
cap. 8. But yet we may observe that a few
Collects are directed to Christ, and in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
some supplications to the holy Ghost,
beside that precatory Hymn of <hi>Veni Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
in the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and that
some Collects, especially for great Festivals
conclude with this acknowledgement, <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
Christ with the Father and the holy Ghost,
liveth and reigneth one God world without
end.</hi> And this seems to be done to testifie
what the Scripture warrants, that although
for more congruity we in the general
course of our prayers go to the Father by
the Son, yet that we may also invocate
both the Son and the Holy Ghost, and that
while we call upon one, we equally wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and glorifie all Three together. <hi>Qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as they are not one long continued prayer,
but divers short ones, they have many
Advantages to gain esteem: The Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Jews of old, in whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
Devotions we find a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of several prayers or Collects to be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99745:41"/>
said together, the example of our Lord in
prescribing a short form; the judgement and
practice of the Ancient Christians in their
Liturgies, and S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> among others
commends highly short and frequent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with little distances between, <hi>Hom. 2. of
Hanna,</hi> so doth <hi>Cassian</hi> also, and from the
judgment of others that were much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
therein. 2 Lib. cap. 10. de <hi>Institut.
Coenob.</hi> And lastly, as they are most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for keeping away coldness, distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and illusions from our devotion, for
what we elsewhere say in praise of short
Ejaculations is true also concerning Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,
and that not only in respect of the
Minister, but the people also, whose
minds and affections become hereby more
erect, close and earnest by the oftner breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out their hearty concurrence, and saying
all of them <hi>Amen</hi> together at the end of
each Collect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Matter of them is most
Excellent and remarkable: It consists usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of two parts: An humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of the Adorable Perfection and
Goodness of God, and a congruous peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for some benefit from him. The first
is seen not only in the Collects for Special
Festivals or benefits; but in those also that
are more general; for even in such what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99745:42"/>
find we in the beginning of them but some
or other of these and the like acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
<hi>That God is Almighty, everlasting,
Full of Goodness and Pity, the Strength, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
and Protector of all that trust in him,
without whom nothing is strong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> nothing is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
no continuing in safety or Being, that such
is our weakness and frailty that we have no
power of our selves to help our selves, to do
any good, to stand upright, cannot but fall;
That we put no trust in any thing that we do,
but lean only upon the help of his heavenly
Grace, That he is the Author and giver of
all good things, from whom it comes that we
have an hearty desire to pray or do him any
true or laudable Service, That he is alwayes
more ready to hear than we to pray, and to
give more than we desire or deserve, having
prepared for them that love him such good
things as pass mans understanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These, and the like expressions can be
no other than the breathings of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians, who with all self-denial
made the grace of God their Hope, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
Protection, Petition, and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against all proud Hereticks and Enemies
of it: And the Petitions which follow
these humble and pious acknowledgements
and praises are very proper, holy and
good, which will better appear, if
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99745:42"/>
we consider the matter of each Collect
apart.</p>
               <p>The first in order among the Collects is
that <hi>for the day.</hi> Now as on every day or
season there is something more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
commended to our meditations by
the Church, so the first Collect reflects
chiefly upon that, though sometimes more
generally upon the whole matter of the
<hi>Epistle</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> desiring inspiration,
strength and protection from God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
in the practice and pursuance, of
what is set before us. But concerning the
matter of the Collects for the day, is
spoken afterward in the particular account
that is given of each <hi>Epistle, Gospel</hi> and
<hi>Collect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second Collect is for <hi>Peace,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and
<hi>Orbem Pacatum,</hi> that the World might be
quiet, was ever a clause in the Prayers of
the Primitive Church; and good reason:
For Peace was our Lords Legacy, My
peace I leave with you, his New-years
gift, <hi>Pax in terris, Xenium Christi,</hi> He
prayed for peace, paid for peace, wept
for it, bled for it: Peace should therefore
be dear to us, all kind of peace, outward
peace and all: for if there be not a quiet
and peaceable life, there will hardly be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99745:43"/>
godliness and honesty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. This
Collect then is fit to be said daily, being a
prayer for peace, and so is that which
follows.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>for Grace</hi> to live well: for if
there be not peace with God by an holy
life, there will never be peace in the
World. No man can so much as think a
good thought, much less lead a godly life
without the grace of God; therefore that
is also prayed for, together with Gods
protection for the day or night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Then the Prayers—according to S.
<hi>Paul. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. Who exhorts <hi>that Prayers
and Supplications be made for all men.</hi> In
particular for Kings, and the Reason he
there gives, sufficiently shews the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Praying particularly and especially
for them; namely, that we may lead a
quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
honesty: which can hardly be done if they
do not help towards it. For as the Son
of <hi>Syrach</hi> sayes <hi>Chap. 10. 2. As the Iudge

Stipendaries, as now it is used to signifie, But
all those whether Parsons or Vicars, to
whom the Bishop, who is the chief Pastor
under Christ, hath committed the cure of
souls of some part of his flock and so are
the Bishops Curates. The Bishop with
these Curates, a flock or Congregation
committed to their charge, make up a
Church. For according to our Saviours
definition, a Church is a <hi>Shepherd, and his
Sheep that will hear his voice;</hi> to which
S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> description agrees, <hi>Ep. 69.
Illi sunt Ecclesia plebs Sacerdoti adunata,

to know, sayes he, that <hi>the Church is in
the Bishop, and the Bishop in the Church,

not in the Church.</hi> Now because the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

               <head>The BLESSING.</head>
               <p>We end our Service with a BLESSING,
which is to be pronounced by <hi>the Bishop,
if he be present.</hi> See the Rubrick before
the Blessing in the <hi>Communion</hi>-Service.
Then the Priest or Bishop, if present, shall
let them depart with this Blessing. This
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99745:44"/>
is order'd for the honour of the Bishops
authority, <hi>Heb. 7. 7. Without contradiction
the less is blessed of the greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore blessing being an act of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
the Bishop ought not to be blest
by the Priest, but the Priest by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</p>
               <p>This blessing of the Bishop or Priest
was so highly esteem'd in the Primitive
times, that none durst go out of the Church
till they had received it, according to the
<hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Agatha Can.</hi> 31. in the year
472. and <hi>Orleans the third, Can.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>And when they received it, they did it
<hi>kneeling or bowing down their heads.</hi> And
the Deacon, to prepare them to it, was
wont to call out immediately before the
time of the Blessing in such words as these,
<hi>Bow down your selves to the Blessing, Chrys.
Liturg.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> received it after the
same manner, <hi>Eccles.</hi> c. 50. v. 23.
<hi>When the Service was finished, the high
Priest went down, and lifted up his hands
over the Congregation to give the blessing of
the Lord with his lips, and they bowed down
themselvs to worship the Lord, that they might
receive the Blessing from the Lord the most
high.</hi> And doubtless did we consider the
efficacy and vertue of this blessing of Priest
or Bishop, we could do no less than they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99745:45"/>
did. For it is God from heaven that
blesses us by the mouth of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.
We have his word for it <hi>Numb.
6. 22. And the Lord spoke to</hi> Moses, <hi>saying,
Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, On this
wise shall ye bless the children of Israel.
The</hi> Lord <hi>bless thee, &amp;c. And they shall
put my name upon the children of Israel,</hi>
And <hi>I will bless them.</hi> And the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of Gods assistance, and ratifying the
Priests Blessing, we have in the Gospel,
S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 13. S. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 5. where our
Saviour charges his Apostles and Disciples
that into whatsoever house they enter they
should <hi>say,</hi> not pray; <hi>say</hi> with authority,
<hi>Peace be to this house,</hi> and (not if your
prayers be servent, or if they in the house
joyn in prayer with you, but) <hi>if the Son
of peace be there;</hi> that is, if he that dwells
in the house hinders not, nor resists your
blessing, if he be a person capable of so
much good as your blessing; (for this is
signified by this Hebrew phrase, <hi>Son of
peace) your peace shall rest upon him:</hi> but if
he be not such a son of peace, <hi>your blessing
shall return to you again,</hi> which it could not
be said to do, unless vertue together with
the blessing had gone out from them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>EVENING SERVICE</hi> differs

               <p>
                  <hi>LItany</hi> signifies an humble, an earnest
Supplication. These Forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
call'd Litanies, (wherein the people
are more exercised than in any other part
of the Service, by continual joyning in
every passage of it,) are thought by some to
have been brought into the Church about
four hundred years after Christ, in times
of great calamity, for the appeasing of
Gods wrath. True it is, that they are
very seasonable prayers in such times, and
therefore were by <hi>Gregory</hi> and others used
in their Processions, for the averting of
Gods wrath in publick calamities, but it
is as true, that they were long before that
time, even in the first Services that we find
in the Church, used at the Communion-Service,
and other Offices, as Ordination
of Priests, and the like: witness <hi>Clem.
Const.</hi> l. 8. c. 5, 6, 10. where we find the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
ministring to the people, and directing
them from point to point what to pray for,
as it is in our Litany, and the people are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99745:46"/>
appointed to answer to every Petition,
<hi>Domine miserere,</hi> Lord have mercy. And
in all Liturgies extant, (as Mr. <hi>Thorndyke</hi>
hath well observed in his Book of <hi>Religious
Assemblies,)</hi> the same Allocutions or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
which are indeed Litanies, may
be seen. And S. <hi>Aug.</hi> Ep. 119. c. 18: tells
us of the Common-prayers, which were
indited or denounced by the voice of the
Deacon. All which make it probable,
that the practice of Litanies is derived
from the Apostles, and the custom of their
time. And S. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rys.</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> c. 8. seems
to assert the same: For upon that verse,
<hi>We know not what we should pray for as we
ought, but the Spirit helps our infirmities,</hi>
he saies thus; In those daies amongst other
miraculous gifts of the Spirit, this was one,
<hi>Donum pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>um,</hi> the gift of making prayers
for the Church, to help the ignorance of
the people that knew not what to pray for
as they ought; he that had this gift, stood
up, and prayed for the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and taught them what to pray for:
whose Office now the Deacon performs:
<hi>viz.</hi> by directing them from point to point,
what to pray for. To every of which
Petitions, sayes <hi>Clem.</hi> above cited, the
people were to answer, <hi>Domine Miserere.</hi>
This continual joyning of the people in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99745:46"/>
every passage of it, tends much both to
the improving and evidencing that fervour
and intention, which is most necessary in
prayers. Hence was it that these Forms
of prayers, (where the peoples devotion
is so often excited<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> quickned, and exercised

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> earnest
or intense Petitions. In which, if they
were relished aright, the earnest and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
devotion of Primitive times, still
breaths; and in these prayers, if ever we
pray with the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Litany of our Church,
we may boldly say, and easily maintain it,
that there is not extant any where; 1. A
more particular excellent enumeration of
all the Christians either private or common
wants; Nor 2. A more innocent, blameless
form, against which there lies no just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
Nor 3. A more Artificial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
for the raising of our devotion,
and keeping it up throughout, than this
part of our Liturgy.</p>
               <p>In the beginning it directs our <hi>prayers</hi>
to the right object, the Glorious TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY.
For necessary it is, that we
should know whom we worship. Then
it proceeds to <hi>Deprecations,</hi> or prayers
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99745:47"/>
against evil; lastly, to <hi>Petitions</hi> for good.
In the <hi>Deprecations,</hi> as right method re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
we first pray against sin, then
against punishment; because sin is the
greatest evil. From all which we pray to
be delivered by the holy actions and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of CHRIST, the only merits of
all our good. The like good order is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in our <hi>Petitions</hi> for good. First,
we pray for the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> the
common mother of all Christians; then
for <hi>our own Church,</hi> to which, next the
Church Catholick, we owe the greatest
observance and duty. And therein, in the
first place for the principal members of it,
in whose welfare the Churches peace chiefly
consists. After this we pray particularly
for those sorts of men that most especially
need our prayers, such amongst others,
as those whom the Law calls <hi>miserable
persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Litany is not one long continued
prayer, but broken into many short and
pithy Ejaculations: that the intention and
devotion which is most necessary in prayer,
may not be dull'd and vanish, as in a long
prayer it is apt to do; but be quickned and
intended, by so many new and quick peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and the nearer to the end, the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and livelier it is, strengthening our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99745:47"/>
devotions by raising in us an apprehension
of our misery and distress, ready, as it
were to sink and perish; and therefore cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out as the Disciples did, <hi>Master, save
us, we perish: <hi>D Lamb of God hear us,
D Christ hear us, Lord have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us.</hi>
                  </hi> Such as these are the active, lively
spirited prayers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which S.
<hi>Iames</hi> mentions and tells us, <hi>avail much.</hi>
S. <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 16.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doxology,</hi> or <hi>Glory be to the Father,</hi>
&amp;c. is much used in our Service, after
Confession, after <hi>Athanasius's</hi> Creed, and
especially after each Psalm and Canticle,
as a most thankful adoration of the holy
Trinity, upon reflection on the matter go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, And therefore is very fitly
divided betwixt the Priest and people in
saying it, according as the matter going
before was; and it is in those places said
<hi>standing,</hi> as the most proper posture for
thanksgiving or Adoration. Here in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,
it is said in a way somewhat different;
for after that the Priest and people have
in the supplications afore going besought
God that He would arise, help and deliver
them, as he did their fore-fathers of old
for his Names sake and Honour, the Priest
does Collect wise sum up This; praying,
that by such deliverances, all glory may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99745:48"/>
redound to God the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, as it was in the beginning, is
now and ever shall be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
only, <hi>Amen,</hi> as it were after a
a <hi>Collect,</hi> and continuing <hi>kneeling;</hi> because
both this, as it is here used, and other
parts of the Litany before and after, are
matters of humble supplication, and so most
fit to be tendred to God in that posture.</p>
               <p>In the former part of the Litany, the
Priest hath not a part so proper but that it
may be said by a Deacon, or other, and it
useth to be sung by such in Cathedral and
Collegiate Churches and Chappels, and
both it and all other our alternate Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which are as it were the Lesser Lita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
do much resemble the ancient Prayers
indicted by the Deacons, as we have said;
but in the latter part of the Litany, from the
Lords prayer, to the end, the Priest hath a
part more peculiar, by reason of the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
of that prayer and other Collects follow,
wherein the Priest doth recommend again
the petitions of the people to God (as in
that prayer, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e humbly beseech thee O
Lord mercifully to look upon our infirmities,</hi>
&amp;c.) and Solemnly offers them up to
God in the behalf of the people, to which
the people answer, <hi>Amen:</hi> and therefore
these Collects after the Litany, though
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99745:48"/>
the matter of them hath been prayed for
before particularly in the Supplications
foregoing, may be said, without the
charge of needless tautology, for here
the Priest does by vertue of his sacred
Office, solemnly offer up and present to
God these petitions of the people, as it
was usually done in ancient Liturgies;
Praying God to accept the peoples Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as he doth more than once in S. <hi>Chrys.</hi>
Liturgy, particularly in that Prayer which
we have out of it in our Litany. For
when the Deacon hath (as we have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
ministred to the People several Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
to which they answer, <hi>Lord have
mercy,</hi> Litany-wise, then the Priest Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect-wise
makes a Prayer to God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the peoples petitions, the Deacon in
the mean time proceeding to dictate to the
people more Supplications, which the
Priest in another Collect offers up to God
Solemnly, but secretly, so that though in
some of those Collects the Priest at the
Latter end, spake out so that the people
might hear and answer, <hi>Amen,</hi> or <hi>Glory
be to the Father,</hi> or the like, (which they
might well do, for though the Prayer
were said by the Priest secretly, yet it
was prescribed, and such as the people
knew before hand) yet some of them were
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99745:49"/>
said throughout secretly by the Priest, to
which the people were not required to
make any Answer;</p>
               <p>The reason of these <hi>Secreta,</hi> secret
prayers said by the Priest, may be partly
for variety to refresh the people, but
chiefly, as I conceive, that by this course
the people might be taught to understand
and reverence the office of the Priest,
which is to make an atonement for the
people, and to present their prayers to
God, by that very offering of them up,
making them more acceptable to God.
All which depends not upon the peoples
consent or confirmation of his office, but
upon Gods alone appointment and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;
who hath set him apart to these
offices of offering gifts and Sacrifices for
the people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 1. And therefore as it
was appointed by God, that when <hi>Aaron</hi>
by his Priestly office was to offer for the
people and make an atonement for them,
none of the people were to be present,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 17. So the Church ordered that
at some times, when the Priest was making
an atonement for the people, and offering
up for them and the acceptation of their
prayers, the Merits and Passion of Christ,
none should seem actually to assist, but
the Priest should say it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> secretly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99745:49"/>
and mystically. Yet lest the people should
be unsatisfied, and suspicious that the
Priest had neglected this his office, which
they could not be assured that he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
because it was done secretly;
therefore the Church appointed that the
Priest should at the end of the Service
come down from the Altar, and standing
behind the Pulpit in the midst of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
say a loud prayer, (call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Goar.</hi> P. 154.) which was
a sum or Compendium of all that the
people had before petition'd for, which he
then solemnly offered up to God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is generally in
her Common Prayers, as for an humble,
so for an audible voice, especially in the
Lords Prayer appointing it to be said, in the
Rubrick before it, with a <hi>loud,</hi> that is,
an <hi>audible</hi> voice, not secretly; and this,
for the more earnest repetition of so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
words, and to make them more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to the people. But though this Church
does not order the Priest to say these Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
secretly, yet she retains the same order
of offering up by the Priest in Collects fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the peoples foregoing supplications.</p>
               <p>The Litany is appointed in the <hi>Rubricks</hi>
to be read <hi>Wednesdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> the
dayes kept in the <hi>Greek Church</hi> for more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99745:50"/>
solemn Fasts, because the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was

on Wednesday, and murdered on Friday,

Church in imitation of the Western hath
chang'd the Wednesday-Fast to Saturday,
yet in memory of the Eastern custom, the

Wednesday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday</hi> was both in Greek Church and
Latin a Litany or Humiliation-day, and so
is kept in ours. And whosoever loves to

bring to the mind the former World
finished by Creation; so the <hi>Christian</hi>
Church hath her <hi>Lords</hi> dayes or <hi>Sundays</hi>
to keep us in perpetual remembrance
of a far better World begun by him who
came to restore all things to make Heaven
and Earth new. The rest of the holy Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals
which we celebrate have relation all
to one Head CHRIST. We begin
therefore our Ecclesiastical year (as to
some accounts, though not as to the order
of our service) with the glorious <hi>Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi>
of his Birth by Angelical message.
Hereunto are added his blessed <hi>Nativity</hi>
it self, the mystery of his <hi>legal Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
the Testification of his true Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
by the <hi>Purification</hi> of his blessed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99745:51"/>
Mother the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> his glorious
<hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven
the admirable sending down of his <hi>Spirit</hi>
upon his chosen.</p>
               <p>Again, for as much as we know that
CHRIST hath not only been manifested
<hi>great in himself,</hi> but <hi>great</hi> in other <hi>his Saints
also;</hi> the dayes of whose departure out of
this world are to the Church of Christ, as
the birth and coronation-dayes of Kings or
Emperors; therefore especial choice being
made of the very flower of all occasions in
this kind, there are annual selected times
to meditate of Christ glorified in <hi>them,</hi>
which had the honour to suffer for his sake,
before they had age and ability to know
him, namely, the blessed <hi>Innocents:</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in them which knowing him as S.
<hi>Stephen,</hi> had the sight of that before death,
whereinto such acceptable death doth lead:
glorified in those <hi>Sages of the East,</hi> that
came from far to adore him, and were
conducted by <hi>strange light:</hi> glorified in
the second <hi>Elias</hi> of the World, sent before
him to prepare his way: glorified in every
of those <hi>Apostles</hi> whom it pleased him to
use as founders of his kingdom here: glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
in the Angels, as in S. <hi>Michael:</hi>
glorified in <hi>all</hi> those <hi>happy souls</hi> that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
possest of bliss.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:99745:52"/>
Besides these, be four dayes annext to
the Feasts of <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsunday,</hi> for
the more honour and enlargement of those
high solemnities. These being the dayes
which the Lord hath made glorious, <hi>Let
us rejoyce and be glad in them.</hi> These dayes
we keep not in a secret Calendar, taking
thereby our private occasions as we list
our selves to think how much God hath
done for all men: but they are chosen out
to serve as publick memorials of such mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and are therefore cloathed with those
outward robes of holiness, whereby their
difference from other dayes may be made
sensible, having by holy Church a solemn
Service appointed to them.</p>
               <p>Part of which Service are the <hi>Epistles</hi>
and <hi>Gospels:</hi> of which in the first place
we shall discourse, because these are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and proper to each several Holy-day,
the rest of the Service for the most part
being common to all.</p>
               <p>Concerning these, two things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.

                     <item>1. To shew the Antiquity of them.</item>
                     <item>2. Their fitness for the day to which

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Antiquity of <hi>Epistles</hi>
and <hi>Gospels,</hi> it will be sufficient once for all,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99745:52"/>
to shew that the use of them in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church was ancient. Concerning the
antiquity of the dayes themselves, to
which the Epistles and Gospels appertain,
it will be sit to be more particular.</p>
               <p>That the use of Epistles and Gospels
peculiar to the several Holy-dayes was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
appears first by ancient Liturgies:
Secondly by the testimony of the ancient,
Fathers. Let S. <hi>AVGVSTINE</hi>
testifie for the Latin-Church, in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to his Comment upon the Epistle of
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and in his X. Sermon <hi>De verb.
Apost.</hi> We heard first, sayes he, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Lesson, then we sung a Psalm, after
that the Gospel was read: Now let S.
<hi>CHRYS.</hi> testifie for the Greek, <hi>Rom.</hi> 19.
in cap. <hi>9. Act.</hi> The Minister stands up, and
with a loud voice calls, <hi>[Let us attend:]</hi>
then the Lessons are begun: which Lessons
are the Epistles and Gospels (as appears
in his Liturgy) which follow immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the Minister hath so call'd for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>The fitness of the Epistle and Gospel
for the day it belongs to, and the reason
of the choice will plainly appear, if we
observe that these holy Festivals and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of the Church, are, as I have
touch'd before, of Two Sorts; The more
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99745:53"/>
high dayes, or the rest: The <hi>First</hi> comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
the signal Acts or Passages of our
Lord in the Redemption of mankind, his
incarnation and Nativity, Circumcision,
Manifestation to the Gentiles, his Fasting,
Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension, the
sending of the Holy Ghost, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a more full and express manifestation of
the Sacred Trinity. The <hi>Second</hi> sort is of
Inferiour dayes that supply the Intervals of
the greater, such as are either the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sundayes, wherein without any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the sequence of time (which
could only be regarded in great Feasts)
the holy Doctrine, Deeds and Miracles of
our Lord are the chief matters o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations;
or else the other Holy dayes
of which already hath been spoken. And
for all these Holy Times we have Epistles
and Gospels very proper and seasonable,
for not only on high and special dayes, but
even in those also, that are more general
and indifferent, some respect is had to the
season, and the holy affections the Church
then aims at, as Mortification in Lent, Joy,
Hope, newness of Life, &amp;c. after Easter;
the Fruits and Gifts of the Spirit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for Christs Second coming in the
time between Pentecost and Advent. But
these things I shall shew in the Discourse of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99745:53"/>
the Holy dayes severally. As for the Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons,
although they have another Order,
and very profitable, being for each day
of the week, following usually the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Chapters, and taking in the Old
Testament also (the Communion dealing
chiefly with the New as most fit for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that Service) yet in them also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
is had to the more solemn times by
select and proper readings, as hath been
shew'd. This being the Churches Rule
and Method (as she hath it from the
Apostle) <hi>that all things be done unto edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
that we may be better acquainted with
God, and with our selves, with what hath
been done for us, and what is to be done
by us. And this Visible as well as Audible
preaching of Christian Doctrine by these
Solemnities and Readings in such an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Order is so apt to infuse by degrees
all necessary Christian knowledge into us,
and the use of it to the ignorant is so great,
<hi>that it may well be feared</hi> (as a Reverend
person hath forewarned) that <hi>When the
Festivals and Solemnities for the Birth of
Christ and his other famous passages of life,
and death, and Resurrection, and Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

together with the Creeds also, 'twill not be
in the power of weekly Sermons on some
head of Religion to keep up the knowledge of
Christ in mens hearts, &amp;c.</hi> And no doubt
for this and other good Reasons which he
gives us, it was that the primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were so exact and religious in these
Solemnities and Meditations on the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them, and therefore the Sermons
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Fathers were generally on the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Day, as hereafter is shewed.
And we have from another the like hand
thus: <hi>The Blessings of God whereof these
Solemnities renew the Remembrance are of
that esteem to the Church, that we are not
able to express too much thankfulness in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that occasion of Solemnizing his Service.
And the greatest part of Christians are such
as will receive much improvement in the
principal Mysteries of our Faith by the
Sensible instruction which the Observation
of such Solemnities yieldeth. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Birth, the Sufferings, the
Resurrection of Christ, the Coming of the
Holy Ghost, the Conversion of the Gentiles
by sending the Apostles, the way made before
his coming by the Annunciation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
and the coming of the Baptist, as it is a
powerful mean to train the more ignorant
sort in the Vnderstanding of such great
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99745:54"/>
Mysteries, so it is a just occasion for all sorts
to make that a particular time of Serving
God upon which we solemnize those great
works of his.</hi> See Dr. Hammonds <hi>View of
the Directory, pag.</hi> 38. Mr. Thorndyke of
<hi>publick Assemblies pag.</hi> 256. and what we
have above said concerning the excellent
use of Festival dayes at <hi>pag.</hi> 105.</p>
               <p>The same Method shall be observed in
this Discourse of Holy-dayes, which the
Service-Book uses; not that in the Title-Page
in the beginning of the book (which
perhaps reckons for Holy-dayes only those
days in which we are solemnly to worship
God, and also to rest from usual labour)
but that in the Services appointed by the
Book which adds over and above, that
old Catalogue of Holy-dayes, S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
And S. <hi>Barnabas, Ashwednesday,</hi> and the
<hi>Holy-Week:</hi> All which must be reckoned
for Holy-dayes in the Churches account,
because they have Holy-day service; Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Gospels, and Second-service ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to them, though there be no Law
that inflicts a penalty upon them that do
their usual works upon those dayes, they
being only desired to be present at the
Churches service at the Hours appointed.</p>

Verses are peculiar to the day, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if they be well considered. The <hi>First
Psalm</hi> for the <hi>Morning Service,</hi> is the 19.
<hi>The heavens declare the glory of God;</hi> very
suitable to the Feast, for at His Birth a

               <p>The third is <hi>Psal.</hi> 85. which is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set for the Birth of Christ. For it is a
thanksgiving to God for sending a Saviour,
which should save his people from their
sins, the greatest captivity that is; and
therefore cannot properly be meant of any
but Christ, who was therefore call'd <hi>Iesus,
because be should save his people from their
sins,</hi> S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 1. 21. And so the Primitive
Church understood it, and therefore se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
it out as a part of their Office for
this day, as being proper and pertinent to
the matter of the Feast: For the meeting
here specified, ver. 10. 11. of <hi>Mercy and
Truth, Righteousness and Peace,</hi> was at
Christs birth, who said of himself, that he
was <hi>the Truth;</hi> who as he had a birth
from Heaven, to wit, his Divine nature,
so had he another as Man from Earth from
the Virgin; which birth drew <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to look from Heaven,</hi> upon poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with a favourable look, and made
<hi>righteousness and peace kiss,</hi> for the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of sinners from their captivity. True
it is, the Prophet in the first Verses speaks
of this delivery as of a thing past, <hi>Lord
thou hast turn'd away the captivity of Iacob.</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:99745:57"/>
Yet for all this it may be a prophesie of
our salvation by the coming of Christ
hereafter: for as S. <hi>Peter</hi> sayes, Acts. 2
30. <hi>David being a Prophet, and seeing this
before,</hi> spake of Christs Nativity, as if it
were already past.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Evening Psalms</hi> are 89, 110, 132.
The first and last of which are thankful
commemorations of Gods merciful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of sending our Lord Christ into the
world, that <hi>seed of David, which be had
sworn to establish, and set up his Throne for
ever.</hi> For which, <hi>O Lord, the very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
shall praise thy wondrous works, and
thy truth in the congregation of the Saints,</hi>
v. 5. Psal. 89. The Church was in aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
now, as is plain in both these Psalms:
but such was the joy that they were affected
with, at the promise of Christs birth and
coming into the world, that they could not
contain, but even in the midst of their
misery, break forth into Thanksgiving for
it: and how can the Church excite us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Thanksgiving to God for the birth
of Christ, upon the day, then by shewing
us how much the promise of it afar off
wrought upon the Saints of old? The 110.
Psalm expresly mentions the birth of
Christ, ver. 3. <hi>The dew of thy birth, is of
the womb of the Morning;</hi> as the morning
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99745:58"/>
dew brings forth innumerable fruit, so
shall the birth of Christ bring forth innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
faithful people: and therefore the
Prophet here does, as we should this day,
adore and praise the goodness of God for
the birth of Christ, the cause of so much
good.</p>
               <p>It is admirable to behold the frame of
the Churches holy Office and Service this
day. In the <hi>First Lessons,</hi> she reads us the
prophesie of Christs coming in the flesh:
in the <hi>Second Lessons, Epistle</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi>
she gives us the History of it. In the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi>
the teaches us to pray, that we may
be partakers of the benefit of his birth:
In the proper Preface for the day, as also
in the proper Psalms, she sets us to our
duty of Adoring and Glorifying God for
his mercy. In the Lessons and Gospels
appointed, holy Church does <hi>the Angels
part,</hi> brings us glad tydings of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
Birth, <hi>Behold I bring you glad tydings
of great joy, for unto you is born this day a

For the Antiquity of this day, many
testimonies might be brought out of the
Ancients; but, because I intend brevity,
I shall be content with two beyond excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> Ep. 119. witnesses,
that it was the custome of holy Church to
keep this day: And upon the five and
twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> in <hi>Psalm.</hi> 132.
S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> makes a Sermon to prove
that the keeping of <hi>Christmas-day</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
even from the first times; and that
the Church kept the true day. In the same
same sermon he sayes, <hi>It is a godly thing to
keep this day.</hi> Nay further, that <hi>the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this day was one of the greatest signs
of our love to Christ.</hi> Amongst other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which he uses there, to perswade
his hearers to keep this day, he brings
this, that the custome of keeping this day
was religious, and of God, or else it
could never have been so early spread over
the whole World, in spight of so much
opposition. <hi>Orat. in Natal. Dom. Tom.</hi> 5.

this was the very time of their
suffering, but because none are thought
fitter attendants on Christs Nativity, than
the blessed Martyrs, who have laid down
their lives for him, from whose birth they
received spiritual life. And there being
three kinds of Martyrdom; I. <hi>In will and
deed,</hi> which is the highest. 2. <hi>In will,</hi> but
<hi>not in deed. 3. In deed,</hi> but <hi>not in will:</hi>
in this order they attend; S. <hi>Stephen</hi> first,
who suffered both in will and deed. Next
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who suffered Martyrdom in will,
but not in deed, being miraculously deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of boyling Cauldron, into which
he was put before <hi>Port-Latin in Rome.</hi>

               <p>The reason of the choice of the Epistles,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99745:59"/>
Gospels and Collects for these dayes is
plain, these being <hi>all priviledged dayes,</hi>
that is, days which have in Scripture their
peculiar histories. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the Collect for
S. <hi>Stephens</hi> day we may note in particular,
That as the Church offers up some of her
Collects directly to the Second Person of
the Trinity, so one of them is this for
S. <hi>Stephens</hi> day, and very properly; For
as S. <hi>Stephen</hi> in the midst of his Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
prayed to Jesus saying, <hi>Lord Iesus
receive my spirit,</hi> and, <hi>Lord lay not this
sin to their charge;</hi> so the Church in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this blessed Proto-Martyr upon
his day calls upon the Lord Jesus also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
of him such a spirit as that of S.
<hi>Stephen,</hi> to love and pray for our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which is that Heroical and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendant
vertue which is peculiar to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion.</p>
               <p>Before we endeavour to shew the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of these days in particular, it will
not be amiss to give some account of the
ancient observation of <hi>Saints dayes in
general.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the observation of Saints days was
very ancient in the Church will appear by
these testimonies following. The Councel
of <hi>Carthag.</hi> 3. c. 47. tells us that the
Church did celebrate the Passions and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99745:60"/>
                  <hi>Anniversaries of the Martyrs. This
Counc. was held in S.</hi> Augustines <hi>time.
S.</hi> Aug. <hi>in Psal. 88.</hi> Attend therefore my
Dearly Beloved; All of you unanimously
hold fast God your Father and the Church
your Mother. Celebrate the Saints Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
<hi>(so they Anciently called the dayes of
their Death and Martyrdom)</hi> with sobriety,
that we may imitate them that have gone
before us, that they may joy over us, who
pray for us, that so the Blessing of God
may remain upon us for ever. Amen,
Amen.</p>
               <p>Chrys. Hom. <hi>66. ad Pop. Antioch,</hi> The
sepulchres of the Saints are honourable, and
their dayes are known of all, bringing a
festival joy to the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before these S.</hi> Cyprian, l. 4. ep. 5. We
celebrate the Passions of the Martyrs and
their days with an anniversary commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>And before him</hi> Anno <hi>147. the
Church of</hi> Smyrna <hi>says the same</hi> Enseb.
<hi>Hist. l. 4. c. 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be demanded why the Church kept
the days of the Saints deaths, rather than
of their Birth or Baptism? The answer
may be: 1. Because at their deaths they
are born Citizens of Heaven, of the Church
triumphant, (which is more than to be
born either a man or a Christian, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99745:60"/>
of the Church Militant) whence (as
above said) these days were usually styled
by the Ancients, <hi>Their Birth-days.</hi> 2. Then
do they perfectly triumph over the Devil
and the world, by which the Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
hath gained, to her comfort, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of persevering constancy and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and the Church Triumphant hath
gained a new joy by the addition of
a new member. For surely if the Saints
and Angels in heaven joy at the conversion
of a sinner, much more do they joy at the
admission of a Saint into Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the Saints days in general.
For these three holy days in particular,
that they are ancient, S. <hi>Augustine</hi> shews
us, who hath Sermons upon all these days,
Tom. 10. And <hi>Chrysol.</hi> who hath Sermons
upon S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Innocents:</hi> And <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>
in his Comment upon these words, <hi>A

Church did, and did well in it to keep the
Feast of <hi>Innocents,</hi> and there is as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the keeping of S. <hi>Stevens</hi> day, who
was the first Martyr, and of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> the

keeping of <hi>Innocents;</hi> and therefore it is

               <p>THis Sunday hath the Collect with

Newyears-day.</head>
               <p>THe Feast of the Circumcision is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Learned men to be of a later
institution: for though many of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
mention the <hi>Octave</hi> of Christmas and
Newyears-day, yet they do not mention
or seem to keep it, say they, as a Feast of
the Circumcision. But suppose it be so;
yet surely it cannot be denied that there is
reason enough for the keeping of this day
solemn, as it is the Feast of Christs Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision:
For as at Christmas <hi>CHRIST</hi>
was made of a woman like us in nature, so
this day <hi>he was made under the Law, Gal.</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:99745:61"/>
4. 5. and for us took upon him the curse
of the Law; being made sin for us, and
becoming a surety to the offended God,
for us sinners. Which suretiship he seal'd,
this day with some drops of that precious
blood which he meant to pour out whole
upon the Cross.</p>
               <p>As by his Birth we received the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sons; so by his Circumcision, the
redemption of the Law: and without this,
his Birth had not availed us at all.</p>
               <p>The Epistle, Gospel, and Collect are
plainly fit for the day.</p>
               <p>This Holy day hath no fast before it,
the Reason we shall shew: and to save
trouble, we will here once for all shew
<q>
                     <hi>Why some Holy-dayes have Fasts before
them:</hi> and then, <hi>Why this and some other
have none.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For the first. It was the religious custom
of the primitive times to spend the night
(or a greater part of it) before the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
in watching and prayers and tears,
partly to prepare them for the more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
and religious observation of the
Holy-day following; partly to signifie
that we should be as the blessed Saints were,
after a little time of mortification and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
translated into glory and joy,
according to the Psalm, <hi>Heaviness may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99745:62"/>
dure for a night, but joy cometh in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>]
Thus after a Vigil comes a Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
These Vigils, or night-watches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in continuance of time, abused by the
wickedness of some, who under colour of
those holy nightly exercises stole a liberty
of intemperance, lust and other villany,
were, say some, by the wisdom of holy
Church, to avoid scandal, turn'd into Fasts,
which still retain the old name of <hi>Vigils.</hi>
The truth of this Assertion I question;
for neither do I find any decree of holy
Church for bidding these Vigils: (the 35.
Can. of the Counc. of <hi>Eliber;</hi> and the
fifth Can. of the Counc. of <hi>Altisiodorum</hi>
or <hi>Auxeres,</hi> which are usually produced
to this purpose, coming far short of such a
prohibition) nor is it so probable, that
the Church should, for some particular
mens abuse, forbid a practice so religious,
commanded by our Saviour, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.
13. commended to us by his practice at
<hi>Gethsemaine,</hi> S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 38. S. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.
12. earnestly urged by the Fathers of the
Primitive times. I therefore rather think,
that, whereas it was the ancient custome
to fast the day and watch the night before
the Holy-day, as <hi>s. Bernard</hi> tells us. <hi>Ser.
de Vigil S. Andrei:</hi> in time, as charity
and devotion grew cold, through sloth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99745:62"/>
and restiness, this more troublesome part
of devotion, the nightly watches were
laid aside, and the Fast only retained, and
that but slenderly observed. But it were
to be wished, that, as the Fast might be
retained, and more strictly observed, so
the holy Vigils might be in part at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived.
For the night was not made only
for sleep. Tradesmen, Mariners, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
will tell you so much; they spend
a good part of the night in watching for
gain; will not you do as much for your
soul? Besides, the darkness and silence of
the night, are helps to compunction and
holy sorrow; helps to meditation and
contemplation: the soul is the more free
from outward distraction. The sight of
men lying a-sleep in their beds, like dead
men in the grave, suggests a meditation of
Doomsday. Let me therefore perswade
men and women; Bend your knees, sigh,
watch and pray in the night, <hi>Blessed is he,
whom our Lord when he cometh shall find so
doing:</hi> and because <hi>we know not what hour
he will come, watch therefore.</hi> See <hi>Chrys.</hi>
Hom. 26. in Act. This for the first;
why some Holy-dayes have Fasts before
them.</p>
               <p>Now why this Feast of CIRCUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CISION,
and some other have no Fasts,
the reason is double.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:99745:63"/>First, because sometimes the significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Vigil or Fast, mentioned above,
ceases: and the signification or mystery
failing, the Vigil or Fast is omitted. For
example, S. <hi>Michael</hi> upon this account
hath no Fast, because the Angels did not
by sufferings and mortifications, enter into
their joy, but were created in the joy they
have. But then secondly, though this
signification and Mystery of vigils and
Fasts holds good in S. <hi>Mark,</hi> S. <hi>Philip</hi>
and S. <hi>Iacob,</hi> and some other, yet they
have no Fasts for another reason; because
they fall either betwixt Easter and Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunday,
or betwixt Christmas and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,
which holy Church held for such
high times of joy and Festivity, that they
would not have one day among them sullied
by pensive sorrow and fasting: <hi>Con. Turon.

                  <p>The Gospel treats of Christs miraculous
stilling of the waves and the wind. By the
tempest on the Sea, may be signified the
tumultuous madness of the people, which
endangers the peace of the Church, Christs
ship: so the <hi>Psalm</hi> expounds it, <hi>Thou
stillest the raging of the Sea, and the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the people:</hi> which would never be
quiet, unless Christ by his word and power
should command it to be still: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he does now rule the peoples madness
by Ministers of his vengeance to whom he
gives his power: therefore the Epistle
teaches and exhorts us to submit conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to that power of Christ, that so the
ship of the Church may be still and safe.</p>
                  <p>The Collect prayes to God to keep the

               <p>MAny reasons are given of this name;
but in my apprehension the best is
<hi>a consequentia numerandi,</hi> because the first
Sunday in Lent is called <hi>Quadragesima,</hi>
containing about forty dayes from Easter;
therefore the Sunday before that being still
farther from Easter, is called <hi>Quinquage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima,</hi>
five being the next number above
four; and so the Sunday before that <hi>Sexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesima,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This and the two next Sundayes and

the Lenten Fast, that when it came, it
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99745:66"/>
might be the the more strictly and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously

               <p>The Epistle perswades us to works of

we should shrink from these hardships, it
encourages us by propounding the reward
of these religious exercises; namely, an
everlasting crown.</p>
               <p>The Gospel is much to the same purpose.
It tells us that Gods vineyard is no place

how that scarce one of four that profess

of the Apostles.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epiphanius adv. Aerium,</hi> tells us, that
the <hi>Aerians</hi> were the most brain-sick He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
that ever were; for they held that
Bishops and Priests were all one; that
Presbyters might ordain Presbyters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they held that they were not bound
to keep Lent, and the holy week, as holy
Churches laws required, but would then
feast and drink drunk in spite, saying, that
it was against Christian liberty to be tyed
to Fast.</p>
               <p>This forty days Fast of Lent was taken
up by holy Church in imitation of <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Elias</hi> in the old Testament; but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
in imitation of our <hi>Saviours</hi> Fast
in the New Testament, <hi>Augustin,</hi> ep. 119.
<hi>That we might, as far as we are able, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to Christs practice, and suffer with
him here, that we may reign with him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if this Fast were taken up in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Saviour; it may be asked, why
we do not keep it at the same time that he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99745:68"/>
did, who fasted immediately after his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.
S. <hi>Matt.</hi> 4. 1. which was at Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
whereas our Fast begins not till some
weeks after?</p>
               <p>For answer of this, many reasons may
be given, why now, rather than at that
time we keep our Lent.</p>
               <p>1. Because at this time when blood and
affections are at the highest, it is most fit
to restrain them; and to that perhaps S.
<hi>Ierom</hi> alludes, when he says, <hi>Iejunamus
tempore congruo,</hi> we fast at a time conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>2. As Christs sufferings ended in an
Easter, a Resurrection; so did holy Church
think fit that our spiriturl afflictions and
penances should end, as his did, at Easter.
<hi>The fast of Lent signifies this present trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
life, and Easter signifies eternal
happiness and rest.</hi> August. <hi>Ep.</hi> 119.</p>
               <p>3. Holy Church appoints that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
whatsoever should receive the holy
Communion at <hi>Easter;</hi> and therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
this time before, to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by fasting and prayer; thus judging
themselves that they might not be judged
of the Lord; and this is after Gods own
pattern, who commanded the Israelites to
afflict themselves, and eat bitter herbs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they should eat the Paschal Lamb. All
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99745:68"/>
Churches therefore agreed that Lent
should end in Easter, though some differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
there was when it should begin.</p>
               <p>This Fast is called Lent from the time of
the year in which it is kept, for Lent in the
Saxon Language is <hi>Spring.</hi> The Spring-Fast,
or Lent.</p>

to supply the Sundays in Lent, upon
which it was not the Churches custome to

                  <p>Hence was it call'd <hi>[Dies cinerum,]</hi>

from prayer, according to the Canons,

               <p>THe Week after Ash-wednesday is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or <hi>Ember-week,</hi> of which Fast
we will here treat in general. There be <hi>Four
Ember-weeks,</hi> called in Latin <hi>Iejunia qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor
Temporum,</hi> the Fasts of the four Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
because they were kept in the four
parts of the year, Spring, Summer, Autumn,
Winter. The first of these begins upon Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday
next after <hi>Ash-wednesday.</hi> The second
upon Wednesday next after <hi>Whitsunday:</hi>
the third upon Wednesday next after <hi>Holy
Cross.</hi> Sept. 14. The last upon Wednesday
next after S. <hi>Lucie.</hi> Dec. 13. The days of
fasting and prayers in these weeks are,
<hi>Wednesday, Friday, Saturday. Wednesday,</hi>
because then our Lord Christ was betrayed
by <hi>Iudas: Friday,</hi> because then he was
crucified: <hi>Saturday,</hi> because then we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the Apostles sorrow for the loss of
their Lord lying in the grave. The causes
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99745:70"/>
of such religious fastings and prayers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these weeks were formerly many, as
namely that Christians in these religious
duties might let the World know, that
they were as devout, as the Jews formerly
had been, whose custome it was to observe
four solemn Fasts, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 19. That they
might dedicate to God, as the first-fruits,
the beginnings of the several seasons of the
year set apart to his religious worship, and
by this means obtain Gods-blessing upon
them, the remainders of those times.
But the principal cause was for preparation
to the solemn Ordination of Ministers;
holy Church imitating the Apostles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
who when they were to set a-part
men to the Ministery, prayed and fasted,
before they laid on their hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3.
And in after-times, at these solemnities,
these Ember-Fasts, special regard was had
to the Ordination of Priests and Deacons.
In what manner, and with how much care
and Christianity these Fasts have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
observed, may be gathered from
S. <hi>Leo</hi> in his Sermons upon them, and from
others: And the second Councel of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi>
decreed herein to good purpose <hi>(Tit.
1. Dec.</hi> 22.) That upon the Sundays before
these Fasts, the Priests should not only in
their Parishes bid the solemn Fast, but
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99745:71"/>
every one in his several Parish should pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and religiously say the Prayers and
Litanies, &amp;c. That Gods assistence being
implored, both the Bishop may be guided
by the Holy Spirit, in the choice of those
whom he shall Ordain, and also that they
that are ordained, may grow in Learning
and holiness of life. These four Fasts
have been anciently observed, both in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in other Churches.
In the Laws of K. <hi>Canute,</hi> Chap. 16. thus
it is said, <hi>Let every man observe the Fasts
that are commanded, with all earnest care,
whether it be the Ember-Fast, or the Lent-Fast,
or any other Fast.</hi> And the like Decrees
are found in other Councels of our Nation
before his time. See Sir <hi>Henry Spelmans
Concil. Britan.</hi> p. 256. &amp; 518. &amp; 546. Now
for the reason of the name, we find in <hi>Tho.
Becon.</hi> (as he delivers it out of others that
wrote before him) <hi>By opinion of much
people, these daies have been called Ember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,
because that our Fathers would on
these daies eat no bread, but Cakes made
under Embers; so that by eating of that they
reduced into their minds, that they were
but ashes, and so should turn again, and wist
not how soon.</hi> These Fasts are still appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For though
she hath not reckoned them amongst the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99745:71"/>
Holy daies, because there is no peculiar
Office appointed for them, (as there is to
all those that are reckoned in the Catalogue
of Holy days) yet by custome they have
been always kept with Litanies, Prayers
and Fasting, and are commanded to be
kept still as formerly they were by that
excellent Can. 31. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1603.
<q>Forasmuch as the Ancient Fathers of the
Church, led by example of the apostles
who set men apart to the ministery of the
Gospel by imposition of hands with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and fasting,) appointed prayers and
fasts at the solemn ordering of Ministers,
and to that purpose allotted certain times,
in which only sacred orders might be
given or conferred, we following their
holy and religious example, do consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
and decree that Deacons and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
be Ordained or made, but only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

GREAT-WEEK, because it hath a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Service than any other Week, every
day having a Second-service appointed.</p>
                  <p>It was called also the <hi>Holy-week,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men gave over all worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and betook themselves wholly to
devotion this week. The <hi>Courts</hi> were
shut up, and civil affairs laid aside, and
prisoners that were put in for small faults
were freed. <hi>Chrys.</hi> Hom. 30. in 10. cap

                  <p>It was also called the week of <hi>Fasts;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
fasting was then heightned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with watching and prayers: for
these six dayes were spent in lying upon the
ground and afflicting the body, in prayers,
watchings and fastings longer than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And when they did eat, their refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was only bread, salt and water. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan.</hi>
adv. <hi>Aerium.</hi> It will not be amiss
to set down <hi>Epiphanius</hi> somewhat more at
large: [Aerius <hi>and his disciples had flout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Catholick Christians severities at
this time. Why, say they, do you keep
Easter? why do you keep such a strict fast
before it? it is Ienish thus to keep daies of
fasting by a law: it is an enslaving your
selves to a yoke of bondage: if I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
to fast at all, I would fast what day
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99745:73"/>
I pleased, at mine own liberty.</hi> Upon this
principle it is, saith that Father, that
<hi>Aerius</hi> and his followers affect to fast on
Sunday, and feast on Friday, and to spend
this week of Religion and Devotion in jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and sport, rising early to fill themselves
with flesh and wine, with which being full
stuft, they sport and scoff at the Catholick
Christians folly in afflicting themselves
with such severities. <hi>But who,</hi> says he,
<hi>are the more fools; Aerius a silly fellow of
yesterday still living with us, or we who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this severe discipline which our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
delivered us, which they received from
their Fathers, and they from theirs, and so
from the Apostles?</hi>
                  </p>

This day, the penitents that were put
out of the Church upon Ash-wednesday,
were received again into the Church:
partly, because there was this day an holy
Communion in memory of <hi>our Lords</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the same this day: and the
Epistle is fitted to that purpose, sit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was that penitents should be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
this day (upon which this Sacrament
was instituted for the remission of sins) to
receive the holy Communion. Partly,
because this day our <hi>Lord</hi> was apprehended
and bound, whose binding wrought our
deliverance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and freedome.</p>
               <p>The form of reconciling penitents was
in short this. The Bishop goes out to the
doors of the Church, where the penitents<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
prostrate upon the earth, and thrice in
the Name of CHRIST he calls them,
<hi>Come, Come Come ye children, hearken to
me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord:</hi>
then after he hath prayed for them, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
them, he reconciles them, and
brings them into Church. The peniterts
thus received, trim their heads and beards,
and laying off their penitential weeds,
they reclothe themselves in handsome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.
The Church doors were wont to
be set all open this day; to signifie that
penitent sinners coming from North, or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99745:74"/>
South, or any quarter of the World, shall
be received to mercy and the Churches
favour.</p>

               <p>THis day holy Church keeps a most
strict Fast; It is called <hi>GOOD-FRIDAY.</hi>
For a good day it was for
us, even the cause of all our good, and
ground of all our joy: And so in respect
of the effect of it, Christs Passion may be
a Gospel for a Feast; and so it is upon
Palm-Sunday. But if we consider that
our sins were the cause of his Sufferings,
and that it was we that crown'd his head
with thorns, nail'd his hands and feet, and
gored his side with a Spear; so his Passion
considered in the cause of it, is matter of
the greatest sorrow, and in this respect we
keep it a Fast.</p>
               <p>The Gospel is taken out of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than out of any other Evangelist; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was present at the Passion, and
stood by the Cross, when others fled;
and therefore the Passion being represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as it were before our eyes this day; <hi>his</hi>
Testimony is read, who saw it himself;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99745:75"/>
and from whose example we may learn not
to be ashamed, nor afraid of the Cross of
Christ.</p>
               <p>This day holy Church prayes expresly
for all Jews, Turks and Infidels, Enemies
of the Cross of Christ; for this day Christ
both prayed and dyed for his Enemies;
and as he exprest the height of his love
this day, by dying for them; so does the
Church her height of Charity in praying
for them.</p>
               <p>The Antiquity of this Holy day appears
by <hi>Euscb.</hi> Hist. l. 2. c. 17. who there tells us,
<q>That it was an Holy-day in his time, and
long before. That day of our Saviours
Passion we are wont to celebrate, not
only with fastings and watchings, but
also with attentive hearing and reading
of the holy Scriptures.</q>

to Easter.</head>
               <p>THough the Church be always mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
while she is upon Earth, yet at
this time <hi>(the time when Kings go out to
battel,</hi> 2 Sam. 11.) she is more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
militant, going out to fight against
her avowed enemies, the World, the
Flesh and the Devil, making it her especial
business to get the mastery over them, so
far, that they may not be able to prevail
over her the year following. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.25.) <hi>Every
one that strives for mastery is temperate in
all things;</hi> therefore at this time especially,
when she is seeking the mastery over her
Enemies, holy Church does more than
ordinary addict her self to temperance,
fasting and other works of Penance and
Mortification: and accordingly she suits
her Readings, not aiming to fit them to each
particular day (this is to be expected only
upon priviledged days, the subject matter
of whose solemnity is more particularly
recorded in holy Scripture) but to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in general and the Churches design at
this time, commending to us Fasting, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
Alms, Charity and Patience in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99745:76"/>
such voluntary afflictions. And
the Collects are suitable also to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and the time, praying earnestly for
those Graces and Vertues before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which are especially requisite to this
her holy undertaking. And because she
knows her own weakness and her Enemies
both craft and strength, who will then be
most active and busie to hurt when we thus
set our selves to fight against them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
does she earnestly and frequently also
in divers Collects pray for Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and defence from those Enemies,
for his strength and assistence whereby she
may overcome them, <hi>That he would stretch
forth the right hand of his Majesty, and by
his power defend us both outwardly in our
bodies, and inwardly in our souls, which of
our selves have no power to help our selves.</hi>
And in such prayers as these the Church
continues, lifting up her hands (as <hi>Moses</hi>
did his against the <hi>Amalekites</hi>) all the time
of this spiritual conflict.</p>

                  <p>Holy Church her aim is in all these chief
days, to represent as full as may be the
very business of the day, and to put us into
the same holy affections that the Apostles
and other Christians were, when they were
first done; she represents Christ born at
Christmas, and would have us so affected
that day yearly, as the first believers were
at the first tidings delivered by the Angel.
So at his Passion she would have us so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with sorrow, as they were that
stood by the Cross. And now at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
she desires to represent it to us,
as may put us into the same rejoycing, that
those dejected Christians were, when the
Angel told them, <hi>He is not here, but is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi>

us to have fasted and wept upon Good-Friday,

our Lord was taken away according to that
of our Saviour, <hi>The time shall come that
the Bridegroom shall be taken away from

for it is a Thanksgiving for the Jews deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
out of Egypt. Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
if we look well into it, we shall find
it proper enough for the day. For as the
Apostle teaches us, <hi>All things hapned to
them in types and figures;</hi> not only words
but actions were typical. Egypt was a
type of Hell, and their captivity there,
a type of our captivity under sin and the
Devil. Their deliverance from thence,
a type and figure of our deliverance from
Hell: and that which the Psalmist here
gives thanks for as past, in the History,
is understood to be meant as much or more
in the prophesie of Christs Redemption
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99745:79"/>
of his Church, (the true Israelites, <hi>that

                  <p>The <hi>first Lesson Morn.</hi> is <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. in

of the Passeover: For as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> observes,
<hi>Ep. 119. We do in this Feast not only call
to mind the history of our Saviours Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
but also celebrate the mystery of
ours.</hi> That as Christ this day rose again
from death to life, so by Christ and the
vertue of his Resurrection shall we be

                     </gap> alive, and rise from death to life
eternal. Christ is therefore our true Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,

For it is concerning the Israelites delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
out of Egypt, a type of our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from Hell this day by Christs glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
resurrection. As that day Israel saw
that great work, which the Lord did upon
Egypt, Ver. 31. So this day we see the
great conquest over Hell and Death fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
by Christs triumphant Resurrection
from the dead.</p>

The <hi>Second Lessons</hi> are plain.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel gives us the full evidence of
Christs Resurrection: The Epistle tells what
use we should make of it, <hi>If Christ be risen,
seek those things that are above, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Collect prayes for grace, to make
that use of it which the Epistle directs.</p>
                  <p>Thus holy Church is careful to teach and
instruct all her children in the matter of the
Feast, preaching Christs Resurrection to
us, both in the type and Prophesie out of
the Old Test. and in the History of it out
of the New. And she does not only teach
us to know what God hath done for us
this day, but also she is careful that we
may do our duty to God for this his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
goodness, commanding and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
recting us to pray for grace to do our
duty, prescribing us excellent forms of
adoring and blessing God for his mercy,
this day such methods as the Holy Ghost
hath set down, in which we may be sure
to pray and praise God by the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>For the Antiquity of this Feast, heaps of
Testimonies might be brought, but these
two following may suffice.</p>

to us, and commanded either by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councels (whose authority in the
Church is most safe) or else by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
as for example, That the Passion
of our Lord, his Resurrection and Ascension

kept their Easter the first Sunday after the

usage the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> confirmed for
these reasons.</p>

kept their <hi>Easter</hi> in thankful remembrance

and therefore differing so much in the main
of the Feast, they would not comply with

                  <p>Thirdly, because after the Jews fashion

it might happen that there might be

in Easter-week</head>
                  <p>THese two Holy days are added as At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
upon Easter-day in honour
of this high Feast and the more solemnity
of it. And we find S. <hi>Austin</hi> upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
mentioning them <hi>De civit, Dei</hi> l. 22.
c. 8. although both from him (else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where)
and others we may gather that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99745:81"/>
these two days were not all which at that
time were added to the Feast: For of old,
this Queen of Feasts, as the Fathers call
it, was so highly esteemed, that it was in
a manner solemnized fifty days together,
even from Easter to Whitsuntide. See
<hi>Ambr. Ser. 61. Per hos quinquaginta dies
nobis est jugis &amp; continuata Festivitas, &amp;c.</hi>
See also <hi>Euseb. de vit. Constant.</hi> l. 4. c. 64.
And <hi>Tertul. de Iejuniis.</hi> And in his Book
<hi>de Idol.</hi> where he affirms that all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Festivals put together could not equal
this one great and solemn Feast of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
From these and the like places some
conclude, and most probably, That every
day of that time the Christians met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in publick to sing with greatest joy
Psalms and Allelujah to God Almighty,
and to take the Cup of Salvation, the holy
Communion, praising the Name of the
Lord. All which time they did not kneel
at their prayers which was accounted a
posture of mourners, but <hi>Stand,</hi> (as upon
Sundays they were wont) in token of joy,
thus making every of those days equal in a
manner to Sundays. The reason of this
so great and long Festivity at this time,
was principally because it was the Feast of
Easter, or of our blessed Lords Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
a principal Article of our faith: for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99745:82"/>
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, 1 Cor. 15. <hi>If Christ be not
risen we are yet in our sins, and we Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
of all men m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st miserable.</hi> Now that
Christ is risen, needs must there be in
Christians hearts an overflowing of joy,
which in those times they expressed by such
dayly publick exercises of Religion, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
of receiving the holy communion,
the pledge of our resurrection (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
says S. <hi>Iohn 6. He that eats my flesh
shall live for ever)</hi> that by this means the
memory of the resurrection might be fixt
deeply in their minds. We must not think
that the Christians then did keep all this
Time holy, so as to cease from labour (for
the poverty of many, and the care and
charity required in all, would not permit
that) but only as to religious exercises
and services. As devotion abated, the
Feast was shortned; yet long after <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
even till <hi>Gratians</hi> time and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the whole week of Easter, as also
of Whitsuntide, were reckoned among
Holy-days. <hi>Gratian. de Consec.</hi> Dist. 3.
And our Church, though she enjoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s only
Munday and Tuesday of this week for
Holy-days, yet seems to me to commend the
keeping holy of this whole week, as also
of the whole week after Christmas, Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and Pentecost: For she directs the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99745:82"/>
proper Prefaces for Christmas, Easter,
Ascen. and Pentecost to be used every day
the week after; Which Prefaces are to be
used only at the Communion, as appears
by the Rubricks; so that by prescribing
the Prefaces to be used upon every day of
the week, she doth withal prescribe the
Communion every day likewise, which is
properly the keeping of a day <hi>Solemnly</hi>
Holy; and this weeks solemnity is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
as we have said, for the expressing
of our joy for our Lords Resurrection,
and the honour of the Feast, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were not willing to make shorter
than the Jews Feast of unleavened Bread.</p>
                  <p>Among the Ancients there was another
peculiar Reason for the keeping of the
whole week of Easter Holy, besides that
of the Resurrection. For they ministring
Baptism (except in case of necessity) a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
no other times but the Eves of Easter and
Whitsunday, did make it a part of their
Festivity, the week following to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
the access of a new Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny;
the New Baptized coming each day
to Church in white vestures with lights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them: where Thanksgivings and
Prayers were made for them, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
also to those that were of years
of discretion (for at that time, there were
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99745:83"/>
many such that came in from Heathenism)
in the principles and ways of Christianity.
But afterwards, when most of the baptized
were Infants, and so not capable of such
solemnities, this custome was altered, and
Baptism administred all times of the year,
as at the beginning of Christianity. <hi>Tertul.

                  <p>Hitherto since Easter the Church hath
been as it were overwhelmed in the joyful
meditation of Christs Resurrection from
the dead, or chiefly about it, and that hath
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99745:84"/>
been the subject of all the Collects since
then. Now in this Collect (as somewhat
also in one of the Readings aforegoing)
the Church reflects upon that other ancient
Paschal Solemnity, the general Baptism
that was used at that time; so that this
Collect is for the new baptized or new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates
by Baptism: desiring Almighty
God who shews the light of his truth,
to them that be in error, (enlightning
them by baptism, which was therefore

be admitted into the fellowship of Christs
religion, namely by baptism, that they
may eschew those things that be contrary
to their profession, or vow in baptism, &amp;c.
Though this custome of general baptism
at Easter be not in use now, yet this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
is still seasonable, as a general anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Commemoration of the great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
received from God by our baptism,
and our solemn vow and profession made
to him therein.</p>

baptized at Easter the year before, came
the year following the same day to the
Church, and solemnly with ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other religious offices commemorated the
anniversary day of their new birth.
Though our Church does not in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
observe the same custome, yet she
draws near to the ancient practice, in this
solemn, though general Anniversary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of baptism this day, minding
us all this day of our baptism, and our
vow made therein, and praying to God to
enable us all to keep it. And for this very
reason does she appoint children to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
upon Sundays and other Holy-days
when most people are present, that they
may be put in remembrance of their own
profession made to God in baptism; <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
before Baptism:</hi> and happy were it
for us, if we would made good use of this
care of the Church, and be often remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that solemn vow; by which we have
dedicated our selves to God to be an holy
people; the wilful breach of which vow
is horrid Sacriledge.</p>
                  <p>In the Gospel our Saviour tells his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
that though they <hi>should weep and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
(by reason of his death) <hi>their sorrow
should be turned into joy, which no man
should take from them</hi> (namely after his
Resurrection.) And such joy belongs to
this time and to us in it, if we be also his
true Disciples and followers; which how
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99745:85"/>
we may be, the Epistle shews by minding
us of (what we promised and vowed,
when admitted into Christs School, and
gave up our names to him) <hi>the abstaining
from fleshly lusts, and having honest conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi>
in all our Relations. And this is the
main drift of the whole Epistle (the first
of S. <hi>Peter)</hi> out of which this is taken, to
perswade them that were born again, and
lately become Christians, to walk suitably
to such an holy profession and that chiefly
in regard <hi>of the lively hope unto which they
were begotten again by the Resurrection of
Iesus Christ from the dead,</hi> and so is most
agreeable to the Churches meditations this
day and season.</p>

upon the three following days Rogations
and Litanies were used, and Fasting, for
these two reasons. 1. Because this time

               <p>The Fast this week is voluntary: for

The 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> begins, <hi>O Lord our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
how excellent is thy name in all the
world, thou that hast set thy glory above the
heavens.</hi> This was fulfilled this day. For
this day he set his glory above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
ascending from earthly humility to
heavenly glory. This made thy Name
wonderful in all the world: For hereby it
appears, that thou that didst before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
so low, and wert for a time so vile
reputed, art greater than all Principalities
and Powers in Heaven and Earth; since
some saw, and all men now believe, that
thou didst ascend into Heaven, whereby
thou hast gotten <hi>A name above all names,
That at the Name of Iesus every knee
should bow, both of things in Hevven, and
earth, Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psal. 15. Who shall dwell in thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
or who shall rest upon thy holy hill?
even he that hath clean hands, &amp;c.</hi> shews
both how just it was that Christ should
ascend and rest upon the holy Hill, the
highest Heaven, of which Mount <hi>Sion</hi>
was a type: for he of all others had clean
hands and a pure heart, and withal tells
us the way which we must walk, <hi>viz.</hi> the
way of righteousness and holiness, if we
desire to follow Christ to heaven.</p>
               <p>The 21. <hi>Psal.</hi> is to be understood of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99745:88"/>
Christ. S. <hi>Aug.</hi> in loc, Ver. 4. <hi>Thou gavest
him a long life, even for ever and ever, his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is great in thy salvation.</hi> 
                  <q>The raising
him from death, hath made his honour
great, and all the world to believe in him.
<hi>Glory and great worship shalt thou lay upon
him,</hi> by setting him at thy right hand in
Heaven.</q> The rest of the Psalm is to
the same purpose, of Christs absolute tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over his enemies, which was this day
fulfilled, when he led captivity captive.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Even. Psalms</hi> are 24. 68. 108.
Psalms.</p>
               <p>The 24. was sung this day at Christs
Ascension, by a Quire of Angels, some
going before the Lord Christ, knocking,
as it were, at Heaven gates, and singing,
<hi>Lift up your heads O ye gates, and be ye lift
up ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory
shall come in:</hi> to whom other Angels in
Heaven, desirous to know, who this King
of glory was, sing the next words, <hi>Who
is the King of glory?</hi> The first Angels,
that waited upon our Lord in his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
answer, <hi>The Lord strong and mighty,
even the Lord mighty in battel,</hi> as ye may
see by the prisoners that he leads captive in
his triumph. Therefore <hi>Lift up your heads, O
ye gates,</hi> that never were yet opened to
humane nature, <hi>where never man yet entred,</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:99745:89"/>
S. <hi>Iohn 3. 13. Acts 2. 24. Heb.</hi> 10. 20.
The other Angels as yet, as it were, amazed
at the glory of the triumph, ask again,
<hi>Who is the King of glory?</hi> what Lord is it
that is so mighty? His heavenly Guard
answer again, <hi>The Lord of hosts, he is the
King of glory; Theodor.</hi> in Psal. Then
Heaven gates were opened, and our dear
Lord entred, and took possession for us,
and prepared places for us S. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 2.</p>
               <p>The 68. <hi>Psal.</hi> at the 18. ver. is by the
Apostle applyed to the Ascension of Christ,
<hi>Ephes. 4. 8. Thou hast ascended up on high,
and led captivity captive.</hi> It is not to be
denied, but that it may be applyed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also, (for the Scripture is full of
sense,) as to <hi>Moses.</hi> For he from the
bottom of the Red Sea, went up to the top
of <hi>Sinai,</hi> leading with him the people of
Israel, that long had been captive to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh:</hi>
and there received gifts, the Law,
the Priesthood, but above all, the Ark of
the Covenant to be the pledge of Gods
presence amongst them: this is the literal
sense.</p>
               <p>This of <hi>Moses,</hi> by analogy, doth King
<hi>David</hi> apply to himself, to his going up to
mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and carrying up the Ark thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For all agree, this Psalm was set
upon that occasion. The very beginning
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99745:89"/>
of it <hi>(Let God arise,)</hi> shews as much; the
acclamation ever to be used at the Arks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving,
<hi>Num.</hi> 10. 35. This was done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
upon his conquest of the <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi>
whom he had taken captives, what
time for the honour of the solemnity, he
dealt gifts, bread and wine to the people,
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. But in the prophetical sense,
this Psalm belongs to Christ, to <hi>the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Iesus,</hi> which <hi>is the Spirit of all
prophesie, Rev.</hi> 19. 10. For that was the
greatest captivity that ever was led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
his the highest up-going, higher
than <hi>Sion</hi> or <hi>Sinai</hi> far: that the most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and glorious triumph, when Christ
made a shew of Principalities and Powers
of Hell, triumphing over them in his
own person, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. which was this
days triumph. Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> Serm 7.
in Pentecost.</p>
               <p>In the 108. Psal. The Prophet awakes
himself and his Instruments of Musick,
to give thanks to God among the people,
and among the Nations, for setting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
above the heavens, and his glory above
all the earth, which was most litterally ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in his Ascension into Heaven, and
sitting down at the right hand of God. It
is true, this Psalm is thought to be set
upon another occasion, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods promise
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99745:90"/>
of subduing the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Idumeans</hi>
under <hi>David,</hi> for which, he here vowes
his best thanks: yet for all this, it may be,
and that principally, meant of Christ and
his triumphant Ascension. For God
Almighty did so direct the mind of the
Prophets, that, that which was spoken by
them of other persons and actions, is
oft-times more exactly fulfilled in and by
Christ. <hi>Osee 11. 1. Out of Egypt have I
called my Son,</hi> was there spoken of the
deliverance of the people of Israel out of
Egypt, fulfilled in Christ, S. <hi>Matth,</hi> 2. 15.
What <hi>David</hi> sayes of himself, <hi>I will open
my mouth in a payable,</hi> was fulfilled by
Christ, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 35. The 72. Psalm was
written for <hi>Solomon,</hi> as the title shews, but
more exactly fulfilled of Christ. <hi>Davids</hi>
complaint or his own n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

verified in Christ. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15 25. Nay
more, (which is worth our observation)
some things <hi>David</hi> spea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do not agree to him, but in a figure,
which agree to Christ in the letter; as,
<hi>They parted my garments among them, and
cast lots upon my vesture, Psalm</hi> 22. 17, 18.
Nay, in the same Psalm, (and sometimes
in the same verse) some words will not
agree to Christ, as <hi>Psal. 69. 5. My faults
are not hid from thee:</hi> These cannot be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99745:90"/>
of Christ who knew no sin. Some
words again most properly belong to
Christ, as verse 22. <hi>They gave me gall to
eat, and when I was thirsty, they gave me
vinegar to drink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus holy Church hath in the Lessons
and Gospel preached to us the Ascension
of Christ, in the type and antitype. In the
Epistle she teaches us our duty not to stand
gazing up to Heaven, wondring at the
strangeness of the sight, but to take heed to
demean our selves so, as that we may with
comfort behold him at his second coming,
his coming to judgment, <hi>Act. 1. 11. Why stand
ye gazing up into heaven?</hi> there is other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to be done, fit your selves for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
coming, for <hi>this same Iesus which
was taken up from you into heaven, shall
so come, even as ye have seen him go into
heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Collect we are taught to pray,
that we, as far as may be, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to our Lord in his Ascension, that
like as we believe him to have ascended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Heavens, so we may also in heart
and mind thither ascend, and with him
continually dwell. In the special Psal. and
Hymn we adore and bless God for our
Saviours glorious Ascension. It is pleasant
to behold the rare beauty of the Churches
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99745:91"/>
offices, as on others, so on this day, how
each part suits the other.</p>
               <p>The Gospel to the Lessons, the Epistle
to the Gospel, the Collect and Psalms
and Hymns, all fitted to the same, and all
to the day.</p>

As in a long war it happens; when the
war is ended, and peace concluded, Pledges
and Hostages are mutually sent, both as
tokens of, and securities for, the mutual
agreement and peace: so was it betwixt
God and Man. After our Lord Jesus had
ended the long war betwixt God and Man,
and finished the reconciliation, he sent up,
or rather he carried up himself, our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage,
our flesh and nature ennobled by the
union with his Divine Person, as a royal
pledge to his Father: on the other side,
God sent this day his royal Hostage, his
holy Spirit, a security for our future
peace. 1. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 12, 13. <hi>Chrys.</hi> Hom. 1.
in Pentecost. Edit. <hi>Savil.</hi> tom. 5. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
had taken us captive, our Lord Christ
undertakes the quarrel, his death was his
battel, but then he seem'd to be overcome:
but up he got again at his Resurrection;
that was his victory; his Ascension was
his triumph: and as the ancient custome
was for Conquerours to scatter gifts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the beholders, especially on the last
and great day of the triumph: so does our
Lord, in this last day of the Feast, the
Conclusion of his triumph, he doth, as it
were, make the Conduits run with Wine;
he poured out his Spirit so upon all flesh,
that some mockers said, they were <hi>full of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99745:92"/>
new wine, Acts</hi> 2. 12. He casts abroad his
new wine, new gifts and graces of the
world, giving <hi>to some the word of wisdome,
to others the gift of knowledge, to others
faith, to others the gift of healing, to others
the working of miracles, to others prophesie,
to others discerning of spirits, to others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
kinds of tongue, to others the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of tongues:</hi> all these worketh one
and the same spirit, the Holy Ghost
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4.) whom the Lord Christ as
he promised, sent down this day with these
gifts, in honour of whom and his gifts we
keep this day holy.</p>
               <p>This time was also appointed of old for
solemn baptism. The reason was: 1.
Because this day the Apostles were baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the holy Ghost and fire, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
3. 2. Because this day three thousand
were baptized by the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40.

this Feast. <hi>Gratian.</hi> de Consec. Dis. 3. c. 13.</p>
               <p>This day is called Pentecost, because it
is fifty days betwixt the true Passeover and
Whitsunday.</p>
               <p>As there were fifty days from the Jews
Passeover to the giving of the Law to
<hi>Moses</hi> in Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> which Law was
written with the finger of God: (for from
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99745:92"/>
the 14. day of the first month, the day of
the Passeover, to the third day of the
third month, the day of the Laws giving,

Passeover which was celebrated, when
Christ was offered up for us, are fifty days

               <p>It is also called <hi>Whitsunday</hi> from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Lights, which kindled such a light in the

world on this day, as never shall be put
out to the worlds end: as also because the
new baptized, which were many at that

two solemn times of baptism) and of old
called <hi>Illuminati,</hi> the Enlightned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.

in baptism, were then cloathed in white
garments, as types both of that spiritual
whiteness and purity of soul, which they
received in baptism, and were carefully to
preserve all their life after, As also of
their joy for being made then by baptism
members of Christ, Children of God, and
Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven. White
is the colour of joy, says <hi>Eccles. 9. 8. Let
thy garments be always white, for God now
accepts of thy works.</hi> S. <hi>Cyril</hi> in his 4. <hi>Cat.
myst.</hi> alluding to this ancient custome of
the new baptized, of putting off their old
garments, and clothing themselves in pure
white, hath words to this effect. <q>This
white clothing is to mind you, that you
should always hereafter go in white. I
speak not this to perswade you always
to wear white clothes, but that you
should ever be clothed with spiritual
white, brightness and purity o soul.
that so you may say with divine <hi>Esay 61.
10. I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, for
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99745:93"/>
he hath clothed me with the garments of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
he hath covered me with the robe
of righteousness.</hi> Of which robe of
righteousness and garment of salvation,
the white vestment was a resemblance.

of Weeks, which was a type of ours.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Evening</hi> first Lesson <hi>Wisd.</hi> 1. is fit
for this day. For it treats of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
ver. 5, 6. how it fills the world, ver.
7. which was most exactly fulfilled this
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99745:94"/>
day, in which <hi>they were all filled with the
holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 2.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Psalms</hi> for the morning 45. 47. are
very proper to the day. The beginning
of the 45. is concerning the Birth of
Christ, and therefore used upon Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-day;
but the latter part is concerning
the calling of the Gentiles, ver. 10, 11.
and the glory of the Church the King of
Heavens Daughter, v. 14. <hi>Who is all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
within,</hi> through the heavenly gifts
and graces of the holy Ghost, sent down
this day; which glorious gifts miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
poured upon the Church brought
in the Gentiles to the Christian faith, ver.
15. <hi>The Virgins that be her fellows shall
bear her company; and shall be brought unto
thee.</hi> For which all the people shall (as
holy Church directs us to do this day)
give thanks unto thee, verse 18. In holy
<hi>`Davids</hi> Psalms, as we do, so <hi>Theodoret</hi>
in Psal. <q>
                     <hi>I will remember thy Name from
one generation to another, therefore shall
the people give thanks unto thee, world
without end:</hi> That is, all people to the

blessings upon the Church with those
Psalms which I compose, and so, (though
I be dead long before) yet in my
Psalms sung by them, I will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

               </p>
               <p>The 47. Psalm is a song of praise for the
conversion of the Gentiles, by the Gospel

this Psalm gives thanks.</p>
               <p>

thankful Commemorations of the various
gifts of God the Holy Ghost, who then
gave temporal, this day, spiritual gifts,
which spiritual gifts of this day were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
out by those temporal, and <hi>all come
from the same spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 4. to whom
this Feast is held sacred: So that in bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Author of them, we bless the
Author of these, the holy Spirit from whom
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99745:95"/>
these divers gifts. Some part of the 104.
is more particularly appliable to this Feast.
<hi>He maketh the clouds his chariots,</hi> that was
upon Ascension day, when he went up to

               <head>TRINITY-SVNDAY.</head>
               <p>IN Ancient Liturgies and Ritualists, we
find this day lookt upon as an <hi>Octave</hi>
of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> or as <hi>Dominica vacans</hi> (of
which Name is spoken p. 219.) and that
the observing of it as a Feast of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
was of later use, and more late in the
Roman Church than in some other, (See
<hi>Decretal</hi> lib. 2. T. 9. <hi>De Feriis)</hi> And
there were who objected, that because on
each day (and especially Sundays) the
Church celebrates the praises of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in her Doxologies, Hymns, Creeds,
&amp;c. Therefore there was no need of a
Feast on one day for that which was done
on each. But yet the wisdom of the Church
thought it meet, that such a Mystery as
this, though part of the Meditation of each
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99745:96"/>
day, should be the chief subject of one,
and this to be the day. For no sooner had
our Lord ascended into Heaven, and Gods
holy Spirit descended upon the Church,
but there ensued the notice of the glorious
and incomprehensible Trinity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time was not so clearly known.
The Church therefore having solemnized
in an excellent order all the high Feast of
our Lord, and after, That of the descent
of Gods Spirit upon the Apostles, thought
it a thing most seasonable to conclude these
great solemnities with a Festival of full,
special and express Service to the holy
and blessed Trinity. And this the rather
in after-times, when <hi>Arrians</hi> and such like
Hereticks had appeared in the world, and
vented their blasphemies against this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mystery.</p>
               <p>Some proper Lessons this day hath, as
the <hi>Morning</hi> First and Second.</p>
               <p>The first Lesson is <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. wherein we
read of three that appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
or the Lord in three Persons, ver. 1, 2. A
type of that mysterious Trinity in Unity,
which was after revealed in the Gospel:
So <hi>Theodor.</hi> l. 2. <hi>ad Graec.</hi> 
                  <q>Because the
Jews had long lived in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had
learned there the worship of many gods;
the most wise God did not plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99745:96"/>
to them the mystery of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
lest they should have mistaken it for
a doctrine of a plurality of gods. Yet
the Doctrine of the Trinity was not
wholly hidden in those times, but some
seeds of that perfection of Divinity were
dispersed: and for that cause, the Quire
of Angels sing thrice <hi>Holy,</hi> but once
<hi>Lord, holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts;</hi>
and here Three Men appeared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Lesson, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. is
thought fit for this Feast, because it delivers
to us the baptism of Christ, at which was
discovered the mystery of the Trinity;
for there the Son is baptized, the holy
Spirit descends upon him, and the Father
speaks from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved
Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Epistle and the Gospel are the same
that in Ancient Services were assigned for
the <hi>Octave</hi> of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> (The Epistle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the vision of S. <hi>Iohn, Rev.</hi> 4. and
the Gospel the Dialogue of our Lord with
<hi>Nicodemus)</hi> And the mentioning (which
we find therein) of Baptism, of the holy
Spirit and gifts of it, though it might then
fit the day, as a repetition (as it were)
of Pentecost, so is it no less fit for it as a
Feast to the Blessed Trinity. The mission
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99745:97"/>
the Holy Ghost brings with it (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
more light and clearness to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity, and when more fit
to think of the gifts of the Spirit, than
on a solemn day of Ordination (as this is
one) when Men are consecrated to spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Offices? But besides this, we have in
the Gospel set before us, all the Three
Persons of the Sacred Trinity, and the
same likewise represented in the Vision
which the Epistle speaks of, with an Hymn
of praise, <hi>Holy, holy, holy Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
&amp;c.</hi> which expressions by ancient
interpretation relate to the holy Trinity,
as is above said.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Of the Sundayes after TRINITY
till ADVENT.</head>
                  <p>THe Church hath now finished the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the high Festivals and
thereby run, as it were, through a great
part of the <hi>Creed,</hi> by setting before us in
an orderly manner the highest Mysteries
of our Redemption by Christ on earth,
till the day he was taken up into Heaven,
with the sending down of the Holy Ghost
at Pentecost. Now after she hath in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
and reflexion upon these Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:99745:97"/>
broke out into a more solemn and
special Adoration of the Blessed Trinity,
she comes according to her Method in the
Intervals of great Feasts (of which see
Pag. 93.) to use such Epistles, Gospels,
and Collects, as suit with her holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and aims at this season. Such,
namely, as tend to our edifying, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the living Temples of the Holy Ghost
our Comforter with his Gifts and Graces;
that having Oyl in our Lamps, we may
be in better readiness to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
at his second Advent or coming
to judgment. And this done in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sundaies till Advent, which in
their Services are, as it were, so many
Eccho's and Reflexions upon the Mystery
of Pentecost (the life of the Spirit) or as
Trumpets for preparation to meet our
Lord at his second coming. Which will
be more manifest if we take a general view
of the Gospels together, and afterwards of
the Epistles and Collects.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>GOSPELS</hi> for this time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the method which hath before
been declared, pag. 93. are of the holy
Doctrine, Deeds and Miracles of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and so may singularly conduce to
the making us good Christians, by being
followers of Christ, and replenished with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99745:98"/>
that Spirit which he both promised and
sent, and for which the Church lately kept
so great a solemnity: For to be charitable,
heavenly-minded, repentant, merciful,
humble, peaceable, religious, compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and thankful, to trust in God and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with such spiritual qualities, are
the Lessons taught us by our Lord in these
Gospels; and that not only by word and
deed, but many miracles also, for divers
Gospels are of such, and tend much to
our edifying. From his healing of the
sick, and going about doing good, we may
learn to employ that power and ability we
have in works of mercy and goodness. He
that raised the dead, and did such mighty
works, can be no other, we may be sure,
than God and Man, the Saviour of the
world, and able to protect us, even against
death it self, to raise our bodies from the
dust, and glorifie them hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have in general the intent of
these Gospels (as may easily appear by
particular observation) and withal, how
pertinent they are to the time. And with
them the Church concludes her Annual
course of such readings, having thereby
given us (and in such time and order as
most apt to make deep impression) the
chief matter and substance of the four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:99745:98"/>
True it is, that in ancient <hi>Rituals,</hi> and
particularly in S. <hi>Hieromes Comes</hi> (or
<hi>Lectionarius)</hi> where we find this same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Epistles and Gospels (See <hi>Pamelii
Liturg. Eccles. Lat.</hi> T. 2.) there are some
other besides these which our Church
useth, as for Wednesdays, Fridaies and
other special times and Solemnities. But
these for Sundaies and other Holy-daies,
which are retained by our Church, are so
well chosen for the fitness, variety and
weightiness of the matter, and out of that
Evangelist that delivers it most fully, that
the chiefest passages of all the Evangelists
are hereby made known and preached to
us; and what we meet not with here is
abundantly supplied by the daily Second
Lessons. And the like also may be said
concerning the Epistles.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>EPISTLES</hi> for this time there
is an Harmony with the Gospels, but not
so much as some have thought in their joynt
propounding of-particular considerations,
and those several and distinct, as the daies
they belong to (for that belongs to more
special solemnities) but rather as they
meet all in the common stream, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
meditation and affection of the season.</p>
                  <p>We may therefore observe, that as all
the Gospels for Sundaies since <hi>Easter</hi> day
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99745:99"/>
hitherto are taken out of the beloved Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who therein gives us many
of the last and most tender and affectionate
words of our dear Lord before his Passion
and Ascension; his promising of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
bidding them not fear, bequeath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing
his peace to them, and the like: so
now the two first Epistles are taken (and
most fitly) out of the same Apostle, who
therein minds us with much earnest affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that spirit which our Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for our Comforter, and of the great
effect and sign of it, <hi>the love of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
If,</hi> saith he, <hi>we love one another,
God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfect in
us: Hereby know we that we dwell in him,
and he in us, because he hath given us of his
Spirit.</hi> And the Epistle for the second Sunday
exhorteth us in like manner, <hi>To love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as he gave commandment, and he that
keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him,
and he in him; and hereby we know that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth
in us, even by the Spirit which he hath
given us.</hi> In the Epistle for the third Sunday,
we are put in mind by S. <hi>Peter</hi> of submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and being humble, (for God gives grace
to such) of sobriety, watching, faith and
patience in affliction, with an exhortation
<hi>to cast our care upon God, who cares for us,
and shall perfect, se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tle, strengthen and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99745:99"/>
us,</hi> which is according to what Christ
said, <hi>That he would not leave us Comfortless.</hi>
The fourth Epistle is out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and is
a comfort against afflictions, <hi>as not worthy
of that glory which shall be shewed upon us,</hi>
provided we be such as they whom the
Apostle there speaks of, <hi>who had received
the first-fruits of the Spirit.</hi> The Epistle
for the fifth being taken out of S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
exhorts us to Love, Peace, Innocence and
such spiritual affections; and if any trouble
us, <hi>not to be afraid,</hi> but to <hi>sanctifie the
Lord God in our hearts.</hi> The rest of the
Epistles for all the days following, relate
much to the same business, as newness of
life, and all the fruits and gifts of Gods
holy Spirit, and as a particular insight will
sufficiently manifest. But being not the
first that are used in this season, they seem
to have been chosen with more indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for they are taken out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
keep the very order of his Epistles, and
the place they have in each Epistle. For of
them the first are out of the Epistle to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and (so in order) the next out
of the Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (first and
second) <hi>Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians,</hi>
and <hi>Colossians,</hi> for so far the Order reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
till the time of Advent. Only two of
the Sundaies (the 18. and 25.) do vary
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99745:100"/>
from this method in the choice of their
Epistles, and there is reason for both.</p>
                  <p>And first, for the 25. or last Sunday the
reason is manifest: for it being lookt upon
as a kind of preparative or fore-runner of
Advent, as Advent is to Christmas (and
in S. <hi>Ieromes Lectionarius</hi> it is comprized
within the time of Advent) an Epistle
was chosen not as hapned according to the
former method, but such an one as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
of Christs Advent or Coming;
for that plainly appears in This out of
<hi>Ieremy, Behold the time cometh saith the
Lord, that I will raise up the righteous
branch of David, which King shall bear
rule, and he shall prosper with wisdom, and
shall set up Equity and Righteousness again
in Earth.</hi> The like Prophesie is implyed
in the Gospel, and applyed to <hi>Iesus</hi> in the
words of the people when they had seen
his miracle. <hi>This is of a truth the same
Prophet that should come into the world.</hi> And
therefore when there are either more or
fewer Sundays than 25 between <hi>Trinity</hi>
and <hi>Advent,</hi> if we so dispose of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
as always to make use of this for
the last of them, it will be agreeable to
reason and exemplary practice, and that
from time of old, for we find such a Rule
in <hi>Micrologus</hi> an ancient Ritualist. The
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99745:100"/>
                     <hi>other Sunday</hi> that follows not the method
of the rest, is the 18. after <hi>Trinity;</hi> for its
Epistle is taken out of the first to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi>
not out of that to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
as other are for the Sundayes that go next
before and after. This seems to be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by a particular circumstance for
which a fit Epistle was to be found out,
though it were not taken out of its place
in the usual order, and that was the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of <hi>Ministers;</hi> for the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, and the ancient care about
Ordinations, it will not be amiss to be
somewhat the larger. We may therefore
note that what was said of Collects (pag.
70.) is true also of this order of Epistles
and Gospels, that it comes down to us
from Ancient Times, as appears by S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes
Lectionarius</hi> above mentioned, and
other old Liturgists and Expositors. And
by them we find that it was the Custome of
old to have proper Services for Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
Fridays, and Saturdayes in each
Ember-week, and then followed (as with
us) the conferring of Holy Orders. But
care being taken that the Ordination should
be performed after continuance the same
day in Prayer and fasting, and yet be done
upon the Lords day also; and because by
ancient Canon that day was not to be fasted,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99745:101"/>
they therefore took this course, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it on Saturday (it being one of the
Ember Fasts) and yet in the Evening of
it, for that time was accounted as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Lords day following; or if
they would continue so long fasting, to do
it early in the morning following. See <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In regard therefore that this was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Sundays work, and that there
had been so much Exercise and Fasting on
Saturday, the Sunday following had no
publick Office, and was therefore called
<hi>Dominica Vacat</hi> (or <hi>Vacans)</hi> a vacant Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
But it was afterwards thought bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not to let that day pass in that manner,
nor to continue so long and late on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in such Abstinence and Exercise; and
therefore the Ordination came to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sooner on Saturday, and the Sunday
following had a Service said on it, which
at first for some time was borrowed of
some other days, but afterwards One was
fixt, being fitted to the day or season with
some respect in the frame of it to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
at that time. For although there
were peculiar Readings, Rites and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for the Ordination it self (as there is
also in our Church much resembling the
ancient Form,) yet besides that, in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99745:101"/>
general Service of the day, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
was made on the business of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>Only the <hi>Vacant Sunday</hi> for the Ember

Sunday sometimes is the 18. after Trinity,
sometimes the 17. or sooner, as Easter
falls out; and accordingly takes the service
of the 18. Sunday, or some other before
it, as it happens to be that year. But of
old after other Vacant days had their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Services, this day continued for some
while to make use of borrowing; so <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
and <hi>Micrologus</hi> say it was in their
times: and what Service can we think
could be more useful for that purpose,
than this of the 18th Sunday, especially if

had then?</p>
                  <p>In ancient Rituals, as S. <hi>Hieromes Lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marius,</hi>

and <hi>Berno Augiens.</hi> in his 5. Chap. is as
large in shewing how well it might serve
in that regard for a supplement to the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
Sunday.</hi> All which considered, and
withal that the usual order of the Epistles
from 5. to the 25. was changed only in
This, and that according to the course of
Easter, the Ordination falls on this Sunday,
or some other before it, we may very
probably conclude that the choice of this
Epistle (and Gospel also) was with design
to exercise our meditations somewhat on
the Ordination this day celebrated, or not
long before it. And hereby a good ground
was given to the Preacher in his Sermon
(for that was usually upon the Readings of
the day) to declare in a fit season the duty
of Pastors and their flocks, according as
he saw occasion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Epistle</hi> is a Thanksgiving <hi>in behalf
of the Corinthians for the grace of God which
was given them by Iesus Christ:</hi> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by what the Apostle saith of them in
divers places, that they had been taught
by many learned Instructers, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them had much profited, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in many spiritual gifts: And such gifts
are here mentioned as are specially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99745:102"/>
for them that are Ordained to be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Guides, as the <hi>being enriched in all
utterance, and in all knowledge, and being
behind in no good gift.</hi> And the <hi>Gospel</hi> is of
our Saviours answering a question of a
Doctor of the Law, of his silencing both
Pharisees and Sadduces by his doctrine and
questions: whereby he shews how those
whom he sends on Divine Messages should
be qualified, how able to speak a word in
due season, to give a reason of their faith,
and to convince gain-sayers. This is the
Gospel in the ancient <hi>Lectionary</hi> above
mentioned; and though some Churches
use other, yet we may observe that they
are all very appliable to this occasion. And
the old <hi>Anthems or Versicles</hi> for the day
S. <hi>Greg. Antiphonary</hi> (which are to be
found most of them in some Latin Services)
are herein most express: desiring of God,
<hi>That his Prophets may be found faithful;</hi>
and speaking of <hi>being glad of going into the
house of God, Bringing presents, coming
into his Courts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Of telling out among the
Heathen that the Lord is King; Of Moses
hallowing an Altar, and offering Sacrifices,
ascending into the Mount, praying for the
people, of Gods shewing himself to him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that other <hi>Ordination-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
relate principally (as is most meet)
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99745:103"/>
to the chief Meditations of those
special seasons wherein they fall,
but yet therein we may find matter
very pertinent to this occasion. How
fit the Service of <hi>Trinity Sunday</hi> is in this
regard, hath already been declared <hi>p.</hi> 182.
nor could any season have been more aptly
chosen for this occasion. In that of <hi>Lent</hi>
the Epistle tells us what holiness of life is
required in all, and therefore certainly in
them whom God hath called to such an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profession: and that saying of Christ
(in the Gospel for the same day) <hi>that he
was sent to the lost sheep,</hi> &amp;c. may mind
them of their duty who are sent by him to
be Pastors of his flock. The like Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
they may gather from both Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
and Gospel of the Sunday of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in time of Advent as may be obvious
to view. And no less proper is that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
which the <hi>Lectionary</hi> and some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
appoint for the same day: <hi>Let a man,</hi>
saith the Apostle there, <hi>thus wise esteem us,
even as the Ministers of Christ, and Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of the Secrets of God. Furthermore
it is required of Stewards that a man be
found faithful.</hi> Which Epistle with us,
and some other Churches, is applyed to
the Sunday next before this, changing place
with another Epistle, not unfit for this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99745:103"/>
and more fit to come next to
Christmas: For by those words in it. <hi>The
Lord is even at hand,</hi> it may excite us to such
a preparation for the Feast of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the flesh, as may prepare us for that
other coming in glory which we look for.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we taken a view of these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Gospels, and upon occasion also of
those which are used after Ordinations,
and somewhat also of the time when holy
Orders were given. Our Church herein
keeps to the day that is most proper: and
that is to the Sunday which next follows
the Ember Fast. A day on which Christ
bestowed his Spirit upon his Apostles, gave
them their Commission, and many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
gifts for the good of the Church.
For this and other reasons doth <hi>Leo</hi> shew,
how congruous the Lords day is for such a
work. Besides this may be added, that a
business of such consequence being done
upon such a day, is attended with more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
and presence of the Congregation.
See the discourse of Ember weeks, <hi>pag.</hi> 149.
and <hi>Leo</hi> Epist. 81. <hi>ad Diosc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>COLLECTS</hi> remain to be
now spoken of: and they in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with the Epistles and Gospels have a
general congruity with the affection of the
season. For as Faith, Hope and Charity,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99745:104"/>
graces and gifts of the Holy Ghost are the
general subject more or less of these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and the same taught, exemplified and
confirmed in the Gospels; so are these <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects</hi>
certain general Invocations upon God
for the assistance of his holy Spirit, and
bringing forth the fruits of it, and consist
usually of a most humble acknowledgment,
and a petition suitable, as is above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 85.</p>
                  <p>And as we have taken there a brief view
of the pious sense and spirit of these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments,
so will it not be amiss to
do the same here concerning the petitions;
which in each <hi>Collect</hi> are some or other of
these following, or such like: <hi>That God
would be pleased to prevent and follow us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with his grace, and with his mercy in
all things direct and rule our hearts, to stir
up our wills, pour into our hearts (graff in
them) the love of his holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame, make us
to have a perpetual fear and love of it, to ask
such things as shall please him, to have the
Spirit, to think and do always such things
as be rightful (to please him, both in will
and deed) that he would encrease, nourish,
keep us in true Religion and all goodness;
give unto us the encrease of Faith, Hope
and Charity, that we may live according to
his will, with pure and free hearts follow him;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99745:104"/>
accomplish those things he would have done,
may be cleansed, assoyled, delivered from all
our offences, have pardon, peace, protection and
defence; may plentifully bring forth the fruits
of good works, and by him be plenteously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
and obtain his promises which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
all we can desire.</hi> Such requests as these
(besides some other, <hi>That God would hear
the prayers of the people,</hi> of which see, pag.
68, and 85.) are by the Priest presented
to God, fit for the Churches meditations
at this time after <hi>Pentecost,</hi> and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly
following the Lessons, the Decalogue,
and the following Supplications of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as the proper place of Collects: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all of them (though in several branches
and expressions) in effect thus much: That
by the merciful Grace, Inspiration, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and Protection of God Almighty, we
may be cleansed from our sins, may obey
his Commandments, may live as Christians
ought, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit,
and so to be fitter to meet our blessed Lord
at his second Advent to judge the world.</p>
                  <p>And this meditation of the second Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of Christ is thought so seasonable in
the last place; that some Churches instead
of those Readings which we have for
the last Sunday of this Time, make use
of some other which concern the day of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99745:105"/>
judgement: But our Church, as she hath
good reason for her method, as we have
seen, <hi>p.</hi> 187, 188. So is she not at all defective
in her thoughts of Christs second coming:
In time of Advent, and often afterwards
she takes occasion to remember it, but most
especially at this season. The last <hi>Gospel</hi>
(except that which implyes a prophesie of
Christs advent) sets before us his raising
up of one from the dead, a great ground
of our faith and hope of a Resurrection.
The <hi>Epistle</hi> that goes with it, and all the
rest in a manner aim most evidently at this,
the <hi>Quickning us to a life spiritual by the
hopes of an eternal.</hi> The <hi>last Collect,</hi> with
some other, is for the enjoyment of it ac|
cording to Gods promises. So that we
see the Church in her Meditations for the
conclusion of the year, takes in that for her
subject which is the close of our Creed,
end of our Faith, and Crown of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions:
<hi>The Rosurrection of the body, and
the life everlasting.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We go in Procession two by two, carrying

at a common fire, but a fire first blest in the
Church by a Bishop. They that go out first
return last; and in the way we sing; <hi>Great
is the glory of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We go two by two, in commendation of
Charity and a social life; for so our Saviour
sent out his Disciples.</p>
               <p>We carry lights in our hands: First, to
signifie that our light should shine before men.
Secondly, this we do this day especially in
memory of the wise virgins (of whom this
blessed Virgin is the chief) that went to
meet their Lord with their Lamps light and
burning. And from this usage and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
lights set up in the Church this day, <hi>it is
called</hi> Candelaria <hi>or</hi> Candlemas.</p>
               <p>Because our works should be all done in the
holy fire of Charity; therefore the Candles
are light with holy fire.</p>
               <p>They that go out first, return last, to teach
humility, <hi>in humility preferring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
Phil. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Because God loves a cheerful giver, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we sing in the way.</p>
               <p>The Procession it self, is to teach us, that
we should not stand idle in the way of life,

               <p>WHereas in the Primitive Church,
the Apostles had not several days
of solemnity; it was appointed that one
day should be allowed for them all; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the Latin Church, the Calends or

S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Afterwards, when

this first of <hi>May</hi> was left to
S. <hi>Philip</hi> and S. <hi>Iacob,</hi> because it was thought
that they suffered upon that day. Thus
<hi>Durandus</hi> and some other deliver it: but
upon further enquiry it seems to be a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take;
for it (as hath been proved in the
discourse upon S. <hi>Stephens</hi> day) Martyrs
and other Saints had their several days ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the first times, it is not probable,
that the Apostles, those Founders of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<hi>those Princes over all Lands</hi> (as they
are called <hi>Ps.</hi> 44. 10.) should be hudled
up all into one day, and have a less respect
given them by the Church than other
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99745:107"/>
Saints and Martyrs had. I conceive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they had several days allowed
them as well as other Saints: and this
mistake of <hi>Durandus</hi> was occasioned by
this, that in some old Martyrologists, this
<hi>Feast</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> was called the
<hi>Feast</hi> of S. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
and in some, the <hi>Feast of Philip and
Iacob and All-saints.</hi> The reason of which
was not, because the Apostles had no other
Feasts appointed them but only this, but
because the Feast of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Kalends</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and so falls within
the Paschal Solemnity betwixt Easter and
Whitsuntide; All which time the Church
of old was wont to commemorate not one
Saint alone, but altogether; and therefore
not <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> alone, but all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and Saints together with them: The
reason of which was, saies <hi>Gemma de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq.
Mis. rit.</hi> cap. 140. Because in our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Country, which that time signifies,
the joy of all is the joy of every one; and
the joy of every Saint, the common joy of
all. Or because as <hi>Micrologus</hi> says, <hi>De
Eccl. Offic.</hi> c. 55. At the general Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
(of which Easter solemnity is a
type) there is a common Festivity and joy

                  <hi>Philip</hi> the Apostle, whom the Gospel men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

Church gives us a Lesson <hi>Acts</hi> 8. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him; and it was a thing not unusual in
ancient Martyrologies to commemorate
divers of the same name on the same day.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iames</hi> that is commemorated this
day is not one of the sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> whose

               <p>WE celebrate the birth of S. <hi>Iohn
Baptist,</hi> and of our Saviour, For
these reasons:</p>
               <p>The Births of both were full of joy and
mystery. Our Saviours we have already
observed. Now for S. <hi>Iohns,</hi> it is plain,
there was more than ordinary joy at his
birth, S. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 14. And full of mystery
and wonder it was. As a Virgin conceived
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99745:108"/>
our Lord, so a barren woman brought
forth S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 36. Again, his
birth was prophetical of our Lord, whom
he saluted out of his mothers womb. Lastly,
his birth was made memorable by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> S. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 19.</p>
               <p>There was formerly another Holy-day

our Church keeps only this Holy-day in
memory of him, wherein though she prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
commemorates his mysterious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
as you may see in the Gospel; yet
she does not omit his Life and Death; his
Life and Office in the Morning Lessons are
recorded. His death is related in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

prayes for grace to imitate his example, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently

Second-Service.</head>
               <p>IN the Liturgy it is called <hi>The Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and well it were that the piety of
the people were such as to make it alwayes
a Commwnion. The Church as appears
by her pathetical <hi>Exhortation before the
Communion,</hi> and <hi>the Rubrick after it,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to bring men oftner to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
than she usually obtains. Private
and solitary Communions of the Priest
alone she allows not; and therefore when
other cannot be had she appoints only so
much of the Service, as relates not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
to a present Communion, and that
to be said at the Holy Table; and upon
good reason, the Church thereby keeping,
as it were, her ground, visibly minding us
of what she desires and labours towards,
our more frequent access to that holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and in the mean while that part of the
Service which she uses may perhaps more
fitly be called the <hi>Second Service</hi> than the
Communion. And so it is often called,
though not in the Rubr, of the Liturgy,
yet in divers <hi>Fast books</hi> and the like set out
by Authority. If any should think that it
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99745:110"/>
cannot properly be called the Second Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
because the Morning Service and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
go before it, which we prove in the
following discourse to be two distinct Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
whereby this should seem to be the
Third rather than the Second Service, it
is Answered, that sometimes the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Service</hi>
is used upon such dayes as
the Litany is not; and then it may without
question be called the Second Service: nay,
even then when the Litany and all is used,
the Communion Service may be very fitly
called the Second Service: For though in
strictness of speech the Litany is a service
distinct, as is shewn; yet in our usual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the word Service, namely for a
compleat Service with all the several parts
of it, Psalms, Readings, Creeds, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,
and Prayers, so the Litany is not
a Service, nor so esteemed, but called <hi>The
Litany,</hi> or Supplications; and lookt upon
sometimes, when other Offices follow, as
a kind of Preparative (though a distinct
form) to them, as to <hi>The Communion,
Commination, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore it was a
custome in some Churches, that a Bell was
tolled, while the Litany was saying, to give
notice to the people, that the Communion
Service was now coming on. This Service
consists of Four parts, The first reaches
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99745:110"/>
to the Offertory, called anciently <hi>Missa
Catechumenorum,</hi> the service of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens:
The second is the <hi>Offertory,</hi>
which reaches to the Consecration. The
third begins at the Consecration, and ends
at the <hi>Angelical Hymn, <hi>Glory be to God
an high.</hi>
                  </hi> The last is the <hi>Post-Commwnion,</hi>
or Thanksgiving, which with us is nothing
but that holy Hymn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Part.</hi> 1. We begin the first part as the
Church was wont to begin her Services,
with the LORDS PRAYER, concerning
which, see the Morning Service.</p>
               <p>After this follows an excellent prayer to
God <hi>to cleanse our hearts by his holy
inspiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then follow the COMMAND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS,
with a <hi>Kyrie,</hi> or <hi>Lord have
mercy upon us,</hi> after every one of them.
Which though I cannot say it was ancient,
yet surely cannot be denied to be very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and pious. And if there be any that
think this might be spared, as being fitter
for poor Publicans than Saints; let them
turn to the Parable of the Publican and
Pharisee going up to the Temple to pray,
S. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. and there they shall receive an
answer.</p>
               <p>Then follows the COLLECT for
the day, with another for the King, which

the <hi>Priest is to say standing, &amp;c.</hi> Of this
posture enough hath been said in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Service. Though there hath been a
Prayer for the King in the Morning <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
and another in the Litany; Yet the

2. who directs that in all our publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for all Men, an especial prayer should
be made for the King. Now the Morning
Service, Litany and this Communion-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
are three distinct <hi>Services,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have each of them such an especial
prayer.</p>
               <p>That they are three distinct Services
will appear. For they are to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at distinct places, and times. The Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Service is to be said at <hi>the beginning of
the day,</hi> as appears in the third Collect for
Grace. <gap reason="foreign">

and S. <hi>Iohn 18. 28. Early.</hi> In S. <hi>Mark</hi>
13. 35. it is translated, <hi>The dawning of the
day.</hi> The place for it is the accustomed
place in the Chancel <hi>or Church,</hi> saies the
Rubr. before Morning prayer, or where
the Ordinary shall appoint it.</p>
               <p>The Litany is also a distinct Service, for
it is no part of the Morning Service, as you
may see Rubr. after <hi>Athanas.</hi> Creed.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99745:111"/>
                  <hi>Here ends the Morn. and Even. Service.
Then follows the Litany.</hi> Nor is it any part
of the Com. Service, for that begins with
<hi>Our Father,</hi> and the Collect, <hi>Almigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God, &amp;c.</hi> and is to be said after the Litany.
The time and place for this, is not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Rubr. but it is supposed to be
known by practice. For in the <hi>Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the 51. <hi>Psal.</hi> is appointed to be said,
where they <hi>are accustomed to say the Litany,</hi>
and that was <hi>in the Church. Eliz, Inj.</hi> 18.
<hi>before the Chancel door.</hi> 
                  <q>Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi>
notes upon the Liturgy: It being a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential
Office, is there appointed, in
imitation of Gods command, to the
Priests in their penitential Service, <hi>Ioel
2 17. Let the Priests weep between the
Porch and the Altar.</hi>
                  </q> The time of this,
is a little before the time of the Com. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<hi>Inj. 18. Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Communion-Service is to be some
good distance after the Morn. Service, <hi>Rubr.
1. before the Communion-Service, So many
as intend to be partakers of the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
shall signifie their names to the Curate,
over night, or before Morning prayer, or
immediately after,</hi> which does necessarily
require a good space of time to do it in.
The usual hour for the solemnity of this
Service, was anciently, and so should be,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99745:112"/>
Nine of the clock, Morning. <hi>C. Aurel.</hi> 3.
c. 11. This is the <hi>Canonical hour De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secr.

call'd, the holy hour, <hi>Decret. dist.</hi> 44.

earlier or later, <hi>Durant, de Rit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bus;</hi> but
this was the usual and Canonical hour, for
it. One reason which is given for it is,
because at this hour began our Saviours
Passion, S. <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 25. the Jewes then
crying out <hi>Crucifie, &amp;c.</hi> At this hour
therefore is the Com. Service (part of
which is a commemoration of Christs
Passion) performed. Another reason
given is, because this hour the Holy Ghost
descended upon the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 15.
Lastly, because it is the most convenient
hour for all to meet, and dispatch this
with other offices <hi>before Noon.</hi> For, 'till
the Service was ended, Men were perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be fasting; and therefore it was
thought fit to end all the Service, before
Noon, that people might be free to eat.
<hi>Durant.</hi> l. 2. c. 7. Why this Service is called
the Second, see pag. 207, 208.</p>
               <p>The place for this Service is the Altar or
<hi>Communion Table, Rubr.</hi> before the Com.
And so it was always in Primitive times,
which is a thing so plain as it needs no
proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:99745:112"/>
After this, the Priest reads the <hi>Epistle</hi>
and <hi>Gospel</hi> for the day. Concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of which, and the reason of their
choice, hath been said already: nothing
here remains to be shewn, but the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and piety of those <hi>Rites,</hi> which were
used both by us and the ancient Church,
about the reading of the Gospel. As</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, when the</hi> GOSPEL <hi>is named,
the Clergy and the people present; say or
sing, <hi>Glory be to thee O Lord.</hi> So it
is in S.</hi> Chrys. <hi>Liturg.</hi> Glorifying God that
hath sent to them also the word of salvation.
<hi>As it is in the</hi> Acts <hi>of the</hi> Apost. 11. 18.
When they heard these things they glorified
God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
granted repentance unto life.</p>
               <p>2. While the <hi>Gospel</hi> is reading, all that
are present <hi>stand Grat.</hi> de <hi>Conser.</hi> dist. 1. c.
68. And <hi>Zozomen</hi> in his <hi>Hist.</hi> l. 7. c. 19.
tells us it was a new fashion in <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
that the Bishop did not rise up when the
Gospel was read: <hi>[Quod apud alios us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
fieri, neque comperi neque audivi;</hi>
Which, says he, <hi>I never observed nor heard
amongst any others whatsoever:]</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was this. Anciently, whensoever the
holy Lessons were read, the people stood,
to express their reverence to the holy word.
<hi>Aug.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:99745:113"/>
But because this was counted too great a
burden, it was thought fit to shew our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence,
especially at the reading of the
Gospel, which historically declares some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
which our Saviour spake, did, or
suffered in his own person: By this gesture,
shewing a reverend regard to the <hi>Son</hi> of
God, above other messengers, although
speaking as from God. And against <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Iews, Infidels,</hi> who derogate from
the honour of <hi>our LORD,</hi> such ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
are most profitable. As judicious
Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> notes.</p>
               <p>3. After the Gospel is ended, the use
was to praise God, saying, <hi>Thanks be
to God for this Gospel.</hi> So was it of old
ordained, <hi>Tolet. Conc. 4. c.</hi> 11. that the
Lauds or Praises should be said, not after
the Epistle, but immediately after the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
for the glory of Christ, which is
preached in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>In some places the fashion was, then to
kiss the book. And surely this book, by
reason of the rich contents of it; deserve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
a better regard than too often it findes. It
should in this respect be used so, as others
may see we prefer it before all other books.</p>
               <p>Next is the <hi>NICENE CREED;</hi> so
called, because it was for the most part
framed at the great <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi> But
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99745:113"/>
because the great Council of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
added the latter part, and brought it to
the frame which we now use, therefore is
it called also the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> Creed.
This Creed began to be used in Churches at
the Communion Service immediately after
the Gospel, in the year of our Lord 339.</p>
               <p>Afterward it was established in the
Churches of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> after the
custome of the Eastern Church, <hi>Conc. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.
3. c.</hi> 2. and continued down to our
times.</p>
               <p>The Reason why this Creed follows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the Epistle and Gospel, is
the same that was given for the APO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STLES
CREED following next after
the Lessons at Morning and Evening pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
To which the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> last
cited, hath added Another Reason of the
saying it here before the people draw neer
to the holy Communion: namely, <hi>[That
the breasts of those that approach to those

                     </gap>ue and right faith.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third reason is given by <hi>Dionys.</hi> Eccl.
Hierar. c. 3. par. 2. &amp; 3. It will not be
amiss to set down some passages of his at
large, because they will both give us a third
reason of using the Creed in this place, and
discover to us, as I conceive, much of the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99745:114"/>
ancient beautiful order of the Communion-Service.</p>
               <p>The Bishop or Priest standing at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
begins the <hi>melody of Psalms,</hi> all the
degrees of Ecclesiasticks singing with him.
This Psalmody is used, as in almost all
Priestly Offices, so in this, to prepare and
dispose our souls by holy affections, to the
celebration of the holy mysteries follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and by the consent and singing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of divine Psalms, to work in us an
unanimous consent and concord one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another. Then is read by some of
the Ministers, first a Lesson out of the Old
Testament, then one out of the New, in
their order, (for the reasons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the discourse of Lessons at Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Service:) After this the Catechumens,
the possessed, and the penitents are dismist,
and they only allowed to stay, who are
deem'd worthy to receive the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
which being done, some of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Ministers keep the door of the Church,
that no Infidel or unworthy person may
intrude into these sacred Mysteries. Then
the Ministers and devout people (reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
beholding the holy signs, not yet
consecrated, but blest and offered up to
God on a by-standing Table, called <hi>the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Proposition</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Praise
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99745:114"/>
and bless the Father of Lights, (from
whom, as all good gifts, so this great
blessing of the Communion does come)
with the Catholick hymn of praise, which
some call the Creed; others more divinely,
The Pontifical Thanksgiving, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it all the spiritual gifts which flow
from Heaven upon us, the whole mystery
of our salvation; when this hymn of praise
is finished, the Deacons with the Priest,
set the holy Bread and Cup of Blessing
upon the Altar; after which, the Priest
or Bishop saies the most sacred, that is,
the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> gives the Blessing to
the people; then they (in token of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
charity, a most necessary vertue at
this time of offering at the Altar, S. <hi>Mat.</hi>
5. 23.) salute each other. After which,
the names of holy Men that have lived and
died in the faith of Christ are read out of
the <hi>Diptychs,</hi> and their memories cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
to perswade others to a diligent
imitation of their vertues, and a stedfast
expectation of their heavenly rewards.
This commemoration of the Saints, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
upon the setting of the holy signs
upon the Altar, is not without some my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery;
to shew the inseparable sacred union
of the Saints with Christ, who is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by those sacred signs. These things
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99745:115"/>
being rightly performed, the Bishop or
Priest, that is to Consecrate, washes his
hands, a most decent Ceremony, signifying,
that those that are to do these holy Offices
should have a special care of purity. <hi>I will
wash mine hands in innocency, O Lord, and
so will I compass thine Altar, Psal.</hi> 26. 6.
After he hath magnified these divine gifts,
and God that gave them, then he conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
the holy Mysteries: and having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
them, reverently shews them to
the people, inviting them to the receiving
of them. Himself, and the Priests and
Deacons receive first, then the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in both kinds; and having all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
they end the Service with a Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
which was <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>After the Epistle and Gospel and the
confession of that Faith which is taught in
holy Writ, follows THE SERMON.
<hi>Amb.</hi> ep. 33. ad <hi>Marcel. Leo</hi> 1. Ser. 2. <hi>de
Pascha,</hi> which usually was an exposition of
some part of the Epistle or Gospel, or
proper Lesson for the day, as we may see
in S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Serm. <hi>de Temp.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pattern in <hi>Nehem. 8. 8. They
read in the book, in the law of God distinctly,
and gave the sense, and caused the people to
understand the reading.</hi> And the Preacher
was in his Exposition appointed to observe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99745:115"/>
the Catholick interpretation of the old
Doctors of the Church; as we may see in
the 19. <hi>Can.</hi> of the sixth <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
held in <hi>Trull.</hi> The Canon is
this. <q>Let the Governors of Churches
every Sunday at the least, teach their
Clergy and people the Oracles of pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y
and true Religion; collecting out of
Divine Scripture, the sentences and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of truth, not transgressing the
ancient bounds and traditions of the
holy Fathers. And if any doubt or
controversie arise about Scripture, let
them follow that interpretation, which
the Lights of the Church and the Doctors
have left in their writings. By which
they shall more deserve commendation,
than by making private interpretations,
which if they adhere to, they are in
danger to fall from the truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>To this agrees the <hi>Canon</hi> made in
Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi>
1571. The Preachers chiefly shall take
heed that they teach nothing in their
preaching, which they would have the
people religiously to observe and believe,
but that which is agreeable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Old Testament and the
New, and that which the Catholick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Ancient Bishops have gathered
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99745:116"/>
out of that Doctrine.</q> These Golden
Canons had they been duly observed,
would have been a great preservative of
Truth and the Churches peace.</p>
               <p>The Sermon was not above an hour long.
<hi>Cyril. Catech.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Before the Sermon no prayer is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the petitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
first consigned upon the people, by the
Preacher or Minister, who is appointed
to bid the prayers, as it is in <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and
Queen <hi>Eliz. Injunctions;</hi> that is, to tell
the people beforehand, what they are at
that time especially to pray for in the Lords
Prayer; which in the 55. <hi>Can. of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit.
Anno Dom.</hi> 1603. is called, moving
the people to joyn with the Preacher in
praying the Lords Prayer. Of old, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was said before the Sermon, but
<hi>Gemina Salutatio,</hi> the double Salutation,
<hi>Clem. Const.</hi> l. 8. c. 5. <hi>Optat.</hi> 1. 7. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
or Priest never begins to speak to
the people; but first in the Name of God
he salutes the people and the salutation is
doubled, that is, the Preacher says, <hi>The
Lord be with you,</hi> and the people answer,
<hi>And with thy Spirit.</hi> Much after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was the Jews practice, <hi>Neh. 8. 4.</hi> &amp; <hi>6.
Ezra the Scribe stood upon a Pulpit of wood,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>and opened the book in the sight of all
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99745:116"/>
the people; and when he opened it, all the
people stood up, and Ezra blessed the Lord
the great God, and all the people answered
Amen, Amen, and worshipped.</hi> Verse 8:
<hi>Then Ezra read in the Book, and gave the
sense, and caused them to understand the
reading.</hi> So we see, that both amongst
Jews and Christians of old, the Preacher
before his Sermon used only a short Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or Blessing; to which the people
having answered, the Sermon began. And
though the Church of <hi>England</hi> uses not
the very same form, yet in this she follows
the ancient practice, prescribing only the
short prayer of our Lord: and indeed
what need any more? For whatsoever we
can desire, is abundantly prayed for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the Liturgy, and needs not be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over again immediately. And therefore
there being no need of such a solemn pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the Church hath appointed none, but
only the Lords Prayer: and no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appointed, no other should be used by
the Preacher. For, as hath been shewn,
Pag. 1. <hi>No prayers should be used publickly,
but those that are prescribed; lest through
ignorance or carelesness, any thing contrary
to the faith should be uttered before God.</hi>
How necessary such restraint of private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
prayers in publick is, and how good
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99745:117"/>
that reason is for such restraint, a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of licentious times will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew. The pulpit is no security from
errors. Men may as well speak blasphemy
or vanity before the Sermon, as in it. Is it
not reason then that the Church should take
care what she can, to prevent this danger,
by restraining that liberty, which is so
likely to run men into it? Suppose some
Preacher should be so careful, as not to vent
any thing unsavory, yet the Church cannot
be secured of all, and therefore must not
allow a general liberty. Nay, suppose the
Church could be assured of all Preachers
care in this particular, that their prayers
should be for matter sound and good; yet
how should it be reasonable for the Church
to allow any private person or Preacher
to offer up to God a prayer in the name of
the Congregation, as their joynt desire, to
which, they never before consented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor their Governors for them. A
Preacher may pray for his Auditory by
himself, though they know it not, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to it before hand; but it is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
how he should offer it up in their
name, or call it their prayer to God, as
sometimes the use hath been, which neither
they themselves, nor their Governours,
whom Christ hath impowred to make
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99745:117"/>
prayer for them, have consented to, or
acknowledged for theirs: no more than any
man can call that the Petition of a Town,
which he shall present in their names, though
they never before consented to it, or so
much as saw it before it was presented.</p>
               <p>This Form of bidding Prayers is very
ancient: we may see the like in <hi>S. Chrys.</hi>
and other Liturgies which they called
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Allocutions,</hi> in which the
Deacon speaks to the people from point to
point, directing them what to pray for
(as hath been said before.) This is all the
difference betwixt them and this; that in
them the people were to answer to every
point severally, <hi>Lord have mercy, &amp;c.</hi> In
this, they are taught to sum up all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
in <hi>the Lords Prayer,</hi> and to pray for
them all together.</p>
               <p>This was the practice in King <hi>Edw.</hi> the
Sixth's time, as appears by Bishop <hi>Latymer,
Iewel,</hi> and others in those daies, whose
Forms of <hi>Bidding Prayers,</hi> before Sermon,
are to be seen in their writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If there be no Sermon, there shall

that ought to be feared, Psal.</hi> 76. 11. This
duty of offerings was practised by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before the Law, with a gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation.
Witness <hi>Abel,</hi> Gen. 4. 4. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the Law, <hi>Exod. 25. 2. Speak
to the children of Israel that they bring me
an offering.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 16. Confirmed
<hi>by our Saviour in the Gospel,</hi> S. Matth. 5. 23.
<hi>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and there remembrest that thy brother
hath ought against thee, leave there thy
gift before the altar, and go thy way, first
be reconciled to thy brother, and then</hi> come
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99745:118"/>
and offer <hi>thy gift.</hi> If any man conceives
that this offering here mentioned was a
Jewish perishing rite, not a duty of the
Gospel to continue; let him consider,</p>
               <p>First, that there is the same reason for
this duty under the Gospel, as there was
under or before the Law, God being Lord
of us and ours as well as of them; and
therefore to be acknowledged for such by
us, as well as by them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that all the rest of our Saviours
Sermon upon the Mount was Gospel, and
concerning duties obliging us Christians:
and it is not likely that our Saviour should
intermix one only Judaical rite amongst
them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that our Saviour before all
these precepts mentioned in this his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
whereof this of oblations is one, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces
this severe sanction, <hi>S. Matth. 5. 19.
Whosoever shall break one of the least of these
commandments, and shall teach men so, shall
be called the least in the kingdom of heaven;</hi>
which could not be truly said concerning
the breach of a Jewish outworn rite.</p>
               <p>4. That, our Saviour hath carefully
taught us there, the due manner of the
performance of this duty of oblations, like
as he did concerning alms and prayers, and
no man can shew that ever he did any
where else; nor is it probable that he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99745:119"/>
should here carefully direct us, how to do
that which was presently to be left, and
was already out of force, as this was, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it to be a Jewish rite. We may then,
I conceive, suppose it for a truth, that obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are here commanded by our Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Add to this, that offerings were highly
commended by the Gospel, in the Wise
men that offered Gold, Frankincense and
Myrrhe, S.</hi> Matth. 2. 11. <hi>and that they
were practised by the</hi> Father <hi>in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church. So saies</hi> Epiphan. haer. 80.
Irenaeus l. 4. c. 34. [By a gift to the King,
his honour and our affection is shewn; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Lord willing us to offer with all sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and innocency, preached, <hi>saying,</hi>
When thou bringest thy gift to the altar,
&amp;c. We must therefore offer of our goods to
God, according as <hi>Moses</hi> commanded, <hi>Thou
shalt not appear before the Lord empty.</hi>
There are offerings under the Gospel, as well
as under the Law: the kind of offerings is
the same: Here is all the difference, they
were offered then by servants, now by sons.]
<hi>S. Hier. ep. ad Heliodor.</hi> The axe is laid to
the root of the tree, if I bring not my gift
to the Altar: nor can I plead poverty, since
the poor widow hath cast in two mites,] <hi>We
should do well to think of this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though oblations be acceptable at any
time, yet at sometimes they have been
thought more necessary, as</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:99745:119"/>
First, when the Church is in want, <hi>Ex.
35. 4, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when we have received some
signal and eminent blessing from God.
<hi>Psal. 76.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had recounted the
great mercy of God in breaking the bow
and the shield of the Churches enemies,
at the 11. verse, he presses this duty, <hi>Bring
presents to him that ought to be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, at our high and solemn Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
<hi>Deut. 16. 16. Three times in the year
shall they appear before me, and they shall
not appear empty;</hi> Especially when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the holy Communion. <hi>Theodoret</hi> Hist.
l. 5. c. 17. tells us, <hi>that it was the ancient
custome, before the receiving of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to come into the Quire and offer at the
holy Table.</hi> And surely it becomes not us to
be empty-handed, when God comes to us
full-handed, as in that Sacrament he does.</p>
               <p>Next to the OFFERTORY is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
PRAYER for the <hi>CHVRCH-MILITANT,</hi>
wherein we pray for the
<hi>Catholick</hi> and Apostolick <hi>Church; For
all Christian Kings, Princes &amp; Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
for the Whole Clergy and people, for
all in adversity,</hi> Such a prayer hath <hi>S. Chr.</hi> in
his Liturg, a little before the Consecration.</p>
               <p>After which follow some wholsom <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations</hi>
to those that are coming to the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99745:120"/>
holy Communion, seriously exhorting the
unprepared to forbear. So was the custome
of old in the Greek Church. The Priest
admonishes all that are coming to that holy
Sacrament, driving away the unworthy,
but inviting the prepared, and that with a
loud voice, and hands lifted up, standing
aloft, where he may be seen and heard of
all. <hi>Chrys.</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> hom. 9. in Ethic.</p>
               <p>Those that after these exhortations stay
to receive, the Church supposing prepared,
invites, to <hi>draw near;</hi> and after their
humble confession the Priest or Bishop ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
and comforts them with some choice
sentences taken out of holy Scripture. After
which the Priest saies, <hi>Lift up your
hearts.</hi> For certainly at that hour when
we are to receive the most dreadful Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is necessary to lift up our hearts
to God, and not to have them groveling
upon the earth: for this purpose the Priest
exhorts all, to leave all cares of this life
and domestick thoughts, and to have our
hearts and minds in heaven upon the lover
of mankind. The people then answer,
<hi>We lift them up unto the Lord,</hi> assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Priests admonition. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
us all to say it seriously: For as we
ought alwayes to have our minds in heaven,
so especially at that hour we should more
earnestly endeavour it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:99745:120"/>
The Priest goes on, <hi>Let us give
thanks to our Lord God,</hi> and many
thanks we ought to render him, that calls
and invites such unworthy sinners as we be,
to so high grace and favour, as to eat the
Flesh and drink the Bloud of the Son of
God.</p>
               <p>The people answer, <hi>It is meet and
right so to do.</hi> For when we give thanks to
God, we do a work that is just, and of
right due to so much bounty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then follow for great daies some proper
Prefaces, containing the peculiar matter or
subject of our thanks that day, which are to
be said seven daies after,</hi> Rubr. <hi>ibidem.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Whitsunday Preface, which is to be
said but six daies after; because Trinity
Sunday is the seventh day after, which hath
a peculiar Preface. By this it appears that
the Church intends to prorogue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
these high Feasts several daies, even
eight daies together, if another great
Feast comes not within the time, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a peculiar Service. But when we
say that the Church would have these high
Feasts continued so long, it is not so
to be understood, as if she required an
equal observance of those several daies,
for some of those daies she commands by
her Canons and Rubricks. Some she seems
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99745:121"/>
only to commend to us to be observed;
some are of a higher festivity, some of less.
The first and the last, namely, the <hi>Octave</hi>
of the first, are usually the chief daies for
solemn Assemblies; yet every of those
daies should be spent in more than ordinary
meditation of the blessings of the time,
and thanksgiving for them: according to
that which the Lord commanded to the
Jews concerning the Feast of Tabernacles,
<hi>Lev. 23. 36.</hi> Upon every one of the daies
of that Feast an offering was to be made,
<hi>but the first and last were the solemn Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason of the Churches proroguing
and lengthning, out these high Feasts, for
several days, is plain. The subject matter
of these Feasts, as namely, Christs Birth,
Resurrection, Ascension, the sending of
the holy Ghost, is of so high a nature, so
nearly concerning our salvation, that one
day is too little to meditate of them, and
praise God for them as we ought; a
bodily deliverance may justly require a day
of thanksgiving and joy; but the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the soul, by the blessings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated
on those times, deserve a much
longer Feast. It were injurious to good
Christian souls to have their joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
for such mercies confined to a day,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99745:121"/>
therefore holy Church upon the times when
these unspeakable blessings were wrought
for us, by her most seasonable commands
and counsels here invites us, to fill our
hearts with joy and thankfulness, and let
them overflow eight daies together.</p>
               <p>See above, of the Continuation of great
Solemnities, pag. 128. 174. 180. and of the
service of Octaves. p. 178.</p>
               <p>But two <hi>Quaeries</hi> here may be fit to be
satisfied.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>why eight dayes</hi> are allowed to
those high Feasts, rather than another num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber?</p>
               <p>For which the reasons given are divers;
one is from the example which Almighty
God sets us, commanding his people the
Jews, to keep their great Feasts some of
them seven daies, and one, namely, the
Feast of Tabernacles, eight daies, <hi>Lev. 23.</hi>
If the Jews were to keep their Feasts so
long by a daily Burnt-offering (which were
but as types of the Christians great Feasts)
the Christians ought by no means to come
short of them, but offer up to God as long,
daily, hearty thanksgivings, presenting
our selves souls and bodies, a reasonable,
holy and lively Sacrifice unto him. Other
reasons, for an <hi>Octave</hi> to great Feasts, are
given, which are mystical. The <hi>Octave</hi> or
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99745:122"/>
eighth day, signifies Eternity, for our
whole life is but the repetition or
revolution of seven dayes. Then comes
the eighth day of Eternity, to which, by
Gods mercy we shall be brought, if we
continue the seven daies of our life in the
due and constant service and worship of
God; or else, which is much the same in
sense; the eighth day is a returning to the
first, it is the first day of the week begun
again, signifying, that if we constantly
serve God the seven days of our life, we
shall return to the first happy estate that we
were created in.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Quaere</hi> is, how the Prefaces
appointed for these eight daies can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
used upon each of them: for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
how can we say eight days together,
<hi>Thou didst give thine only Son to be born this
day for us?</hi> as it is in the Preface.</p>
               <p>To which the Answer may be, That the
Church does not use the word <hi>Day,</hi> for a
natural day of 24. hours, or an ordinary
artificial day, reckoning from Sun to Sun;
but in the usual acception of it in holy
Scripture, where by the word <hi>Day,</hi> is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
the whole time designed to one and
the same purpose, though it lasts several
natural days. Thus all the time that God
appoints to the reclaiming of sinners by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99745:122"/>
merciful chastisements or threatnings is
called, <hi>The day of their visitation, Luke</hi>
19. 42, 44. So all the time allotted us for
the working out of our salvation, though
it be our whole life long, is called a day,
<hi>Work while it is day, the night comes when
no man can work;</hi> and most directly to our
purpose speaks S. <hi>Paul, Heb. 3. 13. Exhort
one another daily, while it is called to day,
or this day,</hi> that is, while you live here in
this world. In like manner all that time
which is appointed by the Church, for the
thankful commemoration of the same grand
blessing, for the solemnity of one and the
same Feast, is as properly called a day, and
all that time it may be said daily, to day,
as well as all our life S. <hi>Paul</hi> saies is called
<hi>Hodie,</hi> this day.</p>
               <p>After which follows the thrice holy
and triumphant song, as it was called of
old [<hi>Therefore with Angels and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels,
and with all the company of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
we laud and magnifie thy glorious
name, evermore praising thee and saying,
holy, holy, holy, &amp;c.</hi>] Here we do, as it
were, invite the heavenly host to help
bear a part in our thanks to make them full.
<hi>O praise the Lord with me, and let us mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
his name together.</hi> And in this hymn
we hold communion with the Church tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99745:123"/>
Which sweet hymn, in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions
is appointed to be said; and
though it should be said night and day,
yet could it never breed a loathing. <hi>Conc.
Vasen. c.</hi> 6. All that is in our Service from
these words, <hi>Lift up your hearts,</hi> to the
end of the Communion-service, is, with
very little difference to be seen in S. <hi>Chrys.
Liturg.</hi> and in S. <hi>Cyrils Catech. mystag. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Part. 3. <hi>Next is the</hi> CONSECRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION.
<hi>So you shall find in</hi> Chrysost. <hi>and</hi>
Cyril <hi>last cited. Which Consecration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
chiefly in rehearsing the words of our
Saviours institution, <hi>This is my body,
and this is my blood,</hi> when the Bread and
Wine is present upon the Communion-table.
Can. Anglie. 21. S.</hi> Chrys. <hi>Ser. 2.
in 2. ad Tim.</hi> The holy Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, which the Priest now makes,
is the same that Christ gave to his Apostles.
This is nothing less than that. For this is
not sanctified by men, but by him that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that: for as the words which God our
Saviour spake are the <hi>same,</hi> which the Priest
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> uses, so is the Sacrament the same.
<hi>Again,</hi> Ser. de Iuda, lat. Ed. tom. 3. Christ
is present at the Sacrament now, that first
instituted it. He consecrates this also: It
is not man that makes the body and blood of
Christ by consecrating the holy Elements,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99745:123"/>
but Christ that was crucified for us. The
words are pronounced by the mouth of the
Priest, but the Elements are consecrated
by the power and grace of God, <hi>THIS IS,
saith he, MY BODY:</hi> By this word the
bread and wine are consecrated.]</p>
               <p>Before these words [THIS IS MY
BODY] the bread and wine are common
food fit only to nourish the body; but since our
Lord hath said, <hi>Do this, as oft as you do
it in remembrance of me, This is my
body, this my blood:</hi> as often as by
these words and in this faith they are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,
the holy bread and blessed cup are
profitable to the salvation of the whole man:

receives himself. so is it ordain'd</hi> Conc.

The Priest shall receive whensoever he offers
up the Sacrifice. For since the Apostle hath
said, Are not they which eat of the Sacrifice,
partakers of the Altar? <hi>1 Cor. 10.</hi> it is
certain, that they who sacrifice and eat not,
are guilty of the Lords Sacrament.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After he hath received, he is to deliver
it to the people in their hands. So was it
in</hi> Cyrils <hi>time,</hi> Cat. mystag. <hi>5. and</hi> Let
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99745:124"/>
every one be careful to keep it, for whosoever
carelesly loses any part of it, had better lose
a part of himself, <hi>saies he, And</hi> Whosoever
wilfully throws it away, shall be for ever
excluded from the Communion. Conc. Tolet.
11. c. 11.</p>
               <p>It is to be given to the people
<hi>KNEELING.</hi> for <hi>a sin it is not to

               <p>
                  <q>When the Priest hath said at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of the Sacrament, the body of our

               <p>The people were of old called out of

were to come up to the Sacrament, and

and lifting up the
holy Cup, shews it to the people, saying,

                     </gap>,
come hither,</hi> or as our Liturgy saies, <hi>draw

               <p>Every Parishioner shall communicate at
the least three times in the year, whereof
Easter to be one. <hi>Rubr. last after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Primitive Church, while Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
continued in their strength of Faith
and Devotion, they did communicate every
day. This custome continued in <hi>Africa</hi>
till S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, <hi>Orat. Dom. We daily
receive the Eucharist, for to be our food of
salvation.</hi> And after him till S. <hi>Augustines</hi>
time <hi>Ep. 23. ad Bonifac.</hi> Insomuch as these
words in our Lords Prayer, <hi>Give us this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99745:125"/>
day our daily bread,</hi> they interpreted of
the Eucharist, as being daily to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.
But afterward when charity grew
cold and devotion faint, the custome grew
faint withal; and within a small time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be left by little and little; and some
upon one pretence, and some upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
would communicate but once a
week. <hi>In the East-Church</hi> they grew to
a worse custome betimes, which in after
Ages came into the <hi>Latin Churches</hi> too.
They fell from every day to <hi>Sundaies and
Holy daies only,</hi> and from thence to <hi>once a
year,</hi> and no oftner. S. <hi>Ambr.</hi> is cited
for the proof of this, <hi>De Sacram.</hi> l. 4. c. 4.
But this wicked custome of receiving the
Eucharist but once a year, was but of <hi>some
Greeks in the East,</hi> saies S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> there;
which cannot properly be understood of
any but the Diocess (as it was anciently
called) or Patriarchate of <hi>Antioch.</hi> For
though the Eastern Empire, whereof <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
was the Metropolis, contained
many Provinces, yet the Eastern Church,
or Greeks in the East, were properly
those of <hi>Antioch, Theodor. Hist.</hi> 1.5. c. 9.
And possibly some of these might be so
supine, as hath been observed; but of the
Greeks in general, no such careless custome
can be affirmed: for S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> tells us
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99745:125"/>
that in his time, <hi>in every meeting or congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Church, the healthful myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Eucharist are celebrated, Hom.
26. in Matth.</hi> In regard of this neglect,
after-Councels did, as the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
make Canons, that if men could be
got to receive it no oftner, yet they
should be forc'd to receive it, at least three
times in the year; Christmas, Easter and
Whitsontide. <hi>Nor was he to be reckoned
amongst good Catholick Christians, that
did not receive at those feasts, Conc. Agat.
c. 18. [Eliber. c. 81.</hi> as they are cited by
<hi>Gratian. de Consor.</hi> dis. 2.] Three times a
year at the least they were to receive,
whereof Easter to be one; and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
For when Christ our Passeover was
Sacrificed for us, then, of all times, let
us keep a Feast with this holy banquet,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. These Canons were made for
the Laity, but for those of the Clergy that
lived in Cathedral and Collegiate Churches,
(where there were enough of themselves,
to make a sufficient company to receive the
Sacrament) they were bound to receive
much oftner, <hi>every day, Edw. 6. Liturg.</hi>
every Sunday at the least, Rubr. 4. after
the Communion. Thus we see holy Church
her care to bring all her Children; Clergy

while terrifies us by the indignation
of God against those that despise his so
great love, and refuse to come, she sends

a Farm, or would try their yoke of Oxen,

None of those that are thus bidden by

gives visible testification of our blessed
Communion with him, we should in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of all Heresies, Factions, and Schisms
declaredly approve our selves united as
Brethren in one, by offering up with all
our hearts and tongues that most effectual

               <p>This done, the Priest offers up the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the holy Eucharist, or the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of praise and thanksgiving for the
whole Church, as in all old Liturgies it is
appointed, and together with that is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up that most acceptable Sacrifice of our
selves, souls and bodies devoted to Gods
service. Of which see <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. and S. <hi>Aug.

               <p>Then we say or sing the <hi>Angelical Hymn,
GLORY BE TO GOD ON HIGH,
&amp;c.</hi> wherein the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy
does admirably imitate the Heavenly, sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this at the Sacrament of his Body which
the Angels did at the Birth of his Body.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99745:127"/>
And good reason there is to sing this for
Christs being made <hi>One with us</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
as for his being made <hi>One of us</hi>
at his Birth. And if ever we be fit to sing
this Angels song, it is then, when we
draw nearest to the estate of Angels, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
at the receiving of the Sacrament. After
the receiving of the holy Sacrament, we
sing an Hymn in imitation of our Saviour;
who <hi>after his Supper sung an Hymn,</hi> to
teach us to do the like. <hi>Chrys.</hi> Hom. 83.
<hi>S. Matth.</hi> And when can a Psalm or Hymn
of thanksgiving be more seasonable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
than after we have received this
heavenly nourishment? Is it possible to
hear these words, <hi>This is my Body, take
and eat it; Drink ye all of this, This is
my Blood:</hi> and not be filled, as with a
kind of fearful admiration, so with a sea
of joy and comfort for the Heaven which
they see in themselves? Can any man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this Cup of Salvation, and not praise
and bless God with his utmost strength of
soul and body? The Ancients did express
their joy at this time in the highest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that they could. Some were so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
with joy, that they immediately
offered themselves to martyrdom, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of being longer absent from their so
gracious Lord, unable to keep themselves
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99745:128"/>
from expressing their love to Christ, by
dying for him; the highest expression of
love. All men then counted it a sin, to
fully the day of their receiving the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist

they called daies of mirth, daies of remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

may all joyn with her in her Offices, both
with our <hi>spirit and understanding,</hi> she hath
been careful, not only to put them into a

the nature of them; making thus her
Prayer-Book a sum of Divinity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
here in the beginning, she instructs
out of holy Scripture concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and efficacy of Baptism, as very
briefly, so very pith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly and fully. First,
laying down this for a rule, That we are
all born in sin, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. all
guilty in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, (so the Catholick
Church spread over the world always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
it, <hi>CON. MILEVAN. c.</hi> 2.)
and therefore by our first birth have no
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99745:129"/>
right to heaven, into which <hi>no unclean
thing shall enter, Ephes.</hi> 5. 5. Secondly,
that therefore there is need of a second
birth, to give us right to that, as it is
S. <hi>Iohn 3. 3. Except a man be born again,
he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
Thirdly, that this second or new birth is
by Water and the Holy Ghost, S. <hi>Iohn
3 5. Except a man be born again of water
and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God.</hi> By Water and the Holy
Ghost is there meant holy Baptism. For
first, this is the most literal interpretation
of the words (for what is Baptism but
Water and the Holy Ghost?) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the best: for that is certainly the
sense of the Holy Ghost, who, as we all
believe, was the Author of the letter of
the Scriptures, and therefore of the literal
sense, where that is not contrary to, but
agreeable with the other Scriptures. Now
this literal sense given is agreeable to other
texts: as namely, to <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 38. and 10.
47. Where Water is declared to be the
element of Baptism. And expresly again,
<hi>Ephes. 5. 26. Christ loved the Church, and
gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie
and cleanse it with the washing of water.</hi>
And as this is the most literal, so is it the
most Catholick interpretation of the words,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99745:129"/>
and therefore also the best, by S. <hi>Peters</hi> rule,
2 S. <hi>Pet. 1. 20. Knowing this first, that no
prophesie of Scripture is of private interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
That this is the most Catholick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
appears by S. <hi>August. l. 1. de
peccator. mer. &amp; rem. c. 30. Tertul. de Bapt.</hi>
and all the ancient interpreters upon the
place, who expound it all of Baptism.
And indeed if it were lawful to expound it
otherwise, seeing no other Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts
this literal sense; I know not how
it can be avoided, but that men may lose
all their Creed, by playing so with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
leaving the letter for figures. Thus
are we instructed in the <hi>nature, necessity,</hi>
and <hi>efficacy</hi> of holy Baptism, that it is the
only ordinary means of our Regeneration
or second birth, which gives us a right
and title to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Then is prescribed a <hi>Prayer,</hi> usually
called the Benediction or Consecration of
the Water, which is used only for reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and decency, not for necessity, as
if the Water without this were not avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Baptism: For, as the Prayer hath
it, <hi>Iordan and all other maters are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by Christ to the mystical washing
away of sin.</hi> So that there needs no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
here, as in the other Sacraments
there is, where the Bread and Wine must
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:99745:130"/>
be blessed by us, saith S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 10.
16. before it be <hi>the Communion of the body
and blood of Christ to us.</hi> And that the
Church does not think any Consecration
of Water necessary, appears in her office
of PRIVATE BAPTISM, where, haste
admitting no delays, no such Prayer or
blessing is used.</p>
               <p>Then follows a Prayer for Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
acceptance of the Infant that is
brought; that, as he is to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
so he may receive all the benefits
of it, And lest any should doubt whether
CHRIST will accept an Infant to Baptism,
and the Effects of it, holy Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
to us the 10. chap. of S. <hi>Mark,</hi>
out of which she concludes CHRISTS
love and good will to children in general;
<hi>For he commanded them to be brought
to him; he rebuked those that would have
kept them from him, he embraced them
in his arms, and blessed them:</hi> which are
all plain arguments that he will receive
them when they are brought to him:
Yea, and that he will so far em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
them as to receive them to
eternal life, if they be brought to him,
is plain by his own words in that Gospel;
<hi>Suffer little children to come unto me,
for to such,</hi> and therefore to themselves
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99745:130"/>
(for <hi>Quod in uno similium valet, valebit
in altero,</hi> what belongs to others because
they are such as children are, must needs
belong to the children) <hi>belongeth the
kingdom of God.</hi> Since then they be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the Kingdom of heaven, and there
is no ordinary way for them to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of heaven, but by a new and second
birth of Water and the Holy Ghost, that
is, Baptism; <hi>Doubt ye not, but that He</hi>
who exprest so much love to them as is
mentioned in the Gospel, <hi>will favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
receive the present infant to baptism,
and gratiously accept our charitable
work in bringing it to him.</hi> Thus holy
Church concludes out of Scripture accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the practice and doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CYPRIAN</hi> tells us that no Infant is to
be hindred from baptism. <hi>Ep. 59.</hi> This
was the sentence of that Council: <hi>Anno

but <hi>fides Ecclesiae firmissima,</hi> the most esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished

constantly to the end. And, <hi>Quicunque

pronounced Anathema to any that shall deny

               </p>
               <p>Next follows a <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for our
Baptism, which we are put in mind of by
this occasion, with an excellent prayer for
our selves; and the Infants before us, that
we may walk worthy of baptism; and

l. 6. Aug.</hi> Ep. 23. and <hi>Cyril. Cat.
Mist.</hi> 1. Where you may see at large the
ancient Form and Manner of Abrenunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.
<q>First, you entred into the Church
Porch the place of the Font or Baptiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and standing towards the West, you
heard it commanded you, that with hands
stretched out you should renounce the
Devil, as if he were there present. It
behoves you to know that a Type or Sign
of this, you have in the Old Testament.
When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the most bitter and cruel
Tyrant oppressed the free people of the
Jews, God sent <hi>Moses</hi> to deliver them
from the grievous servitude of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
the posts of the doors were anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the blood of the Lamb, that the
destroying Angel might pass by the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which had that sign of blood: and the
people were delivered beyond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But after that the Enemy saw them
delivered, and the Red sea divided; he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99745:132"/>
followed and pursued them, and was
over-whelmed with the waves of the Sea.
Pass we from the Figure to the Truth,
there was <hi>Moses</hi> sent by God into Egypt;
here Christ is sent into the world; he to
deliver the people oppressed by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
Christ to deliver the Devils captives;
there the blood of the Lamb turn'd away
the Destroyer; here the blood of the
immaculate Lamb Christ Jesus is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against the Devil; That Tyrant
followed our Fathers to the Red Sea,
this impudent Prince of wickedness the
Devil, follows there even to the waters
of Salvation; he was drowned in the
Sea, this is stifled in the waters of Life.
Hear now what with a beck of the hand
is said to the Devil, as present; <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
thee Satan:</hi> It is worth the while,
to explain why you stand to <hi>the West</hi> when
you say this. The sun-set is the place of
darkness, and the Devil is the Prince of
darkness; and therefore in token of this,
ye renounce the Prince of darkness, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the West, <hi>I renounce thee
Satan</hi> thou cruel Tyrant, I fear thy force
no more, for Christ hath dissolved the
power of darkness, I renounce thee,
subtle Serpent, who under the shew of
friendship, actest all thy villany, Then
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99745:132"/>
he adds, <hi>and all thy works.</hi> Those are
sins of all sorts, which you must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
renounce. And this you must
not be ignorant of, that whatsoever thou
sayest in that dreadful hour, is written
down in Gods book, and shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for. After this you say, <hi>And all
his pomp,</hi> all vain shews from which holy
<hi>David</hi> prayes to be delivered. <hi>Turn
away mine eyes lest they behold vanity,</hi>
Psal. 119. <hi>and all thy worship,</hi> all Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Superstition, all Magick and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying,
all worship of, and prayers to the
Devil. Take heed therefore of all these
things which thou hast renounced: For if
after the renunciation of the Devil, you fall
back again into his captivity, he will be a
more cruel Master than before; <hi>the last
state of that man is worse than the beginning.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>When you have renounced the Devil,
then the Paradise of God is opened to
you, which was planted in the East; and
therefore as a Type of this you are turn'd
<hi>from the West to the East, the Region of light.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We have seen that it was <hi>Ancient.</hi> And
that it is <hi>Reasonable</hi> we shall perceive, if we
consider, that in baptism we are making
or concluding a <hi>Covenant,</hi> the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Gospel; in which Covenant
Gods part is promises, precious promises,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99745:133"/>
as S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls them, 2 S. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. for
performance of which he hath given his
word; and therefore good reason it is,
that we also should give our word, and
promise for performance of conditions on
our parts, <hi>viz.</hi> to renounce the Devil and
the World, and swear fidelity to <hi>our
LORD.</hi> In all other Covenants and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
it is thought reasonable, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parties should mutually engage for
performance of conditions, and that at the
making and concluding of the Contract.</p>
               <p>And why should not that which is
thought reasonable in all other contracts,
be thought reasonable in this? As thus to
give our faith and word for performance
of conditions is reasonable; so, if it be
done with grave solemnity and in publick,
it is so much the better, and more obliging:
For grave solemnities make a deep impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
upon the apprehension: (whence it is,
that a corporal oath vested with the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
solemnity of laying on the hand upon,
and kissing the holy Gospels, is more
dreaded, than a naked and sudden oath)
and promises made in publick bind more,
because of the shame of falsifying, where
so many eyes look on: which very shame
of being noted to be false, oft-times is a
greater bridle to sin, than the fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
as the World knows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:99745:133"/>
And this use the ancient Fathers made
of it, to shame gross offenders by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
them of their solemn promise made
in Baptism to renounce the Devil, and give
up themselves to God. <hi>Children, who
by reason of their tender age, cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>
this solemnity, have appointed them
by the Church, <hi>Susceptores,</hi> Godfathers,
who shall in the name of the child do it
for them. As, by the wisest laws of the
World, Guardians may contract for
their Minors or Pupils to their benefit;
and what the Guardians in such cases
undertake, the Minors or Pupils are
bound, when they are able to perform.
For the Law looks upon them, not the
Guardians, as obliged. So did the
Church always account, that these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
which were made by the God-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the name of the childe, did bind
the child, as if in person himself had made
it. And when the Ancients did upbraid
any offenders with the breach of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made in baptism; none of those that
were baptised in their infancy, were so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate,
as to answer scornfully, it was not
I but my Godfathers that promised; and
if any should so have answered, he would
have been loudly laught at for that his
empty criticism.</p>
               <p>

Though this promise of <hi>Abrenunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
made in baptism be ancient and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
yet is it not <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to
baptism, but when danger requires haste,
it may be omitted, as the Church teaches
in <hi>Private Baptism:</hi> yet if the child lives,
it is to be brought to Church, and this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity

which were certain prayers taken

compos'd by the Church, CONC.
CARTH. 4. c. 7. for the dispossessing
of the person to be baptized; who being
born in sin is under the Devils tyranny,
from which the Church by her prayers,
endeavours to free him. And so available
they were, that oftentimes those that were
corporally possessed, were freed by them,
<hi>Cyp. ep.</hi> 77. and thereupon <hi>Cyril, Nazianz.
Gennadius,</hi> and others, earnestly perswade
not to despise the Churches Exorcisms.

                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:99745:134"/>
Next follows the <hi>Commemoration of
Christs institution</hi> of Baptism; and his
Commission to his Disciples to Baptize.
Thus the Priest reads his Commission, and
then acts accordingly: and because no <hi>man
is sufficient for these things, 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 16.
therefore he prayes for Gods assistance and
acceptance of his ministration.</p>
               <p>Then the Priest asks the <hi>childs name.</hi>
As under the Law at <hi>Circumcision</hi> the
name was given, so now at Baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
then we renounce our former Lord
and Tyrant, and give up our names to
God as his servants.</p>
               <p>Then the Minister <hi>Baptizes the child
dipping or spinkling it, &amp;c.</hi> either of
which is sufficient <hi>Gennad,</hi> dog. 74. For it
is not in this spiritual washing, as it is in
the bodily, where if the bath be not large
enough to receive the whole body, some
part may be foul when the rest are cleansed.
The soul is cleansed after another manner,
<hi>Totum credentibus conferunt divina com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendia,</hi>

as well a whole River, CYPR.
<hi>ep.</hi> 77.</p>

deposes him that does otherwise. The
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:99745:135"/>
Church so appointed then because of some
Hereticks that denied the Trinity: upon
the same ground afterwards it was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do it but once (signifying the unity
of substance in the Trinity) lest we should
seem to agree with the Hereticks that did
it thrice. <hi>Toletan.</hi> 4. c. 5.</p>
               <p>This baptizing is to be at the FONT.
What the Font is, everybody knows, but
not why it is so call'd. The rites of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
in the first times were perform'd
in <hi>Fountains</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> both because their
converts were many, and because those
ages were unprovided of other <hi>Baptiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi>
we have no other remainder of this
rite but the name. For hence it is that we
call our Baptisteries, <hi>Fonts;</hi> which when
Religion found peace, were built and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
for the more reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Sacrament. These were set at
first some distance from the Church, <hi>Cyril</hi>
cat. myst. 1. after, in the Church-Porch,
and that significantly, because Baptism is
the entrance into the Church mystical, as
the Porch to the Temple. At the last, they
got into the Church, but not into every,
but the <hi>City-Church,</hi> where the Bishop
resided, hence call'd the <hi>Mother Church,</hi>
because it gave spiritual birth by baptism;
afterward they were brought into Rural
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99745:135"/>
Churches. Wheresoever they stood, they
were had in high veneration. <hi>Anastas.</hi> ep.
<hi>ad Orthodox.</hi> complains sadly of impiety in
his time; such as never was heard of
in war, that men should set fire to Churches
and Fonts, and after mentioning the Fonts.
<hi>Good God! Christ-killing Iews, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Atheists, have without all reverence
entred and defiled the Fonts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Priest hath baptized the child,
he receives it into the congregation, by
this solemnity declaring that he is by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
made a member of the Church, I <hi>Cor.
12. 13. We are all baptized into one body.</hi>
And when he thus receives it, he signs it
with the sign of the Cross, as of old it
was wont, <hi>AVG.</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. and on the
forehead, the seat of blushing and shame,
that he may not hereafter blush and be
ashamed of the disgraced cross of Christ,
<hi>Cypr. ep.</hi> 56. By this badge, is the childe
dedicated to his service, whose benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon him in baptism, the name of
the cross in holy Scripture does represent.
Whosoever desires to be fully satisfied
concerning the use of the cross in baptism,
let him read the 30. <hi>Can.</hi> of <hi>our Church,</hi>

Of such short ejaculations in general hath

consider, that <hi>Confirmation</hi> is appointed
for the strengthning of us against all our

despair of obtaining strength enough to
resist them, for <hi>Our help stands in the Name

willing also to help them that call upon his

               </p>
               <p>After these <hi>Versicles</hi> follows a Prayer,
that God would strengthen the baptized,
with <hi>the holy Ghost the Comforter,</hi> who
had in their baptism received him as a
Sanctifier. These two wayes, to omit
others, we are taught in holy Scripture,
that the holy Ghost may be received, as a
sanctifier and cleanser in holy baptism,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99745:139"/>
                  <hi>Tit. 3. 5. He saved us by the washing of
regeneration and renewing of the holy Ghost:</hi>
and after baptism we may receive him again
as a Comforter and strengthener. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who received him the first way in
baptism, are promised to receive him the
second; <hi>S. Iohn 16. 7. Acts 1. 8.</hi> which
was performed <hi>Acts 2. 4. They were filled
with the holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>shall the Bishop lay his hands
upon them severally.</hi> By this sign certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
them of Gods Goodness towards
them, and consigning it upon them. This
is the most ancient and Apostolical Rite of
Confirmation, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. and by this
name it is known, <hi>Heb. 6. 2. The doctrine
of baptisms, and laying on of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a most excellent prayer for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in Gods love, &amp; obedience to him,
the Bishop departs them with a Blessing.
Of such blessings hath been said already.</p>
               <p>This holy Rite hath been too little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by many, and therefore too
lightly esteem'd and valued: for the remedy
whereof, it may not be amiss to shew the
benefit of it in these conclusions following.</p>
               <p>1. The Holy Ghost was given to persons
baptized, by the Apostles prayers and laying
on of hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 14, 15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 6.</p>
               <p>2. This gift of the Holy Ghost so giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,
was not only, nor principally, the gift of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99745:140"/>
miracles or speaking with tongues. For,
first, Confirmation is reckoned by S. <hi>Paul</hi>
amongst Fundamentals, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. which
were necessary to all ages of the Church;
but the gift of miracles was not such, for
that lasted but a wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le, as experience hath
taught us. Again, confirmation was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
to all baptized persons, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.
15. 19. 6. but all baptized persons were
not to have the gift of miracles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
8, 9. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit the word
of wisdom, to another the working of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
And again, 29. verse, <hi>Are all work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of miracles?</hi> It is true that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
times, the inward grace of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was attended with miracles, but it will
not thence follow that miracles were the
principal intended gift in confirmation,
no more than that the visible opening of
Heaven is the proper effect of baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
at our Saviours baptism, the heavens
were so opened, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> 3. or that
the proper effect of preaching is to work
miracles, because that at the Apostles
preaching miracles were wrought, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.
44. In those first times, the Holy Ghost
fell upon Believers and they spake with
tongues. <hi>Signa erant tempori opportuna,
[Those signs were seasonable to those times:]</hi>
does any man now expect that those, that
receive the holy Ghost by our prayers and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99745:140"/>
imposition of hands, should speak with
tongues? and if they do not speak with
tongues, is any man of so perverse a heart,
as to say, that they have not received the
holy Ghost? S. <hi>Aug.</hi> in ep. S. <hi>Ioh.</hi> tractat.
6. <hi>In the beginning of spiritual and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
dispensations, outward signs appeared to
confirm the new preached faith, but now
that the faith is sufficiently confirm'd, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
such miracles be not wrought, yet we
receive those inward graces and vertues,
which were signified and demonstrated by those
signs. Chrys.</hi> in S. <hi>Matth.</hi> Hom. 13.</p>
               <p>3. The proper and principal effect of
confirmation was, and is, <hi>Ghostly strength
and power to resist temptations,</hi> as our
Church teaches <hi>Rubr.</hi> 1. before the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism.</hi>
That the baptized, when they
come to years and the use of reason, may
have, not their baptism confirm'd (which
needs no confirmation to perfect it,) but
themselves and their souls, by some new
vertue and power, or by an addition and
increase of former graces, by which they
may be enabled against those temptations
that shall assault them, whence it is called
Confirmation. <hi>Regeneramur ad vitam per

                        <desc>•</desc>

[By baptism we are regenerated to life, in
confirmation we are strengthned to fight,</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:99745:141"/>
against our enemies: <hi>Melchiad.</hi> ep. ad
Epis. Hisp. about the year 311.] In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
the Holy Ghost is given for
strength, as he was given to the Apostles
at Pentecost, that Christians may boldly
confess the Name of Christ. <hi>Conc. Flor.
Tertul.</hi> de bapt. <hi>Cypr.</hi> ep. 2. ad donat.
For our fuller perswasion of this, it will
be necessary to consider that our Lord
Christ promised to his Apostles after they
had been baptized, that, <hi>When he went
away, he would send them the holy Ghost to
be their comforter</hi> or strengthener, S. <hi>Iohn</hi>
16. 7. to make them able to bear witness
of Christ, notwithstanding all the threats
and terrors of men, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 27. 16. 1,
2, 3. And <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 5. he promises them,
that, <hi>Not many daies hence, they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the holy Ghost,</hi> or the power of the
Holy Ghost, whereby they (that forsook
him formerly and fled) should be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
emboldned and encouraged to bear
witness to him all the World over, vers. 8.
This promise was performed at Pentecost,
<hi>Acts 2. 4. They were filled with the holy
Ghost, and began to speak,</hi> and to bear
witness of Christ with courage, verse 36.
This very promise made to the Apostles
formerly, and perform'd at Pentecost,
belongs to every one of us that are baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99745:141"/>
                  <hi>Acts 2. 38. Repent and be baptized
every one of you in the Name of Iesus Christ,
for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive
the gift of the holy Ghost: For this promise</hi>
of the holy ghost fulfilled on us, verse
33. <hi>is unto you and to your children, and to
all that are afar off.</hi> And what S. <hi>Peter</hi>
here promises them, was fulfilled by him
and the other Apostles; for by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and imposition of hands, they received,
after baptism, the holy Ghost, not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
them to speak miraculously, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
strengthening and comforting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
as he did the Apostles. For the
same that was promised to the Apostles,
belonged to them and their children, and
was given by imposition of hands. Now
that which was promised to the Apostles,
was principally, ghostly strength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
on which that gift of miracles was
an attendant, as we have seen: this then is
the principal effect of confirmation, the
gift of the holy Ghost by way of eminence,
<hi>Acts</hi> 2 38. Hence this phrase, <hi>Full of the
holy Ghost,</hi> is interpreted by Scripture to
be the same in effect with this, <hi>Full of
ghostly courage and strength. Act. 4. 8. 31.
They were all filled with the holy Ghost, and
spake with boldness the word of the Lord,
Acts</hi> 7. 55. and <hi>Acts 6. 5. Stephen full of
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:99745:142"/>
faith and the holy Ghost,</hi> that is, full of
faith and power, verse 8.</p>
               <p>4. This Office of Confirmation, as well
as that of Baptism, is to continue in the
Church as long as that shall be Militant
here on earth. For S. <hi>Paul Heb.</hi> 6. l, 2.
joyns them together, calling them <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals;</hi>
and a Fundamental in one age is
so in another. Besides we have seen that
Confirmation was the means used by the
Apostles, (and doubtless not without their
Lords directions and guidance of his Spirit,)
for conveying the holy Ghost the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into persons baptized: and since that
all ages have as much need of that ghostly
strength as the age of the Apostles had,
and that the promise of it belongs to us all,
as well as to them, as formerly hath been
proved; and since that we find no other
means appointed instead of Confirmation,
for the conveighing of the gift of the holy
Ghost, then given by confirmation; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
that we conclude, that Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is still to continue. And so the Church
Catholick hath taught us both by her do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and practice: as may be seen by the
quotations cited above.</p>
               <p>5. That Bishops, who succeed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
are to be the Ministers of this holy
Rite hath been shewn above.</p>

               <head>of MATRIMONY.</head>
               <p>FIrst, holy Church instructs us in the ends
of Matrimony, which are three.
1. <hi>The procreation of children. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedy
against sin. 3. A mutual help
to each other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Priest requires the parties to
be married, by the terror of the dreadful
judgment day, to declare, if they know
any impediment, why they may not be
lawfully married? which is as much care
and caution as can be used by those that are
not able to discern the secrets of the heart.</p>
               <p>Then follows the Contract in the future tense,
whereby these persons mutually
promise to the Priest, Gods Minister, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Congregation, to enter into that
holy state of Wedlock, and strictly to keep
those sacred laws of marriage which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God hath ordained. This is that,
as I conceive, which S. <hi>August.</hi> de Gen.
ad lit. l. 11. c. 4. calls <hi>Votorum solennitatem,</hi>
[<hi>the solemnities of vows and promises,</hi>]
which was in his time and formerly an usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
ceremony of marriage: And of very
good use is this solemnity; for by this have
the persons bound themselves to their duty,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:99745:143"/>
by all the obligations that a sacred solemn
vow or promise can lay upon the soul.</p>
               <p>Then the Priest asks [<hi>Who gives this
woman to be married to this man?</hi>]
This was the old custome, that the Bride
should be given by the Father or friend,
<hi>Aug.</hi> de Gen. ad lit. 11. c. 41. to which
S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be thought to allude, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
2. <hi>I have espoused you to one husband, that
I might present you as a chaste virgin to
Christ.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 45. 13. The Queen</hi>
the Spouse, <hi>shall be brought to the King.</hi>
The reason of this saith Learned Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>
l. 5. Eccl. Pol. Sect. 73. was, <hi>That in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times all women which had not Husbands
or Fathers to govern them, had their Tutors,
without whose authority, there was no act,
which they did warrantable; and for this
cause they were in marriage delivered unto
their husbands by others. Which custom
retained, hath still this use, that it puts wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in mind of a duty, whereto the very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity
of their sex doth bind them, namely,
to be always directed and guided by others.</hi>
Whether this were the very cause of this
custom, I will not determine, nor what else
was: but whatsoever was the first cause of
it, this is certain, that it is a decent custom.
For it cannot be thought fit, that a woman,
whose chiefest ornament is modesty and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:99745:143"/>
shamefacedness, should offer her self before
the Congregation to marriage to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but should rather be led by the hand
of another, and given by him.</p>
               <p>After the marriage it self [<hi>The man
puts a Ring upon the womans finger.</hi>]
The Ring hath been alwayes used as an
especial pledge of faith and fidelity. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more fit to serve as a token of our
purposed endless continuance in that which
we never ought to revoke; and therefore
fitly used in marriage, which is a contract
not to be dissolved but by death. <hi>Aurum

was permitted to wear gold, save only
upon one finger, which the husband had
fastned to himself with a wedding Ring.
This he puts <hi>upon the fourth finger of the
left hand,</hi> because there is a vein that goes
from thence to the heart; by which is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
that the love should be hearty: say
some <hi>Rituals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then follows [<hi>With my body I thée
worship, &amp;c.</hi>] <q>For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of this phrase, we must know
that <hi>anciently</hi> there were two sorts of
wives; <hi>One</hi> whereof was called the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
or lawful wife; the <hi>other</hi> was
called the half wife or Concubine. The
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:99745:144"/>
difference betwixt these two, was only
in the differing purpose of the man,
betaking himself to the one or the other:
If his purpose was only fellowship, there
grew to the woman by this means no
worship at all; but rather the contrary.
In professing that his intent was to add
by his person, honour and worship unto
hers, he took her plainly and clearly to
be his Wife, not his Concubine. This is
it which the <hi>Civil Law</hi> doth mean, when
it makes a Wife to differ from a Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
in dignity. The worship that grew
unto her, being taken with declaration
of this intent, was, that her children
became by this means free and legitimate,
heirs to their father: <hi>Gen</hi> 25. 5, 6. her
self was made a mother over his family:
Lastly, she received such advancement
of state, as things annexed to his person
might augment her with. Yea, a right
of participation was thereby given her
both in him, and even in all things which
were his: and therefore he saies not only
[<hi>With my body I thée worship,</hi>] but
also, <hi>with all my worldly goods, thée
endow.</hi> The former branch having
granted the principal, the later granteth
that which is annexed thereto, <hi>Hooker</hi>
Eccl. Pol. l. 5. Sect. 73.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:99745:144"/>
The <hi>Iews</hi> anciently used the same phrase
[<hi>Godwin</hi> Jew. Customs.] <hi>Be unto me a
wife, and I according to the word of God,
will worship, honour and maintain thee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the manner of husbands amongst
the Iews, who worship, honour and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their wives.</hi> And that no man quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at this harmless phrase, let him take
notice, that to worship here signifies, to
make worshipful or honourable, as you
may see, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. For where our last
Translation reads it, <hi>Him that honours me,
I will honour;</hi> in the old Translation, which
our Common-Prayer book uses, it is, <hi>Him
that worships me, I will worship;</hi> that is,
I will make worshipful, for that way only
can God be said to worship man.</p>
               <p>After the Priest hath prayed for grace
and Gods assistence, for the married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to enable them to keep their solemn
vow and contract, then does he as it were
seal that bond and contract, by which they
have mutually tied themselves, with Gods
seal, <hi>viz. Those whom God hath joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
let no man put asunder.</hi>

their troth each to other, and declared
the same by giving and taking of a Ring,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99745:145"/>
and joyning of hands;</hi> and the Priest
having sealed and ratified all, as it were,
with Gods seal, which no man must break,
<hi>he pronounces them man and wife, in
the Ntame of the Father, Son, and holy
Ghost.</hi> Which Proclamation, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of the married persons to be man
and wife; thus in the Church by the Priest,
was one of those laws and rites of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which the Church received of the
Apostles. <hi>Euar.</hi> ep. ad Epis. Aphric. Anno
110.</p>
               <p>Then the Priest blesses them solemnly
according to the old rules, <hi>Conc. Carth.</hi> 4.
c. 13. Of the efficacy of which blessings
hath been said formerly.</p>
               <p>After this follows the 128 <hi>Psalm</hi> which

used by the Jews at Nuptials, says <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul.</hi>
in loc.</p>
               <p>Then pious and devout prayers for the
married persons, and lastly the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MUNION.
Such religious solemnities
as these, or some of these, were used by
the Jews at marriages: For, their rites
and ceremonies of their marriage were
publickly performed with blessings and
thanksgivings; whence the house was
called the <hi>House of Praise,</hi> and their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
song <hi>Hillulim,</hi> praises; the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:99745:145"/>
intimate friends sung the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
-song, who are called <hi>children of the
Bride-chamber,</hi> S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 15. [<hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
of Jews mar.] The Primitive
Christians had all these which we have. The
persons to be married were contracted by
the Priest, the marriage was solemnly
pronounced in the Church, the married
couple were blessed by the Priest, prayers
and thanksgivings were used, and the holy
Communion administred to them. And
these religious rites, the Church received
from the Apostles, saies <hi>Euarist.</hi> Ep. ad
Epis. Aphr. And doubtless highly Christian
and useful these solemnities are: For first,
they beget and nourish in the minds of men,
a reverend esteem of this holy mystery,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 32. and draw them to a greater
conscience of wedlock, and to esteem the
bond thereof, a thing which cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impiety be dissolved. Then, are they
great helps to the performance of those
duties which God Almighty hath required
in married persons; which are so many,
and those so weighty, that whosoever duly
considers them, and makes a conscience
of performing them, must think it needful
to make use of all those means of grace,
which God Almighty hath appointed.
For if we duly consider the great love and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99745:146"/>
charity that this holy state requires, even
to the laying down of life, <hi>Husbands love
your wives, even a Christ loved the Church,
and gave himself for it, Ephes.</hi> 5. 25. of
the weighty charge of the education of
children, which if well performed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
a blessing, and an advantage to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
1 <hi>Tim. 2. 15. She shall be saved

it procures a most heavy curse,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 29, 31. &amp;c. Or lastly, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
and holiness necessary to that state of
marriage, heightned now up to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of the mystical union of Christ
with his Church, <hi>Eph. 5. 32. This is a great
mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the
Church;</hi> to which holy conjunction, our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and all our works and affections in the
same, should correspond and be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
I say, if we consider all these duly,
can we think we may spare any of those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
helps to performance; whether they
be vows and holy promises to bind us, or
our Fathers and Mothers, Gods and the
Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ches blessings, or holy prayers for
Gods assistance; or lastly, the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun
on that great strengthener of the soul?
If mens vices and licentiousness have made
this holy service seem unseasonable at this
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:99745:146"/>
time, reason would that they should labour
to reform their lives, and study to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of this holy service, and not that the
Church should take off her command for
the receiving of the holy <hi>Communion</hi> for
their unspeakable good. For would men
observe Gods and the Churches commands,
and enter into this holy state; not like
beasts or heathens at the best, but like
Christians with these religious solemnities,
the happiness would be greater than can
easily be exprest. <hi>I know not which way I

principal Interrogatory or question to be
put to the sick person, whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
as a Christian ought to do? And this
he does by rehearsing to him the CREED.
And there can be no better rule to try it by.
For whatsoever was prefigured in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
or taught in the Scriptures, or
foretold by the Prophets, concerning God
the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, is all

briefly contain'd in the Apostles Creed.

               <p>In the next place holy Church directs
the Priest to <hi>examine</hi> the sick person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his life and conversation; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
concerning these two particulars.
1. Whether he <hi>forgives</hi> all the World.
2. Whether he hath <hi>satisfied</hi> all injuries
done to others: without which the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
of repentance, which is necessary to
the sick persons salvation, will not profit
him. For the first, our Saviour tells
S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 14. That <hi>unless we forgive
others</hi> neither our persons nor our Prayers
will be accepted: <hi>God will not forgive us.</hi>
And for the second, <hi>Non remittetur pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum
nisi restituatur ablatum,</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
without restitution and reparation of
injuries cannot be true and serious; or if
it can, it cannot profit, <hi>Aug.</hi> ep. 5. <hi>For if
he that is injured by another cannot be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
of God, unless he forgives him that
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:99745:148"/>
injured him; how can he that injures others,
and does not make him restitution, hope for
pardon? Chrysost.</hi> Hom. 15. in S. <hi>Matth.</hi>
The Priest therefore is to advise him, that
whereinsoever he hath injured any, <hi>he
should make satisfaction to the uttermost of
his power.</hi> By the uttermost of his power,
is not meant that he must give to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
persons all his estate, nor that he
must restore four-fold, for injuries done,
(which was required in some cases under
<hi>Moses</hi> Law, by way of punishment, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than of satisfaction) but that he be
careful to the uttermost of his power, that
the person injured be so repair'd, that he
be no loser by him; which is all, that by
the law of justice, which commands to
give every man their due, is required,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 14, 15. <hi>When I say to the wicked,
he shall surely die: if he turn from his sin,
if he restore the pledge, give again that he
hath robbed,</hi> it is not, if he restore four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
but if he restore that which he hath
robbed, <hi>he shall surely live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Priest is to admonish the sick
person to settle his estate, <hi>For the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of his own conscience, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness
of his Executors.</hi> But holy Church
exhorts men to do this work in their
health, that when they are sick, they may
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:99745:148"/>
not be troubled about the world, but may
bestow their whole time and care, as it is
fit, about setling and securing their future
estate. And were men possest with that
fear and trembling, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. they would be careful to gain
all the time that might be then, to work
out their salvation.</p>
               <p>The Minister <hi>may not forget to move

[To every man that is ready to depart
out of this world, let the Bishop after exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
and trial give the holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if he desires it.</hi>] For this, saies the
Counsel, is <hi>antiqua &amp; Canonica lex, ut siquis
vità excedat, ultimo &amp; necessario vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atico
minime privetur. [This is the ancient
law of the Church,</hi> saies this Conc. there,
<hi>concerning him that is dying, that whosoever
he be, he shall not be denied the last and most
necessary viaticum of his life.</hi>] This viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,
or provision for the way, is the holy
Communion, as is plain in the Canon cited.
For though as learned <hi>Albaspineus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
this word <hi>Viaticum</hi> was applyed
to more things besides the Eucharist, as to
Alms, to Baptism, to Absolution, which
are all necessary helps in our journey to
heaven; Yet in this Canon I conceive the
<hi>Viaticum</hi> or provision for the way, to be
the holy Eucharist. For in the first part
of the Canon it is call'd <hi>Vltimum Viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
the last provision for the way; which
cannot be meant of any other properly
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:99745:150"/>
but of the holy Eucharist: For the rest,
for instance, Absolution, (of which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baspineus</hi>
understands this Canon,) is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliatio
Altaribus,</hi> a Reconciliation to
the Altar, or Sacraments, as it was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
call'd, a fitting or qualifying of the
Communicant for the holy Eucharist, and
therefore to go before it, as the 76. <hi>Can.</hi>
of <hi>Carth.</hi> 4. directs; and for Alms, they
are part of the fruits of penance, and so
necessary to fit us for Absolution, and
Baptism is <hi>janua Sacramentorum,</hi> the first
admission into Christs Church, which
gives the first right to the Communion and
Sacrament-of the Church; and therefore,
all these being pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

only the Euchari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> it self. Besides, in the
last part of the Canon there is expresly
mentioned, the participation of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
which must be the same with the <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum</hi>
in the first part, as may appear by
this: The Canon immediately before this,
had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rected, that penitents, especially those
of the first or second degree, should ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urches tax, before they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to the Churches prayers: but if
those should fall into danger of death, the
ancient Canon shall be observed (saith this
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:99745:150"/>
Canon in the beginning) that they shall be
admitted, notwithstanding the former Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
to the last <hi>Viaticum;</hi> the reason is
given in the later part of this Canon: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that to every one whatsoever, that
shall in danger of death desire the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
it shall be given to him if he be found
fit to receive it. This could be no reason
of the former part of the Canon, namely,
of giving the last <hi>viaticum</hi> to penitents in
danger of death, unless that <hi>Viaticum</hi> and
the Eucharist, here be all one. To that
which may be objected that this <hi>Viaticum</hi>
cannot be the same with the Eucharist men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the last part of the Canon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this <hi>Viaticum</hi> here is allowed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in danger of death without any exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
but the Eucharist is granted to
persons in the same danger with this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if the Bishop after examination shall
find him fit. It may be answered, that
notwithstanding this, the <hi>Viaticum</hi> and the
Eucharist may be all one, for the Canon
in the first part, where it allows it to
persons in necessity without examination,
speaks only of penitents, who had already
undergone the examination, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their penance, and submitted to the
Churches discipline, and so professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
truly penitents; and were in such
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99745:151"/>
necessity desiring the Eucharist, in the
judgment of charity supposed fit to receive
it; though the Church denied the same to
them, when there was no such necessity,
for the maintenance of holy discipline,
and in terror of offendors. But <hi>generaliter
de quolibet</hi> for every one that should desire
it, before he had given testimony of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
there could not be sufficient
ground of charity to believe so well; and
therefore they were to be examined by the
Bishop, or some others by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So then I think the Canon may be
interpreted thus of the holy Communion,
without any contradiction; and that it
ought to be so understood, may, I think,
be concluded by these Testimonies follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Con. Ilerd. c. 5. Const. Leon.</hi> 17. And
most clearly by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Ep. 54. <q>After
consultation we have determined, that
those that have fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in time of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have defiled themselves with
unlawful Sacrifices, should do full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
yet if they were dangerously sick,
they should be received to peace. For
divine clemency does not suffer the
Church to be shut against them that
knock; nor the succour of saving hope
to be denied to those that mourn and
beg it; nor to send them out of the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:99745:151"/>
World without peace and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
This is exactly agreeable to that
Canon of <hi>Nice.</hi> What Communion that
was, he tells us soon after; that it was
not only Absolution but the holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
besides, as appears by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
Formerly we made this rule,
That penitents, unless in time of extream
sickness, should not receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
And this rule was good, while
the Church was in peace and quiet; but
now in time of persecution, not only to
the sick, but to the healthful peace is
necessary; not only to the dying, but to
the living, the Communion is to be
given; that those whom we perswade
to fight manfully under Christs Banner,
and to resist even to blood, may not be
left naked and unarmed, but be defended
with the protection of the body and
blood of Christ; which for this cause
was instituted, that it might be a strength
and defence to them that receive it: how
shall we teach them to shed their blood
for Christ, if we deny them Christs
blood to strengthen them? Or how shall
we fit them for the cup of Martyrdom,
if we do not admit them to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Cup of the Lord? Upon
this very ground was it provided, that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:99745:152"/>
all dying men might have the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Eucharist, the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in that dangerous hour, when the
Devil is doing his worst and last. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is the 76. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the 4. <hi>Carth. Coune.</hi> He that in
time of sickness desires penance, if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
while the Priest is coming to him,
he falls dumb, or into a phrensie, let
them that heard his desire bear witness
to it, and let him receive penance: and
if he be like to die speedily, <hi>Let him be
reconciled by imposition of hands, and let
the Eucharist be put into his mouth.</hi> If he
recovers, let him be acquainted with
what was done by the former witnesses,
and be subject to the known laws of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
And those penitents which in
their sickness received the <hi>Viaticum</hi> of
the Eucharist, let them not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
absolved without imposition of
hands, if they shall recover, c. 78. <hi>Car.</hi>
4. And the <hi>Coun. of Orange.</hi> c. 3. saies the
same. They, that after penance set them,
are ready to depart out of this life, it
hath pleased the Synod to give them the
Communion, without the reconciliatory
Imposition of hands. Which suffices for
the reconciling of a dying man, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the definition of the Fathers, who
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:99745:152"/>
fitly call'd the Communion a <hi>Viaticum.</hi>
But if they recover, let them stand in
the rank of penitents, that by shewing
the necessary fruits of penance, they
may be received to the Canonical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
by the reconciliatory Imposition
of hands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It will not be amiss for the clearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of all passages in these Canons,
to consider the Church her discipline in
this particular. Holy Church for preserving
of holy discipline and deterring men from
sin, did appoint for wasting sins, such as
Adultery, Murder, Idolatry, and the like,
severe penance for three or four, six or seven
years, more or less, according to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
and quality of the offence. In the Greek
Church they had several degrees of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to be gone through in this set time.</p>
               <p>1. First, they were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes,</hi>
Mourners, standing without the
Church Porch; they were to beg of all the
faithful that entred into the Church, to
pray for them: in this degree they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
a year or more, according as their
crime deserved.</p>
               <p>2. They were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Audiente8,</hi>
Hearers; these might come into the
Church Porch into a place call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Ferula</hi> (so called, because those that stood
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:99745:153"/>
there, were subjected to the Churches
censure of <hi>Ferula</hi>) where they might
stand and hear the Scriptures read, and
Sermons, but were not admitted to joyn
with the Church in her prayers.</p>
               <p>3. They were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Subster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes,</hi>
the prostrate, as we may say; so
called, because they were all to prostrate
themselves upon their faces, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till the Bishop said certain prayers
over them, and laid his hands upon them.
They might be present at Sermon and the
first Service of the Catechumens, and then
go out. <hi>Laodic. Con. 19. apud Nicolin.</hi>
these were admitted into the Nave of the
Church, and to stand behind the Pulpit.</p>
               <p>4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Consistents; they
might stay after the rest of the Penitents
were gone out, and pray with the faithful,
but not receive the holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Communicants, they
were received to the participation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
but were still to weare some
marks of penance, till by prayers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
they had obtained the full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Churches favours and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
says <hi>Goar. in Euch. Graec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These several degrees were poor peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
to go through in the <hi>Greek Church,</hi>
and as much affliction in the <hi>Latin,</hi> unless
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:99745:153"/>
the Bishop should think fit to remit any
thing of it, before they were fully admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Churches favour: but if any
of these were desperately sick, Holy
Church took care, that upon their desire
they should have the Churches peace by
Absolution, 4. <hi>Carth.</hi> c. 78. and 77. and the
holy Communion, sayes the same Canon,
and <hi>Cypr.</hi> Epist. 54. lest they should want
that great strengthening and refreshing of
their souls in their last and greatest necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Provided nevertheless, that if they
should recover, then they should resume
their several places and degrees of penance
they were in before, and go through and
perfect their task of penance, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, they should receive <hi>Vltimam
reconciliationem,</hi> their last and highest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation;
a favour which was denied
to some that had been admitted to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Eucharist, as you may see
<hi>Con. Vas.</hi> 2. c. 2. This last Reconciliation
was a solemn Absolution from all the
Churches censures and penances, by the
laying on of the hands of the Bishop, and
some of his Clergy, says <hi>Cypr.</hi> l. 3. Ep. 14.
A Declaration to all the Church, that they
were received not only to necessary <hi>Viati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and assisting such as the former Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
mentioned, 76. Can. 4. <hi>Carth.</hi> and the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:99745:154"/>
holy Sacrament of the Eucharist were;
which they were permitted to receive in
case of necessity; but also to all the honour
and solemnities, and priviledges of the
faithful, quite free from all brands and
marks of penitents. They were restored
<hi>Legitimae Communioni,</hi> to the Canonical
and Legitimate Communion, <hi>Orang.</hi> c. 3.
they might offer with the faithful, and
their offerings be received by the Church;
and they might receive the kiss of peace,
and all other favours of the Church. This
that hath been said, may help us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the true meaning of the so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
Canon of <hi>Orange,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,

of the Churches censures; which those
penitents in case of extremity could not
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:99745:154"/>
receive, because, as by the Canons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
they were, if they recovered, to
return to their several tasks of penance
again, till they had fulfilled them. It was
enough for them to be reconciled to the
Altar and Sacrament, by the Absolution
<hi>in foro Coli</hi> in Heavens Court. The power
of which was granted to the Apostles and
their Successors, S. <hi>Iohn 20. Whose sins ye

                  </gap>, or
the Absolution from sin; and this they
were to receive Can. 76. <hi>Carth.</hi> 4. and after
that the holy Eucharist. And this says the
Canon of <hi>Orange</hi> was sufficient for a dying
mans Reconciliation according to the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of the Fathers. And this the Church
of <hi>England</hi> provides for all dying men
that shall desire it. And infinitely bound to
their Mother, for this her care, are all
true Sons of the Church. For thrice happy
souls are they, who shall have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at their last and greatest extremity,
worthily to receive the Reconciliation and
the holy Communion, the Bread of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the Blood of God, our Hope, our
Health, our Light, our Life. <hi>For if we
shall depart hence guarded with this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

We have seen the Churches care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
all necessaries for sick persons salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
'Twere an happy thing to see in the
people an answerable diligence in the use
of these Ghostly Offices, that they would,
when they are sick, send for the Priest;
not verbally only to comfort them, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsing
to them comfortable texts of
Scripture, whether they belong to them
or not (which is not to heal the sick, but
to tell them that they have no need of the
spiritual Physician, by which means, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
souls perish, for whom Christ died:)
but to search and examine the state of their
souls, to shew them their sins, to prepare
them by ghostly counsel, and exercises of
penance, for absolution, and the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
whereby they might indeed find
comfort, remission of sins and the holy
Ghost the Comforter. And this should be
done while the sick person hath strength
and ability to attend and joyn with him in
these holy Services. There is an excellent
Canon to this purpose, <hi>Decretal.</hi> l. 5. tit. 38.
c. 13. <hi>By this present Decree we strictly
charge and command all Physicians, that
when they shall be called to sick persons, they
first of all admonish and perswade them to
send for the Physicians of souls, that after
provision hath been made for the spiritual
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:99745:155"/>
health of the soul, they may the more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
proceed to the use of corporal medicine:
For when the cause is taken away, the effect
may follow.</hi> That which chiefly occasioned
the making of this good Law, was the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
carelesness of some sick persons, who
never used to call for the Physician of the
soul, till the Physician of the body had
given them over. And if the Physician did,
as his duty was, timely admonish them, to
provide for their souls health, they took
it for a sentence of death, and despair'd of
remedy, which hastned their end, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
both the bodily Physician from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any cure upon their body, and the
ghostly Physician from applying any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
means to their souls health. It is
good counsel that <hi>Eccles.</hi> gives c.38. 9.
where we are advised, not first to send for
the Physician, and when we despair of his
help, and are breathing our last, then to
send for the Priest, when our weakness
hath made him useless. But first <hi>to make
our peace with God</hi> by ghostly offices of the
Priest, and <hi>then give place to the Physician.</hi>
Which method our Saviour hath taught us
also by his method of Cure; who, when
any came to him for bodily cures, first
cured the soul of sin, before he healed the
bodily infirmity: teaching us, that sin is
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:99745:156"/>
the cause of sickness, and that cure first to
be lookt after. And by thus doing, we may
possibly save the body, without the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
S. <hi>Iames 5. 14. Is any sick, let him
send for the Elders or Priests of the Church
to pray over him, and the prayer of faith
shall save the sick.</hi> But if he fails of that
bodily cure by these means, yet he may
be sure to obtain remission of sins by their
means: <hi>If he hath committed sins, they shall
be forgiven him,</hi> ver. 15. by the benefit of
absolution, so the words import. For

               <p>There was an ancient Canon, which that
it might be truly practised and observed,
it must be the wish of all good men. It is
<hi>Can. 7. Con. Aurelian 5. ut qui pro quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque
culpis in carceribus deputantur, ab
Archidiacono seu à Praeposito Eccles. diebus
singulis Dominicis requirantur, at necessitas
vinctorum, secundum praeceptum divinum,

misericorditer sublevetur;</hi> That all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
for what crime soever, shall be
call'd for and visited by the Archdeacon or
Bishop of the Church, every Lords day,
that the necessities, bodily and ghostly, of
the prisoners, according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
may be mercifully relieved. The
neglect of which duty, how dangerous it is,
we may read, S. <hi>Mat.25. 43. Go ye cursed, for
I was sick and in prison, and ye visited me
not.</hi> The Rubrick at the Communion of
the sick, directs the Priest, to deliver the
Communion to the sick, but does
not there set down how much of the
Communion-Service shall be used at the
delivering of the Communion to the sick;
and therefore seems to me, to refer us to
former directions in times past. Now the
direction formerly was this:</p>
               <p>If the same day (that the sick is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Communinn) there be a celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy Communion in the Church,
then shall the Priest reserve (at the open
Communion) so much of the Sacrament
of the body and blood as shall serve the sick
person, and so many as shall communicate
with him. And as soon as he may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
after the open Communion ended
in the Church, shall go and minister the
same first to them that are appointed to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:99745:157"/>
communicate with the sick, if there be any;
and last of all to the sick. But before the
Curate distribute the holy Communion,
the appointed general Confession, (in the
Communion-Service) must be made in the
name of the Communicants, the Curate
adding the Absolution, with the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sentences of Scripture, following in the
open Communion immediately, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the Communion-Service to the
end of the Consecration and Distribution:
and after the Communion ended, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
is to be used, which begins; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and everliving God, we most heartily
thank thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But if the day wherein the sick person is
to receive the Communion, be not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the open Communion, in the
Chruch; then upon convenient warning
given, the Curate shall come and visit the
sick person afore noon. And cutting off
the form of the visitation at the Psalm, <hi>In
thee O Lord,</hi> shall go straight to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
<hi>Rubr. 3. Com. of sick;</hi> that is,
after he hath said the Collect, Epist. and
Gosp. there directed, he shall go to the
Communion-Service. K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6th. 1.</p>

the hope of the resurrection, being
the proper hope of Christians. Such was
the Christians burial of old, that it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
both an evident argument and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

done to that body, which the Holy Ghost

prayers, praises, and holy Lessons, and
decent solemnities, we do glorifie God,
honour the dead, and comfort the living.</p>
               <p>Take away these prayers, praises and
holy lessons, which were ordained to shew
at Burials, the peculiar hope of the Church
of the Resurrection of the dead, and in the
manner of the dumb funerals, what one

perceive that we are Christians? <hi>HOO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KER

over death, when he hears holy Lessons and
discourses of the Resurrection, when he
hears us pray for a happy and joyful Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

him believe the same, <hi>and so fall down and

               <p>THe Woman when she comes to give

she is required by the Civil Law, according

for any unholiness in the Woman, or inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of receiving the holy Mysteries at
that time; (for if there be fear of death,
she may receive them, as soon as she please
after the birth;) but for some secret rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

in the Law, which are set down,

               <p>The Woman that is to be Churched,
is to have a Veil; and good reason; For
if as S. <hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi>11. sayes, <hi>Every wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when she prayes in publick, ought to
have a veil</hi> or covering <hi>on her head,</hi> in
token of her modesty and subjection: then
much more, when she is to sit in a more
eminent place of the Church, near to the
holy Table, apart from the rest of her Sex,
in the publick view, ought she to have
such a Veil or covering. Nor can it be
deemed unreasonable for her at that time
to have a Veil or habit distinct from
others; that so it may be known, for
whom thanks is then particularly given.</p>
               <p>The Preface following. <hi>Forasmuch, &amp;c.</hi>
is left arbitrary to the Priest, but the
prayers are all prescribed.</p>
               <p>Then shall the Priest say the 121. psal.
<hi>I have lifted up mine eyes unto the
Hills, &amp;c.</hi> The Church appointing this
Psalm at this time, does not intend to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us by this, that this Psalm was pen'd
for such a particular occasion as this; or
that the promises of Gods protection and
assistence there expressed, were directly
and primarily made to persons in that
danger of child-birth: but because the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:99745:160"/>
Psalm at the very beginning tells us all,
that our help comes from God, it is
thought seasonable at this time to be used,
to mind the woman from whom she hath
received that mercy of deliverance, and
to whom she is to return the honour due
for such a mercy, even to him from whom
comes all our help, the Lord that made
heaven and earth. And this were enough
to justifie the Churches choice of this
Psalm at this time; in that, part of it is
so fit for this business in hand, though it
were not penn'd upon this very occasion
<q>(for so we find <hi>Hezekiah</hi> commended,
for appointing of the Psalms of <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Asaph,</hi> to set forth the praises of God
in the publick services, 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 29. 30: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
neither had <hi>Hezek</hi> and the Church
then, the very same occasions to use them,
which <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> had, nor did every
particle of those songs, so directly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to <hi>Hezekias</hi> and the Church
then, as they did to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Asaph.</hi>
                  </q>)
But not only the beginning of this Psalm,
but even the whole body of it is fit and
suitable to this service, and those promises
of divine assistence therein exprest, though
they were primarily and in their first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
made to the Church of the Jews:
yet in their proportion they do belong
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:99745:161"/>
to the person coming to give thanks, and
to every one that shall lift up their eyes to
the Hills, and trust in God. For not Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
at large, but Israel lifting up her eyes
to God, and trusting in God, is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
and true object of this promise; which
therefore, belongs to every such person as
shall be so qualified, so depending upon
God. This rule S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. applying there the promise
made particularly to <hi>Ioshuah</hi> Chap. 1. 5.
to every one of us that shall contentedly
depend upon God, as <hi>Ioshuah</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to do in expectance of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
<hi>Let your conversation be without
covetousness; and be content with such things
as ye have; For he hath said, I will not
leave thee nor forsake thee. So that we may
boldly say, the Lord is my helper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One verse of this Psalm may perhaps at
the first sight seem not so well expressed,
namely this, <hi>the sun shall not burn thée
by day, nor the Moon by night;</hi> for the
Moon does not burn but cool. But it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
easily cleared, by taking notice that <hi>to burn</hi>
is not always taken in the strict and proper
sence, but usually in a larger; whereby it
is the same with, to <hi>grieve or hurt;</hi> a
ordinary skill in language will enform us;
so the meaning is, <hi>The Sun shall not hurt
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:99745:161"/>
thee by day, nor the Moon by night,</hi> whose
shine is held to be very hurtful.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Psalm</hi> follow the <hi>Kyrie</hi> or
<hi>short Litany,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> so
admirably good and useful, that there is
scarce any publick service dispatcht with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them: after these follow <hi>some Verses
and Responds,</hi> of which and the reason of
their use, together with the antiquity of it,
hath been said already, and need not be
here repeated. But there is one thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
in these Responds or Answers
which was not spoken of hitherto, nor
was so observable in some of the former
Verses and Responds as in these here; and
that is this, that some of these Answers are
not of themselves intire sentences or peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the others were, but are parts
or ends of the foregoing verses, the verse
and Answer together making up one entire
petition. For example,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>O</hi> Lord save this Woman thy Servant,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>R.</hi> Which putteth her trust in thee.</l>
                  </q>
And,
<q>
                     <l>Be thou to her a strong Tower,</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>R.</hi> From the face of her Enemy.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This I observe, because it seems to be
the remain of a very ancient custom. For
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:99745:162"/>
                  <hi>Eus.</hi> in Hist. l. 2. c. 17. tells us, that the
Primitive Christians in the singing of their
hymns, had this use; that one began and
sung in rhythm; the rest hearing with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
only the last part, or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the ends of the Psalm or Hymn, all the rest
joyned and sung together with him. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this says <hi>Clem. Const.</hi> l. 2. c. 57.
was the usage in his time and before. After
the readings of the Old Testament, says
he, Let another sing the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi>
and let the people answer <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the extreams or ends of the Verses. What
the reason of this ancient custome was, I
will not peremptorily determine; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were only for variety, which much
pleases and delights, and is a great help
against weariness; which those Primitive
Christians, (who continued in sacred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
from morning to night) had need
of. For which cause says <hi>Euseb.</hi> in the place
above cited, they used all decent and grave
variety of rhythmes and Meeters in their
Hymns and Psalms. Or whether it were
to avoid the inconvenience of indecorum
and confusion, which the people (usually
not very observant of decency) were guilty
of in their joynt singing: and yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them apart in these Offices; that it
was so appointed, that they should only
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:99745:162"/>
sing the extreams or ends of the Verses.
Or what else was the cause, I leave it to
others to judge.</p>
               <p>The prayer following is clearly fitted to
the occasion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>woman that comes to give her
thanks, must offer. Rubr.</hi> after the
Thanksgiving. Although Offerings be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
acceptable to God, yet some times
there are, in which the Church hath held
them more necessary, as hath been shewn
formerly about offerings. First, when the
Church is in want. Secondly, at the holy
Communion. Thirdly, when we come
to give thanks for some more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
blessing received; Then not only in
word, but in Deed also to thank God, by
bringing a present to God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 10,
11. That this is more than an ordinary
blessing, a deliverance that deserves even
perpetual thanks, <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.
5. <hi>Thou art he that took me out of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb, my praise shall be always of thee.</hi>
This service is to be done betwixt the first
and second Service, as I have learnt by some
Bishops enquiries at their Visitation; the
Reason perhaps is, because by this means
it is no interruption of either of these
Offices.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Though it be not ancient, yet is it a very
useful penitential service, either in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or private, consisting of holy sentences
taken out of Gods word, fit for the work
of repentance; Gods holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the glass wherein we see our sins;
Holy penitential prayers taken for the most
part out of holy Scripture: so that, he
which prayes this form, is sure <hi>to pray by
the Spirit,</hi> both for words and matter.</p>
               <p>Nothing in it seems to need exposition,
but the AMEN, which is to be said after
the Curses, which being commonly used
after prayers, may perhaps here be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
by some, a wish or prayer; and
so the people be thought to curse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>For the satisfying of which scrupulosity,
it is enough to say, that God himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
these Amens to be said after these
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:99745:163"/>
Curses. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. and therefore good
there may be in saying of them, but harm
there can be none, if men when they say
them understand them. Now that we may
understand them when we use them, let us
consider, that Amen is not always a wish
or prayer. For, it signifies no more but
verily or truly, or an assent to the truth
of that to which it is added. If that to
which it is added, be a prayer, then this
must needs be a joyning in the prayer,
and is as much as <hi>so be it;</hi> but if that to
which it be added be a Creed, or any affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
proposition, such as these curses
are, then the Amen is only an affirmation,
as that is, to which it is annexed. In this
place therefore it is not a wishing that the
Curses may fall upon our heads, but only
an affirming with our own mouthes <hi>that
the curse of God is indeed due</hi> to such sins,
as the Church here propounds it. The use
of it is to make us flee such vices for the
future, and earnestly repent of them, if
we be guilty: since, as we acknowledge,
the curse and vengeance of God doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
follow such sins and sinners.</p>

A Temple
and a Priest are necessary instruments of
publick and holy worship. The Priest, to
offer it up, and the Church with an Altar
to offer it upon. <hi>Symeon Thessal. The Light
of Nature</hi> taught <hi>Heathens</hi> thus much;
and they obeyed that Light of Nature, and
dedicated and set apart to the worship of
their gods, Priests and Temples. The
<hi>Patriarchs,</hi> by the same Light of Nature,
and the guidance of Gods holy Spirit,
when they could not set a part houses, being
themselves in a flitting condition, dedicated
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:99745:164"/>
Altars for Gods service, <hi>Genesis</hi> 22. 9. 28.
22. &amp;c. <hi>Vnder the Law,</hi> God call'd for a
Tabernacle, <hi>Exodus</hi> 25. within which was
to be an Altar, upon which was to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the daily Sacrifice, Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Exod. 29. 38. David</hi> by the same
Light of Nature, and the guidance of the
holy Spirit, without any express direction
from God, (as appears 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 7. and also
by this, that God did not suffer him to
build it) intended and designed <hi>an House</hi>
for Gods service and worship; which,
(though for some reasons, <hi>viz.</hi> because
he had shed much blood, being a man of
war) God did not suffer him to build,
yet he accepted it highly from him, and
for this very intention promised to bless
him and his, for many generations,2. <hi>Sam.
7. But Salomon</hi> built him an house, which
God accepted, and our <hi>Saviour owns under
the Gospel,</hi> for <hi>His house of prayer,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apostles go up to pray, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the <hi>Christians</hi> set apart and
consecrated with great solemnity of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Rites and holy Prayers, Churches
and Oratories for the same solemn service
and worship. Nor can it with reason be
thought needless or superstitious to use so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
religious Rites and Prayers, at the
Consecration and setting of those Houses
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:99745:165"/>
apart to religious uses and services. For
as S. <hi>Paul</hi> argues in another case, <hi>Doth
not even nature teach you,</hi> that it is unseemly
for any man to go about the building of an
house to the God of Heaven with no other
apparance, than if his end were to rear
up a Kitchin or a Parlor for his own use?
Did not this light of Nature teach the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
in the state of Nature, when they
erected Altars for Gods service, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
and set them apart with religious
solemnities? <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 18. &amp;c. And did not
<hi>Moses,</hi> by the direction of the God of
Nature, consecrate the Tabernacle and
Altar, with the like solemnities? <hi>Exod.</hi>
40. And <hi>Solomon</hi> after consecrated the
Temple, with religious Prayers and Rites,
1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8. without any particular direction
from God, that we find, only by the Light
of Nature and right reason, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that it is fit, that the House which is
dedicated and given up to God, should be
solemnly surrendred into his possession,
and by religious Rites guarded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
from Sacrilegious usurpation.</p>
               <p>Again, Nature teaches us by these solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
that the House so consecrated, is
to be no more used to Common and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
employments, but set apart to holy
and religious services, such as those are,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:99745:165"/>
with which it is consecrated. These things,
those pious Christians in Primitive times
did not account superfluous. They knew
how easily that which was meant should be
holy and sacred, might be drawn from the
use whereunto it was first provided. They
knew how bold men are to take even from
God himself; how hardly those Houses
would be kept from impious profanation:
they knew, and right wisely therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
by such solemnities to leave in
the minds of men that impression, which
might somewhat restrain their boldness,
and nourish a reverend affection towards
the House of God. Thus therefore they
built and set apart to Gods holy service
and worship by religious solemnity,
Churches and Oratories, which they called
<hi>Dominica's, the Lords Houses,</hi> and <hi>Basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a's,
Royal and Kingly houses;</hi> because. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
and holy worship were offered up
there to the great King of all the world.
And when persecutors at any time destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
those holy places, as soon as the storm
was over, those blessed Souls, the first
thing they did, re-built, and re-beautified
them, <hi>Euseb.</hi> l. 10. c.2. that they might
worship God, according to the Psalmists
rule, <hi>in the beauty of holiness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:99745:166"/>
Thus to offer up Gods publick service
and worship in separate and dedicated pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which we call Churches, is most fit; both
for the honour of God, and our own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
It is for the honour of God to have
a House of his own, for his service alone,
where flesh and blood hath no right or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
where no common or prophane
thing may be done. S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 22. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called <hi>the habitation of his honour.
Psal.</hi> 27. 8.</p>
               <p>Again, it is for our profit many ways;
for First, it begets and nourishes in us, dull
flesh, a reverence and awe to God and
his service, to offer it up thus in places set
apart to that purpose, and so helps devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Besides, our prayers and publick
services are most readily accepted, in such
holy separate places, 2. <hi>Chron. 7. 15. Now
mine eyes shall be open, and mine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ars attent
unto the prayer in this place.</hi> This promise
of acceptance of our prayer was there, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
made directly to the House which
<hi>Salomon</hi> built, but belongs to any place
so Dedicated and Consecrated unto God
for his holy service and worship: For that
is the reason that God gives of his gracious
readiness to hear the prayer of that holy
place; <hi>For now have I chosen and sanctified
this house, that my name may be there.</hi> Now
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:99745:166"/>
that it is dedicated and solemnly set apart
by religious rites and prayers to my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<hi>Now have I chosen</hi> or accepted
<hi>it for mine,</hi> to be call'd by my name,
S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 13. to be for <hi>a house
of prayer,</hi> and therefore <hi>mine eyes and my
heart shall be there.</hi> Then, by the Rules of
Logick, <hi>à quatenus ad omne valet consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi>
if because he hath so sanctified this
place and accepted it for his, therefore his
eyes and ears shall be open to the prayer of
that place; by the like reason, whatsoever
place shall be dedicated to him and accepted
by him, shall have his eyes open, and his
ear attentive to the prayer of it. And
God Almighty promises as much, <hi>Exod.
20. 24. In all places, where I record my
name, I will come unto thee, and I will bless
thee.</hi> In all places dedicated to me and my
service, and so made mine, <hi>called by my
name (as Iacob</hi> calls his dedicated stone,
<hi>Gods house, Gen.</hi> 28. 22.) <hi>I will come and
bless thee.</hi> And such are all Consecrated
Churches and Chappels. And therefore holy
Church wisely orders that the prayers and
publick services of God shall be offered
up there, in <hi>the accustomed place of the
Church, Chappel, or Chancel.</hi>

               <p>In times past, the fabrick of the Church,

in the form and fashion of a Ship,
which very figure might mind us thus

safely through, to our haven of rest

Church.</p>
               <p>The Church of old was parted into two
principal parts. <hi>Navis the NAVE</hi> or
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:99745:167"/>
body of the Church; and <hi>Sacrarium the
CHANCEL.</hi> The first, <hi>the Nave,</hi> was
common to all the people that were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
worthy to joyn in the Churches
Service: <hi>the Chancel</hi> was proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Priests and Sacred persons.
The <hi>Nave</hi> represents the visible world,
and the <hi>Chancel</hi> typifies heaven, or as
<hi>Symeon Thessal</hi> applies it.</p>
               <p>The whole Church is a type of heaven,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 17. the house of God is heaven
upon earth; the Nave represents the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or lowest heaven or Paradise; the
lights shining alost, represent the bright
Stars; the circling roof, the Firmament;
the Priests within the Quire beginning the
divine Hymns, represent the first order of
Angels that stand before God; the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
with the Readers and Singers order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
succeeding, the middle order or quire
of heaven; the whole company of true
believers joyning with the Priests and
Deacons in heart and affection, saying
Amen to the divine Hymns and prayers,
and so inviting and alluring the mercy of
God, resemble the lowest rank of Angels,
with whom no prophane Heretick, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean

for, <hi>what fellowship hath light with
darkness?</hi> thus the whole Church typifies
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:99745:168"/>
heaven, but the <hi>Chancel,</hi> parted and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the <hi>Nave</hi> or body of the
Church, so as, that it cannot be seen into
by those that are there, typifies the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
heaven, or things above the heaven,
not to be seen by the eye of flesh.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nave</hi> or body resembles the lowest
visible heaven or Paradise: and as man for
sin was cast out of <hi>Edens</hi> Paradise into

they had made their peace and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Nave,</hi> we shall mention but two
things as observable here; First, <hi>the

or <hi>Gate, Acts</hi> 3. 2. because those that had
entred them, might see the whole beauty
of the Church; and <hi>the Pulpit</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which stood in the midst or side of the
Nave, <hi>Sym. Thess.</hi> This signifies the stone
rolled away from the Sepulchre; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Angel sitting upon it, preacht the
Gospel of the Resurrection of Christ to
the women, S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 6. the Priests
and Deacons, imitating the Angels pattern,
from this Pulpit, publish and proclaim the
glad tidings of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The Chancel was divided from the Body
of the Church, <hi>Cancellis,</hi> whence it is
called the <hi>Chancel.</hi> This was, as was said,
peculiar to the Priests and sacred persons.
In it were, at least in some principal
Churches, these divisions; <hi>Chorus Canto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
the Quire; where was an high Seat
for the Bishop, and other Stalls or Seats
for the rest of the Quire: yet perhaps this
<hi>Chorus,</hi> as also the next, called <hi>Soleas,</hi>
might be more properly reckoned a part
of the Nave; and the Chancel properly
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:99745:169"/>
that which of old was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
the Sanctuary, which was separated from
the rest of the Church with rails, and
whither indeed none but sacred persons
entered: whereas the Laity entred into
the other, as will appear after; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it to which you please, such a place
there was, and immediately beyond it, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from the Quire with boards on the
one side, and from the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> by the

place called <hi>Soleas,</hi> from the Latine <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
or <hi>Throne,</hi> because this was Christs
lower Throne; his higher or upper Throne
was the Altar, where the precious body
and blood of Christ was consecrated and
offered: And this was his lower Throne,
where the Bishop or Priest in Christ his

to the people. Beyond this is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now that no man take offence at the
word <hi>Altar,</hi> Let him know that anciently
both these names <hi>Altar</hi> or <hi>holy Table</hi> were
used for the same things, though most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
the Fathers and Councils use the
word <hi>Altar.</hi> And both are fit names for
that holy thing: For the holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi>
being considered as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the breaking of the Bread,
and pouring forth the Cup, doing that to
the holy Symbols, which was done to
Christs Body and Blood, and so shewing
forth and commemorating the Lords death
and offering upon it the same Sacrifice that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:99745:170"/>
was offered upon the Cross, or rather the
commemoration of that Sacrifice, S. <hi>Chrys.</hi>
in Heb. 10. 9. may fitly be call'd an <hi>Altar,</hi>
which again is as fitly call'd an <hi>holy Table,</hi>
the <hi>Eucharist</hi> being considered as <hi>a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which is nothing else but a distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and application of the Sacrifice to the
several receivers.</p>
               <p>To put all out of doubt, it is questionless
lawful and safe to speak the language of the
New Testament, and to give this holy
thing the name, which is given it there;
now there it is called an <hi>Altar, Heb.</hi>13.
10. <hi>we have an Altar:</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the
verse before had perswaded that they
should not be carried away with strange
doctrines of Jewish and carnal observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which are grown unprofitable to those
that walk in them. <hi>For we have an Altar</hi>
now, whereof they that serve at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
the Jewish Priests, have no right
to eat, unless they will receive the Faith
of Christ; our Altar is better than theirs,
and theirs was but a shadow of ours; the
Sacrifices of their Altar, but types of ours;
theirs are vanished and ours only continue.
And for this reason, do you leave strange
doctrines of legal observances, and Jewish
Altars, and continue in the grace of the
Gospel, whose Altar is to continue; <hi>for
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:99745:170"/>
we have an Altar.</hi> Again S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23.

That precept and direction for Offerings
is Evangelical, as is proved at large. p. 258,

duty there mentioned be Evangelical,
then Altars are to be under the Gospel;
for those gifts are to be offered upon the
Altar, so that I hope, we may go on and
call it <hi>Altar</hi> without offence.</p>
               <p>To return then to the appendices of the

of the Resurrection. What is the Altar,

but the seat of the Body and Bloud of Christ?
and yet your fury, hath either shaken, or
broken, or removed these: every of these is
crime enough, while you lay sacrilegious
hands upon a thing so holy. If your spite
were at us, that there were wont to worship
God, yet wherein had God offended you, who
was wont to be there call'd upon? What had
Christ offended you, whose Body and Blood,

In this you have imitated the Iews, they
laid hands upon Christ on the Cross, you
have wounded him in his Altars. By this
doing, you are entred into the list of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious.
You have made your selves of
the number of them that Elias complains of,</hi>
1 Kings 19. <hi>Lord, they have broken down
thine Altars. It should have sufficed your
madness that you had worried Christs mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that you had broken his people, so long
united, into so many Sects and Factions,
at least you should have spared his Altars.</hi>
So he, and much more to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>Many more testimonies to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
might be brought; but this may
shew sufficiently the respect they had to
the Altar; First, the Epithets they gave
it, calling it the Divine, the Dreadful Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:
Secondly, their bowing and adoring
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:99745:172"/>
that way, turning their faces that way in
their publick prayers, as towards the
chiefest and highest place of the Church:
Lastly, placing it aloft in all their Churches
at the upper end, the East. For so both
<hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Niceph.</hi> l. 12. c. 34. tell us,
the Altar was placed <hi>Ad Orientem,</hi> at the
East, in all Christian Churches, except in
<hi>Antiochia Syriae,</hi> in <hi>Antioch.</hi> And so
they stood at the East in the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> till <hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi> time, when
some of them were taken down indeed,
upon what grounds I dispute not; but
wheresoever the Altars were taken down,
the holy Tables, which is all one; were
set up in the place where the Altars stood,
by the Queens Injunctions, and so they
continued in most Cathedral Churches;
and so ought to have continued in all; for
that was injoyned by Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
Injunctions, forbidden by no after-Law,
that I know, but rather confirm'd by this
Rubr. <hi>For the Chancels are to remain

               <p>WE have seen the reason of the

holy Service should be offered up in the
Church or Chappel, &amp;c. But what if a

Church may not be had, <hi>The Priest
shall say it Privately,</hi> says the same
Rubr. 2. And good reason; for Gods
worship must not be neglected or omitted
for want of a circumstance. It is true,
the Church is the most not convenient place
for it, and adds much to the beauty of
holiness. And he that should neglect that
decency, and despising the Church should
offer up the publick worship in private,
should sin against that Law of God that
<hi>says, Cursed is he that having a better Lamb
in his flock, offers up to God a worse:</hi> For
God Almighty must be serv'd with the best
we have, otherwise we despise him. He
that can have a Church, and will offer up
the holy service in a worse place, let him
fear that curse: but if a Church cannot be
had, let him not fear or omit to offer up
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:99745:173"/>
the holy Service in a convenient place in
private, having a desire to the Church,
looking towards the Temple in prayer,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 28. for it will be accepted,
according to that equitable rule of S. <hi>Panl,

not according to that he hath not.</hi>

l. 8. c. 34. <q>If, O Bishop, or Priest,
you cannot go to the Church because of

               <head>Of the word Priest.</head>
               <p>THe Greek and Latin words which we
translate <hi>Priest,</hi> are derived from
words which signifie holy: and so the word
<hi>Priest</hi> according to the Etymologie, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
him whose meer charge and function
is about holy things: and therefore seems
to be a most proper word to him, who is
set apart to the holy publick service and
worship of God: especially when he is,
in the actual ministration of holy things.
Wherefore in the Rubricks, which direct
him in his ministration of these holy pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
services, the word <hi>Priest</hi> is most
commonly used, both by this Church and
all the Primitive Churches Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
as far as I can find, and I believe it can
scarce be found, that in any of the old
Greek or Latin Liturgies the word Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
was used in the Rubricks that direct
the order of service, but in the Greek,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and in the Latin <hi>Sacerdos,</hi> which
we in English translate <hi>Priest,</hi> which I
suppose to be done upon this ground,
that this word <hi>Priest</hi> is the most proper
for him that ministers, in the time of his
ministration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:99745:175"/>If it be objected, that according to the
usual acception of the word, it signifies
him that offers up a Sacrifice, and therefore
cannot be allowed to a Minister of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
who hath no Sacrifice to offer.</p>
               <p>It is answered: that the Ministers of the
Gospel, have Sacrifices to offer, S. <hi>Peter</hi>
1 ep. 2. 5. <hi>Ye are built up a spiritual house,
a holy Priesthood to offer up spiritual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
of prayer, praises, thanksgivings, &amp;c.
In respect of these the Ministers of the
Gospel may be safely in a metaphorical
sence called <hi>Priests;</hi> and in a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
manner than other Christians are; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are taken from among men to
offer up these Sacrifices for others. But
besides these spiritual Sacrifices mentioned,
the Ministers of the Gospel have another
Sacrifice to offer, <hi>viz.</hi> the unbloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
as it was anciently call'd, the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative
Sacrifice of the death of Christ,
which does as really and truly shew forth
<hi>the death of Christ,</hi> as those Sacrifices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law did foreshew it, and in respect
of this Sacrifice of the Eucharist, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
have usually call'd those that offer
it up, <hi>Priests.</hi> And if <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> was
called a Priest, (as he is often by S. <hi>Paul:</hi>
to the Hebrews) who yet had no other
Offering or Sacrifice that we read of, but
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:99745:175"/>
that of Bread and Wine, <hi>Gen. 14. He
brought forth Bread and Wine;</hi> and, <hi>or,</hi>
for (the Hebrew word bears both) he
was a <hi>Priest,</hi> that is, this act of his was an
act of Priesthood, for so must it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
he brought forth Bread and Wine;
for he was a <hi>Priest.</hi> And not thus, and he
was a <hi>Priest,</hi> and blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> (for
both in the Hebrew and Greek there is a
Full point after these words, <hi>and, or, for
he was a Priest.</hi>) If, I say, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi>
be frequently and truly call'd a <hi>Priest,</hi> who
had no other Offering, that we read of,
but <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> why may not they
whose Office is to bless the people as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck</hi>
did, and besides that to offer
that holy Bread and Wine, the Body and
Blood of Christ, of which, his Bread and
wine, at the most, was but a type, be as
truly and without offence called <hi>Priests</hi>
also?</p>
               <p>If it be again objected, that the word
<hi>Priest</hi> is a Jewish name, and therefore not
to be used by Christians.</p>
               <p>1. It is answered, first, that not every
thing that was Jewish is become unlawful
for Christians to use. I find indeed that
those things amongst the Jews that were
shadows of things to come, are abolished
now that Christ is come, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16, 17.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:99745:176"/>
and therefore to use them, as still necessary
and obliging to performance, is unlawful
under the Gospel, for it is virtually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Christ to be come, <hi>Gal. 5. 3. An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling
our selves again in the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
from which Christ hath set us free,
Col.</hi> 2. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians</hi>
there, that he was <hi>afraid of them</hi>
for their superstitious observation of
Sabbaths which were shadows of things to
come: and in that Chapter to the <hi>Galat.</hi>
he does denounce damnation to them that
<hi>entangle themselves again in that yoke of
bondage,</hi> v.2. But that other things, rites
or usages of the Jews, which were no such
shadows, should be unlawful to Christians
if they were used without such an opinion
of necessity, as we formerly spake of; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perswade my self can ever be proved
by either direct Scripture, or necessary
inference from it. It will not therefore
follow, that the name of <hi>Priest,</hi> (which
is no shadow of things to come) though
it were Jewish, would become unlawful
to Christians.</p>
               <p>2. The names of those rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which were most Jewish, and are
grown damnable to Christians, may still be
lawfully used by Christians in a spiritual
and refined sence. S. <hi>Paul</hi> who tells that the
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:99745:176"/>
Circumcision of the Jews is become so
unlawful, that if it be used by Christians
(with an opinion of the necessity afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said)
it forfeits all their hopes of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. uses the word
Circumcision frequently, particularly in
that very Chapter, Ver. 11. <hi>In whom ye</hi>
Christians, <hi>are circumcised,</hi> See p. 149.</p>
               <p>3. The word Priest is not a Jewish
name, that is, not peculiar to the Jewish
Ministery. For <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> who was
not of <hi>Aarons</hi> Order or Priesthood, is
called a <hi>Priest</hi> by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrews
often: and our Saviour is a <hi>Priest</hi> after the
Order of <hi>Melchisedeck:</hi> and the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Gospel</hi> are call'd <hi>Priests</hi> by the
Prophet <hi>Esay 66. 21. Ier.</hi> 33. 17. where
they prophesie of the times of the Gospel,
as will appear by the Context, and ancient
Exposition. Lastly, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he
defines a Minister of the Gospel, as well
as of the Law, as hath been proved (p. 78.
of the <hi>Ration.</hi>) calls him Priest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. &amp;
8. Chap. To sum up all then; That name
which was not Jewish but common to
others; that name which was frequently
and constantly used by Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
that name, by which the Prophets
foretell that the Ministers of the Gospel
shall be called: Lastly, that name by which
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:99745:177"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them, may not only lawfully,
but safely, without any just ground of
offence to sober men, be used still by
Christians, as a fit name for the Ministers
of the Gospel: and so they may be still
called, as they are by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in her Rubrick, <hi>Priests.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Pag. 236. lin. 13. Add this.</q>
               <p>This Sacrament should be received fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
3. Counc. of <hi>Carthag.</hi> can. 29. And
so was the practice of the universal Church,
sayes S. <hi>Aug. Epist.</hi> 118. which is authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
enough, (in things of this nature,
namely, circumstances of time, &amp;c.) to
satisfie any that do not love contention,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. Yet it will not be amiss in
a word to shew the reasonableness of this
Catholick usage. And the first reason
may be this, because our minds are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
our devotion quickest, and so we fittest
to perform this most high service, when
we are are in our Virgin spittle, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
expresses it. A Second is this; it
is for the honour of so high a Sacrament,
that the precious body of Christ should
first enter into the Christians mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any other meat. S. <hi>Aug. Ep.</hi> 118.
<q>It is true, that our Saviour gave it to
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:99745:177"/>
his Disciples after Supper; but dare any
man quarrel the universal Church of
Christ, for receiving it fasting? This
also pleased the holy Ghost, that, for the
honour of so great a Sacrament, the
body of Christ should first enter into
the Christians mouth, before all other
meats. Neither, because our Saviour
gave it to his Disciples after Supper,
will it necessarily follow that we should
receive it so, mingling the Sacrament
with our other meats: a thing which the
Apostle seems to reprehend, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
there was a special reason for our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
doing so, his Supper was to succeed
immediately to the Passeover; and
therefore as soon as that was over, he
instituted his; and that he might the more
deeply imprint the excellency of this
mystery into the minds and hearts of his
Disciples, he would give it them the last
thing he did, before he went from them
to his Passion, knowing that dying mens
words move much: but he no where ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
what hour and time it should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
be received; but left that to be
ordered by them that were after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
to settle the Churches, namely,
the Apostles, and accordingly we find
S. <hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi> 11. rectifying some abuses,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:99745:178"/>
and prescribing some rules for the better
ordering of some Rites and Ceremonies
about the Sacrament, and promising
when he should come, to settle an order
for the rest, verse 34. from whom
S. <hi>Aug.</hi> seems to think that the Catholick
Church received this custom of receiving
the Sacrament fasting, Ep. 118.</q>

               <p>THe <hi>PSALMS</hi> in our English

of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, and
used in Churches till the New Translation
under <hi>King Iames,</hi>) though a much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Translation from the former in other
parts, yet retains the same Psalms without
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:99745:178"/>
any alteration. And therefore whereas
it hath Notes upon all the rest of the Books
both of the Old and New Testament, it
hath none at all upon the Psalms, not so
much as references to parallel places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reason</hi> hereof I suppose was to
avoid offending the people, who were used
to that Translation, and to whom the
Psalms were more familiar than any other
part of the Bible. As S. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Latin Bible retains the Psalms
of the Old Latin Translation out of the
Septuagint, though himself also had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
them <hi>juxta Hebraicam Veritatem,</hi>
as they are extant at the end of the Eighth
Tome of his works.</p>
               <p>This Our Translation was doubtless out
of the Hebrew. And though it tyes not it
self so strictly to the Letter and words of
the Hebrew as the Later Translations
would seem to do, but takes the Liberty
to vary a little for the smoothing of the
Language: yet it holds to the sence and
scope more than some suppose it doth, and
many times much more than those who
would seem to stick so close to the Letter.</p>
               <p>Some have had a conceit that this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
was out of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> or (which
is all one in effect) out of the <hi>Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi>
But the Contrary is evident and will
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:99745:179"/>
appear to any man that shall compare them
but in any one Psalm.</p>
               <p>In one Case indeed this Translation may
seem to follow the LXX and Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
against the Hebrew, namely, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of some words or Clauses, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
whole Verses, not found in the
Hebrew. But this Case excepted, where
it once agrees with the LXX and Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Latin against the Hebrew, it forty
times agrees with the Hebrew against
them.</p>
               <p>And for these Additions. 1. They were
made to Satisfie them who had missed
those words, or Sentences in the former
English Translations, finding them in
the Greek or Latin. See the Preface to
the English Bible in folio 1540.</p>
               <p>2. In that Edition 1540. they were put in
a different Character from the rest, and
in some Later Editions between two
hooks [] of which there are even still
some remainders, though now for the

I conceive our Translation to agree very
well both with the sence and letter of the
Hebrew. Neither doth it go alone: but
so translated both <hi>Pagnin</hi> a little before,
and <hi>Castellio</hi> since; who both keep as close
to the sence of the Hebrew, and <hi>Pagnin</hi>
to the letter also, as any that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>

            <head>To your Liturgical Demands I
make as good Return to you
as I am able, on this wise.</head>
            <p>In the Preface, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>COMMEMORATIONS</hi> were
the recital of the Names of famous Martyrs
and Confessors, Patriarchs, Bishops, Kings,
Great Orthodox Writers, Munificent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors:
which recitation at the Altar
took up much time, and those Names were
anciently wont to be read out of <hi>DIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TYCHS,</hi>
or Folded Tables; and tedious
quarrels have been anciently about dispun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
some Names out of the <hi>DIPTYCHS,</hi>
which have run into schisms.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>SYNODALS</hi> were Synodical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
such as are in <hi>Linwood,</hi> wont to
be read on Sundayes in time of Service, to
the great waste of time; and you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that our Canons of <hi>Anno</hi> 1604.
are appointed to be read at least once a
year in all Churches.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>PYE,</hi> I should suppose did come
from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. A Table of
Order, how things should be digested and
performed. But the Latin word is <hi>Pica,</hi>
which perhaps came from the ignorance of
<pb facs="tcp:99745:193"/>
Friers, who have thrust in many barbarous
words into Liturgies. I have heard some
say, it came from <hi>Litera Picata,</hi> a great
black Letter in the beginning of some new
order in the Prayer, and among the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that term is still used, the <hi>Pica Letter,</hi>
as I am informed.</p>
            <p>4. No wonder the <hi>VSE of SARVM,
YORK, LINCOLN, HEREFORD,
BANGOR</hi> are mentioned. For the Missals
and Breviaries of the Roman Church were
of divers models in several Countries and
several Diocesses. The <hi>Trident. Council</hi>
first endeavored to bring them all into one
shape, yet that order was not obeyed till
<hi>Anno</hi> 1568. under <hi>Pope Pius the Vth,</hi> yet
is not observed to this day; the Spaniards
in some places keeping the <hi>Mozarabique</hi>
Form, the <hi>Premonstratenses</hi> another, and
sundry besides. Nay, that Church hath
altered the Breviaries of <hi>Pius the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and
new Corrections have come forth under
<hi>Clement the VIII.</hi> 1598. and what have
been done since I know not. But why the use
of those five Churches? Perhaps that was
accidental, that the diversities of them were
more signal than others. (Some Historians
mention <hi>Osmundus</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>
and Chancellor for the Compiler of the <hi>Vse
of Sarum,</hi> about <hi>Anno</hi> 1070. or after) yet
<pb facs="tcp:99745:194"/>
since we read of no Use of <hi>Canterbury, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Ely,</hi> perhaps those places observed
the true Roman Breviaries, and the other
five mentioned, were discrepant Dialects
from the Original Breviary. However they
are called <hi>Vses</hi> and <hi>Customes,</hi> not <hi>Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
from Provincial Synods.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>The DIVISION of the whole Bible</hi>
into several Sections hath varied infinitely:
It was a long time parted into Titles; for
S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 355. for S. <hi>Mark.</hi> 335. for S.
<hi>Luke.</hi> 343. S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 332, &amp;c. See for this
<hi>Sixt. Senenf. l. 3. p.</hi> 158. Some have
thought that the present distinction of
Chapters generally now used, was by <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franc</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> 1060. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
sooner you shall not meet with it;
and after him all Commentators and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
use it; and Rabbi <hi>Kimchi</hi> and other
Learned Jews from that time, usurp the
same partition of Chapters on the Old
Testament: you may read in <hi>Goodwin,</hi> that
<hi>Lanfranc</hi> took much care to procure sound
and uncorrupt Copies of the Bible. Look
more for this in <hi>Possevines Bibliotheca.</hi>
Yet (according to <hi>Io. Bale) Steph. Lancton</hi>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> divided the
Bible into Chapters about <hi>Anno</hi> 1224. But
for the deduction of <hi>all Chapters into Verses</hi>
I am sure it was the work of <hi>Robert Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens,
<pb facs="tcp:99745:194"/>
Anno</hi> 1550. so his son <hi>Henry Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>
testifies in his Epistle before the
<hi>Greek Concordance.</hi> See also Sir <hi>Henry
Spelman Gloss. in Verb. Heptaticus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>EMBER-WEEKS.</hi> The reason of
the name is very uncertain. Some derive
<hi>Ember</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>b</hi> was interposed as
from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. As
Lent, a Fast of weeks, so these, a Fast of
daies. I believe it a Saxon word. Surely I
have read it in <hi>Gower</hi> or <hi>Chaucer,</hi> our old
Poets. Some think it betokens Fasting. But
after my small skill in Saxon Terms, <hi>Em</hi> is
a brother, <hi>Bert</hi> is noble or very worthy;
this put together is <hi>Hebdomada Embert,</hi> the
week of the noble or worthy brothers. But
look better into it.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>AFALDISTORY,</hi> is the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Seat or Throne within the Chancel, for
in the barbarous Language of that middle
age, <hi>Falda</hi> is a place shut up, a Fold;
and <hi>Faldistorium,</hi> is <hi>Cathedra Episcopi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trasepta
Cancelli;</hi> so I find in many, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in Sir <hi>Hen. Spelman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. What should a <hi>CANTICLE</hi> be but
the praise of God, not only to be read,
but sometimes to be sung. By the Order
of the <hi>Codex Canonum, Can.</hi> 121. the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean</hi>
Fathers appointed an Hymn or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
interserted between the Lessons, <hi>Te
Deum, Magnificat, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99745:195"/>9. One direct answer cannot be rendred
what <hi>PRIESTS</hi> and <hi>CLERKS</hi> together
are. 1. The chief Rector of a Parish (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Cardinal Priest of old, <hi>quia incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatus
in Beneficio</hi>) was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the
rest under him <hi>his Clerks.</hi> 2. Where there
were <hi>Cantores,</hi> the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Council,
Can. 119. called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who
only till our Reformation were to sing
in the Church, and none else; these were
the Priest <hi>his Clerks.</hi> 3. Where there
were Chantries, as there were in most
Churches of <hi>England,</hi> their assisting the
Rector of the Church, made up that form
of speech, <hi>The Priest and Clerks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. You tell me News, that a <hi>Latin</hi>
Copy of our Service-book, printed 2. <hi>Eliz.</hi>
hath in it an Office for a <hi>Communion</hi> at bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
(<hi>Celebratio Coenae Domini in Funebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
&amp;c.) It is a Translation of some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
pen, not licensed by Authority, as I
guess; Communions by the direction of
our Service are joyned with Morning Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
burials are mostly in the Afternoon.
<hi>Offertories</hi> at Burials did last to be frequent
(if they were considerable Funerals) to
the middle of King <hi>Iames</hi> his Reign, the
Ministers of Parishes keeping up the profit
of oblations as long as they could; and
these Offertories at Funerals are spoken
<pb facs="tcp:99745:195"/>
of in the first Liturgy of King <hi>Edward
the VI.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is as much as comes into my head
at present, enquire of them that are more
skilful, but none shall be more willing to
observe you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <q>IN the Name of <hi>Richard Smith</hi> of
<hi>Peer-tree</hi> in the County of <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Esquire, Right Reverend Father in
God, I present unto you the state of the
Village of <hi>Weston,</hi> and the Hamlets,
<hi>Itchin, Wolston, Ridgeway,</hi> and the part
of <hi>Bittern</hi> Mannor (being all of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
of S. <hi>Maries,</hi> near <hi>Southampton</hi> in
the Diocess of <hi>Winton</hi>) as well in his
own, as in the name of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the said Village, Hamlets, &amp;c.
wherein are many Housholds, and much
people of all sorts, who not only dwell
far from the Church, but are also divided
from the same by the great River of <hi>Itchin,</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99745:199"/>
where the passage is very broad, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
dangerous; and very many times
on the days appointed for Common-Prayer,
and that Service of God, so
tempestuous, as the River cannot be
pass'd; and so the people go not over
at all, or if any do, yet they both go and
return back in great danger, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not the same day. Besides, in the
fairest weather, at their return from
Church, they press so thick into the Boat
for haste home, that often it proves dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and ever fearful, especially to
women with child, old, impotent, sickly
people, and to young children; many
times also they are forced to baptize
their children in private Houses, the
water not being passable; and when they
lye sick, they are without comfort to
their souls, and dye without any Ghostly
advice or counsel; their own Minister
not being able to visit them, by reason
of the roughness of the water, and other
Ministers being some miles off remote
from them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And thus much formerly having been
presented to your Predecessor, he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
gave leave to the said <hi>Richard
Smith</hi> to erect a Chappel on the East-side
of the said River, at the only proper

Cost and Charges of him the said <hi>Richard
Smith:</hi> which Chappel being now finish'd
with intent and purpose that it may be
dedicated to the worship of God; &amp; that
his Holy and Blessed Name might there be
honour'd and called upon, by the said <hi>R.
Smith</hi> his Family, and the Inhabitants
aforesaid, who cannot without great
danger pass over unto their Parish
Church, I, in the name of the said <hi>Richard
Smith,</hi> and in the names of them all, do
promise hereafter to refuse and renounce
to put this Chappel, or any part of it,
to any prophane or common use whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and desire it may be dedicated
and consecrated wholly and only to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
uses, for the Glory of God, and
the Salvation of our Souls.</q>

as Gods Minister, the Bishop and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of this Diocess, in Gods stead to
accept of this his Free-will offering; and
to decree this <hi>Chappel</hi> to be severed from
all common and profane uses, and so to
sever it: as also by the Word of God
and Prayer, and other Spiritual and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

Place, even as Gods House, and use it
accordingly; and that we will from time

be, see it conveniently repair'd, and

ought to be; And that we will procure
us some sufficient Clerk, being in the

MOst glorious God, the Heaven is
thy Throne, and the Earth is thy
Footstool; what house then can be built
for thee, or what place is there that thou
canst rest in? Howbeit we are taught by
thy Holy Word, that thy will is not to dwell
in the dark Cloud, but that thy delight
hath been ever with the Sons of Men; so
that in any place whatsoever, where two
or three are gathered together in thy
name, thou art in the midst of them; But
specially in such places as are set apart and
sanctified to thy name, and to the memory
of it, there thou hast said, thou wilt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
thy gracious Presence after a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner, and come to us and bless us.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in all Ages of the world, thy
Servants have separated certain places
from all prophane and common uses, and
hallow'd unto thy Divine Worship and
Service, either by inspiration of thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Spirit, or by express Commandment
from thine own mouth.</p>
            <p>By inspiration of thy holy Spirit. So
didst thou put into the heart of thy Holy
Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> to erect a stone in <hi>Bethel</hi>
to be an house to thee, which act of his
thou didst call for, and highly allow of.</p>
            <p>By express Commandme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t from thine
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99745:201"/>
own mouth. So did <hi>Moses</hi> make thee the
Tabernacle of the Congregation in the
Desert, which thou didst honour by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
it with a Cloud, and filling it with
thy Glory.</p>
            <p>And after, when it came into the heart
of thy servant <hi>David</hi> to think it was in no
wise fitting that himself should dwell in an
house of Cedar, and the Ark of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
but in a Tabernacle, thou didst testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
with thine own mouth, that in that
<hi>David</hi> was so minded to build a House to
thy Name, it was well done of him, to be
so minded, though he built it not.</p>
            <p>The material Furniture for which house
though his Father plentifully prepared, yet
<hi>Solomon</hi> his Son built it and brought it to
perfection. To which House thou went
pleased visibly to send fire from Heaven to
consume the Sacrifice, and to fill it with
the Glory of thy presence before all the
people.</p>
            <p>And after, when for the sins of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that Temple was destroyed, thou didst
by thy Prophets, <hi>Aggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary</hi> (by
shewing how inconvenient it was that they
should dwell in cieled houses, and let thy
house lye waste) stir up the spirit of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robabel,</hi>
to build thee the second Temple
anew: which second House likewise by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99745:202"/>
the fulness of the Glory of thy presence,
thou didst shew thy self to like and allow of.</p>
            <p>Neither only wert thou well pleased
with such as did build thee these Temples,
but even with such of the people after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
as being moved with zeal added
unto their Temple, their <hi>Mother Church,</hi>
lesser places of prayer, by the names of
Synagogues, in every Town throughout
the Land; for the Tribes to ascend up to
worship thee, to learn thy holy will and to
do it. Which very Act of the Centurion,
to build thy people a Synagogue, thou didst
well approve and commend in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>And by the bodily presence of thy Son
our Saviour at the feast of the Dedication,
testified by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> didst really well allow
of, and do honour to such devout Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
services, as we are now about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
            <p>Which also by thy holy Word hast
taught us, that thine Apostles themselves,
and the Christians in their time, as they
had houses to eat and drink in; so had they
also where the whole Congregation of the
Faithful came together in one place, which
they expressly called Gods Church, and
would not have it despised, nor abused,
nor eaten nor drunken in, but had in
great Reverence, being the very place of
their holy Assemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99745:202"/>
By whose godly examples the Christians
in all Ages successively have erected and
consecrated sundry godly houses, for the
Celebration of Divine Service and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
(Monuments of their Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
as our eyes see this day.</p>
            <p>We then as Fellow-Citizens with the
Saints and of the Houshold of God, being
built upon the Foundation of the Apostles
and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being
the head corner-stone, walking in the steps
of their most holy Faith, and ensuing the
examples of these thy Patriarchs, Prophets,
and Apostles have together with them done
the same work (I say) in building and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
this house, as an habitation for
thee, and a place for us to assemble and
meet together for the observation of thy
Divine Worship, invocation of thy Name,
reading, preaching &amp; hearing thy most holy
Word, administring thy most holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
&amp; above all in thy most holy place,
the very gate of Heaven upon earth, as <hi>Iacob</hi>
nam'd it, to do the work of Heaven; to set
forth thy most worthy praise, to laud and
magnifie thy most glorious Majesty, for all
thy goodness to all men; especially to us of
the Houshold of Faith. Accept therefore we
beseech thee, most gracious Father, of this
our bounden duty and service; accept this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99745:203"/>
for thine house; and because thine Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
becomes thine house for ever, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this house with thy gracious presence,
which is erected to the honour of thy most
glorious Name.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, arise O Lord, and come
into this place of thy rest, thou and the
ark of thy strength; Let thine eye be open
towards this House day and night; Let
thine ears be ready towards the Prayers of
thy children, which they shall make unto
thee in this place, and let thine heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to dwell here perpetually: And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thy servants shall make to thee their
petitions in this House, either to bestow
thy good graces, and blessings upon them,
or to remove thy punishments &amp; judgments
from them; hear them from Heaven thy
dwelling place, the Throne of the glory of
thy Kingdom, and when thou hearest have
mercy; and grant, O Lord, we beseech thee,
that here and elsewhere thy Priests may be
cloathed with Righteousness, and thy Saints
rejoyce in thy Salvation.</p>
            <p>And whereas both in the Old and New
Testament thou hast consecrated the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
out and building of a material
Church, to such an excellent Mystery, that
in it is signified and presented the fruition
of the joy of thy Heavenly Kingdom, we
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99745:203"/>
beseech thee that, in this material Temple
made with hands, we may so serve and
please thee in all holy Exercises of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Christian Religion, that in the
end we may come to that thy Temple on
high, even to the holy places, made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hands, whose Builder and Maker is
God; so as when we shall cease to pray
to thee on Earth, we may with all those
that have in the like manner erected such
places to thy Name, and with all thy Saints
eternally praise thee in the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
for all thy goodness vouchsafed us
for a time here on earth, and laid up for us
there in thy Kingdom for ever and ever;
and that for thy dear Sons sake, our Blessed
Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BLessed Father, who hast promised in
thy holy Law, that in every place
where the remembrance of thy Name shall
be put, thou wilt come unto us and bless us;
according to that thy promise come unto us
and bless us, who put now upon this place
the memorial of thy Name, by dedicating it
wholly and only to thy Service and Worship.</p>
            <p>Blessed Saviour, who in the Gospel, with
thy bodily presence, didst honour and
adorn the Feast of the dedication of the
Temple; at this dedication of this Temple
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99745:204"/>
unto thee be present also, and accept, Good
Lord, and prosper the work of our hands.</p>
            <p>Blessed Spirit, without whom nothing
is holy, no person or place is sanctified
aright, send down upon this place thy
sanctifying power and grace, hallow it, and
make it to thee an holy habitation for ever.</p>
            <p>Blessed and glorious Trinity, by whose
Power, Wisdom and Love all things are
purged, lightened, and made perfect; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
us with thy Power, enlighten us with
thy Truth, perfect us with thy Grace, that
both here and elsewhere acknowledging
the glory of thy eternal Trinity, and in the
Power of thy Divine Majesty worshipping
the Unity, we may obtain to the fruition
of the glorious Godhead, Trinity in
Unity, and Unity in Trinity to be adored
for ever.</p>
            <p>God the Father, God the Son, and God

            <p>Grant as this Chappel is separated from
all other common and profane uses, and
dedicated to those that be sacred only, so
may all those be that enter into it.</p>
            <p>Grant that all wandring thoughts, all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and worldly imaginations, may be far
from them, and all godly and spiritual cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
may come in their place, and may
be daily renew'd and grow in them.</p>
            <p>Grant that those thy servants that shall
come into this thy holy Temple, may them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
be made the Temples of the Holy
Ghost, eschewing all things contrary to
their profession, and following all such
things as are agreeable to the same.</p>
            <p>When they pray, that their prayers may
ascend up into Heaven into thy presence, as
the Incense; and the lifting up of their
hands be as the morning sacrifice; purifie
their hearts, and grant them their hearts
desire, sanctifie their spirits, and fulfil all
their minds, that what they faithfully ask,
they may effectually obtain the same.</p>
            <p>When they offer, that their Oblation
and Alms may come up as a Memorial be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99745:206"/>
thee, and they find and feel that with
such Sacrifices thou art well-pleased.</p>
            <p>When they sing, that their souls may be
satisfied as with marrow, and fatness, when
their mouth praiseth thee with joyful lips.</p>
            <p>When they hear, that they hear not as
the word of man, but as indeed it is the
Word of God, and not be idle Hearers,
but Doers of the same.</p>

            <p>O Lord God, mighty and glorious
and of incomprehensible Majesty,
thou fillest Heaven and earth with the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of thy presence, and canst not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
within any the largest compass, much
less within the narrow walls of this Room;
yet forasmuch as thou hast been pleased to
command in thy holy Law, that we should
put the Remembrance of thy Name upon
places, and in every such place thou wilt
come to us and bless us; we are here now
assembled to put thy name upon this place,
and the Memorial of it, to make it thy
house, to devote and dedicate it for ever
unto thee, utterly separating it from all
worldly uses, and wholly and only conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
it to the invocation of thy glorious
Name, wherein supplications and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
may be made for all men; thy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Word may be read, preached and
heard, the Holy Sacraments, (the Laver
of Regeneration, and the Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the precious death of thy dear Son)
may be administred; thy Praise celebrated
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99745:207"/>
and sounded forth, thy people blessed by
putting thy Name upon them; we (poor
and miserable creatures as we are) be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unfit, and utterly unworthy to
appoint any earthly thing to so great a
God; And I the least of all thy servants,
no ways meet to appear before thee in so
honourable a service; yet being thou hast
oft heretofore been pleased to accept such
poor offerings from sinful men, most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
we beseech thee, forgiving our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
sins, and making us worthy by count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us so, to vouchsafe to be present here
among us in this religious action, and what
we sincerely offer graciously to accept at
our hands, to receive the prayers of us and
all others, who either now or hereafter
entring into this place, by us hallowed,
shall call upon thee; And give us all grace
when we shall come into the house of God,
we may look to our feet, knowing that
the place we stand on is holy ground, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hither clean thoughts, and undefiled
bodies, that we may wash both our hearts
and hands in innocency, and so compass
thine Altar.</p>

that whatsoever prayer in this sacred place
shall be made according to thy will, may
be accepted by thy gracious favour, and

Esquire, R. Reverend Father in God, I
present unto you the state of the Village
<hi>of Weston,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ut prius, usque ad, the River
cannot be passed,</hi> whereby it often cometh
to pass that they have been constrain'd to
bury their dead in the open fields, the
water not being passable, or if they durst
venture over, yet the dead body was
follow'd with so little Company, as was
no way seemly.</q>

               <q>And thus much formerly having been
presented to your Predecessor, the R. R.
F. in God, <hi>Iames</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Winton;</hi>
and Petition to him made to give and to
grant leave unto the said <hi>Richard Smith,</hi>
to enclose a piece of ground for a burial
place on the East side of the said River,
he favourably gave licence and granted
power unto the said <hi>Richard Smith</hi> so to
do, as may appear by an instrument un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Episcopal Seal, bearing date the
23. of <hi>February</hi> in the year of our Lord
God according to the Computation of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> 1617.</q>

Suiters to your Lordship, as Gods
Minister, the Bishop and Ordinary of
this Diocess, in Gods stead to accept this
his free-will offering, and to decree this
ground severed from all former common
and profane uses, and to sever it, as by
the Word of God and prayer, and other
special Religious duties to dedicate and
consecrate it to be a Coemeterie or place
of Christian burial, as aforesaid; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their bodies may be laid up until the
day of the general Resurrection; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
that they will ever so hold it for
holy ground, and use it accordingly,
applying it to no other use, but that only,
and that they will from time to time, and

it conveniently repair'd and fenc'd in

            <p>Tum Dominus Episcopus in genua ibi
submissus precatur.</p>
            <p>O Lord God, thou hast been pleased to
teach us in thy holy Word, as to put
a difference between the soul of a Beast,
and the spirit of a Man; for the soul of a
Beast goes down to the earth from whence
it came, and the spirit of man returneth
unto God that gave it; so to make diverse
accompts of the Bodies of Mankind and the
Bodies of other living Creatures; in so
much as the Body of <hi>Adam</hi> was resolved
on, and afterwards the workmanship of
thine own hands, and endued with a soul
from thine own breath: But much more
since the second <hi>Adam,</hi> thy blessed Son, by
taking upon him our nature, exalted this
flesh of ours to be flesh of his flesh, whose
flesh thou sufferedst not to see Corruption;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99745:218"/>
so that the Body returns to the earth, and
the soul to him that gave it. It shall from
thence return again, it is but a rest, and a
rest in hope (as saith the Psalmist) for it is
a righteous thing with God that the Body
which was partaker with the soul both in
doing and suffering, should be rais'd again
from the Earth to be partaker also with
the soul of the reward, or punishment
which God in Mercy or Justice shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
not to one of them alone, but joyntly
to them both.</p>
            <p>There being then so great difference, it
is not thy will, O Lord, that our Bodies
should be cast out as the Bodies of Beasts
to become dung for the earth, or our bones
lye scatter'd abroad to the sight of the Sun;
But when thy servants are gathered to their
Fathers, their Bodies should be decently
and seemly laid up in the bosom of the Earth
from whence they were taken.</p>
            <p>Neither is it thy pleasure, O Lord, that
they should be buried as an Ass in the open
fields, but in a place chosen and set apart for
that purpose.</p>
            <p>For even so from the Beginning we find
the holy Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> (the Father
of the faithful) would not bury his dead
in the common fields; nay nor amongst
the Bodies of Hethites who were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99745:219"/>
men, but purchased a burial place for
himself in the plain of <hi>Mamre</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as it were the Church-Yard of the
Patriarchs, therein they laid the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, of himself, his
son <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> his wife; after them
<hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> were buried there.</p>
            <p>After this manner did the Patriarchs in
old time, who trusted in God, sever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
places for Burial: whose children
we are so long as we do their works, and
walk in the steps of their most holy Faith.</p>
            <p>Ensuing then the steps of the Faith of
our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> we for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
have made choise of the very same
place, wherein we now are; that it may be
as the Cave of <hi>Mamre,</hi> even Gods store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
for the Bodies of such our Brethren
and Sisters to be laid up in, as he shall ordain
there to be interred; there to rest in the
sleep of peace till the last Trump shall awake
them; for they shall awake and rise up
that sleep in the dust; for thy dew shall be
as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall
yield forth her dead.</p>
            <p>We beseech thee good Lord to accept
this work of ours in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>LOrd God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
who because thou art the God,
not of the dead, but of the Living, shewest
hereby that they are living and not dead,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99745:221"/>
and that with thee do live the spirits of all
them that dye in the Lord, and in whom
the Souls of them that are Elect after they
be delivered from the burden of this flesh,
be in joy and felicity; thou hast said thou
wilt turn men into small dust, and after that
wilt say, Return again you Children of men:
Thou art the God of Truth, and hast said
it; thou art the God of power and might,
and wilt do it; by that power whereby
thou art able to subdue all things unto
thy self, and bring to pass whatsoever
pleaseth thee in Heaven and Earth, with
whom nothing is impossible.</p>
            <p>Lord Jesu Christ, who art the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and the Life, in whom if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
though we be dead yet shall we live;
who by thy death hast overcome death,
and by thy rising again hast opened to us
the Gate of everlasting life, who shalt
send thine Angels and gather the bodies of
thine Elect from all the Ends of the Earth,
and especially those who by a mystical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are flesh of thy flesh, and in whose
hearts thou hast dwelt by Faith; we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseech thee for them, whose bodies
shall in this place be gathered to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they may rest in this hope of
Resurrection to eternal life through thee,
O blessed Lord God, who shalt change
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99745:222"/>
their vile bodies, that they may be like thy
Glorious body according to the mighty
working whereby thou art able to bring
all things, even death and all into subjection
to thy self.</p>
            <p>Holy and blessed Spirit, the Lord and
giver of life, whose Temples the bodies
of thy Servants are, by thy sanctifying
Grace dwelling in them; we verily trust
that their bodies that have been thy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and those hearts in which Christ hath
dwelt by Faith, shall not ever dwell in
corruption, but that as by thy sending forth
thy Breath at first we received our Being,
Motion, and Life in the beginning of the
Creation, so at the last by the same Spirit
sending forth the same breath in the end of
the Consummation, Life, Being and Mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall be restored us again; so that after
our dissolution, as thou didst shew thy
holy Prophet, the dry bones shall come
together again, Bone to his Bone, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
and Flesh shall come upon them, and
thou shalt cause thy Breath to enter into
them, and we shall live; and this Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall put on Incorruption, and this
Mortal shall put on Immortality.</p>
            <p>God the Father, God the Son, and God
the Holy Ghost, accept, sanctifie and bless
this place to that end whereunto according
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99745:222"/>
to thine own Ordinance we have ordain'd
it, even to bestow the Bodies of thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in, till, the number of thine Elect
being accomplished, they with us, and we
with them, and with all other departed in
the true Faith of thy Holy Name, shall have
our consummation and Bliss both in Body
and Soul in thy eternal &amp; everlasting glory.</p>
            <p>Blessed Saviour, that didst for this end
dye and rise again, that thou mightest be
Lord both of the Living and the Dead,
whether we live or die thou art our Lord,
and we are thine; living or dying we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
our selves unto thee, have mercy
upon us, and keep us thine for evermore.</p>
