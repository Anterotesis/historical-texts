            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT is now more than four years since I (being then elder than <hi>Barzillai</hi> was, when he made the like request to King <hi>David)</hi> did beg and obtain leave from the King my Gracious Lord and Master to quit my personal attendance on him at the Court in Council, and to retire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countrey, and to serve him there, by praying for him without distraction, or interruption; remembring that old and wise saying,

and noise of all Secular Affairs, to mind nothing else (besides the necessary care of mine own Diocese) but the making my self ready by God's gracious assistance for a quiet and a comfortable <hi>Exit</hi> out of this evil and troublesome World. The near approach whereof (by reason of my great Age) you do well to put me in mind of and I thank you for it, though you do it in such a manner as seems to imply, that you think me to have more need of such a <hi>Memento</hi> than one of my Age ought to have.</p>
                  <p>But then being my <hi>unfeigned well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willer</hi> (as in the subscription of your Address to me you tell me you are) why do you endeavour so unseasonably to withdraw me from so necessary a work (especially supposing me to have so little time left for the doing of it) which you do, <hi>first,</hi> by calling me to an Account for what I writ in a Letter above 18 years ago, in which you say there are <hi>many mistakes in matter of fact,</hi> which (if I say nothing to the contrary) will be taken for granted. And <hi>secondly,</hi> by your so
<pb facs="tcp:94113:4"/>
earnestly pressing me as well as the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> (to whom you make the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Address also) to tell you what we think of that which you call the <hi>Onely true way of Concord of all Christian Churches,</hi> and if upon Perusal thereof we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced it is so, <hi>to see that Prejudice resist not,</hi> but that we would acknowledge and confess it to be so. But this you know cannot be done without reading over and considering and examining that whole Book of yours; nor consequently by me without taking off my thoughts from minding so much, as otherwise I might do that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num necessarium</hi> which you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise me to think on, and which indeed is a much more proper employment for one so near the grave as I am, than to engage or to be engaged to Apologize for mine own, or to Censure other mens Writings.</p>
                  <p>Yet rather than to seem by my silence to acknowledge what you charge me with to be true, which I cannot without being injurious to truth it self as well as to mine own reputation; I will in the first place vindicate my self from having made so
<pb facs="tcp:94113:5"/>
many, or any one so gross a mistake in matter of fact, as you say there are in my aforesaid Letter. And then, if I live long enough and have time enough to spare from better and more necessary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I will tell you freely and plainly what I think of the Book you address to the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and me; I mean whether what you promise in the Title-page of it be performed in it. In the mean time wishing you <hi>Saniorem mentem in saniori cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> I rest (as much as the peace and safety of the Church will permit me to be)</p>

                  <p>NExt to the carrying of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God out of the World with him, I think the next care every man ought to have, is to leave a good name or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of himself in the World behind him; especially if he be or have been a man of any Eminency of Place, or Office, or Order, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Church, or State; because, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever aspersions of infamy are cast upon such mens persons, do commonly in vulgar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction reflect on their Office, and Order also, and are often by the malignancy of the Authours of them intended to do so. And therefore though we must (if it be God's will it should be so) be content, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, to run the race that is set before us,
<pb facs="tcp:94113:6"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whether we be well or ill spoken of; yet we may and ought, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did (and did it often) doe what we can to vindicate our personal Credit and Reputation also; especially when the Credit and Reputation of our Office, or Order, is concerned in it; and more especially when we are ill spoken of publickly, and in Print, and by one that is a professed Adversary to the Church and Order whereof we are, as well as to our selves; most especially if he be the Head, or one of the heads of a very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Party, and therefore likely to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in what he says or writes of or against any one (though never so false and injurious) by many too credulous though well meaning men, if he be not publickly contradicted and confuted. This therefore being my very case in all the aforesaid particular circumstances of it; I am constrained (weak, and feeble, and old, as I am, drawing near the end of the 85th year of my age) to enter into the Lists with this great <hi>Goliah</hi> or Champion of the Non-conformists; not to defend our Church against him or them; that is too great a work for my undertaking, at this
<pb facs="tcp:94113:6"/>
time of day, my night being so near, when no man can work; and that work being done (thanks be to God) and done better al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready than I could have done it (when I was much more able than I now am:) but onely to vindicate my self, together with the honour of the Order whereof I am (though I confess myself unworthy to be so) from being guilty of such crimes, and reproaches, as it hath pleased Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to lay unto my charge; which may perhaps, after I am gone, be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be true, if they be not proved to be false before I go from hence and be no more seen. And this I had done sooner, had not some of my learned Friends and Brethren ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised me not to take notice of any thing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had said of me; because (as they said) his tongue is no slander, nor his pen neither; especially when he whets either the one or the other against Bishops; and because I had already long ago, both answered and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the Objections he had then, or hath since made against the truth of what I had said of him in relation to the Conference at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and of the justice of what I had done to him when I was Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:94113:7"/>
is now above <hi>20</hi> years ago. These perswasions, and reasons, together with the consideration of the little time I had left for better employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prevaild with me to lay aside some few Observations and Animadversions I had begun to make upon some particulars relating to me in some of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s late Writings; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till some other of my Learned and Reverend Brethren did very lately let me know, that in their opinion, I was obliged for the Churches sake, as well as for mine own, not to suffer it to be said hereafter, that a Bishop of the Church of <hi>England</hi> having been told, and told in Print, that he was a Preacher of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, and consequently a liar in the pulpit, a slanderer of all the Non-conformists, nay a blasphemer, or a defier not of Humanity onely, but of the Deity it self, had nothing to say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did say nothing, to the contrary; though I could have replied that I thought, and some others of my Reverend Brethren thought also, that the Letter I had written and printed so long ago, with the Testimony annexed to it, was enough, and more than enough, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate me from the two first of those Reproaches, and to prevent the last of them also: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>hath lately printed a Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> [The Mischiefs of Self-Ignorance, and the Benefits of Self-Acquaintance] <hi>in the Address of which Book to his dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved the Inhabitants of</hi> Kidderminster, <hi>he hath this ensuing passage relating to the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Worcester.</head>
                  <p>IN a disputation by writing, those of the other part formed an Argument, whose Major Proposition was to this sense (for I have no Copy) <hi>[Whatsoever Book enjoyneth nothing but what is of it self lawfull, and by lawfull Authority, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth nothing that is sinfull,]</hi> We denied this Proposition, and at last gave divers Reasons of our denial; amongst which one was, that <hi>[It may be unlawfull by Accident, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sinfull]</hi> You now know my Crime; it is my concurring with Learned Reverend <hi>Brethren,</hi> to give this reason of our denial of a Proposition: yet they are not forbidden to Preach for it, (and I hope shall not be) but onely I. You have publickly heard from a mouth that should speak nothing but the words of Charity, Truth and Soberness, (especially there) that this was <hi>[a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate shift that men at the last are forced to]</hi> and inferring <hi>[that then neither God nor man can enjoyn without sin]</hi> In City and Countrey this soundeth forth to my reproach; I should take it for an act of Clemency to have been smitten professedly
<pb facs="tcp:94113:11"/>
for nothing, and that it might not have been thought necessary to afflict me by a defamation, that so I might seem justly afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Prohibition to Preach the Gospel. But indeed is there in these words of ours so great a Crime? though we doubted not but they knew that our Assertion made not Every Evil <hi>Accident</hi> to be such as made an imposition unlawfull, yet we expressed this by word to them at that time, for fear of being misreported: and I told it to the <hi>Right Reverend Bishop</hi> when he forbad me to Preach, and gave this as a reason: And I must confess I am still guilty of so much weakness, as to be confident that <hi>Some things, not Evil of themselves, may have Accidents so Evil, as may make it a sin to him that shall command them.</hi> Is this opinion inconsistent with all Government? yea I must confess my self guilty of so much greater weakness, as that I thought I should never have found a man on Earth, that had the ordinary reason of a Man, that had made question of it; yea, I shall say more than that which hath offended (viz.) <hi>That whensoever the commanding or forbidding of a thing indifferent is like to occasion more hurt than good, and this may be foreseen, the commanding or forbidding it is a sin.</hi> But yet this is not the Assertion that I am chargeable with, but that <hi>[Some Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there may be that may make the Imposition sinfull]</hi> If I may ask it without accusing of others, how would my Crime have been denominated if I had said the contrary? should I not have been judged unmeet to live in any governed Society? It is not unlawfull of it self to command out a Navy to Sea: but if it were foreseen that they would fall into the Enemies hands, or were like to perish by any <hi>Accident,</hi> and the necessity of sending them were small, or none, it were a sin to send them. It is not unlawfull of it self to sell Poyson, or give a knife to another, or to bid another to do it; but if it were foreseen that they will be used to poyson or kill the buyer, it is unlawfull; and I think the Law would make him believe it that were guilty. It is not of it self unlawfull to light a Candle, or set fire on a straw; but if
<pb facs="tcp:94113:11"/>
it may be foreknown, that by another's negligence or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it is like to set fire on the City, or give fire to a train or store of Gunpowder that is under the Parliament House, when the King and Parliament are there, I crave the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s pardon for believing that it were sinfull to doe it, or command it; yea or not to hinder it (in any such case) when <hi>Quinon vetat pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care cum potest, jubet,</hi> yea though going to God's publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be of it self so far from being a sin, that it is a Duty, yet I think it is a sin to command it to all in time of a raging Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or when they should be defending the City against the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of an Enemy, it may rather then be a duty to prohibit it. I think <hi>Paul</hi> spake not any thing inconsistent with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God or man, when he bid both the Rulers and the People of the Church, <hi>not to destroy him with their meat for whom Christ died:</hi> and when he saith, <hi>he hath not his power to destruction, but to edification;</hi> yea there are evil <hi>Accidents</hi> of a thing, not evil of it self, that are caused by the Commander: and it is my opinion that they may prove his Command unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>But what need I use any other instances than that which was the matter of our dispute? Suppose it never so lawfull of it self to kneel in the Reception of the Sacrament, if it be imposed by a penalty that is incomparably beyond the proportion of the offence, that penalty is an <hi>Accident</hi> of the command, and maketh it by <hi>Accident</hi> sinfull in the Commander. If a Prince should have Subjects so weak as that all of them thought it a sin against the example of Christ and the Canons of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils, and many hundred years practice of the Church, to kneel in the Act of Receiving on the Lord's day, if he should make a Law that all should be put to death that would not kneel, when he foreknew that their Consciences would command them all, or most of them to die rather than obey, would any man deny his command to be unlawfull by this <hi>Accident?</hi> Whether the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ejecting Ministers that dare not put away all that do not kneel, and of casting out all the people that scruple it, from the
<pb facs="tcp:94113:12"/>
Church, be too great for such a circumstance (and so in the rest) and whether this, with the lamentable estate of many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the divisions that will follow, being all foreseen, do prove the impositions unlawfull which were then in Question, is a Case that I had then a clearer call to speak to, than I have now; onely I may say, <hi>That the Ejecting of the Servants of Christ from the Communion of his Church, and of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers from their Sacred Work, when too many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations have none but insufficient, or scandalous Teachers, or no Preaching Ministers at all, will appear a matter of very great moment in the day of our accounts, and such as should not be done upon any but a necessary cause, where the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is greater than this hurt (and all the rest) amounts to.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having given you (to whom I owe it) this account of the cause for which I am forbidden the exercise of my Ministry in that Countrey, I now direct these Sermons to your hands, that seeing I cannot teach you as I would, I may teach you as I can: And if I much longer enjoy such Liberty as this, it will be much above my expectation.</p>

                     <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Worcester<hi>'s Letter to a Friend for Vindication of himself from Mr.</hi> Baxter<hi>'s Calumny.</hi>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have received that Letter of yours, whereby you inform me that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath lately written and printed something with such a reflexion upon me, that I am obliged to take notice of it.</p>
                  <p>I thank you for your care of my Reputation, which next to Conscience ought to be the dearest of all things to all men, especially to men of my Profession and Order, who the more they are vilified (whether justly or unjustly) the less good they will be able to doe, especially amongst those that have industriously been prepossessed with prejudice either against their Persons or their Functions. This was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Case, when there were some that did what they could to make the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to undervalue his Person, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might discredit his Doctrine, and weaken his Authority, whom therefore he thinks he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of Charity call <hi>False Apostles and Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Workers.</hi> Nay this was our Saviour's own Case, who, whilst he lived here upon the Earth, was ever and anon traduced and slandered by the Scribes and Pharisees, those proud Hypocrites, who were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94113:13"/>
pretenders to Holiness, and yet the greatest Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of the people, and the grossest falsifiers of God's Word, that ever were in the world, untill these our times, which have brought forth a generation of men (St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> would have called them a <hi>Generation of Vipers)</hi> who in the Art of holy juggling and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious slandring have out-done the Pharisees themselves and all that went before them; witness their so often wresting and perverting the Scripture in their Sermons to stir up the people to Sedition, and their as often Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling the King in their Prayers, in order to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Subjects first to hate him, then to fight against him, and at last to take away his Crown and his Life from him. And is it any wonder that those that are such enemies to Kings, should not be friends to Bishops? or that one (who had done what he could to make the late King odious unto his People) should doe what he can likewise to make the Pastour odious unto his Flock? to his Flock, I say; For it is the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that is Pastour of <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> as well as of all other Parochial Churches in that Diocese; neither did I or any other <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> ever commit the Care of Souls in that, or any other Parish of that Diocese to Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> though by that Preface of his to those of <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> he would make the world believe, that they were <hi>his</hi> Flock, and not <hi>mine,</hi> and that therefore he hath the more reason to complain of my defamation of him (as he calls it) in that place and before that people: whereas the truth is that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was never either <hi>Parson, Vicar,</hi> or <hi>Curate</hi> there or any where else in my Diocese; for he never came in by the <hi>Door,</hi> that is, by any legal right or lawfull admission into that Sheepfold, but climbed up some other way, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by violence and intrusion, and therefore by Christ's
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94113:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
own inference he was a <hi>Thief</hi> and a <hi>Robber;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did <hi>Rob</hi> him that was then, and is now again the lawfull <hi>Vicar</hi> of that Church; he <hi>Robbed</hi> him, I say, first of his <hi>Reputation</hi> amongst his Flock, and then of his <hi>means</hi> and <hi>maintenance,</hi> by taking away the <hi>Fleece</hi> as well as the <hi>Flock</hi> from him; though (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself hath confessed to me) <hi>He be a man of an unblameable life and conversation, though not of such parts</hi> (said Mr. <hi>Baxter) as are fit to qualifie him for the Cure of so great a Congregation;</hi> which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were so or no, I am sure Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was not to be the Judge; but in that Case the Bishop that was then living should and would have provided him a Coadjutor, as I have done since, and such an one, as I hope will feed that Flock with much more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Doctrine than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did, when he sowed the Seed of Schism and Sedition, and blew the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of Rebellion amongst them. For which cause I thought it my Duty <hi>(as being their Pastour in Chief)</hi> not onely to forbid Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to Preach there any more, which, by the way, he had done without my Licence; but likewise to Preach there my self, and to doe what I could to undeceive that poor seduced and miserably deluded People; which was not to be done, as long as they had the person of their <hi>Seducer</hi> in so great admiration; and therefore by the example of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who in order to the same end, did take the same course with <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith, with <hi>Demas, Philetus</hi> and <hi>Hymeneus;</hi> as likewise by the example of Christ himself, who in order to the same end, did take the same course with the Scribes and Pharisees, I thought it necessary to let them know <hi>that one that was of great authority amongst them</hi> (meaning indeed, though not naming Mr. <hi>Baxter) was not the man they took him for; that he had not dealt faithfully with them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94113:14"/>
nor preached the word of God sincerely to them, when he made them believe it was lawfull for them to take up Arms against the King, nor in suffering (if not making) them to scruple at those things as unlawfull, which he he himself confesses to be lawfull;</hi> and afterwards ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of those scruples of theirs (which he himself had infused into them, or not endeavoured to take from them) as the onely argument why those things they did so scruple at should not be enjoin'd by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Authority, though lawfull in themselves, <hi>because</hi> forsooth, <hi>the enjoining of things lawfull by lawfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, if they may by Accident be the occasion of sin, is sinfull;</hi> which assertion of his (as I then said, and must still maintain) is destructive of humane Society in taking away the Authority of Commanding and the Obligation of Obeying, together with the whole Legislative Power, Civil as well as Ecclesiastical, and Divine as well as Humane. And thus much (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself saith) I told him before in mine own House, neither did he then deny the assertion, or endeavour to disprove what I inferr'd from it, by any of those distinctions or instances he now useth. And that this is true the <hi>Reverend Dr. Warmstry,</hi> now <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> will witness for me, whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to be by whilst I conferr'd with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> foreseeing what misreport a man of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s principles and temper was like enough to make of what should pass betwixt us. And it was very well I did so; for I find that the <hi>Presbyter</hi> as well as the <hi>Papist</hi> will serve themselves, as often as they are put to it, of their <hi>pioe fraudes,</hi> or holy artifices, of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more or less than the truth, as it makes more or less for their purpose or advantage; as likewise of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>non causam pro causa,</hi> or a part and a less princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of the cause for the whole cause. For who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94113:14"/>
would not think that knows not Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that when he tells his Disciples of <hi>Kidderminster, You now know my Crime,</hi> with reference to the aforesaid asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to that onely, who would not think, I say, that either there was nothing else objected against him, or at least nothing of moment, or that could be any just and reasonable cause of my forbidding him to Preach in my Diocese? especially when he adds that the <hi>Right Reverend Bishop gave him this as a reason for his forbidding him to Preach;</hi> where if he means that the <hi>Bishop</hi> gave him this as the onely, or the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reason, he speaks without truth, and against his Conscience; for the first and principal reason the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> gave him for his forbidding him to Preach, was (as he well knows, and as the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> will witness against him) <hi>His Preaching before without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, having no Cure of his own to Preach to;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto when he replied, <hi>I had promised to give him such a Licence as the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>had given him, viz.</hi> Quàm diu se bene gereret, &amp; durante beneplacito, I rejoin'd, <hi>That it was true indeed, I had once promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to give him such a Licence, but withall, that it was as true, that first I had never promised to give him a Licence, if he took it before I gave it him; and that for this presumption of his, I had now forbidden him to Preach any more.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That I knew more of him since than I did at that time; for,</hi> first, <hi>I had been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, that he had abused the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<hi>'s favour by preaching factiously, though not in the City, yet in the Diocese of</hi> London, <hi>and I named the place to him:</hi> Secondly, <hi>that since that promise of mine (which cannot be supposed to be other than Conditional) I my self had heard him, at a Conference in the</hi> Savoy, <hi>maintaining such a Position as was destructive to Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power both in God and Man</hi> (meaning the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94113:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before spoken of, <hi>viz. That the enjoining of things lawfull by lawfull Authority, if they might by Accident be the cause of sin, was sinfull) which Assertion of his with the horrible consequences of it, I told him then at</hi> Worcester, <hi>I had formerly told him of at the</hi> Savoy <hi>openly, and before all the Company that was at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;</hi> whereunto all that he replied at my second telling him at <hi>Worcester,</hi> was, <hi>that he had used some distinctions to salve that Assertion from those consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> but what those distinctions were he did not then mention, (as Dr. <hi>Warmstry</hi> can witness) though in this printed Address of his to his Friends of <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> he saith, <hi>he did tell the</hi> Bishop <hi>in what a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and restrained sense he and his Brethren understood that Assertion;</hi> which whether they did or no, will appear by and by, when we shall more nearly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his printed Narrative as to that particular. In the mean time, though I said indeed that one that held and was likely to teach such Doctrines, was not to be suffered to Preach unto the People, yet this was not then alledged by me as the cause or crime for which I had forbidden him to Preach, (for that, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was <hi>His presuming to Preach without a Licence)</hi> but onely as a reason why I should have thought my self not obliged by the promise I had formerly made him, to give him a Licence, though he had not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise forfeited his claim to that promise by preaching without, or before he had it. Lastly, He might have remembred another reason I gave him why I could not have made good that promise, namely, <hi>those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Treason and Rebellion publickly extant in his Books, which I had not taken notice of till after the making of that promise, and which till he should recant in as publick a manner, I thought my self obliged in Conscience not to suffer him to Preach in my Diocese;</hi>

whereunto his answer was, <hi>That whatsoever he had said or done in that kind, was pardoned by the Act of Indempnity: True,</hi> said I, <hi>so far as the King can pardon it, that is, in regard of its corporal punishment here in this world, but it is God that must pardon the guilt or obligation to punishment in the world to come, which he will not without repentance, and it is the Church that must pardon the scandal, which she cannot doe neither without an honourable amends made her by publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Recantation.</hi> I could tell Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his ear likewise, that in excuse of his rebellious Principles formerly published, he said, <hi>That now the Parliament had declared where the Sovereign Power was, he should acknowledge it and submit to it,</hi> as if the King owed his Sovereignty to the Declaration of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which is as false as rebellious, and as dangerous a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple as any of his former: however by what hath been said, it appears that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> meant to impose upon his credulous Friends at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his unwary Readers, by making them believe that was the onely cause for which the <hi>Bishop</hi> forbad him to Preach, which was neither the onely, nor the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cause, why the <hi>Bishop</hi> did so, nor indeed, to speak properly, any cause of it at all; for the onely proper cause for which the <hi>Bishop</hi> forbad him to Preach, was <hi>His preaching before without the</hi> Bishop<hi>'s Licence;</hi> the other which he pretends, together with the third which he conceals, were properly and professedly the causes why the <hi>Bishop</hi> would not take off that Prohibition, or why he would not give him a Licence to Preach for the future, either at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> or in any other place of his Diocese, untill he should publickly retract that Position which he had openly asserted at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and should publickly renounce likewise those seditious and rebellious Principles which are published
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94113:16"/>
in his Books. And this is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth of what passed betwixt me and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at <hi>Worcester,</hi> before I preached at <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminster,</hi> where whether I defamed him, or he, by saying so, hath not grosly defamed me, will appear by that which follows; wherein that I might neither be deceived my self, nor deceive others, I have not trusted to my own memory onely, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith he doth to his, but I have consulted with Dr. <hi>Gunning</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> two of the three that managed that Conference with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his <hi>Assistants,</hi> and have seen that Assertion in the same sense that I object it, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> disclaims it, affirmed by Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himself under his own hand.</p>
                  <p>I found Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> at the <hi>Savoy</hi> engaged in a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and I perceived that to keep himself off from that part of the Argument which would press near to the merits of the Cause, he had often affirmed in his <hi>Answers, That the Command of a most lawfull Act was sinfull; if that Act commanded might prove to any one a sin</hi> per accidens. This Assertion I did then and there presently and openly lay to his charge; and when he denied it (as it was most frequent with him immediately to deny what he had before affirmed) the answers which he had delivered written with his own hand were produced, and upon the reading of them, the justice of my charge was most apparent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I urged him farther, that this Assertion of his was not onely false, but destructive of all Authority Humane and Divine, as not onely denying all power to the Church of making Canons Ecclesiastical for the better ordering and governing of the Church, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so taking away all Legislative Power from the King and Parliament, and even from God himself: I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at the same time my reason for what I said,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94113:16"/>
which was briefly this, because there can be no Act so good of it self, but may prove <hi>per Accidens,</hi> or by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, a sin; And therefore, if to command an Act which may prove <hi>per Accidens</hi> a sin, be a sin, then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Command must be a sin. And if to command be a sin, then certainly God can command nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God cannot sin; and by the same reason, Kings, Parliaments and Churches ought not to command any thing, because they ought not to sin.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I then charged Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and to this Charge he gave then no satisfaction. Neither can I yet conceive it possible to give any satisfaction, but by one of these two ways, either by proving that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, with which I charged him was never his, or by shewing that the consequence I urged, is not good; neither of which was he then able to doe: and by what he hath now been pleased to publish, it is more than probable that he can never perform either of them.</p>
                  <p>For in his bold, but weak Apology, he doth not so much as pretend to shew any Invalidity in my Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and for the Assertion with which I charged him, he denies it so poorly, and goes about to prove another instead of it so manifestly, that he may without any injury be interpreted to yield it. He saith indeed now, <hi>That he told us that his Assertion made not every Evil Accident to be such as made an Imposition unlawfull.</hi> But whether he ever said so before this time or no, it was then clearly proved that he did assert, <hi>That an Act for nothing else, but because it might be</hi> per Accidens <hi>a sin, could not be commanded without sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now in his publick Appeal, he hath taken a strange way to wipe off all this, for he makes a very brief Narration, and most notoriously imperfect, and then says, <hi>You know my Crime,</hi> as if that were all that had been, or could be objected against him. Besides,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94113:17"/>
in the relating of this short Narrative, he relies wholly upon his own memory; not so much as endeavouring to satisfie himself, before he presumed to satisfie others. How his memory may be in other things I know not, in this if it hath been faithfull to him, he hath been very unfaithfull to others. He relates an Answer in what terms he pleaseth, and brings one Proposition, as made by his Opponents in what terms he thinks fit, and the Application of this answer to that Proposition he propoundeth as all his Crime; whereas his Answer was far more largely given, and that to several Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in several Syllogisms, of which the Proposition which he relateth was but one, or rather none; so that he hath most shamefully abused his Disciples at <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> with a short and partial Narrative of his Fact.</p>
                  <p>As for his <hi>Concurring with Learned Reverend Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (which he would pretend to be part of his Crime) and his invidious insinuation, <hi>That they are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Preach for it, though he be,</hi> the reason is clear. He had often delivered this Assertion before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, his Brethren had not; the words of the Answer were written with his hand, not with his Brethrens. His Brethren had several times declared themselves not to be of his Opinion (as particularly when he affirmed <hi>That a man might live without any actual sin).</hi> And therefore we were so just as not to charge them with this Assertion; especially considering they did shew themselves unwilling to enter upon this dispute, and seemed to like much better another way tending to an amicable and fair compliance, which was wholly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s furious eagerness to engage in a Disputation.</p>
                  <p>All his Discourse which followeth (after his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Narrative) in justification of himself, is grounded first, upon a misreporting of his own Assertion; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94113:17"/>
upon the dissembling of the several Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to which his Answer was so often applied; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon his pretending <hi>That he says more now, than that which had offended formerly;</hi> which is most palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly false, and in all probability (if he have any memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) against his own Conscience. And this will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently appear by the vanity and impertinency of all those specious instances which he brings to mollifie his Assertion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To Command a Navy to Sea</hi> (he says) <hi>is lawfull, but if it were foreseen that they would fall into the Enemies hand, or were like to perish by any accident, it were a sin to send them.</hi> Is this more than he said before, or is it any defence of his Assertion at all? It is not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because the Opponents had put it expresly in the Proposition; <hi>That the Act in it self lawfull, was to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have nothing consequent, which the Commander of it ought to provide against;</hi> and yet being so stated, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirmed, <hi>That if the Act might be</hi> per Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens <hi>sinfull, the Commanding of it was sin.</hi> Now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the falling of a Navy into the Enemies hand, or the perishing of it any other way, <hi>if foreseen,</hi> ought to be provided against by the Commander; whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s answer did import, That if any Prince did Command a Fleet to Sea, though he did not foresee the Fleet would fall into the Enemies hand, or perish any other way, yet if by Accident it miscarried that or any other way, which he could not foresee, or were not bound to provide against, the very Command at first was sin.</p>
                  <p>The same reason nullifies his instances of the <hi>Poison,</hi> and the <hi>Knife,</hi> because the sin in selling them supposeth the murther of the buyer to be foreseen, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the seller ought to prevent it; but if he will speak in correspondence to his former Answer, he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94113:18"/>
must shew, that though the seller do not foresee that the buyer will use the Poison or the Knife, to his own, or any other man's destruction, yet if by any Accident or mistake, either the buyer, or any other perish by the Poison or the Knife, the seller is guilty of his death.</p>
                  <p>His instance of <hi>setting a City on fire, or putting Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder under the Parliament House when the King and Parliament are there,</hi> is of the same nature, and needs no addition of answer but onely this, that Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in a sense too true, hath been very instrumental in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the City on fire, and in adding powder to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>The rest which follows betrays the same weakness, because the inconveniences are urged <hi>upon a Duty to prohibit them,</hi> and his Answer did charge the Command with sin in respect of such Accidents, as it was no part of the Commander's Duty to provide against. It is therefore most certain, that no one of those instances singly, nor all of them jointly have any force in any measure to justifie that Assertion which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did maintain, and whereof he is accused.</p>
                  <p>As for that last instance, <hi>which was</hi> (saith he) <hi>the matter of the Dispute,</hi> and which he urgeth in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>(Suppose it never so lawfull of it self to Kneel in the reception of the Sacrament, if it be imposed by a penalty, that is incomparably beyond the proportion of the offence, that penalty is an Accident of the Command, and maketh it by Accident sinfull to the Commander)</hi> he is manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of a double falsification: First, in pretending the matter in dispute, <hi>was the imposition of kneeling at the Communion;</hi> when this very matter was expresly rejected in the very beginning of the Dispute, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Canons,</hi> not the Common-Prayer-Book, the lawfulness of which <hi>Canons</hi> the Commissioners had no authority to debate, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows, that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94113:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Argument was denied upon that ground. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond falsification is yet greater, in urging the penalty to make the Command sinfull, when his Answer did charge the Command with sin, without any relation to the punishment; and when the Proposition he repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to was so framed, that all unjust penalties were <hi>in terminis</hi> expresly excluded, even then I say he charged the Command of a lawfull Act with sin, if it were otherwise by Accident sinfull; though by the way I must not grant that the penalty imposed by the Law for not kneeling at the receiving of the Sacrament (namely the not admitting of such as will not kneel, at the receiving of it) <hi>is incomparably greater than the offence;</hi> for the greatness of the offence in such cases, and as it stands in relation to such or such a penalty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it, is not to be measured by the Quality of the Act considered in it self, but by the more or less mischievous consequences it is likely to produce, if men be not restrain'd from such an Act by such a penalty; for example, when a Souldier is hang'd for stealing of a Hen, or for taking away any thing of never so little a value, without paying for it, no wise man will blame the <hi>General</hi> for such a severity; because if he did not doe so, every one would take what he pleased, which would discourage the Country from bringing in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and consequently the whole Army would be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd. And as the Martial, so the Civil and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Laws likewise in commanding or forbidding any thing under such or such a penalty, have an eye not so much to the merit of the Action it self, as to the more or less danger of the Publick in the consequences of it; whence it comes to pass, that a less evil may sometimes most justly be forbidden under a more severe penalty than a greater, because the former may be of much more dangerous consequence than the latter; so that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94113:19"/>
he that will judge rightly, and impartially of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or iniquity of appointing or inflicting such or such a penalty, he must not so much consider the quality of the Transgression singly in it self, nor whether it be from weakness, or wilfulness in the party transgressing (as he is this or that individual person) but rather he must consider what the <hi>Consequence</hi> would be of the breach of such a Command if it were not prevented by such a penalty, (always supposing the Command it self to be lawfull, and that the transgressour of it is to be considered as he stands in relation to that whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether Civil, or Ecclesiastical, whereof he is a part;) and that the whole is not to be endangered out of tenderness and indulgence to some particulars, as evidently it would be, if every man were left at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to doe what seem'd best in his own eyes, even in the Ceremonials and Circumstantials of God's Worship; for considering the pride and self-love that is in humane nature, which makes men so overvalue their own practices and their own opinions, that they are always apt to undervalue those that will not conform to them, as it always hath been, so it always will be; he that worshippeth God one way, will either judge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him that worshippeth God another way; he that <hi>Kneeleth</hi> at the Sacrament, will be thought to be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous or Superstitious by him that <hi>Kneeleth not,</hi> and he that kneeleth not will be thought wilfull, or weak, by him that kneeleth. And thus from diversity grows dislike, from dislike enmity, from enmity opposition, and from opposition, first Separation and Schism in the <hi>Church,</hi> and then Faction, Sedition and Rebellion in the State; which is a progress very natural, and I would we had not found it to be so by our own experience; for as the safety of a State depends upon the safety of the Church, so the safety of the Church depends upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94113:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Unity, and Unity it self depends upon Uniformity, and Uniformity there cannot be, as long as there is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity or divers ways of Worship in the same Church, which will be always, unless it be lawfull for publick Authority to oblige all particulars to one way of publick Worship, and that under such penalties, as the Law-givers shall think necessary to prevent the disturbing of the publick peace and safety; the preservation whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main end of all Laws, and of all penalties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Law, those practices that are either inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally or consequentially destructive to this End, may be, and no doubt ought to be restrain'd by severe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties. It is not therefore the <hi>not kneeling</hi> at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but the <hi>breaking</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> of the Church, and the endangering of the Peace and Safety of the whole, which our Laws punish by not admitting such unto the Sacrament, as will not, or perhaps dare not kneel at it; for as they will not endanger the Peace of their Consciences for the Churches sake; so it becomes the Law-givers not to endanger the Churches and the States Peace for their sakes: And surely when there is a necessity of the yielding of the one or of the other, it is much more reasonable that a part should yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole, than the whole unto a part, especially when the whole cannot yield without endangering it self, and with it self even those themselves also, that, will they nill they, must be involved in the ruine of it; as the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have found by their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence also, who by their groundless and needless separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from us, have given example and ground enough for others to separate from them, till by dividing and subdividing from one another, there was nothing of Uniformity, or unity, or order, or decency left in that <hi>Church,</hi> which was formerly (and I hope by the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Piety of Publick Authority will be now
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94113:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
again) the Glory and Pattern of all other Protestant and <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches in the world; of which, by the way, there is not one which doth not use as great severity for the preserving of Unity by Uniformity as we do, even in this particular; for do not the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches in <hi>France</hi> enjoyn <hi>Standing,</hi> the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Holland, Scotland,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Germany</hi> that follow <hi>Calvin</hi> enjoyn <hi>Sitting,</hi> and the Churches that follow <hi>Luther</hi> there and elsewhere enjoyn <hi>Kneeling</hi> as we do, and all of them upon the same penalty of not receiving it otherwise? And is it not as lawfull for our Church, as for all other Protestant, and all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches, to require of her Children the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to her Laws under the like penalty for the same end, and to prevent the same danger? <hi>Yes</hi> (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> when this question was ask'd him) <hi>just as lawfull,</hi> that is, <hi>not lawfull at all, such an injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon such a penalty being sinfull, wheresoever and by whomsoever it is enjoyned.</hi> O happy <hi>England,</hi> that hath such an <hi>Aristarchus</hi> as is worthy to censure all the Churches of the world, whose Catholick practice (if it cross Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s opinion) must presently without more adoe be Condemn'd as sinfull, and all the world must be Lyars rather than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in his sayings. You have before seen the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and veracity, you now see the humility and the modesty of the Man; and indeed in proportion, of the whole Party, for <hi>crimine ab uno,—Disce omnes.</hi> But doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and the rest of his perswasion think indeed, that it is so great and grievous a punishment to be kept from the Sacrament when men will not receive it in that way and upon those terms that the Church offers? if they do, why then do they deny it to so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that hunger and thirst after it, whensoever either by reason of Age, or Lameness, or Sickness, or some
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94113:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other bodily infirmity they cannot come to Church for it? especially when the Catholick Church in the Twelfth Canon of the first General Council commands it be given even to those that are Excommunicate, if they desire it when they are <hi>in Extremis,</hi> or going out of the world. Secondly, why have they suffered so many whole Parishes in <hi>England</hi> under their charge to have been without a Communion so many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as I am credibly informed they have? Thirdly, why do they reject those from the Sacrament, that will not come before hand to them to be examined by them, there being neither precept nor practice in the Gospel, nor Canon in the Church, either to warrant them to require it, or to oblige the People to submit to it upon any such penalty? I am sure St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he chides those of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> for coming ignorantly to the Sacrament, and for behaving themselves profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Sacrament, that which he prescribes for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the same or the like faults for the future, is not that every man should come, and be examined by the Minister, but that <hi>every man should examine himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he eat of that Bread and drink of that Cup;</hi> And yet I will not deny but that every man before he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ought to be well Catechis'd and instructed by the Minister, and thereby enabled to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the better; nor will I deny neither but that every man may and ought in case of scruple of Mind or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Conscience to advise with, and to be advised by him that hath the cure of his Soul; but that every man as often as he intends to receive the Sacrament should be obliged under the penalty of being rejected from it, to come and to be examined by the Minister, this is that which I utterly deny, and which I take to be the same thing in other words with that of <hi>Auricular Confession;</hi> so that they who exact the one, have no reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94113:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the other, unless it be because they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross it wholly unto themselves: Howsoever, if refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Sacrament to those that will not kneel, when the Church enjoyns it, be a penalty so far transcending the offence, how much more must the same penalty transcend the offence, when there is indeed no offence at all? for where there is no <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there can be no <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, where there is no Law there can be no Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, and consequently there being no Law of God nor Man that requires all Communicants to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined by the Minister, those that are refused the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament because they will not be pre-examined, are punished with the same punishment which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, for no offence at all. And therefore <hi>Si maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè digna essem</hi> (may our Church say) <hi>ista contumelia, indigni vos, qui faceretis tamen;</hi> for, <hi>Who art thou, O Man, that judgest another?</hi> nay, that judgest thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>when thou doest the same,</hi> or worse, <hi>things,</hi> than those are for which thou condemnest her? And how can any man of reason be so scrupulous, as to quit his Calling, rather than deny the Sacrament to those that will not receive it kneeling, when the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it should neither be taken nor given otherwise, and yet make no scruple at all of denying it to whole Parishes? of denying it to those that cannot come to Church for it, though desirous of it, and qualified for it, and such as have most need of it to strengthen their Faith in their last Agony? and lastly, of denying it to such as refuse to be pre-examined by them, and all this without any command or warrant from God's Word, and contrary to the Command and Custom of God's Church? whereby it plainly appears, that either they do not think the receiving of the Sacrament of so great importance, as indeed it is, nor the denying of it so great an injury or punishment as they pretend it to be;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94113:21"/>
or else that they would have every Minister to be a Monarch or Sovereign Law-giver in his own Parish, and this indeed is that they would fain be at, now they have lost their hopes of governing the whole Kingdom; for you see by what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> adds, that if they may not be suffered to give or deny the Sacrament to whom they please, and in effect to doe what they list in their own Parishes, they threaten to quit their Stations, which he calls <hi>being Ejected because they dare not put away all that will not kneel at the Sacrament:</hi> And this menace they often repeat upon all occasions, as if they were the onely men that could carry on the work of the Lord; or as if the Church must needs sink and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, if it wanted such Pillars as they are to uphold it. But (thanks be to God for it) the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not yet (notwithstanding all their endeavours to that purpose) reduced to so very ill a condition, that she cannot subsist without them; whereas the truth is, she cannot subsist with them, as long as they continue to be what they have been, the sowers and somenters of Schism in the Church, and Sedition in the State; and as long as they continue to doe as they have done in humouring, and hardning, and confirming the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their obstinate standing out against the lawfull commands of their Superiours; which they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done at all, if these men had not at first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into them these scruples. And therefore as God asked <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, How came ye to know that ye are naked?</hi> so if I should ask those poor Souls whom those sly and subtile Serpents have beguiled and seduced, How came ye to know that ye shall sin against God if ye obey the Orders of the Church in general? or particularly how came ye to know, <hi>That it is against the Canons of the General Councils, and many hundred years practice of the Church to Kneel in the Act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving?</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94113:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Did ye or can ye your selves reade those General Councils? Did ye or can ye examine so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years practice of the Church as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> speaks of? What answer can they make to these demands, but that which <hi>Eve</hi> made unto God? <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat;</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or some such Godly and Learned men as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is, did tell us so, and we believed them: But what if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> do not believe that himself which he would have you believe? For first he would have you believe that there is great reverence and respect to be given (as indeed there is) to the Canons of <hi>General Councils,</hi> and to the <hi>Catholick practice</hi> of the Primitive Church; but doth he himself believe this? if he do, why did he so furiously oppose that which all General Councils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of and confirm? I mean the Government of the Church by <hi>Bishops</hi> in the sense wherein it is asserted and practised in our Church? Or why did he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade Subjects to take Arms against their <hi>Sovereign?</hi> which he knows to be contrary to the Doctrine and practice of the Primitive Christians for many hundred years more than he speaks of. Secondly, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have you believe, that Kneeling at the receiving of the Sacrament is forbidden by <hi>General Councils,</hi> and contrary to the custom and <hi>practice</hi> of the Ancient Church, which I am affraid he doth not believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; I am sure there is no convincing reason to make him believe it; for it is not the Ancient Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to stand when they prayed betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> that will prove they were forbidden to Kneel when they received; especially if the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> opinion be true, <hi>that we are not to be in the Act of Praying, when we are in the Act of receiving;</hi> But if we may pray (as no doubt we may and ought to pray) in the Act of Receiving, then supposing the Ancient
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94113:22"/>
Injunction of the Church to stand at Prayer upon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsuntide</hi> to be still in force, yet all the rest of the year we are to kneel when we Pray, and consequently when we Receive, though there were no particular command of our own Church for it. Besides, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows that the aforesaid Injunction of the Church was but Temporary, till the people were sufficiently confirmed in the Doctrine and Belief of the Resurrection; for if it had been of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obligation, and were still in force, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must needs condemn the whole present Church of God for kneeling when they pray betwixt <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,</hi> and particularly he must most of all condemn himself and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for not stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when they receive, if at least that Injunction be to be understood of Receiving, as well as Praying; which if it be not, then is it urged by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> against us to no purpose, as indeed it is; And therefore no doubt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not believe himself what he would have others believe, when he presseth that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional temporary injunction of the Church for <hi>standing</hi> against <hi>kneeling;</hi> which if it be of force, must needs condemn his own practice of <hi>sitting,</hi> as well as ours of <hi>kneeling.</hi> The like may be said of Christ's example alledged by him also; for would he, or would he not have his Disciples believe that they are obliged to doe as Christ did? if he would not have them believe so, why doth he press them with Christ's example? if he would have them believe so, I demand again whether he doth believe it himself or no? if he do not, it is plain he is a Seducer of the <hi>People;</hi> but if he do believe it, he must needs condemn the <hi>French Presbyterians</hi> for <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> as well as the <hi>English Protestants</hi> for <hi>kneeling;</hi> nay he must needs condemn himself and all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the world for not doing as Christ did in point
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94113:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of time, I mean for not giving and receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Evening as Christ did, as well as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us for not doing as Christ did in point of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; unless he can prove (which I think he cannot) that we are of necessity to follow Christ's example in one circumstance of the same action, and not in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in that circumstance which is less, but not in that which is more material; for certainly that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which denominates the action (as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of time doth the Lord's Supper) is most materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and yet that circumstance by the consent of all Christendom is altered from the Evening to the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and so was the gesture or posture of receiving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and that upon most just and weighty reasons, till those that delight in change would needs have it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and that perhaps for no other reason but because they found it settled in the Church: This is not to follow Christ's example, who in things indifferent in their own nature conform'd his practice to that of the Church in which he lived, though varying in some circumstances from the Primitive Institution; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this very action, from which they press us with Christ's example. For it is certain that Christ and his Disciples sate at the Passeover, (though it be uncertain whether he or they sate at the giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament or no, for it was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>after he had supped,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20.) Howsoever it is certain, I say, that Christ and his Disciples sate when they ate the Passeover, and this no doubt was according to the custom of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church at that time; but it is as certain that this was not the manner according to the first Institution of it, which was to eat it <hi>standing,</hi> as you may reade, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 11. So that to urge Christ's example against us, is to urge Christ's example against himself; for as we
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94113:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conform our selves to the Churches order and custom of our times, in receiving the Communion otherwise in point of gesture, than perhaps it was received at the first Institution; so Christ and his Apostles conforming themselves to the order and practice of the Church of their times, did celebrate the Passeover otherwise than according to the first Institution it was to be celebrated in point of gesture also; thereby perhaps intending to teach us, that as long as the Essentials of Doctrine and Worship (which are unalterable) are preserved, we are not to separate from the Church, or quarrel with our Superiours, if those things that are in their own nature alterable, be not always and in all places just the same that they were at first; because there may be very just cause for the alteration of them; and whether there be such a cause or no in this and the like particulars, it is the Church that is to be the Judge. So that there is nothing that can be collected either from the Canons of the Councils, or from the practice of the Primitive Church, no nor from Christ's own example, that can prove Kneeling at the Sacrament to be a sin; neither doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself believe it to be sinfull, for if he did, he would not say (as he does, Pag. 411. of his Five Disputations) <hi>that he himself would kneel rather than disturb the Peace of the Church, or be deprived of its Communion.</hi> In which words he confesseth, First, that Kneeling at the Sacrament is not sinfull or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Secondly, that not to Kneel when it is imposed, is to disturb the Peace of the Church; and, Thirdly, that the imposing of it upon penalty of being deprived of the Communion, is an effectual means to make those that otherwise would not kneel, to conform to it; and consequently that the imposing of it upon such a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is prudent and rational, and whatsoever is prudent and rational cannot be unlawfull; so that not onely the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94113:24"/>
Act of Kneeling it self, but the imposition of it by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Authority must needs be lawfull. Neither indeed would the People scruple at the imposition, if they had not been taught that the thing it self were unlawfull, or if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would yet teach them to believe what he himself believes, namely, that it is lawfull; which with what Conscience he can refuse to do I know not; for sure he is obliged to teach them obedience not to Divine Authority onely, but to Humane Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in all lawfull things; and not to let them go on in such an erroneous opinion, <hi>as will disturb the Peace, and deprive them of the Communion of the Church,</hi> and consequently make them sin against God and Man and their own Souls. Of which sin of theirs he must needs be a partaker in a great measure, if he do not perswade them from it; seeing (as he himself saith) <hi>Qui non vetat peccare cum potest, jubet.</hi> And what <hi>Power</hi> he hath to lead or mislead those kind of men, <hi>their</hi> venturing to kill and be killed in an unrighteous quarrel (upon his perswasion) hath more than enough demonstrated during the time of the late troubles; unless he will say that he hath conjured up a Spirit that he cannot lay. Howsoever by how much the more faulty he hath been in misleading them heretofore, by so much the more zealous he should be to reduce them into the right way hereafter; which if he and the rest of his Brethren can doe (as I am confident they can if they will) they will make some amends for the mischief they have done, and then there will be no fear or danger <hi>of Ministers being Ejected for their tenderness towards the People, nor of the Ejecting of any of the People from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church for not conforming themselves to the Orders and Commands of it,</hi> and consequently, there will be no Schisms or Divisions amongst us, when we shall all worship the same God the same way. But if
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94113:24"/>
they will not doe this (which by all obligations humane and Divine they are bound to doe) for my part I know no better way for undeceiving and reducing of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than by removing such Ministers, and then we shall see when the blowing of those boysterous winds ceaseth, whether the waves will not be still or no: In the mean time I hope the removing of <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>seditious,</hi> will not necessitate the introducing of <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ministers,</hi> though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ought to remember, that as there is no sin more heinous than Rebellion, so no teacher ought to be more scandalous (I am sure there is none more dangerous) than a teacher of Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>And now (to use Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own words) I think there is <hi>no man to be found on earth, that hath the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reason of a Man, but will confess, That it is indeed destructive of all Government and Legislative power, to Assert</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did Assert) <hi>the command of a thing in it self lawfull by lawfull Authority, under no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just punishment, with no evil circumstance, which the Commander can foresee or ought to provide against</hi> (for all these pre-cautions were expresly put in the proposition which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied) <hi>is a sinfull Command, for no other reason, but because the Act Commanded may be by Accident a sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then know, and (if he have ingenuity enough) confess, that the words I spoke (as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) were <hi>words of truth,</hi> and <hi>words of Charity</hi> also, as being intended and spoken to no other end, but to undeceive that People, who by having his person too much in admiration (as if he could neither deceive nor be deceived) had been so long and so dangerously misled by him; so that it was not I that defamed him then, but it is he that hath defamed me now. Neither could I expect less from the boldness of this man and that party, who have had the confidence publickly to own the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94113:25"/>
of the Covenant, even since it hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to be burnt by the Parliament. And truly I see no reason why all those Books and Sermons which have been Preach'd and Printed in defence of the Covenant, or to maintain the same or worse principles of Sedition than are in the Covenant, should not be burnt also. Nay I dare be bold to say, that if the Authours of such Books and Sermons were not still of the same opinions, (and if they be, God deliver us from such Preachers) if they were not still, I say, of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but did truly repent of them, and were heartily sorry for the horrible mischief they have done by them, they would with those converted Exorcists, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 19. bring all those Conjuring Books of theirs together, and to save the Hang-man a labour; would publickly burn them all with their own hands, that so, though by the burning of their works they may perhaps suffer some loss in point of reputation with some of their Disciples, yet they themselves may be saved, but so as by fire, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. At least they ought to be enjoyned to write Books of Retractation, as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> did, having much more reason to doe so than St. <hi>Augustine</hi> had.</p>
                  <p>And this, Sir, is all I have to say upon this occasion, and more a great deal than I ought to have said, or than perhaps was needfull to be said to one that knows Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and me as well as you do; which if it satisfie you, as I hope it will, you may doe what you please with it, in order to the satisfying of others; for this is the first and last trouble I mean to put my self to of this kind, whatsoever provocation I may have from him hereafter,</p>

If a People that by Oath and Duty are obliged to a Sovereign, shall sinfully dispossess him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Covenants, chuse and Covenant with another, they may be obliged by their latter Covenant notwithstanding their former; and particular subjects that consented not in the breaking of their former Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, may yet be obliged by occasion of their latter choice to the person whom they chuse. <hi>Thes.</hi> 181.</item>

If a Nation injuriously deprive themselves of a worthy Prince, the hurt will be their own, and they punish themselves; but if it be necessarily to their welfare, it is no injury to him. But a King that by war will seek reparations from the body of the people, doth put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into an hostile State, and tells them actually that he looks to his own good more than theirs, and bids them take him for their Enemy, and so defend themselves if they can. <hi>Pag.</hi> 424.</item>

                     <p n="2">II. As to them that argue from the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and the title given the King, I refer them <hi>(saith Mr.</hi> Baxter) to Mr. <hi>Lawson</hi>'s <note place="margin">
                           <hi>He might have referr'd them to himself, pag.</hi> 460. <hi>where he gives the same answer to the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</hi>
                        </note> answer to <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s Politicks, where he sheweth that the Title is often given to the single Person for the honour of the Commonwealth and his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because he hath an eminent interest: but will not prove the whole Sovereignty to be in him: and the Oath excludeth all others from without, not those whose interest is implied as conjunct with his—The emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dignity and interest of the King above others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the name of a Monarchy or Kingdom to the Commonwealth, though indeed the Sovereignty was mixed in the hands of the Lords and Commons. <hi>Pag.</hi> 88.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>He calls it</hi> a false supposition. 1. That the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power was onely in the King, and so that it was an absolute Monarchy. 2 That the Parliament had but onely the proposing of Laws, and that they were Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely by the King's Authority upon their request. 3. That the power of Arms and of War and Peace was in the King alone. And therefore <hi>(saith he)</hi> those that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94113:29"/>
argue from these false suppositions, conclude that the Parliament being Subjects, may not take up Arms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, and that it is Rebellion to resist him; and most of this they gather from the Oath of Supremacy, and from the Parliaments calling of themselves his Subjects; but their grounds <hi>(saith he)</hi> are sandy, and their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure false. <hi>Pag.</hi> 459, &amp; 460.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And therefore Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>tells us,</hi> that though the Parliament are Subjects in one capacity, yet have they their part in the Sovereignty also in their higher capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, <hi>Ibid. And upon this false and traitorous supposition he endeavours to justifie the late Rebellion, and his own more than ordinary activeness in it. For,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Where the Sovereignty <hi>(saith he)</hi> is distributed into several hands (as the King's and Parliaments) and the King invades the others part, they may lawfully defend their own by war, and the Subject lawfully assist them, yea, though the power of the Militia be expresly given to the King, unless it be also exprest that it shall not be in the other. <hi>Thes.</hi> 363.</p>
                     <p>The conclusion <hi>(saith he)</hi> needs no proof because Sovereignty, as such, hath the power of Arms and of the Laws themselves. The Law that saith the King shall have the <hi>Militia</hi> supposeth it to be against Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and not against the Commonwealth, nor them that have part of the Sovereignty with him. To resist him here is not to resist power, but usurpation and private will; in such a case the Parliament is no more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted than he. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. If the King raise War against such a Parliament upon their Declaration of the dangers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the people are to take it as raised against the Commonwealth. <hi>Thes.</hi> 358.</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94113:30"/>
And in that case (saith he) the King may not onely be resisted, but ceaseth to be a King, and entreth into a state of War with the people. <hi>Thes.</hi> 368.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Again, if a Prince that hath not the whole Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty be conquered by a Senate that hath the other part, and that in a just defensive War, that Senate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not assume the whole Sovereignty, but supposeth that government in <hi>specie</hi> to remain, and therefore another King must be chosen, if the former be incapable. <hi>(Thes.</hi> 374.) <hi>as he tells us, he is,</hi> by ceasing to be King, <hi>in the immediately precedent</hi> Thes.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. <hi>And yet in the Preface to this Book he tells us that</hi> the King withdrawing <hi>(so he calls the murthering of one King and the casting off of another)</hi> the Lords and Commons ruled alone; <hi>was not this to change the</hi> species <hi>of the Government? Which in the immediate words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had affirmed</hi> to be in King, Lords and Commons; which constitution <hi>(saith he)</hi> we were sworn, and sworn, and sworn again to be faithfull to and to defend. <hi>And yet speaking of that Parliament which contrary to their Oaths changed this Government</hi> by ruling alone, and taking upon them the Supremacy, he tells us that they were the best Governours <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Preface to the H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>What then was he that deposed them? one would think Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>should have called him a Traitour, but he calls him in the same Preface,</hi> the Lord Protector, <hi>adding,</hi> That he did prudently, piously, faithfully, and to his immortal honour exercise the Government, <hi>which he left to his Son,</hi> to whom <hi>(as Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>saith pag.</hi> 484.) he is bound to submit as set over us by God, and to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94113:30"/>
obey for conscience sake, and to behave himself as a Loyal Subject towards him, because <hi>(as he saith in the same place)</hi> a full and free Parliament had owned him: <hi>thereby implying, That a maimed and a manacled House of Commons, without King and Lords, and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the violent expulsion of the secluded Members</hi> were a full and free Parliament; <hi>and consequently that if such a Parliament should have taken Arms against the King he must have sided with them. Yea, though they had been never so much in fault, and though they had been the beginners of the War, for he tells us in plain and express terms,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. That if he had known the Parliament had been the beginners of the War and in most fault, yet the ruine of the Trustees and Representatives, and so of all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Nation being a punishment greater than any faults of theirs against the King could deserve from him, their faults could not disoblige him <hi>(meaning himself)</hi> from defending the Commonwealth. <hi>Pag.</hi> 480.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And that he might doe this lawfully, and with a good Conscience, he seems to be so confident, that in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, he makes as it were a challenge, saying, that</hi> if any man can prove that the King was the highest power in the time of those Divisions, and that he had power to make that war which <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>The Pref to his Holy Commonwealth,</hi> prope. finem.</note> he made, he will offer his head to Justice as a Rebel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As if in those times of Division the King had lost or forfeited his Sovereignty, and the Parliament had not onely a part, but the whole Sovereignty in themselves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">IX, <hi>Finally Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>tells us, Pag.</hi> 486. That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often searched into his heart, whether he did law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully engage into the War or not, and whether he did
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94113:31"/>
lawfully encourage so many thousands to it; he tells us, I say, that the issue of all his search was but this,—That he cannot yet see that he was mistaken in the main cause, nor dares he repent of it, nor forbear doing the same, if it were to doe again in the same state of things. <hi>He tells us indeed in the same place,</hi> that if he could be convinc'd he had sinned in this matter, he would as gladly make a publick recantation, as he would eat or drink: <hi>which seeing he hath not yet done, it is evident he is still of the same mind, and consequently would upon the same occasion doe the same things,</hi> viz. <hi>fight, and encourage as many thousands as he could to fight against the King for any thing that calls it self, or which he is pleased to call</hi> a full and free Parliament: <hi>as likewise that he would own and submit to any <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surper of the Sovereignty</hi> as set up by God, <hi>although he came to it by the murther of his Master, and by trampling upon the Parliament.</hi> Lastly, <hi>That he would hinder as much as possibly he could the restoring of the rightfull Heir unto the Crown. And now whether a man of this Judgment, and of these affections, ought to be permitted to Preach or no, Let any, but himself, judge.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>MAster <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his Book (called by him <hi>The true and onely way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of all Christian Churches)</hi> reflecting upon a Letter of mine, Written and Printed near 20 years before, saith; <hi>There are so many Mistakes in matter of fact in it, that although he had made an Answer to it, yet he cast it aside for Peace sake; believing, that the opening of the aforesaid so many mistakes would not easily be born:</hi> the rather, because (as he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:94113:35"/>
says in the words immediately foregoing) <hi>he knew he had greatly incurr'd both our displeasures already, (to wit,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s and mine) <hi>for what he had said and done against our Way; and that</hi> (as to my particular) <hi>the aforesaid Letter of mine was a proof of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, in the same <hi>Preface</hi> to the same Book, he saith, <hi>You,</hi> (meaning the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and Me, to whom he addresseth that Preface) <hi>have (above all men I know) effectually helped to bring us</hi> (meaning himself, and the rest of his Party) <hi>under.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s complements when he speaks to me, and therefore, I am not to expect more Civility from him, when he speaks of me, as he doth in divers of his Books which I have seen, and perhaps, in many more of them which I have not seen; (for I hope all men are not bound to reade all Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> writes:) But in those I have seen, when he speaks of me, it is neither <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris,</hi> nor <hi>Charitatis gratiâ;</hi> but to reproach me either directly and in express terms, (or covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by the bye) as, when in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the second part of his <hi>Plea for Nonconformists,</hi> he saith, <hi>It was Bishop</hi> Morley<hi>'s gross mistaking charge that made him write one whole Tract, or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, namely, That of things sinfull</hi> per Accidens <hi>or by accident.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, in the former part of the aforesaid <hi>Plea for Nonconformists,</hi> he saith, <hi>Bishop</hi> Morley <hi>advised him to reade</hi> Bilson <hi>and</hi> Hooker, <hi>in whom</hi> (saith he) <hi>I found more than he approv'd, for resisting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining of Kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, in another of his printed Papers; (I mean that Paper which he would have taken for a <hi>Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:94113:35"/>
of some of those <hi>Political Aphorisms,</hi> I had laid to his charge) though he do not name me, yet he points directly at me, as if I had accused him for asserting, <hi>That all humane powers are limited by God; which to deny</hi> (as he there insinuates I do <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>his Letter to Mr.</hi> Hinkley, <hi>and his last answer to Dr.</hi> Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet.</note> and elsewhere plainly tells me I do) <hi>is to defy Deity and Humanity:</hi> and consequently makes me a defyer of them both.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, with the same ingenuity and candour, he aims at me more obscurely, and more obliquely indeed, but yet more spitefully and more mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously; when in the close of his <hi>Animadversions upon the Dean of St.</hi> Paul's <hi>Sermon,</hi> he speaks of somebody that removed somebody from a great Man's service, who might have kept him from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statizing, if he had been suffered to continue with him; meaning my supposed removing Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> the Authour of <hi>Elymas the Sorcerer;</hi> from being one of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Chaplains.</p>
                     <p>These are the things that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth either <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>expresly,</hi> or <hi>implicitely</hi> and <hi>obliquely</hi> charge me withall: And perhaps there be many more in other of his voluminous Writings which I have not seen, nor heard of yet; and all of them as true perhaps as any of those I have here named, that is, not true at all, as I hope I shall make it appear to any indifferent and impartial <hi>Reader,</hi> that will take the pains to compare his several <hi>Allegations</hi> with my several <hi>Answers</hi> to them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. That this is a charge in general terms onely, without specifying any one of those <hi>many mistakes</hi> in <note place="margin">He names no one mistake.</note> particular.</p>
                     <p>And 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> that he names no body, no not so much as any one of his own Party, that now doth, or ever <note place="margin">Himself the only Accuser.</note> did for 20 years together, lay any such thing to my Charge besides himself; so that whether there be <hi>many</hi> or any, or if any <hi>mistakes,</hi> they being mistakes <hi>in matter of Fact</hi> (as he saith they are) there is no <hi>Constat,</hi> no other evidence, but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s bare Affirmation onely, whereunto my bare Negative ought in Law, Equity, and Reason to be esteemed a sufficient Answer.

                     <p>Be it so; but yet neither <hi>Bishop</hi> nor <hi>Presbyter,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">No one to be believed in his own Case.</note> nor any body else, is to be believed in his own Case, or upon his accusing of a third person upon his own word, or upon his own affirmation onely; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the accusation is general, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance thereof in particular. As if, when one man speaking of another, saith, he is a <hi>Liar,</hi> a <hi>Thief,</hi> or a <hi>Perjured person,</hi> he were to be believed, and the man he speaks of were to be thought to be such a one as he saith he is, without so much as naming, and much less proving any one particular either <hi>Lie</hi> or <hi>Theft</hi> or <hi>Perjury</hi> that he is guilty of.</p>
                     <p>What is this, but to make a <hi>Pope</hi> of a <hi>Presbyter?</hi> for the <hi>Pope</hi> claims no more than that his <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> his bare saying of a thing, should be proof enough to oblige men to believe what he affirms to be true, no nor so much neither as to <hi>matter of fact;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible as the Pope.</note> though some of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s shameless <hi>Sycophants</hi> have of late offered to maintain that he is as <hi>Infallible</hi> in matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> as he is in matter of <hi>Faith;</hi> and I verily believe him to be so. And I believe likewise that many of the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> have the same opinion of their <hi>Teachers,</hi> which the most <hi>Bigott-Papists</hi> have of their <hi>Pope,</hi> as to their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94113:37"/>
                        <hi>Veracity</hi> at least, if not to their <hi>Infallibility</hi> also. So I mean as undoubtingly to believe whatsoever they teach them in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> or tell them in matters of <hi>Fact.</hi> But whether it be because they are taught to believe so, or because their having such <hi>mens persons in admiration</hi> makes them believe so, I will not, I cannot determine: I hope it is the latter rather than the former, though I am afraid, some of their <hi>Teachers</hi> are well enough pleased they should so esteem and believe of them. Howsoever, or whatsoever may be the cause of it, We are sure enough, by undeniable experience, that it is so.</p>
                     <p>And truly Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth very much presume upon his own very <hi>great,</hi> or upon my very <hi>little</hi> Credit in the World, if he thinks that whatsoever he is pleased to say of me, without any proof or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it will for his own bare saying of it onely, be believed by any, but those of his own party; and by those of his own party, I mean not all the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists,</hi> but the <hi>Baxterian Nonconformists</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Baxterian Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</note> onely, if there be any such besides himself.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may perhaps say in his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that although in his aforesaid <hi>Preface</hi> to his <note place="margin">

Well, But <hi>Where</hi> is that <hi>Answer</hi> of his to that <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of mine? Why, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> after he had writ it <hi>laid</hi> it <hi>aside;</hi> for so Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself (which <note place="margin">Not likely that it was laid aside.</note> ought to be taken for proof enough) saith. But
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94113:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Why</hi> did he lay it aside? Sure he did not mean to lay it aside when he writ it: It was therefore for some very extraordinary reason, if he did so; For never any man had a greater <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>natural</hi> tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and <hi>affection</hi> for all the Issues of his own brain, <note place="margin">His writings; numerous,</note> than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seems to have; Which Issues of his are so numerous, as if he had begun to <hi>write</hi> assoon as he could <hi>speak,</hi> and to <hi>print</hi> assoon as he could <hi>write;</hi> and they do so croud to come into the world, that one seems to take hold of the heels of another, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did of <hi>Esau</hi>'s, strugling which should get out first, and from this striving, while they were yet in the womb of his brain, comes their so often <note place="margin">And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictious.</note> crossing, and contradicting of one another, after he is delivered of them.</p>
                     <p>This fondness of his towards his own concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the delight he takes in the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and publishing of them makes me think, that <note place="margin">His own reasons why he laid it aside.</note> either there was never any such <hi>Answer</hi> at all made by him, or if indeed there were any such Answer, there were some other reasons, besides what are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him, that made him forbear the Printing of it; for whereas he saith, <hi>It was for peace, or <hi>for peace sake</hi> that he laid it aside,</hi> or forbore printing it; <hi>because having already</hi> (that is, before my publishing of the aforesaid Letter) <hi>greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the Bishop of</hi> Ely<hi>'s displeasure and mine by what he had said and done against our Way, he believed the opening of so many mistakes in matter of fact</hi> (as were in that Letter) <hi>would not easily be born;</hi> and for that reason, he laid aside that <hi>Answer</hi> of his to that <hi>Letter</hi> of mine.</p>
                     <p>I cannot believe that this was the <hi>onely,</hi> or indeed <hi>any</hi> reason at all of his so doing; I mean it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94113:38"/>
his love of peace in general, nor his fear of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me any farther provocation in particular, that made him suppress that pretended <hi>Answer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>first,</hi> if he were of so peaceable a disposition <note place="margin">Not probable for peace-sake.</note> or so great a lover of <hi>Peace</hi> as he would seem to be, he would not have spent so much of his time in writing so many Volumes to keep up and increase <hi>Schism and Separation</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> together with <hi>Faction and Sedition</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> as he hath done.</p>
                     <p>Which might be made to appear yet farther from the <hi>manner,</hi> as well as the <hi>matter</hi> of his writing, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>Magisterial in his writing.</hi>
                        </note> which is so <hi>Magisterial,</hi> and with that contempt, undervaluing and vilifying of those he writes against, or that write against him, and sometimes with such exasperating and provoking language as very ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him that pretends to be a <hi>Peace maker.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And perhaps in such a style was that <hi>Answer</hi> of his written (if he writ any answer at all) to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <note place="margin">What likely might be the reason of his laying it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</note> 
                        <hi>Letter</hi> of mine; and then perhaps too, some wiser Friend of his might advise him to forbear printing of it, at least at that time, namely, at the <hi>King's first coming in,</hi> against one that came in a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and was sent by him, and had been, all the while the <hi>King</hi> was abroad, in Exile <hi>with</hi> him, and <hi>for</hi> him, and had newly received some more than ordinary marks of his <hi>Majestie's</hi> favour from him. These, or the like considerations to these, being suggested to him, might peradventure at that time prevail with him, rather wholly to suppress, or at least to defer the printing of that <hi>Answer</hi> of his (if there were any such answer) than thereby so unseasonably to provoke me more, <hi>whose displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> he saith, <hi>he had greatly incurr'd by what he had said and done against the Bishop of</hi> Ely<hi>'s way

and mine;</hi> as if the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and I had a Way of our own, wherein no body walked but our selves.</p>
                     <p>I would therefore fain know what he calls the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s way and mine, and <hi>for his speaking and acting against which, he had so greatly incurr'd that Bishop's and my displeasure:</hi> Is it a new or a newly found out <hi>Way,</hi> or a way of our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s way is of his? a way that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Baxter<hi>'s Way a New way of his own.</hi>
                        </note> never any walked in before, nor none but himself doth walk in yet, nor will (I believe) ever walk in hereafter. For it is neither <hi>Episcopal,</hi> nor <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> nor wholly <hi>Independent,</hi> nor any of any other denomination either <hi>ancient</hi> or <hi>modern,</hi> that I ever heard of; but partly of all, and partly of none of them. But <hi>Ours,</hi> I mean, the Way, which the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and I do walk in, is no <hi>By-path,</hi> not <note place="margin">The Bishop's Way the old Church of England<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> a Way of Sufferance or <hi>Toleration</hi> onely, such as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and all the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> plead for: but the <hi>Good old way,</hi> the <hi>King's,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s way, nay, the <hi>Catholick Churches</hi> High-way; the Way wherein all the <hi>Primitive Fathers, Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and all the <hi>Orthodox Christians</hi> in all Ages, (untill the last before this of ours) have gone before us. I mean the Government of the Church by <hi>Bishops,</hi> teaching all and nothing else, but what was taught by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> in point of <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and commanding nothing which God has forbidden, nor forbidding any thing which God has commanded, in the outward Administration of God's publick <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Service:</hi> but making use of that liberty and power that God hath left to his <hi>Church</hi> in order to Decency and Uniformity and Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and consequently in order to that Unity and <hi>Concord,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth so much pretend to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94113:39"/>
desire and plead for. This, and no other but this, is the Way of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and this, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but this is the Way, which the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and I do walk in, and would have all men else, that are born within the pale of our Church, to walk in also. And therefore, as we cannot chuse but be sorry for those that are led or kept out of this way, both for their <note place="margin">Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist Teachers draw and keep people out of the way.</note> own and the Churches sake, so we cannot chuse but be <hi>displeased</hi> too with those that not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to walk in it themselves, but endeavour and doe what they can to draw others from it, and to keep those that are gone out of it, from returning again into it, by making and preaching and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pleas</hi> and Apologies for <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> which can have no other end <hi>(consequentially</hi> at least, if not <hi>intentionally)</hi> but to confirm them in their <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity.</hi> And surely, he that would not forbear <note place="margin">

                        </note> to doe this, and to doe it over and over again, being so prejudicial and destructive to the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> (as We have experimentally found it to be) He (I say) that would not forbear to doe this for the publick peace sake, nor for fear of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the makers of those Laws against those things and persons, he so loudly and so boldly pleads for, did not in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility <hi>for peace sake</hi> (and much less for fear of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing Bishop <hi>Morley)</hi> forbear to publish what he had written in answer to that <hi>Letter</hi> of the Bishop's which would have been much less provoking, by specifying though not proving some of those <hi>many mistakes</hi> he now chargeth him with, without naming any of them, and consequently, as much as in him lies, imposing upon his <hi>Readers,</hi> especially such as are ill-affected to Bishops, an implicit belief, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94113:39"/>
there are indeed many, very many mistakes in the Bishop's Letter; and perhaps gross ones too, and such as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> could have named, and proved also; but being a man of so peaceable, so patient, and so meek a disposition as he is, he did <hi>for peace sake,</hi> and because he would not provoke the Bishop to be more displeased with him than he was already, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to doe so; <hi>Credat Judoeus, non Ego,</hi> Believe it who list for me, as he faith.</p>
                     <p>And therefore he must give me leave to think, upon better considerations, that he never writ any <note place="margin">Most likely that he writ no Answer.</note>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>peace,</hi> which he calls <hi>an extorted and distorted Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,</hi> or rather a bundle of Treatises bound up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And <hi>distorted</hi> enough indeed it is, but how or by whom it was <hi>extorted</hi> from him I know not; he seems by the many Books he hath written, to be so <hi>ready a Writer,</hi> that he needed not to have any thing he writes to be <hi>extorted</hi> from him. For indeed he is rather one of those, <hi>quibus difficile est non scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere,</hi> who are as hardly to be restrained from Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as others are from Preaching. But in this bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Treatises, whether <hi>extorted</hi> or not extorted, there is one wherein I am particularly concerned, He calls it, <hi>The judgment of Nonconformists of things sinfull by accident;</hi> and in his <hi>Preface</hi> to that whole bundle of Treatises, he saith, <hi>This Treatise in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular was written purposely to answer the gross mistaking charge of Bishop</hi> Morley.</p>
                     <p>And truly if he had not said so, or if that <hi>Treatise</hi> had been Printed by it self, I should neither by the <note place="margin">The Bishop's pretended mistake not mentioned in the Treatise written to answer it.</note> 
                        <hi>Title</hi> of it, nor by the <hi>Book</hi> it self have suspected it to have been purposely written against me, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any mistake of mine: For neither in the <hi>Title</hi> nor in the <hi>Book</hi> it self do I find Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> so much as once named, or any way so characterized by any thing I have said or done, as to conclude my self to be understood by it. Nay, I verily believe, that if I should grant all and every one of the sixty four <hi>Propositions</hi> asserted in that <hi>Treatise</hi> to be true, yet nevertheless whatsoever I have laid to Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s charge in that <hi>Letter</hi> of mine, would be true also; so that I cannot chuse but wonder that he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94113:41"/>
should say, as he does in the aforesaid Preface, <hi>That this particular Treatise of scandal or evil by accident was purposely written to answer the gross mistaking charge of Bishop</hi> Morley: whereas the <hi>Title page</hi> to that <hi>Treatise</hi> saith no such thing, neither is that wherein he saith the Bishop is so grosly mistaken to be found either <hi>in terminis terminantibus</hi> or <hi>oequipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentibus</hi> (either in downright terms, or in words that imply as much) in the whole <hi>Treatise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be replyed, that as the general <hi>Preface</hi> to the whole bundle of Treatises called <hi>The second Part of the Nonconformists Plea</hi> tells me, that I am the man that am guilty of so gross a mistake; so that the <hi>Title page</hi> to that particular <hi>Treatise,</hi> We are now speaking of, (though not <hi>explicitly</hi> and formally, yet <hi>implicitly,</hi> and intelligibly enough) tells me <note place="margin">That gross mistake, what it is.</note> what it was wherein I was so grosly mistaken, namely, <hi>in misreporting the Nonconformists judgment of things sinfull by accident.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I rejoyn <hi>(first)</hi> that unless Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks that every body is obliged to reade all that he Writes, he <note place="margin">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94113:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not have said as I have done in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he had not given so much as any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>many mistakes</hi> he saith there were in my printed <hi>Letter,</hi> as indeed he did not where he speaks of them to me; nay, he saith he had laid aside an Answer he had written to that Letter <hi>for peace sake,</hi> that he might not by <hi>opening</hi> or publishing so many mistakes of mine, give me any farther cause of being displeased with him. And yet two years <note place="margin">

                        </note> before (mark the ingenuity of the man) he had published a whole Book, consisting of sixty four <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> besides <hi>Quoeries,</hi> purposely intended then, (though he doth not say so in plain terms, till two years after) for an <hi>Answer to Bishop</hi> Morley<hi>'s gross mistaking charge;</hi> though neither then nor since, neither there nor any where else hath he yet told us what that gross mistaking charge is, but leaves it to be guessed at or collected out of the <hi>Title page</hi> to that <hi>Treatise,</hi> which he saith he purposely writ for an Answer to it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in whether he hath dealt justly and candidly either with me or with his readers, I am now to consider and examine, after I have premised out of what I have already said two or three short preliminary <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereof the <hi>first</hi> is this; That it was not, <note place="margin">Three Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations from what hath been said.</note> nor could not be <hi>for peace sake,</hi> nor because he would not give me any farther provocation, (as in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his Book of <hi>Concord</hi> he pretends it was) that he laid aside the <hi>Answer</hi> he saith he had made to my printed <hi>Letter;</hi> for then, he would not without any farther provocation on my part, have afterwards printed a whole Book on purpose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of one of the many mistakes in that <hi>Letter,</hi> or rather to expose me to the World, for having been guilty of so gross a mistake as he calls it.</p>

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:94113:42"/>
A <hi>second</hi> observation is this, That naming but one of those <hi>many mistakes</hi> he saith there were in that <hi>Letter</hi> of mine, he doth implicitly confess that he could name no more; because by aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that as much as he can, he declares he would not have forborn to specifie the rest, if there had been any more to be specified.</p>
                     <p>And consequently (which I would have to be observed in the <hi>third</hi> place) That if this which he calls a <hi>gross mistake,</hi> be no mistake at all of mine, but a very great Mistake, or rather a very great Calumny of his, as I doubt not but I shall prove it is, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had no reason to charge that <hi>Letter</hi> of mine with so many mistakes, nor I any reason to thank him for concealing of them.</p>

And how did Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> know, but that many hundred Souls during that long interval might be infected with that so dangerous a sin of believing the truth of that Charge, and die in that belief without repentance, merely for want of being helped to it by this so effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious or <hi>none-such</hi> a remedy, as is prescribed by him in this <hi>Treatise?</hi>
                     </p>

And then I would fain know, how his deferring so long to publish this so sovereign an Antidote and Remedy against so malignant, and Soulkilling a disease, could consist either with the charity he owes to other mens Souls, or the care of his own? For if it be true that when he did publish it, it was (as he tells us it was) <hi>For fear of dying with the guilt of silence upon him;</hi> why should not the same cause have produced the same effect sooner? Truly Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had little care of his own as well as of other mens Souls in the mean time, if he himself believes what he would have other men to believe, namely, that the believing of Bishop <hi>Morley</hi>'s mistaking Charge is of so very dangerous a consequence to those that die without

                     <p>FOr indeed I know not what the judgment of <hi>Nonconformists</hi> (if by <hi>Nonconformists</hi> he mean all the <hi>Nonconformists)</hi> is in this or in any other particular, except it be in being <hi>Dissenters</hi> from the Government and discipline of our Church, as it is by Law established; no nor what is the judgment of all the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> of any one <hi>species</hi> or kind of them, (whether <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Independents</hi> or <hi>Anabaptists</hi> or <hi>Antinomians</hi> or any other of any one denomination) as to this particular.

                        <note place="margin">Without their Commission or approbation.</note> party of the <hi>Nonconformists.</hi> Which I am the bolder to affirm, because having sometimes occasionally made use of his Authority in point of <hi>opinion,</hi> and of his Example in point of <hi>practice,</hi> for the convincing of some both <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> who by their practice seemed to be of another judgment in diverse things, than he was, I found that what he said or did signified little or nothing unto them: Nay, they told me in plain terms, that I was very much mistaken, if I thought that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s either judgment or practice was of so great weight with them, as for that reason onely, to make them alter their own either judgment or practice in any thing whatsoever: So that it doth not follow, that because Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> in that printed Letter of his saith that this or that was Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Assertion, therefore he said, or must be understood as if he had said, it was the assertion of all or indeed of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> but of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself onely.

with him in that <hi>Assertion,</hi> which I lay unto his charge, though he saith, <hi>he concurr'd with them in it.</hi> I charge <hi>him</hi> with it, because (as I tell him in my printed <hi>Letter)</hi> he did often affirm and declare it to be his; and I discharge <hi>them</hi> from it, because neither of them did affirm or declare it to be theirs, but rather seem'd to dislike it, and to dissent from him in it.</p>

We see you have done so once already, and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it often both before and since, and why may not you do so again?

                        <hi>King</hi> too.

Now whether the People of <hi>England</hi> will be content to be at such a Charge, and to live under such a Government, those that would have such a <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> or <hi>Toleration of Religion</hi> as there is in <hi>Holland,</hi> let them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94113:48"/>
enquire of the peoples Representatives, and Petition them to that purpose at their next meeting.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time all their <hi>Pleas for Peace</hi> are but sowing the seeds of War, or like <hi>Cadmus</hi> sowing the serpents teeth, which presently grew up to so many armed men, and presently fell a cutting one anothers throats; which though it will not be the first work the <hi>Sectaries</hi> will doe, yet it will come to that at last.</p>
                     <p>For preventing whereof, considering the nature of man, and the animosity, and the irreconcileableness of differences in <hi>Religion,</hi> there is no other way to secure the publick Peace either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> no nor the several <hi>Sectaries</hi> themselves, from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and destroying one another, but either the suppressing of them all, by execution of the Laws that are or may be made against them, or by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awing of them all by such a standing force, as may be always ready and able to keep them from joyning together against the Government, or to dissipate them if they should joyn.</p>
                     <p>But if the safety of the <hi>Government</hi> might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and secured by either of the two aforesaid <note place="margin">The necessity the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders lie under of keeping up a standing force at Land and Sea.</note> Ways, why did not the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>

I answer, because they were always after their revolt from <hi>Spain</hi> in danger of Invasion from abroad, as well as of differences and divisions among themselves at home; and therefore, there was and always will be a necessity of their having and keeping up such a force both at Land and Sea, for their own defence against their potent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Enemies, as could not possibly be supported
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94113:48"/>
and maintained, but by so vast an Income of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue as was not to be expected from so small a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory as theirs is, though never so industriously husbanded, or thriftily managed, without the help of many more hands, than their own to work and fight for them; and of many more mouths than their own, to consume what the Commodities of their own growth and their trading with other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions brings in to them; together with the product of that Consumption by the <hi>Excise</hi> that is laid upon <note place="margin">Their Excise and other Taxes.</note> all things that are eat, or drunk, or worn, or bought or sold amongst them: And hence it is, and from other <hi>Taxes</hi> and Impositions (which are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any that by the <hi>Turks</hi> are imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Christians)</hi> which all that live amongst them are subject to, that they are able to maintain such <hi>Armies</hi> and <hi>Navies</hi> as they do and must do for their defence against any sudden and powerfull Invasion of them by their enemies that lie round about them; and this makes them not onely to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as many as <hi>will,</hi> but to invite and incourage as many as they <hi>can,</hi> to come and live there, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to be of what <hi>Religion</hi> they please a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves (so they contribute to the publick Charges as well as they who are of the Religion of the Countrey) because the more mouths they have to eat and drink, the more hands they are able to keep in pay, to oppose any Invasion from without, and withall to suppress and prevent any Commotion or Insurrection from within also. So that there the <hi>Toleration</hi> of so many <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Sectaries</hi> as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, is not onely not dangerous, but in a Political sense very usefull and advantageous to that Government, by helping them to keep up and pay
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94113:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Army, which otherwise they must have kept up wholly at their own Charges; by which Army, the <hi>Sectaries</hi> that help to keep it <hi>up</hi> are themselves kept <hi>under.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here with us (thanks be to God) there is no need of having or keeping up a <hi>Standing Army,</hi> to <note place="margin">We under no such necessity.</note> defend us against Invasions from abroad; being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fortified and intrenched within so wide and deep a ditch as cannot be passed on a sudden to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize us, nor at all with such a Force as may very much indanger us, but We shall hear of it time enough to provide against it, by joyning all of us (I mean all the whole Nation) together to oppose it, as certainly all of us, (unless we be mad, or worse than mad) shall do upon such an occasion, when our lives, our Wives and all that We have are at stake. And therefore (I say) We need not always be at the Charge of keeping up an <hi>Army,</hi> against any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy, having the Sea for our Wall, and our Ships for our Bulwarks, nor for the preventing of any Insurrection or Rebellion at home neither, if the good <hi>Laws</hi> which are already made be put in execution, especially those that are made to secure <note place="margin">Provided the Laws be put in execution.</note> the established Government both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> I mean those Laws that are made against all <hi>Recusants</hi> or <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> by what name soever they are specified or distinguished: But if instead of putting those <hi>Laws</hi> in execution, there shall be such a <hi>Toleration</hi> granted here, as there is in <hi>Holland,</hi> there will be a necessity of raising and keeping up such a <hi>standing Army</hi> here, as there is there, though not to defend us against our Enemies abroad, yet to keep peace and prevent a <hi>Civil War</hi> at home, which will infallibly be the product of such a <hi>Toleration,</hi>

if there be not always a <hi>Standing Army</hi> to prevent it; and truly if there must be such an Army, it is but reason, that they for the keeping down of whom it is raised and kept up, should be at all the charge of raising and keeping up of it.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN order whereunto We are first to consider, what the <hi>Assertion</hi> was that I charge Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, He in his <hi>Title page</hi> to the <hi>Treatise</hi> (which he saith was purposely written to answer that Charge) saith it was this <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
                        <q>Whatsoever may be the Occasion of sin to any, must be taken away; or that Nothing may be imposed which Men may take scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal at, or by Accident turn to sin.</q> But the truth is that neither the one nor the other of these <hi>Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> was that with which I charged Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:94113:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either in my Sermon at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> or in my printed <hi>Letter;</hi> but that <hi>Assertion</hi> which I charged him with, both in my aforesaid <hi>Sermon,</hi> and in my aforesaid <hi>Letter,</hi> was this, and no other but this. <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That the enjoyning things lawfull by lawfull Authority, if they may by Accident be the Occasion of Sin, is sinfull:</q> From whence, (if it were true) it would follow, that nothing may be imposed, that may be Accident be the occasion of Sin, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> which was then the thing in question; but then it would follow like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that nothing at all could be impos'd (as I then told Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and since repeated in my aforesaid <hi>Letter)</hi> by any <hi>Civil,</hi> any more than by any <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> nor by any <hi>Divine,</hi> more than by any <hi>Humane</hi> Authority; because there is nothing which either man or God himself hath commanded, but considering the pravity of humane nature, it may by Accident, be the occasion of Sin. Now that this <hi>Assertion,</hi> which draws along with it all these Consequences, was that very Assertion, with which I charge Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in my <hi>Letter,</hi> and did charge him with in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> appears partly by the <hi>Letter</hi> it self, which I have reprinted, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Passage in a book Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had printed before, which was the occasion of my Writing and printing that Letter, and therefore I have reprinted that provoking passage of his also; both which I must desire the Reader of these Papers to peruse before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that he may be the better able to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what I have said already, touching what was the <hi>Assertion</hi> I charged him with, as likewise, what I shall say to prove he did assert it, be true or no; and consequently whether I in charging him with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94113:51"/>
it was grosly mistaken, or he, in denying he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted it, be not worse than grosly mistaken. For surely he cannot chuse but know and remember whether he asserted it or no. But <hi>Affirmantis est probare,</hi> (as I said before) It lies upon him who affirms a thing, to prove it; and therefore seeing he denies it, I must prove it.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:94113:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore as his not denying the <hi>Minor</hi> of the first <hi>Syllogism,</hi> was in effect a Confession, that our Church commands nothing in that Book but what is lawfull in it self, so his not denying of the <hi>Minor</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Syllogism,</hi> is in effect, a confession also, that the Church injoyns nothing in that Book under an unjust penalty: for still the Proposition he denies is the <hi>Major</hi> in this Syllogism, as well as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, without taking any exception to the <hi>Minor</hi> in either of them.</p>
                     <p>But why did he deny the <hi>Major</hi> of this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism? <note place="margin">

                        </note> or what reason or reasons did he give for it?

                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Assertion charged home upon-Mr.</hi> B.</note> 
                        <hi>Accident it might be the occasion of Sin;</hi> though it were not commanded under an unjust penalty, and though that evil, whereof it might be the occasion by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, were not such as the Commander was obliged to provide against; For all this he thatdenies the aforesaid <hi>Major</hi> Proposition of the last ofthe aforesaid three <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisms,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did, must needs grant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently must he needs grant and assert also, (if he will not contradict himself) That any command of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nything though never so lawfull in it self, by what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority soever it is commanded, is unlawfull, if it may be the occasion of Sin though <hi>per Accidens</hi> onely; and though that Accidental Sin or evil be such, as the Commander either did not, or could not foresee, or was not obliged to provide against it: For all this is consequentially and necessarily affirmed and asserted by him that denies the aforesaid <hi>Major</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position for no other reason, but because the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand may by Accident be the Occasion of Sin. But if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> shall say he gave another reason for his denial of the aforesaid Proposition, namely, that such a Command, though never so lawfull in it self, might become unlawfull, if it were commanded <hi>under an unjust penalty;</hi> I confess he did, but most illogically and irrationally; because one of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Command which the Proposition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denies to be lawfull, is, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94113:55"/>
it must not be commanded <hi>under an unjust penalty,</hi> and the reason why Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denies it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is, because it is or at least it may be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under an unjust Penalty: which is all one as if he had said that which is not so, is so, because it may be so.</p>
                     <p>This reason therefore being so expressly excluded as it is from being any reason at all why the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied should be, or could be denied with any shew or colour of reason, there was nothing left him to resort to or rely on as his last refuge, but his first reason; namely, because such a command, though it was not commanded under an unjust penalty, yet it might be the occasion of Sin <hi>per Accidens,</hi> and therefore unlawfull to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; which being given for a reason for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of the aforesaid Proposition of the last Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism, he could not mean it of such an evil <hi>per Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> as that the commander ought to provide against, because it was another of the Conditions expressly required by the <hi>Proposition</hi> it self, to make a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand lawfull, that as it should not command any thing evil in it self, so it should not command any thing neither though never so good in it self, that might by accident be the occasion of such an evil, as the Commander ought to prevent or provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; so that the occasion of evil in that sense <hi>per Accidens,</hi> could not be the reason why Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied the Proposition; and therefore by evil <hi>per Accidens</hi> in relation to this Proposition and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it, he must needs mean such an evil <hi>per Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens,</hi> as was neither commanded under an unjust penalty, nor such as the Commander was obliged to hinder or prevent. Whence it follows that

Bishop <hi>Morley</hi>'s charging him with asserting, <hi>That the command of that which is lawfull in it self is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>His other Instance of Kneeling at the Sacrament, as imposed by an unjust Penalty, were it true, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Case.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd so is the other <hi>Instance</hi> of his likewise which makes the two reasons (which in his aforesaid Answer he did severally insist upon) to be but one, namely, <q>
                           <hi>Supposing</hi> (saith he) <hi>to kneel at the Sacrament to be never so lawfull in it self, if it be imposed by a</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">His Instance of kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous;</note> 
                           <hi>penalty incomparably beyond the proportion of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that Penalty is an accident of the Command, and maketh it by Accident sinfull in the Commander.</hi>
                        </q> This <hi>instance</hi> I say of his, though he speaks of it as very pertinent and argumentative, yet is it as <hi>frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> and <hi>impertinent</hi> as any of the former; I mean as to the discharging him from the Charge I charge him with, and which his denying of the aforesaid Proposition proves him to be guilty of. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing all that he supposeth in this Instance to be <note place="margin">Supposing an unjustpenalty;</note> never so true; namely, that the penalty for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament is an accident to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Kneeling, and supposing too, that penalty to be incomparably beyond the proportion of the offence, and consequently must needs make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it self to be Sinfull in the Commander of it under such a penalty; supposing all this (I say) to be true: what then? Doth this prove the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a thing lawfull in it self and commanded under no unjust penalty to be sinfull in the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it? For this it must prove, or it proves nothing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94113:57"/>
at all, as to the discharging Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> from what his denial of the aforesaid proposition proves against him. For doth not that proposition say <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or in express words, that <q>
                           <hi>The command which it affirms to be a lawfull command, must,</hi> first, <hi>command an act in it self lawfull; and,</hi> secondly, <hi>no other Act whereby an unjust penalty is injoyned; nor,</hi> thirdly, <hi>any circumstance whence directly or</hi> per Accidens <hi>any Sin is consequent, which the Commander ought to provide against?</hi>
                        </q> And yet such a Command so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied did Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then deny to be lawfull, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the aforesaid subscribed <hi>Attestation.</hi> And now, what he then denied to be lawfull, though it were not commanded under an unjust penalty, he would by this instance prove to be unlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is commanded, or rather because he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it to be commanded under an unjust penalty. <hi>Quo te constringam Protea nodo?</hi> What tye can hold one, who so <hi>Proteus</hi> like shifts his shape? For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be or be not commanded under an unjust pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, the command it seems must be alike unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Disciples list not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, that is, if they themselves are not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of it.</p>
                     <p>Again supposing, but not granting Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s supposed unjust penalty for not kneeling at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <note place="margin">And supposing such an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as the commander ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide again?.</note> of the Sacrament to be an Accident to the command of kneeling; I ask him, whether it be such an accident as the Commander ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against, or no? If not, how can it be sinfull in the Commander to command it? or how can it make his commanding of it to be unlawfull? But if it be such an Accident as the Commander ought to provide against, (as indeed every unjust penalty is)
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94113:58"/>
then this <hi>instance</hi> of his is altogether as <hi>frivolous</hi> and <hi>impertinent</hi> as any of his former. For that command which we affirmed, and he denied to be lawfull, and consequently asserted to be unlawfull, was to be such a Command as commanded an Act lawfull in it self, and no other Act whence directly or <hi>per Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens</hi> any Sin is consequent, which the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ought to provide against: But this instance of his, is of such a Command, as is <hi>per accidens</hi> at least the cause or occasion of some such evil, or sin, as the Commander ought or is obliged to provide against. Whereas if he had meant to speak pertinently (in order to the discharging himself from my charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him) he should have given us an Instance of the unlawfulness of a lawfull command by lawfull Authority, where no evil which the Commander ought to provide against, was any way consequent either directly or by Accident onely. But this he hath not done yet, nor I dare say ever will doe, or can doe, though the <hi>Metaphysical Limbeck</hi> of his brain sweat never so much for it.</p>

                     <p>ANd thus having (as I suppose) made it appear that all Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Instances are <hi>frivolous</hi> and <hi>impertinent</hi> as to the proving what I charge him with, to be a <hi>gross mistake,</hi> or indeed any mistake

at all, I am now to make it appear also, that those before specified Instances of his, are not onely <hi>fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous</hi> and <hi>impertinent,</hi> but <hi>fraudulent, scandalous</hi> and <hi>injurious,</hi> and (I am afraid) <hi>malicious</hi> also, as to the intention and design of them.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94113:59"/>
supposing <hi>to kneel at the receiving of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to be lawfull, yet the enjoining of it under an unjust penalty makes the Command it self to be unlawfull; he would make it to be believed that he did not deny the command of a lawfull thing by lawfull authority to be lawfull, unless it were injoined or commanded under an unjust pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, such as he supposeth the penalty for not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament kneeling to be.

                        </note> this last instance to the former, and considering them one with another, or all of them together, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in alledging of them must needs be this, to make it to be believed that whereas Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> chargeth him with having affirmed the Command of a lawfull Act by lawfull Authority to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if by accident it might be the cause of sin; all that he said or at least all that he meant was this, that such a Command was unlawfull, if the evil, it might by accident be the cause of, was foreseen and ought to have been prevented by him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, or if it were commanded under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just penalty; and consequently that Bishop <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s charge of him was a <hi>gross mistake.</hi>

evil as the Commandee, not the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be guilty of; and if no Command be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that may be the occasion of such an evil, then (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> truly tells his <hi>Kidderminster</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Assertion ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> Friends) <hi>Bishop</hi> Morley <hi>did infer that no Command either of God or man could be lawfull,</hi> or (as he is pleased to word it) <hi>That neither God nor man can enjoyn any thing without Sin,</hi> if the sinfulness, it may by accident be the occasion of in those to whom the Command is given, be to be imputed either to the Command, or to the Commander, which I think is little less than blasphemy to affirm; and therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had reason to disguise the <hi>Assertion</hi> I charge him with, by giving such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances <note place="margin">His Instances onely disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.</note> of it as are nothing a kin to it; for all his aforesaid instances are instances of the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such Commands as are or may be the cause or occasion of some such evil or mischief as the Commander foresees and is obliged to prevent, or of such as are commanded under an unjust penalty. Whereas if he would have dealt ingenuously and pertinently he should have given us one instance at least, if not more of the unlawfulness of such a Command, (as he asserted at the <hi>Conference</hi> to be unlawfull, namely of the unlawfulness of such a Command) as was neither commanded under an unjust penalty, nor was the occasion or cause of any such evil, mischief or sin, as the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der did not foresee, or was not bound to prevent.

will be made of it, because it may fall out that some body or other may be poysoned with it? Or how doth the unlawfulness of commanding a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> to Sea, when the Commander foresees it will fall into the Enemies hands, prove the unlawfulness of such a Command, because by such a chance as the Commander did not, nor could not foresee, it did fall into the Enemies hands? or lastly, how doth the unlawfulness of commanding to <hi>kneel</hi> at the receiving of the Sacrament, if it were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under an unjust penalty, as he supposeth, (but did not nor cannot prove it is) prove the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the same command if it be not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under an unjust penalty, as We and all other <hi>Protestant</hi> Churches in the World, as well as ours, say it is not? for proof whereof I refer the Reader to what I have said long ago in my printed <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

If there be any such <hi>Casuists</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, I will readily acknowledge they are as bad, if not worse than the worst of the <hi>Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites;</hi> but let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> name any, at least one such <hi>Casuist</hi> of ours, if he can, or if he cannot, if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:94113:62"/>
he have any thing of Ingenuity left in him, let him confess his <hi>fraudulent</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us and repent of it. For as for that passage which he quotes out of <hi>Ecclesiastical Polity</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Page.</hi> 23.</note> to prove the Authour of that Book such a <hi>Casuist</hi> as he speaks of, it is so illogical and unconcluding, that none but one that cares not what he says, or that thinks his <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> his own bare saying, is enough to conclude <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> any thing from any thing, would have quoted it upon such an occasion.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I do not, I cannot deny, but <note place="margin">Some amongst us as bad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists as the Jesuits.</note> there be some, nay many <hi>Casuists</hi> among us, (but they are not of us) as bad as any of the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> especially in that <hi>Casuistical</hi> doctrine which is most <hi>Jesuitical;</hi> I mean, that of the lawfulness of <hi>Subjects</hi> taking Arms against their <hi>Sovereign;</hi> nay of selling, buying, imprisoning, deposing and murthering of Kings by their Subjects; I need not name those Casuists, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows whom I mean. But of this no more at this time, neither should there have been so much, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had not forgotten what he might have learned at School without going to the University; that <hi>Qui alterum accusat probri, ipsum se intueri oportet,</hi> He who chargeth another with a crime, ought to look home to himself: and it is but just, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t qui ex maledicendo voluptatem ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, malè audiendo amittat;</hi> That he who takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in speaking ill of others, should lose that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by having his own faults told him.</p>
                     <p>And indeed I have very often and very much wondred, that of all men living Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> should reproach us so frequently, so loudly, and so ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly as he does, with what he knows himself and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94113:63"/>
his party may most justly and undeniably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with, unless he thinks the calling of an honest Woman <hi>Whore first</hi> will make her that calls her so, to be thought an honest Woman. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed men are apt to believe that one would not for shame accuse another of what he knows himself to be more guilty; but experience proves the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And I hope I have proved it too, partly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming my <hi>Charge</hi> against Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and partly by confuting his <hi>Calumny</hi> against me. But the truth is, when Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is in his fit of raving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Charge of the forementioned Assertion renewed and made good against Mr.</hi> B. <hi>notwithstanding that late Treatise of his which he pretends was purposely written in answer to it.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IF it be objected, that I have said nothing yet in answer to the <hi>Creatise,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith he writ on purpose to prove my <hi>Charge</hi> against him, to <hi>be a gross mistake;</hi> I confess I have not, because in truth I do not see how I am concerned in it, or how <note place="margin">That Treatise of his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to this business.</note> any thing I charge Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> withall, is disproved, or so much as offered to be disproved by it. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that (as I said before) if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had set out that <hi>Treatise</hi> by it self, and had not in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to another of his Treatises told me himself, it was purposely written against me, I should not have taken any notice of it at all; neither do I yet, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reading of it over and over again and again) see any reason why I should put my self to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of writing, or any body else to the trouble of reading, any thing in reply to it; because if all and every one of his sixty three <hi>Metaphysical Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> (of which that Treatise of his doth consist) were all of them so many <hi>Mathematical Demonstrations</hi> (as perhaps he thinks they are) yet my Charge of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would still stand in full force against him, being not so much as touched, much less o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, by any of those Propositions. For <note place="margin">His charge repeated.</note> what was that I charged Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> withall? was it not this? That he at the Conference in the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:94113:64"/>
denyed the command of a thing lawfull in it self, and commanded by lawfull authority, to be a lawfull command, if by accident it might be the cause or occasion of Sin? Yes, will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> say, but then <note place="margin">His sham Answer,</note> by <hi>accident</hi> I meant not every accident, but such an accident as the Commander might and ought to prevent; as for example, the commanding it <hi>under an unjust penalty</hi> (for that he will have to be an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident)</hi> or the commanding of it, though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander knows or foresees it will by accident be the cause or occasion of some such evil, or mischief, <hi>as he can and ought to provide against.</hi> And in the one or the other of these two notions of an accident, would Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have his <hi>Assertion</hi> (of the unlawfulness of a Command of a lawfull thing by lawfull Authority, if by accident it may be the occasion of Sin) to be understood; and I cannot blame him; for <hi>Secundoe cogitationes sunt meliores,</hi> Second thoughts are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiser and better than the first. But that he did not then by such an <hi>accident</hi> as made a lawfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to it.</note> unlawfull, mean an accident in either of those notions is evident, by his frequently and finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the command of a thing lawfull in it self to be lawfull, if by accident it may be the cause of Sin, though it be not injoyned under an unjust penalty, and though the accidental evil or mischief, it may be cause or occasion of, be such as the Commander either cannot or ought not to provide against. Now, he that denies such a command as this to be lawfull, or (which is all one) asserts such a command as this to be unlawfull, because by accident it may be the cause of Sin, cannot either <hi>Grammatically</hi> or <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> be understood, to mean such an <hi>accident</hi> or accidental Sin as the Commander ought to provide
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94113:64"/>
against; and consequently, if he mean any thing, he must needs mean such an <hi>accident,</hi> or acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal evil, as not the Commanding, but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded party, is to answer for. And therefore as <note place="margin">The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Assertion.</note> I said then so I say now, That to assert the lawfull command of a lawfull thing, to be unlawfull, upon such an account, or because it may by such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> must needs be understood to mean) be the cause or occasion of Sin, is destructive of all Legislative power Divine as well as Humane: And therefore Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> was not grosly mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either in charging Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with such an asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in charging such an assertion with such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and pernicious consequences, as he affirms, and I confess I did.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth grosly abuse me, and his <note place="margin">His soul dealing.</note> Reader too, by substituting a true <hi>Assertion</hi> instead of a false one for himself, and a false one instead of a true one for the Bishop and his party. As if that which he asserted, was, The unlawfulness of the command of a lawfull thing, if either it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under an unjust penalty, or the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it did foresee it would be the cause of some such great evil or sin, as he was obliged to prevent; and that which we had asserted, was, The lawfulness of a Command of a thing lawfull in it self, though it were commanded under never so unjust a penalty, or though the Commander of it foresaw it would be the cause of such an evil or mischief as he might and ought to prevent. And as to make the latter of these two <hi>Assertions</hi> to be believed to be ours, he brings in the aforesaid <hi>Suppositions</hi> and fraudulent instances of <hi>selling of poyson,</hi> &amp;c. So to make the former to be believed to have been his Assertion
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94113:65"/>
                        <hi>then,</hi> he asserts that, and none but that <hi>now;</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his friendly or unwary Readers will believe it was the very same which he asserted then. And this indeed he might have reason to hope for from his Friends at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> who he knew would believe whatsoever he told them, to be, as he said it was, especially telling it them in print, and before there was any thing in print to the contrary; but that he should think to impose such a belief upon the impartial part of the World, after the truth of what I charge him with had been so long before at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested in print, under the hands of two such men, as the Bishops of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Chester,</hi> (who could not chuse but know what was then said on both sides) is a confidence that never any yet even of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s own party hath assumed, and I believe never will.</p>
                     <p>Good reason therefore had I to reprint that <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion annexed to the printed Letter proves the charge of that Assertion against Mr.</hi> B.</note> of mine together with the aforesaid <hi>Attestation</hi> annexed to it, that what is in question betwixt Mr. <hi>Baxter and me</hi> might truly and clearly be stated, (namely, whether he did, or did not assert what I charge him with) which being onely <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and consequently no way to be decided but by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and such Witnesses as cannot justly, nor ever were actually, either by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself, or any of his party, in so many years since excepted against; and they having testified so clearly and effectually (as they do) that charge of mine against Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> I know not what needed to have been done more, for my justification and his conviction, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing of the testimony of two such Witnesses as <note place="margin">Nothing he saith now can invalidate that testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> they are. Against whose Testimony, as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validating of it, nothing he asserts now, though never
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94113:65"/>
so true, nor none of the <hi>Instances</hi> he gives of such an <hi>Assertion,</hi> though never so pertinent, do, or can signifie any thing; for that which I charge him with, and what the aforesaid Witnesses testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, is onely concerning what he asserted <hi>then,</hi> and not what he hath asserted at any time since, or doth assert <hi>now;</hi> which, as is already proved, is very far from being the same which he asserted then. And this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself must needs confess, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he will say (as I think he will not) that there is no difference betwixt denying (as he did then) the command of a lawfull thing to be lawfull, though it be not commanded under an unjust penalty, and the denying (as he doth now) the lawfulness of such a command if it be commanded under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just penalty; or as if it were all one to assert (as he did then) the command of a thing lawfull in it self to be unlawfull, if by accident it might be the cause or occasion of evil or sin, though it were such an evil or sin as the Commander was not obliged to prevent; and to assert (as he doth now) such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be unlawfull, if the evil or sin which it might be the cause of, were foreseen and ought to have been prevented by the Commander: But these <note place="margin">What he saith now, contrary to what he said then.</note> Assertions being so contrary, (as they are) to one another, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s asserting that which is true <hi>now,</hi> will not excuse him from having asserted that which was false <hi>then,</hi> which was all that I charged him with. If he hath changed his mind since, and be ashamed to own and maintain now, what he then held and asserted, and therefore sought to palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and disguise it as well as he could, yet he ought not to have excused himself by accusing me, (and which is much worse) by endeavouring to make it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94113:66"/>
to be believed that we of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party asserted the Command of a lawfull thing to be lawfull, if it were commanded by lawfull Authority, though under never so unjust a penalty, and though the Commander did foresee that it would by accident be the cause of never so great a mischief, and such as he knew he was bound to prevent; as the <hi>selling of Poyson</hi> by an Apothecary who foresees it will be made use of to poyson some body; and thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that they were onely such things as this, or of the like nature to this, which we asserted, and he denied to be lawfull; which is evidently and equally <note place="margin">His false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the thing</note> false in relation to us, and to himself also; for we never asserted the lawfulness of the one nor denied the unlawfulness of the other, as he would have it to be believed we did; so that to what I charged him with before, I must now add not onely his want of ingenuity in disguising and misrepresenting what <hi>He</hi> asserted or denied, but his being guilty of Calumny also, in disguising and misrepresenting what <hi>we</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted or denied, at the aforesaid Conference in the <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore this being the ground of all that he <note place="margin">That Treatise of his ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a false supposition.</note> hath said in that <hi>Treatise,</hi> of which he saith it was purposely written against me to confute my <hi>gross mistaking charge</hi> against him, needs no refutation, because it proceeds all the way <hi>ex falso supposito,</hi> upon a false supposition, as if what he asserts there, were the same that he asserted at the Conference; or as if, because what he asserted afterwards was true, therefore what he had said before was not false; or lastly, as if, because he doth not continue to say so, therefore he never did say so; by which kind of <hi>Logick</hi> he might as well conclude he never thought
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94113:66"/>
it lawfull to fight against the <hi>King,</hi> because he now doth not, or at least pretends he doth not; or that he never writ all his <hi>Political Aphorisms,</hi> because he tells us since that he hath recanted some of them; or that he never thought it lawfull to <hi>subscribe</hi> and <hi>conform,</hi> when he was ordained by a <hi>Bishop,</hi> because he doth not think so now: such Inferences as these are not, nor cannot be true, when they are affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any fallible and mutable subject, as all men are both in their Words and Actions; and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (will some men say) hath been so as much as any man in both of them. So that having sufficiently <note place="margin">The issue of the whole matter; His charge stands good.</note> proved, that which I charged Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> with, which was, what he asserted <hi>then,</hi> I have sufficiently discharged my self from being so grosly mistaken as he pretended, or indeed from being mistaken at all; And therefore need say nothing, or at least no more than I have said already in answer to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Book or <hi>Treatise</hi> of his, which onely tells us what his Judgment of things sinfull <hi>per accidens</hi> is <hi>now</hi> but not what it was <hi>then;</hi> which was the thing and onely thing I charged him withall, which he is so far from disproving, that he doth not as much as deny it, or take any notice at all of it, in this whole <hi>Treatise,</hi> which he pretends purposely to have written for the confutation of it; which it is so far from confuting, that there be several of his own <hi>Propositions</hi> in that Treatise that do implicitly and <note place="margin">His own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> consequentially justifie my <hi>Charge</hi> against him, by proving that <hi>Proposition</hi> of ours to be true, which he then denied as false.</p>
                     <p>For Example, <hi>Prop.</hi> 31. <note n="*" place="margin">Vid <hi>his book of Things sinfull by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</hi>
                        </note> He saith, <hi>Rulers may command many things which the Subject may by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent make sinfull for himself to doe.</hi> And in the next
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94113:67"/>
Proposition, he saith, <hi>There be some accidents ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Act commanded unlawfull, which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander may and ought to make provision against, or prevent; But there are some which he neither can, nor is bound therefore to forbear or to change his Laws; because</hi> (as it follows in the next Proposition) <hi>the publick welfare is not to be hazarded to save a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person from himself, and from his sinfull inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ill doing.</hi> And of such Laws, and of such evils, and of such onely <hi>per accidens</hi> did our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in express terms affirm then, what Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> asfirms now, but then denied.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Propos.</hi> 36. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith, <hi>Wicked men are so much inclined to turn all things into sin, that it is not possible to command any thing so good, which bad men may not make sinfull use of.</hi> Which I hope Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> intends not for an Argument to prove the command of lawfull things by lawfull Authority to be unlawfull; nor consequently, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his aforesaid denial of our aforesaid Proposition, or to disprove my Charge against him for denying of it.</p>
                     <p>Much less doth that Instance he gives in his 48 <note place="margin">The instance of an Aptthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's selling poyson can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, ed.</note> 
                        <hi>Proposition</hi> come near to what is controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and me, and was then controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and our Disputants at the <hi>Savoy.</hi> I mean the so often alledged aforesaid instance of an <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary</hi>'s <hi>selling of Poyson</hi> to one whom he knows will use it to murther himself, or some body else with it; <hi>which to maintain or justifie to be lawfull, because it is a sin</hi> per accidens, <hi>is,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Baxter, an inhumane Errour:</hi> And so indeed it is; and therefore as we were worse than the worst of men, if his imputation of it to us were true; so it being so false, that nothing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94113:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can be falser, I will not say what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is, but I will say that his imputing that inhumane Errour <note place="margin">

                        </note> unto us, as being held, taught, or countenanced, or any way connived at by us, or by any <hi>Casuist</hi> of ours, is an inhumane and Diabolical slander. For we would have Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> know, that we are not <hi>so muddy brain'd</hi> (as he is pleased to say we are) but we can and do distinguish betwixt what a Man doth or may foresee, and what he doth not or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; as likewise betwixt what a Commander can, and is obliged to hinder, and what either he cannot, or is not obliged to hinder. The former is Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Apothecary's case, and therefore we do not call his <hi>selling of Poyson</hi> (knowing what mischief will be done with it) a sin or cause of sin <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may call it so if he pleases, <hi>Nobis</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Case rightly stated.</note> 
                        <hi>non licet esse tam disertis,</hi> but we that love to speak plain English, and <hi>to call a spade a spade,</hi> do not call such a <hi>selling of Poyson,</hi> a casual or an accidental, but an intended and a presumptuous sin; not a <hi>Chance-medley,</hi> but <hi>wilfull murther</hi> in the Seller, as well as in the Buyer of the poyson. Because though the selling and the buying of poyson be not sinfull <hi>per se,</hi> or in it self, abstracting from the End for which, and the Intention with which it is sold or bought, because it may be sold and bought and used for a good end as well as for a bad; yet in Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Apothecary's case, the selling as well as the buying of it is sinfull <hi>per se</hi> and not <hi>per accidens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Seller is supposed to foresee what the Buyer will doe with it. For according to our <hi>Grammar,</hi> and our <hi>Logick</hi> too, <hi>per accidens</hi> is not always nor onely opposed to <hi>per se,</hi> but to <hi>praevisum</hi> and <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinatum,</hi> to what is foreseen and design'd afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand

also; so that whatsoever falls out or comes to pass <hi>contra</hi> or <hi>proeter intentionem</hi> or <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem agentis,</hi> Contrary to the intention or opinion or expectation of the Agent, may be said to be <hi>per accidens,</hi> whether it be <hi>per se</hi> or no. And in this notion of <hi>per accidens</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Apothecary's selling of poyson, cannot excuse him from being a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> or guilty of murther <hi>per se,</hi> and not <hi>per accidens</hi> onely; no not though <hi>per accidens</hi> there were not that ill use, that he thought there would be, made of it.</p>
                     <p>I might say the like of his <hi>Impropriety of speech,</hi> when he tells us, <hi>That the command of a lawfull thing under an unjust penalty is a sin in the Commander</hi> per <note place="margin">

For though an <hi>unjust penalty</hi> be an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or accidental as to the command it self, because it might have been commanded under no penalty at all, or under some other more equitable penalty; yet in respect of the Commander and commanding of it, it is sinfull <hi>per se,</hi> and not <hi>per accidens;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Metaphysical notion to the contrary: which I note the rather, that he and his admirers may see that he is not the Man of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctness in his <hi>Notions,</hi> nor of that propriety and accurateness in his <hi>Expressions,</hi> as he would be thought to be; the want whereof he doth so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and so insultingly impute to his Adversaries upon all occasions, and particularly in this <hi>Treatise</hi> of his which we are now speaking of.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the beginning of which <hi>Treatise,</hi> speaking of the Men he had to doe with at the <hi>Savoy-</hi>Conference, he saith, that <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>The Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things sinfull by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, p.</hi> 1.</note> 
                        <hi>as they were men of confounding Practices, so they were men of confus'd Conceptions,</hi> and <hi>such as could not be reconcil'd to distinctness and congruity of speech.</hi> For with this <hi>Encomium</hi> of those that disputed with him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that <hi>Treatise</hi> of his, which he saith he writ <note place="margin">His Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal party.</note> purposely against me; but I am sure that <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristical Preface</hi> thereunto cannot so properly be meant of me, as of those that disputed with him; at least it cannot be meant of me onely, but of them also, nor of them and me onely neither, but of the whole <hi>Episcopal</hi> party, at least as to the first Clause of the Character whereby he describes his Adversaries, when he saith, <hi>They were Men of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why he calls them men of confounding practices.</note> 
                        <hi>confounding Practices;</hi> for so he takes it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Bishops</hi> and Episcopal party are, because they will not consent to the alteration of the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Government, either in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State;</hi> or the letting in of <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Foxes in Sheeps cloathing</hi> into the Sheepfold; I mean all the several sorts of <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who dissent as much perhaps or more from one another than all of them do from us: and consequently such, as if they were admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pale of the <hi>Church,</hi> would bring in a very <hi>Babel</hi> of Confusion along with them. And it is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94113:69"/>
this, and nothing else but this, I mean the keeping of <hi>Anarchy</hi> and confusion out of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleased to call a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding practice:</hi> But then he should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred who They are, whom he so rudely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects <note place="margin">Whom he must mean by that Title.</note> upon, and who are the Men of such <hi>confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding practices:</hi> Surely, They were not the men he had to doe with, whether by them he means any or all of the <hi>Conforming Party</hi> that were at that Conference; for what do We conform to but the Laws? and who are the Makers of those Laws for <hi>Conformity,</hi> and for excluding all that will not conform, but the <hi>Parliament?</hi> That is, the <hi>King,</hi> with the consent of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> (and not the <hi>Bishops,</hi> who doe nothing but in obedience to those Laws,) are the Men whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (if he speaks properly, as he would be thought to do always) must needs mean by the men of <hi>confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Practices;</hi> which how he will justifie if he be called in question for it, he were best to consider.</p>
                     <p>But as for the <hi>men of confused Conceptions, and such as could not be reconciled to distinctness</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Whom he means by the men of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> 
                        <hi>and congruity of speech,</hi> I doubt not but he meant Me for one, (as I doubt not neither but he meant me for one of the men of <hi>confounding Practices</hi> also) but as he meant more besides my self, when he speaks of men of <hi>confounding Practices,</hi> so he must do also, when he speaks of men of <hi>confus'd Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> because he speaks of men in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, speaking of both the sorts of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the men of <hi>confused Conceptions,</hi> though he may, and I believe doth mean me for one, yet he must needs mean those that disputed with him as well as me, and rather them than me, or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94113:69"/>
any other of the Bishops that were there; for the <hi>Disputants</hi> on our part were they, that he and his Assistants had to deal with.</p>
                     <p>And they were men that, I dare say, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Their just Vindication.</note> thought by any, but Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to be men of such <hi>confus'd Conceptions,</hi> and so <hi>irreconcileable to distinctness, and congruity of speech,</hi> that is, so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly without <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Grammar</hi> as he would have them thought to be. I am sure the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> did not think them to be so, when two of them were made the <hi>Primary Professours of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology</hi> in that famous University: Neither did the King think them to be so, when he made all three of them <hi>Bishops:</hi> nor did We that were then <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> think them to be so when we made choice of them to be ours and the Churches <hi>Advocates</hi> in a Cause of so high concernment as that was. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> having been so shamefully nonpluss'd as he was at that <hi>Disputation,</hi> would have it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them.</hi>
                        </note> by those that were not there, that he had, or should have had much the better of it, if the men he had to deal with, had not been men of such <hi>confus'd Conceptions</hi> that they could not understand his meaning by his words, or of such <hi>impatience</hi> (for that's part of his <hi>character</hi> of them also) that they would not give him leave to explain himself more fully than he did.</p>
                     <p>This might have had some colour of reason in it, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the conference at the</hi> Savoy <hi>how it was.</hi>
                        </note> if the <hi>Conference</hi> betwixt our and their <hi>Disputants</hi> had been <hi>oral,</hi> or by word of mouth, which is always indeed lyable to heat, and eagerness, and impatience, and misunderstanding of one another, whilst they are arguing, as likewise, to misrepor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting afterwards of what was said of either side.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:94113:70"/>
But this <hi>Conference</hi> was by writing, to prevent jangling and all other the aforesaid inconveniences, which <hi>oral interlocutory</hi> Disputes are subject to; as likewise that each party might have time to consider what they were to stick to, and abide by, before they writ it down, and to peruse it afterwards, and if need were, to alter or amend any thing they saw amiss in it before they delivered it to those that were to answer or reply to it. And thus were our Arguments delivered unto them by us, and thus were their Answers to our Arguments delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by them, all of them written with Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s <note place="margin">

                     <p>The <hi>Arguments</hi> and the <hi>Answers</hi> that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down, and interchangeably delivered from one Party to the other, were the very same <hi>in terminis</hi> which I have before recited, and which are attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">The same as are attested in the Bishop's printed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> by the subscriptions of the aforesaid witnesses printed above 20 years since, and now again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed with the <hi>Letter</hi> whereunto they were first annexed; which <hi>Attestation,</hi> together with the Arguments and Answers which are attested, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the Reader seriously and impartially to peruse and consider, and then to judge whether the men Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had to deal with were <hi>Men of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Conceptions, and so irreconcileable to distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and congruity of speech,</hi> as he would have them thought to be: or whether indeed he himself were not evidently and inextricably confus'd, puzzled and perplexed in his Answers to their Arguments; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he gave his final Answer to their last <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisme,</hi>

his <hi>Assistants,</hi> had not he, (being such a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, so contentious and self-will'd, as he is,) overruled them both. For who not blinded with prejudice or transported with passion (as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Baxter</hi> often is, and as it seems then was) would have denied (as he did) the truth of this Proposition, <hi>(viz.) That Command which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an act in it self lawfull, and no other act where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any unjust penalty is enjoyned, nor any circumstance whence directly or</hi> per accidens <hi>any sin is consequent, which the Commander ought to provide against, hath in it all things requisite to the lawfulness of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and particularly cannot be guilty of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an Act</hi> per accidens <hi>unlawfull, nor of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an act under an unjust penalty?</hi> This, this (I say) was the Proposition which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did, in Writing with his own hand, finally deny to be true; and this is that which I charge him withall, and from which (as I then told him) it necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follows, that no <hi>Law,</hi> either humane or Divine, can be lawfull; because there is no <hi>Law</hi> of either sort but may by some accident or other, be the cause or occasion of sin.</p>
                     <p>For example, <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Fasting,</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it urged.</note> and <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> are all of them God's holy <hi>Ordinances;</hi> but may not any, nay all of these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God himself, be by accident the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sin? nay, were not all of them so in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high degree in the late Times? being made use of in their several seasons, to stir up and encourage the People to rebell against their Sovereign; and to plunder and murther their fellow Subjects: But
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94113:71"/>
did this make God's commanding all or any of these holy Ordinances to be unlawfull? by Master <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Logick it must do so, because by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they were the cause or occasion of very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and very great sins; and such sins as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander foresaw, they would be the occasion of, and might have prevented if he would, by suffering no ill use to be made of them; (which is more than any <hi>humane Lawgiver</hi> can doe) and yet he did not, nor would not prevent those accidental e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, either by forbearing to make such Laws, as he knew would be the occasion of sin, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing, or altering, or dispensing with them after they were made, or by remitting and not inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the punishment that was due to the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of them; all which he might have done if he would; but he would not because he was not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to doe so, and because it seemed best to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wisedom not to doe so.</p>
                     <p>But Men, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will say, or <hi>humane Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers,</hi> are obliged (though God be not) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <note place="margin">
                           <hi>A rejoynder to Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s Reply.</hi>
                        </note> or provide against all (even accidental) evils which they can prevent, or provide against.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, but not by making no <hi>Laws</hi> at all. For <hi>Meliùs vivitur ubi nihil licet, quàm ubi omnia,</hi> It is better living under the severest Laws, than under none at all. And if there be any <hi>Laws</hi> made for men to live by, or to live under, such is the pride and the pravity of humane nature (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself confesseth) that there will be transgressions of them, and such transgressions as the wisest <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawgiver</hi> cannot foresee, or the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of them be able to prevent; and consequently,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94113:71"/>
no <hi>humane Lawgiver</hi> is bound to doe so; for, <hi>Nemo tenetur ad impossibile,</hi> No body is bound to impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities.</p>
                     <p>Neither is a <hi>Humane Lawgiver</hi> bound to prevent all the <hi>Evil</hi> which it is possible for him to prevent, if it be not to be prevented, but by making no <hi>Laws</hi> at all; or if it be not to be prevented, but by omitting or forbearing to doe some important pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, which as a Lawgiver he is bound to doe. So that no accidental evil which the Lawgiver either <hi>cannot</hi> or <hi>ought not,</hi> (and by ought not, I mean, is not bound or obliged) to provide against, can make the command of a thing lawfull in it self <note place="margin">The Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged home.</note> to be unlawfull. And he that denies this (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did) must (as I said before) consequently affirm no command, either of man or God to be lawfull; because there is no command, either <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> but is liable to such accidental e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, as man either <hi>cannot</hi> or <hi>ought not,</hi> and God hath not thought fit, to provide against, any otherwise than by forbidding, and threatning to punish the transgressours of them; which <hi>Humane Lawgivers</hi> are obliged to doe also; which being all they can doe, and consequently all they are obliged to doe, neither they, nor their just <hi>Laws,</hi> or lawfull <hi>Commands,</hi> are to be blamed or repealed, because they accidentally prove to be the occasion of such evils as the Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either cannot, or is not bound to provide against. And such sins as these must he needs mean, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did) the command of a lawfull thing by lawfull Authority, under no unjust penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be lawfull, because, by accident it might be
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94113:72"/>
the occasion of some such sin as the Commander was not bound to prevent or provide against.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I would fain have Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> speak out, and tell us plainly and distinctly, (being such <note place="margin">
                           <hi>A Call to Mr.</hi> Baxter.</note> a Master of <hi>distinctness</hi> as he is) what these acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental evils or sins are, that can make such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as he denied to be lawfull to be unlawfull. Sure I am, they can be no such evils or sins as by his aforesaid Instances he would make it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they are. For they are all of them such as the Commander is obliged to hinder or provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; but he must instance in some such accidental evils or sins which the Commander is not bound to hinder or provide against, and then prove that a lawfull command, by being the cause or occasion of such an accidental evil or sin, becomes unlawfull; which when he hath done, <hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo,</hi> I shall take him for a great Prophet; and then I will confess that I have been grossly, very grossly mistaken in my charging of him, as I did.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, he hath grossly, very <note place="margin">His gross shuffling and cutting.</note> grossly abused his friends at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> in that <hi>Narrative</hi> of his, where by shuffling in of one <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> instead of another, a true one instead of a false one, he would make them believe that it was the true one that he asserted, <hi>viz. That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a thing lawfull in it self was unlawfull if it were commanded under an unjust penalty, or would be the occasion of some such evil as the Commander foresaw and ought to prevent.</hi> And not the false one, <hi>viz. That the Command of a thing lawfull in it self was unlawfull though it were not commanded under an unjust penalty, nor would be the occasion of any such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94113:72"/>
evil or sin as the Commander was bound to prevent;</hi> which was that indeed and in truth which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> asserted, and not the former: And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his asserting whereof, I do very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, (and so may he too, if he will) I stood up, and said, There is no more Disputing with this man who doth in effect deny any of God's commands as well as Man's to be lawfull. For what Law or Command of God is there, that may not be the <note place="margin">His Assertion the occasion of breaking up the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> occasion of some such evil or sin? And so the Disputeended; for <hi>Contra Principia negantem non est dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum,</hi> There is no disputing against a man who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies principles: And certainly this if any is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple among Christians, <hi>That all God's commands are just and righteous;</hi> which none of them are or can be, if by accident to be the occasion of sin can make them not to be so; which I affirmed to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had asserted.</p>
                     <p>But I did not charge him with asserting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence it self; nay, I did not charge <hi>him,</hi> and much less all or any other of the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">He is not charged with it as his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> besides him, with asserting that which he did assert, as theirs, or his own judgment; (as by the Title page to his <hi>Treatise</hi> of sinfulness <hi>per accidens</hi> (which he saith <hi>was purposely written against me)</hi> he would make his Readers believe I did) but I charged him with it, <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>as a desperate shift he was forced to make use of;</hi> for so he himself saith I said I did, (when I charged him with what he had asserted) which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that I did not charge him with that <hi>Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as that which was, or which I did believe to be indeed his Judgment; but rather, with what contrary to his Judgment, he was fain or forced

to assert <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to serve his turn for the present, as not knowing how otherwise (all at once) to impeach the lawfulness of the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> (which was then his business) and consequently to justifie his own and his Party's refusing to obey and conform to them.</p>
                     <p>And as when I charged him with what he had <note place="margin">Nor is He, but the Assertion, charged with its Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> asserted, I did not charge him with it, as with that which I thought to be his Judgment; much less, when I charged that <hi>Assertion</hi> of his with those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and absurd <hi>Consequences</hi> that may be, nay, must be inferrr'd from it, do I charge him with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting all or any of those Consequences: For a man may abhor the necessary consequences of his own Opinion, as I believe all well meaning <hi>Papists</hi> (and sure there be some <hi>Papists</hi> that are well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men) do detest and disclaim all the necessary consequences of their blasphemous Doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> and as I believe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth the necessary consequences of that <hi>Assertion</hi> I charged him with. Nay, I am apt to believe that Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himself, now he sees what will necessarily follow upon that <hi>Assertion</hi> of his, is sorry and ashamed that ever he did assert it, and wishes with all his heart he had never asserted it; but his heart is too great to suffer him to confess it, and he values his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his <hi>Party</hi> at too high a rate to acknowledge <note place="margin">His reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him than truth.</note> that ever he was guilty of so much weakness, as to have denied what he did deny, and consequently to have asserted what he did assert. And therefore (as I said before) he would fain have it to be believed that it was another thing that he denied and asserted,

But all that he hath done hitherto, or can doe hereafter, to that end, will be all in vain, and to no purpose, as long as two such Witnesses, as the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and the Bishop of <note place="margin">The Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion utterly spoils all his endeavours of clearing himself.</note> 
                        <hi>Chester,</hi> who disputed with him, have attested it under their hands, presently after the matter of fact, and when it was fresh in every man's memory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having been contradicted or excepted against either by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself, or any of his party in his behalf, though it be above twenty years ago, since this <hi>Attestation</hi> of theirs was first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>And therefore whatsoever Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath said since, or doth say now, or shall say hereafter, it will never make what he did say then to be <hi>non dictum,</hi> not to have been said, or what he writ then to be <hi>non scriptum,</hi> not to have been written; so that he may as well call back yesterday as unsay what he had said; <hi>repent</hi> it he may, but <hi>recall</hi> it he cannot. If therefore that Pamphlet of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">That Treatise of his wholly useless to that purpose.</note> sinfulness <hi>per accidens</hi> was purposely writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as he saith it was) to prove Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> was grossly mistaken in charging him with what he did assert <hi>then,</hi> because he doth not assert it <hi>now,</hi> or because he now doth assert the contrary; the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of it to that end is not onely vain and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less but absurd and ridiculous, unless Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks his own Party does believe of him, as the <hi>Bygott-Papists</hi> do of their <hi>Pope;</hi> namely, that he never erred, because he cannot err; which is Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to be said of any but of God. For <hi>Errare, labi, decipi, suit, eritque semper humanum,</hi> to err, to slip, to be deceived and mistaken, hath been and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94113:74"/>
will always be the effect and character of Humane frailty. And therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ought not to have taken it so heinously to be charged, and to be charged ashe was with an <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, with that which is but an humane infirmity; for so, and no more but so, is all Errour. But the denying of it, and much more the persisting in it, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and most of all the defending of it by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising it and making a false representation of it; seems to have somewhat of a much worse principle in it, and makes the Errour to be much more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, than otherwise it would have been; for <hi>Causa Patrocinio non bona pejor erit,</hi> A bad cause will but prove worse by standing out in it and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make it good.</p>
                     <p>It would have been therefore much more ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and much more excusably too, done of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> if, as when he speaks of his <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Aphorisms,</hi> he saith he would have some part at least of that Book to be taken <hi>pro non scripto,</hi> as if it had never been written; so in speaking of what I say he said in the Conference at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> he would not have said it was <hi>non dictum,</hi> a thing that he had not said; but that he would have it taken <hi>pro non dicto,</hi> as a thing he wished he had not said: and so he might have saved all the pains he hath taken, and all the trouble he hath given his Readers, in his <hi>Metaphysical Casuistical Treatise</hi> of things sinfull <hi>per accidens;</hi> wherein there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did not say, what I say he did at the Conference in the <hi>Savoy;</hi> nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to prove that I was <hi>grossly mistaken</hi> in

                     <p>But first, I must make it appear, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth indeed, and <hi>in totidem verbis,</hi> in plain terms, charge me to be so; For proof whereof, I refer my self to a printed Paper of his, now before me, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <hi>R.

                     </p>
                     <p>In which words it is observable, that the word <hi>One</hi> is printed in a different Character, from any of the rest, on purpose no doubt, that the Readers of that pretended curtail'd <hi>Recantation,</hi> may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of whom he means by that <hi>One,</hi> which it was easy for any that had read my Collection of some of his <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> to guess at; but this is certain, that whomsoever he means by that <hi>One,</hi> he saith of him in express terms, that he is <hi>a defier of Deity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that he means me by that <hi>One,</hi> though it be not clearly and plainly exprest in that Paper, <note place="margin">

                        </note> yet it is more than intimated in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to a Letter of Dr. <hi>Hinckley</hi>'s; wherein he doth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94113:76"/>
repeat what the Doctor had said touching those <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisms</hi> of his, which I had collected and printed, so as though neither of them name me, yet it cannot be doubted, but both of them mean me; the rather, because Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth there, and in that place of his Letter, set down the very words of the <hi>first</hi> of those <hi>Aphorisms</hi> I have collected, from denial of which <hi>Aphorism,</hi> or rather from the denial of another <hi>Proposition</hi> substituted by him in the place or instead of that <hi>Aphorism,</hi> he doth in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Paper infer and conclude that <hi>One</hi> he speaks of to be <hi>a defier of Deity and Humanity.</hi>

                     <p>But to put it out of question that I am the man he means by that <hi>One</hi> in the aforesaid Paper, and whom he there makes to be <hi>a defier of Deity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity:</hi>

                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>gives a false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Bishop's accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of him.</hi>
                        </note> where doth Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> accuse Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying there is any lawfull Monarchy, or humane Power, unlimited by God? <hi>He doth it</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter) among the Passages of my accused Aphorisms.</hi> But why doth not he name the passage where, or
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94113:77"/>
the particular <hi>Aphorism</hi> wherein I do accuse him, for his denying the aforesaid Proposition, or for his denying there is any lawfull Monarchy, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane Power, unlimited, or not limited by God? I will tell you why he doth not, because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he cannot; there being no such <hi>Aphorism</hi> nor any such <hi>Passage</hi> in any of those Aphorisms of his, which I question him for, or accuse him of.</p>
                     <p>There is indeed an <hi>Aphorism</hi> of his <hi>(viz.)</hi> the first of those which I have collected and exposed, <note place="margin">The true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what it is the Bishop accuseth him of.</note> wherein he saith, <hi>That of Governours some are limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and some are unlimited, and those which are</hi> de facto <hi>unlimited are Tyrants, and have no right to their unlimited Governments:</hi> And the reason why I put this <hi>Aphorism</hi> of his into the catalogue of those which I except against, is his affirming that such Governours (I presume he means all such Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours) as are <hi>de facto</hi> unlimited, are Tyrants and have no right to their unlimited Governments. It is (I say) his affirming of this, and not his denying the <hi>lawfulness of a Monarchy or any other power or species of Government that is not limited by God,</hi> that I question him for or accuse him of. For if he thinks the affirming of <hi>that</hi> and the denying of <hi>this</hi> to be all one, he is very much mistaken: but the truth is that he is not at all mistaken as to this particular; he knows well enough, that it is not all one to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the one and deny the other; for if he had thought it had been so, why did he not specifie the <hi>Aphorism</hi> it self (which I except against) <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> as it is set down in my Collection, and as he sets it down himself in his aforesaid Letter to Dr. <hi>Hinckley?</hi> It had been much more fairly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously done of him, if he had done so, and much
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:94113:77"/>
more pertinently too, as to the business in hand; there being no question betwixt him and me (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <note place="margin">The Question rightly stated.</note> to the truth or falshood of the aforesaid <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism)</hi> whether all lawfull Monarchies or humane Powers are limited by God or no? but whether all such Governours as are <hi>de facto</hi> unlimited <hi>(not by God but by Men)</hi> are Tyrants, and such as have no Right to their unlimited Governments. The <hi>former</hi> I never did, nor no man that is not a downright professed Atheist can deny to be true: The <hi>latter</hi> I affirm to be false, and not <hi>false</hi> and <hi>erroneous</hi> onely, but <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>seditious</hi> also; and I doubt not but by God's assistance to prove it to be so.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, let no man think it was the not discerning or not animadverting the difference betwixt what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms in his Aphorism, and what he denies in his Paraphrase of it, that makes him substitute the one for the other; <hi>Non sic notus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lysses,</hi> The cunning man is better known than so. No, he doth it artificially and designing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might the more probably and plausibly infer from the one, what he knew he could not with any colour of consequence infer from the <note place="margin">

again in that aforesaid late printed Book of his, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of my denial of what he affirms in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Aphorism, he saith, <hi>that I accuse him for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that there is any lawfull Monarchy or humane Power unlimited by God;</hi> and then infers <hi>That he who asserteth the contrary</hi> (as he implies I do) <hi>is</hi> 1.

                     <p>But thanks be to God, we have a more mercifull Judge than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is; for Woe be to the Bishop, <note place="margin">We are not to be judged by consequences.</note> and Woe be to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself; nay, Woe be to the best and wisest of all mankind (neither of which do I think that I or Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself is) if we were to be judged by the consequences of all our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions at the last day. For, <hi>I know nothing by my self,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who was spiritually as wise and as good a man as perhaps ever any mere man was) <hi>yet I am not,</hi> saith he, <hi>thereby justified:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>though our hearts do not condemn us</hi> (says St. <hi>John) yet God who is greater than our hearts, may.</hi> And truly I know no Man that hath more reason to be afraid to be tried by Consequences than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself hath, as I think I have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear already from the Consequences of what he asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the <hi>Savoy-</hi>Conference, and shall make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more and more before I have done with him.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is for his sake more than for mine own (at least upon this occasion) that I would not have men judged of by the <hi>Consequences</hi> of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, though never so truly inferr'd from them, if they be denied by them. But I say not this, as <note place="margin">No such conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the case.</note> any way or in any the least degree acknowledging that there is any such Consequence logically or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to be inferr'd, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith there is from my denying of his aforesaid Aphorism to be true, that therefore I deny all humane Powers to be limited by God. <note place="margin">An unlimited lawfull Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, in what sense.</note>

in the world as an unlimited lawfull Monarchy or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power,</hi> consequentially deny, that all humane Powers are limited by God?

But he that denies that aforesaid Aphorism (may Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply) doth consequently maintain there may be such a Monarchy or Sovereign power unlimited by God; because Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth <hi>expressly</hi> speak of <hi>limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by God.</hi> He doth so indeed in the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately subjoyn'd to that <hi>Aphorism,</hi> but not in the Aphorism it self, neither doth he speak of it in the words subjoyned, to explain what he meant by the <hi>limitation</hi> he speaks of in the Aphorism before, but
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94113:81"/>
rather to intimate that it was not a <hi>limitation by God,</hi> which he before spake of. For having said in his <note place="margin">

                        </note> Aphorism, that <hi>Of Governours some were limited and some unlimited, and that the unlimited were Tyrants and had no right to their unlimited Governments;</hi> he adds (as a reason why the unlimited were Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and had no right to their Governments) <hi>For they are all subject themselves, and under the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and Laws of God.</hi> Which is in effect, as much and no more than if he had said, Though I tell you, that of Governours some are <hi>limited</hi> and some are <hi>unlimited,</hi> I do not mean any of them are unlimited or not limited by God; and what is this but a plain confession that by limitation of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in the aforesaid Aphorism, he means their limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <note place="margin">If he means limited by men, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</note> by men, and not by God? And then (Ihope) a man may deny all such Governours to be <hi>Tyrants,</hi> that are not so limited, without denying them to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by God; and consequently without incurring the Censure of being <hi>a defier of Deity and Humanity.</hi> For why, of these Governours or humane Powers that are all of them limited by God, may not some of them be unlimited or not limited by men, that is by humane Pacts, Laws or Constitutions?</p>
                     <p>And if this be not Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own meaning, I would fain know how he will make good his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Governours,</hi> into some that are <hi>limited,</hi> and some that are <hi>unlimited?</hi> For, if his meaning be <note place="margin">If he means limited by God,</note> this, that of <hi>Governours</hi> some are <hi>limited by God,</hi> and some are <hi>unlimited by God,</hi> he must needs own that assertion to be his, which he would impose upon me; namely <hi>that all humane Powers are not limited by God;</hi> and consequently besides his unavoidably <note place="margin">The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence falls upon himself.</note> involving himself in a palpable <hi>Contradiction</hi> (for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94113:82"/>
what can be more contradictory, than to say that <hi>all</hi> Governours are, and <hi>some</hi> are not limited by God? he doth necessarily make himself, what he would have me thought to be <hi>(viz.) a defier of Deity and Humanity,</hi> if to deny all humane Powers to be limited by God, be consequently to defy Deity and Humanity. For what more evident or undeniable consequence can there be than this? <hi>Some Governours,</hi> or some humane Powers, <hi>are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited,</hi> that is, <hi>not limited by God;</hi> Therefore <hi>All Governments,</hi> or all humane Powers, <hi>are not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by God;</hi> but the <hi>Antecedent</hi> or former of these two Propositions is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s (if by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation in his Aphorism he means limited by God as he saith he does) and therefore the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent</hi> or latter of these two Propositions must be his also.</p>
                     <p>Neither will his <hi>de facto</hi> doe him any service at all, to help him at this dead lift: for, whereas he saith in his Aphorism, <hi>Some are limited, and some are</hi> de facto <hi>unlimited</hi> (supposing him still to mean unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited as well as limited by God) I would fain know what <hi>de facto</hi> was put in for, and written in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Character, to make it the more observable? Was it, because there was some <hi>Metaphysical</hi> myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry couched in it? If so, he should have explained himself so, as that we, who want his higher Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, might have understood what he meant by it; but if he meant no more than ordinary <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Logick</hi> enables us to comprehend; namely that <hi>de facto</hi> is to be understood as it is opposed to <hi>de jure,</hi> and then (still supposing that by <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>unlimited</hi> he means limited and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited by God) the meaning of that part of his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94113:82"/>
Aphorism must be this, that of Governours, though all are limited by God <hi>de jure,</hi> yet some of them are unlimited by God <hi>de facto.</hi> And then I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> where there are, or ever <note place="margin">

For designing <note place="margin">His design to make the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop odious.</note> to make a Bishop, and especially Bishop <hi>Morley,</hi> (for

so he is always pleased to call me, (not <hi>honoris gratiâ,</hi> For honour's sake, you may be sure) when by name he speaks of me) as odious as he could to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, what more probable, or to the <hi>Sectaries</hi> more plausible, a <hi>Medium</hi> could he have devised to make use of to that End, than first to shuffle in this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition <hi>(All humane Powers are limited by God)</hi> and then to make me the denier of it, and finally there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to pronounce me a <hi>defier of Deity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> you may observe likewise his wonderfull skill in the art of reasoning, and the Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating power of his <hi>Logick,</hi> by which he will needs infer from my maintaining there may be <hi>a lawfull</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">His strange Logick.</note> 
                        <hi>unlimited Monarchy,</hi> I do therefore deny all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Powers are limited by God. O the weight of a Straw, when it is turned into a Club and weild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such a <hi>Hercules!</hi> For what doth all this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, but that he had rather bely himself, than not slander me, and that he had rather contradict and condemn himself, than not say something to make a Bishop, and especially Bishop <hi>Morley;</hi> to be thought to be an Atheist and a Blasphemer? not animadverting perhaps that the fiery darts which he slung at the Bishop might with much more force be retorted against himself; for <hi>aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus,</hi> Sometimes honest <hi>Homer</hi> is caught napping; or as we say, It is a good horse that never stumbles; and <hi>Malice</hi> sometimes is blind, as well as <hi>Love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this time, I think, it is evident enough, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own way of reasoning, that either he himself is a <hi>defier of Deity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi>

or Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> is not. And God forbid, that by any concluding argument either of us should be proved to be so. But now this bold and groundless Calumny (from which, for the honour of my Order as being a <hi>Bishop,</hi> as well as for my <note place="margin">His calumny cleared.</note> personal reputation as I am a <hi>Christian,</hi> I was bound in the first place to vindicate my self) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed out of the way; it is high time to come to the consideration of that which was, or ought to have been the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Aphorism aforesaid proved to be False, from the account of Paternal Government and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Monarchy. Governours not therefore Tyrants, because <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited.</p>

                        <hi>Aphorism</hi> it self which is This. <q>
                           <hi>—Of Governours some are limited, some</hi> de facto <hi>unlimited; the unlimited are Tyrants, and have no right to their unlimited Governments—</hi>
                        </q> This is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Aphorism <hi>in terminis;</hi> and this I confess is one and the first of those <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of his, which I think are all of them <hi>nigro signanda lapillo,</hi> To be marked with a black cole; as being all of them, (I mean all that I have specified) not onely <hi>false</hi> and <hi>errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> but, as I said before, <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>seditious</hi> also;</p>
                     <p>And I put this <hi>Aphorism</hi> of his in the first place, because it is the most general, as speaking of all <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> Sovereign as well as Subordinate, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and unlawfull, limited and unlimited; and pronounceth all the Unlimited, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to be <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and <hi>to have no Right to their unlimited Governments.</hi> 2. I put it in the first place, because Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seems to have laid it as the Foundation or Corner-stone, upon which he

                     <p>And this I except against, <hi>first,</hi> as considered in it self, without relating to Us or to our Governours either Civil or Ecclesiastical, and so considered I say it is <hi>false and erroneous:</hi> and <hi>secondly,</hi> I except against

it also, as it may be considered, and as I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was intended, with a respect to our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here in <hi>England;</hi> and so considered, I say it is <hi>dangerous and seditious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First then I say that what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> affirms in this <hi>Aphorism,</hi> (namely, <hi>that Governours</hi> de facto <hi>unlimited are Tyrants, and have no right to their</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">This Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism of his charged with falshood.</note> 
                        <hi>unlimited Government)</hi> is <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>erroneous</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered <hi>in it self,</hi> as it is set down in general terms, without relation or application to any particular <hi>species</hi> or form of <hi>Government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For proof whereof, and in order thereunto, I will presume to take for granted, 1. That by <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Three things premised.</note> (of whom he saith some are <hi>limited,</hi> and some are <hi>unlimited)</hi> he means <hi>Sovereign or Supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours;</hi> Subordinate Governours being all limited by the Supreme, (and therefore none of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That by <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>unlimited</hi> is meant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and unlimited <hi>by Men;</hi> there being no such thing as any Governour, how great or absolute so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that can be said either <hi>de jure</hi> or <hi>de facto</hi> to be unlimited <hi>by God,</hi> as I have already proved.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, <hi>3dly.</hi> I shall take it for granted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that by his <hi>de facto</hi> unlimited Governours, he means such as are not <hi>de facto</hi> limited by men or by humane Pacts and Constitutions; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all such <hi>Sovereign and Supreme Governours</hi> it is that he affirms, that they are <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and that none of them have any right to their respective so unlimited Governments.</p>
                     <p>These things premised, I demand first of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> what he thinks of <hi>Paternal Government</hi> or the <note place="margin">Of Paternal Government.</note>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:94113:87"/>
Government of <hi>Fathers</hi> over their Children, which was the first and most natural Government that ever was in the World, and was antecedent to <hi>Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in Nature, as well as in Time; though Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> doth Magisterially <hi>pro more suo,</hi> According to his custom, define <note n="*" place="margin">Vide <hi>His Apology for the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</hi> p. 138.</note> 
                        <hi>Propriety</hi> to be in Nature antecedent to <hi>Dominion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to let that pass, I demand (I say) whether <hi>Paternal Government</hi> was either <hi>de facto</hi> or <hi>de jure</hi> a limited Government by any humane antecedent Law, Pact or Constitution?</p>
                     <p>If so, I demand again, by whom or betwixt whom, was it made to be so? There were no Men to make it to before <hi>Adam,</hi> (unless Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will allow of the dream of the <hi>Preadamites)</hi> nor any besides <hi>Adam,</hi> untill the World began to be peopled with his Children; of all whom, I presume, <note place="margin">Adam <hi>the first Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                        </note> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not deny their Father <hi>Adam</hi> to have been the lawfull Governour, though he was not, nor could not be limited by them, nor by any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Covenant or Constitution made betwixt them and him: whence it follows, that either all <hi>de facto</hi> unlimited Governours are not <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and such as have no Right to their unlimited Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or that <hi>Adam</hi> the Father of all Mankind, and the first Governour that ever was in the World, was a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and had no right to Govern his own Children, as he did, and his Childrens Children also, or at least had a right to do so as long as he lived; which was very near a thousand years. So that if any during that time did not submit to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was not because he was not a lawfull, though an unlimited Governour; but because who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever disobeyed or resisted him, were not onely
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94113:87"/>
                        <hi>unnatural Children</hi> but <hi>rebellious Subjects;</hi> of whom <hi>Cain</hi> that killed <hi>Abel</hi> his Brother was the first, and <note place="margin">Cain <hi>the first Rebel.</hi>
                        </note> probably so were all descended from him, a wicked and rebellious generation, who for their rebellion against God and God's Vicegerent their Father <hi>Adam,</hi> their Sovereign Lord and King, were all swept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by that universal Inundation and Deluge, wherein all mankind perished, but <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family onely, who were none of the cursed offspring of <hi>Cain,</hi> but the Posterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> whom God gave unto <hi>Adam,</hi> instead of <hi>Abel,</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> slew.</p>

                     <p>So that there were as many several <hi>Colonies</hi> which <note place="margin">An account of Government after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</note> afterwards grew into as many several <hi>Nations,</hi> as there were then several <hi>Languages,</hi> and as many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

                     <p>So that upon this division and distribution of <note place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p>No obligation from any Law, either of God or Nature or Nations, that all Governours should be limited by the People. Conquerours in a just War have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited right; and for the people conquered, after submission, to rise up against them is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUt Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> perhaps will reply, All of them <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps, that all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours ought</hi> de jure <hi>to be limited.</hi>
                        </note> are therefore <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surpers</hi> because they are <hi>unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> as indeed he seems to insinuate by annexing <hi>de facto</hi> to unlimited; as if <hi>de jure</hi> all Governours ought to be limited in their governing by antecedent Covenants and Compacts betwixt those that are to govern, and those that are to be governed by them; and therefore those Governours that are not so limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or precontracted with, are <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and such Tyrants as have no right to govern, because <hi>de jure,</hi> by right, they ought to be limited or precontracted with. And this I do verily believe to be Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s genuine sense and meaning in this <hi>Aphorism;</hi> and he that reads what he writes afterwards, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his Aphorisms and discourses of the <hi>Causes of Conveying power,</hi> and of <hi>Obedience and Resistance,</hi> will I am confident be of my mind as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
                     <p>Now if the reason why he doth so magisterially pronounce all those <hi>Governours</hi> that are <hi>de facto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">No obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that all Government should be so limited by any law.</note> 
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited</hi> to be <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and <hi>to have no right to their Governments,</hi> be, because they ought <hi>de jure</hi> to be limited, I mean so limited as is before declared;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94113:90"/>
I demand <hi>quo jure,</hi> By what right or law, they are obliged to be so limited? Was it <hi>jure divino positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> By divine positive law? or was it <hi>jure divino naturali,</hi> By divine law of nature? or was it <hi>jure gentium,</hi> By the law of nations? for one of these three it must be, or else it could not be obligatory to all <hi>Governours</hi> and all <hi>Nations</hi> that are to be Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them.</p>
                     <p>But first it was not <hi>jure divino positivo,</hi> By divine positive law. For where or in what place of God's <note place="margin">1. <hi>Not by the positive law of God.</hi>
                        </note> word, either of the new or old <hi>Testament,</hi> do we reade any positive command of God, that the Kings or Governours of all Nations, or of any Nation, should be antecedently limited by Pacts or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants agreed upon betwixt them and the People, over whom they were to reign, before they could have any just Right or Title to governor reign over them? I am sure the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> though they were limited by God, not as Men onely, and as all other Kings are, but as Kings, or in the execution of their Kingly Office, and that <hi>jure positivo,</hi> By posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive law, as well as <hi>jure naturali &amp; morali,</hi> By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and moral law; yet they were never limited by the people either <hi>antecedenter</hi> or <hi>consequenter,</hi> neither <hi>à parte ante</hi> nor <hi>à parte post;</hi> nor was there any command of God, or so much as any intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God that they should be so.</p>
                     <p>Again, as such limitation of Governours by the <note place="margin">2 <hi>Not by the law of nature.</hi>
                        </note> People is not <hi>de jure divino positivo,</hi> By any positive law of God, there being no positive Command in God's word for it; so it is not <hi>de jure divino natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> By the law of nature, neither; for then it would have been <hi>de facto</hi> likewise at first as well as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and in all places as well as in some; especially
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:94113:90"/>
in such places, where there are no other rules or Laws for the People to live by, but the dictates of <hi>Nature</hi> onely; as in all inhabited places of the late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered New world, where we find no other Government, but by <hi>Kings</hi> or Monarchs, no nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings or Supreme Governours, but such as are <hi>unlimited.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, as such a limitation of Kings or Supreme Governours by the People, is neither <hi>de jure positivo</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">3. <hi>Not by the law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                        </note> nor <hi>naturali,</hi> Neither by any positive law, nor by the law of nature; so it is not <hi>de jure Gentium,</hi> By the law of Nations, neither; For nothing is <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Gentium,</hi> By the law of Nations, but that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the interest of all Nations is concerned; as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> the inviolableness of the Persons of <hi>Ambassadours, &amp;c.</hi> but how is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of all other Nations concerned in this or that particular Nation's being governed by a <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>unlimited</hi> Prince or Governour? and supposing the first Kings or Sovereigns to have been <hi>unlimited,</hi> as <hi>Justine</hi> and all other Historians tell us they were; and as in all probability they were indeed in the first plantation of the World: and supposing too their unlimited Governments to have been <hi>Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> as all History Humane and Divine do testify also: I would fain know, how the <hi>Heirs and Successours</hi> of such <hi>unlimited</hi> Princes could come to be limited. It could not be upon the account of a conditional <hi>Election;</hi> for an Election cannot be, but into a place that is void; but in an Hereditary Kingdom there is never any vacancy, because in an Hereditary Kingdom <hi>The King never dies,</hi> though the man <note place="margin">The King ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies, how to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</note> who was King doth; for immediately assoon as the Father ceaseth, the Son or next Heir begins to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94113:91"/>
be King, and to be King as his Father was, that is, an <hi>unlimited Sovereign</hi> as his Father was, and so from generation to generation. And then Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> must grant, that the Hereditary Successours of <hi>unlimited Governours</hi> may have a Right to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Governments, and such a right as their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects cannot deprive them of, without such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's own consent; nor he deprive his Heirs of the same right, by his consenting to the limitation or lessening of it, unless they and every one of them consent to it also.</p>
                     <p>Or else he must prove that a free People, or a People that were <hi>sui juris,</hi> At their own disposal, and under no Government at all (if there were ever such a people in the World) might not voluntarily and lawfully submit themselves to the Government of one or more Governours, without any antecedent Pact or Covenant to <hi>limit</hi> him or them in his or their Government; and for proof of this he must produce some universal binding Law to the contrary; which untill he can doe, I do and must still affirm, that <hi>unlimited Governours</hi> (supposing them to be no U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpers, and that they do not reign tyrannically, as certainly there be some that do not) are not all of them <hi>Tyrants,</hi> because they are <hi>unlimited;</hi> or <hi>such as have no right to their Governments</hi> upon that account onely; and consequently that this <hi>Aphorism</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, which affirms the contrary, is <hi>false;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven home.</note> and would be <hi>Treason</hi> and justly punishable as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, if it were affirmed by a Subject of a <hi>Despotical</hi> Prince or Sovereign, such as all Kings at first were; and such as all Kings in the East and West<hi>-Indies,</hi> and in <hi>Africk,</hi> and some in <hi>Europe,</hi> as the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> and <hi>French</hi> King, are at this day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="tcp:94113:91"/>
Whereunto may be added the <hi>unlimited</hi> Right <note place="margin">Conquerours in a just war unlimited.</note> and Title which <hi>Conquerours</hi> have over those they have conquered; I mean such Conquerours, as by a just War are become Lords and Masters of the lives and fortunes of those they have subdued; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>Rebels</hi> or <hi>Enemies;</hi> and therefore as they may justly save the lives of as many or as few as they please, so, and much more so, may they justly govern those, whose lives they have saved, as they think fit, and most for their own advantage; as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> making them <note place="margin">Instances out of Scripture.</note> 
                        <hi>Hewers of Wood and drawers of Water;</hi> that is, by employing them in all manner of drudgery, and servile works: And thus and worse than thus, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did to the <hi>Ammonites, even to all the people of the cities of Ammon</hi> (saith the Text) which he had conquered, <hi>putting them under sawes and harrows of iron, and making them pass through the Brick-kilns,</hi> because they had violated the <hi>jus Gentium</hi> or the law of Nations, by the barbarous usage of his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, whom out of kindness he had sent unto them. And yet (which is observable) the <hi>Ammonites</hi> were none of those Nations, which God had devoted to destruction, and commanded the <hi>Israelites</hi> to make war upon; but it was a War the <hi>Ammonites</hi> had justly drawn upon themselves with the sad and severe effects of it.</p>
                     <p>And what if our <hi>King</hi> having been so long, and <note place="margin">The like Case supposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our King and the Algerines.</note> so continuedly, and so outragiously injured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the <hi>Algerines</hi> robbing and pillaging of his Ships, and inslaving and murthering of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, should make War upon them, and by God's blessing vanquish and subdue them, making himself
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94113:92"/>
Master of all they have, both of strength and wealth, both by Sea and Land, and of that den of Thieves it self (I mean the City of <hi>Argiers,)</hi> might he not, if he would, justly destroy them all? or if he thought it better for himself, or more for his own Interest, sell them all for slaves, or use them all as slaves to tugg at the Oar all their life long in their own Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, or to dig in Mines and Quarries, or to mend high ways, or to put them to any other toilsome or sordid labour, and to have nothing for it but brown Bisket and water for their food, and for their clothing any thing that will but cover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and all this while to be beaten as often and as much as their Task-masters shall think fit to inflict it? This would be very hard usage you will say, but no harder than that wherewith they have used others; nor no harder than a Conquerour may most justly inflict on such inhumane Monsters, and such profest Enemies of all mankind, as they are. Howsoever I hope Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will not deny such a Conquerour to be an <hi>unlimited</hi> Governour of those whom he hath so conquered, and yet to have a just right and Title to his unlimited Government, as every <hi>Master</hi> hath likewise over his <hi>slaves,</hi> whether they be <hi>born in his house,</hi> or <hi>bought with his money,</hi> without capitulating with them before-hand, how he shall govern them, or how they will be governed by him.</p>
                     <p>But may not a People though conquered in a just <note place="margin">Whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may after submission free themselves by force?</note> War, and deservedly made and used as slaves and Vassals by the Conquerour, doe what they can, to free themselves from that slavery and servitude? Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks they may, as appears by what he saith <hi>Page</hi> 193 of his <hi>Holy-Commonwealth,</hi> where <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>saith, I.</hi>

he tells us that <hi>Dominatio,</hi> that is, (in his sense) <hi>any unlimited Government is penal to the Subjects, and they may escape it if they can, yea though they have submitted themselves to such a servitude:</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> By stronger reason, they may doe what they can to free themselves from it, if they be forced by a Conquerour to submit to it.</p>

                        <note place="margin">2 Chron. 3. 13. Jerem. 5. 2.</note> made his Viceroy under him) seeking to free himself and the people from that bondage or unlimited power, which the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> exercised over them, is by God himself declared to be a <hi>Rebel,</hi> and his endeavouring to cast off that unlimited yoke is called <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and Rebellion it could not be, <note place="margin">Zedekiah<hi>'s casting off the yoke of the king of</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>called Rebellion and punished as such.</hi>
                        </note> unless it had been a rising up against a rightfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign: and therefore as God called it a Rebellion, so he punish'd it as a Rebellion by giving up <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and <hi>Zedechiah</hi> himself into the hands of him against whom he had rebelled; who after he had slain his Children before his eyes, he presently caused them to be put out, that the slaughter of his Children might be the last thing he should ever see; and then carried him captive unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> and kept him in a dungeon till he died: he caused likewise the walls
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94113:93"/>
of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to be broken down, and the House of God it self, that glorious fabrick, that wonder of the World, to be destroyed, and all the Nobility, Clergy, Gentry, and Artificers of the Nation to be carried away captive also, together with all the wealth and whatsoever was worth the carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, leaving nothing but some of the poorer sort of labouring People to dress and till the ground, and to keep it from being overrun with wild beasts. So that all the <hi>Jews</hi> got by this and their former Rebellion against the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> was but the making of their yoke harder to be born, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than it was before; as it seems by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s sad bewailing of it in his Book of <hi>Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> And as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> declares the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, so the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> declares the Causes of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Witnessed by the prophet</hi> Ezekiel.</note> this their miserable condition; namely their Perjury, breaking the <hi>Oath of Allegeance</hi> they had taken, and their revolting from their obedience they had sworn to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who had conquered them and forced them to submit to his unlimited power in Government of them; which if it had been unlawfull for them to obey, God would not have suffered them to be punished as they were, for endeavouring as they did, to free themselves from it; at least he would not have called that endeavour of theirs a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and specified it as the main cause, for which they were so punished.</p>
                     <p>And it is very observable, that though God had promised to free them from that yoke, which first the <hi>Assyrians</hi> had laid upon them, and afterwards <note place="margin">Their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at last from the Babylonish captivity, was not by force of Arms.</note> the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs did keep them under; yet, when after their seventy years Captivity was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, and the prefixed time of their deliverance
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94113:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was come, as the Text tells us <hi>Daniel</hi> knew by Books (namely by what he had read in the former Prophets) it was, God would not suffer them so much as to endeavour to deliver themselves by strong hand, or by rising up in Arms against their unlimited So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, as no doubt he could have done if he would; but he put into the heart first of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> then their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and unlimited Sovereigns, not onely to give them leave to return into their own Countrey, but abundantly to furnish them with Money and Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of all sorts, for the rebuilding of the Temple and City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as is recorded at large in the Books of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And like unto this was their former Deliverance out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the house of bondage, <note place="margin">As neither was that from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</note> from whence after a long and grievous slavery they were brought out by a strong hand indeed, but not by a strong hand of their own; for as they never attempted any thing against the arbitrary unlimited Government they lived under, during their very long and very cruel slavery in <hi>Egypt,</hi> so when at last they went out of it, they went not out without <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s leave to doe so; though there were above Six hundred thousand fighting Men amongst them, a number sufficient to have made their way by force against all the Power <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could have raised to hinder it; but God would not give them courage, or suffer them to doe so, to the end that there might <note place="margin">The reason of this, to give no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</note> be no countenance or colour for Rebellion, against even the most unjust, and injurious, and tyrannical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Powers, to be found upon record in his Word, as allowed by him in his own People, to justifie or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any other people or persons, upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

                     <p>No, saith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> I do not say he hath no right to his Government, but that he <hi>hath no right to his unlimited Government,</hi> whereby I confess I know not what he means, unless it be this, that an <hi>unlimited Governour</hi> is not a Governour, but a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;</hi> and that <hi>he hath no right to his unlimited Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> because there ought to be no such Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                     <p>But then again, what will become of his division of <hi>Governours,</hi> and consequently of Governments also, into some that are <hi>limited,</hi> and some that are <hi>unlimited?</hi> If he reply, that though <hi>de facto,</hi> As to matter of fact, there be some Governours and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that are <hi>unlimited,</hi> yet <hi>de jure,</hi> As to matter of right, they ought all of them to be <hi>limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> and consequently, no man can have a right to an <hi>unlimited</hi> Government, because a Government that is unlimited is no rightfull Government. If this be his meaning, it is but <hi>petitio Principii,</hi> A beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of that which is in question, nay of that which <note place="margin">A Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's being unlimited, no hindrance to his Right.</note> I think I have put out of question already, by the Instances I have given. (1) of <hi>Paternal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the Old World before the Floud. (2.) Of the first <hi>Monarchs</hi> in the New World after the Floud. (3.) Of all <hi>Conquerours</hi> over those whom they have conquered in a just War; who were all of them <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Governours</hi> by any humane Constitution, and that not <hi>de facto,</hi> As in fact, onely, but <hi>de jure,</hi> In right, also; there being no positive law of God, nor no humane antecedent Pact, or Constitution to the contrary. Such likewise were the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and yet their Right and Title to their <hi>unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:94113:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Government was never question'd, either by <hi>Christ</hi> himself, or by any of the <hi>Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who were his first and best disciples. So that there is no more to be said to prove that it is not the Governour's (I mean the Sovereign or Supreme Governour's) being <hi>unlimited</hi> that can make him <hi>to have no right to his unlimited Government.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither need there to be much said to prove, that <note place="margin">A lawfull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Tyrant, doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his Right.</note> it is not the lawfull Governour's being a <hi>Tyrant</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>unlimited)</hi> that can make him lose or forfeit the right he had, or hath, unto his Government, so as to free his Subjects from their obligation of obedience to him, or warrant their taking up of Arms, or rebelling against him, and consequently to depose him and put him to death: for upon the same ground, and by the same reason the former may be done, the latter may be done also. So that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are no more excusable from being our late blessed King's murtherers, than the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents;</hi> the latter inferring the <hi>Conclusion</hi> from the <hi>Premisses</hi> of the former. But this by the way onely. I proceed to the proof of what I have in hand, namely,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That a lawfull Sovereign,</hi> whether limited or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, <note place="margin">The Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to be proved.</note> 
                        <hi>doth not lose or forfeit his right to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty or Government over his Subjects by being a Tyrant,</hi> or by Governing them in a Tyrannical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; so as upon that account his Subjects may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully disown or rebell against him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Because there is nothing in <hi>God's word</hi> to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <note place="margin">Several ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove it.</note> it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Because there is much to be alledged out of God's word to disprove it.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:94113:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
3. Because the Doctrine and Practice of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians</hi> is against it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Because it seemeth to be a <hi>contradiction</hi> to the nature of the thing it self to maintain it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And lastly, Because supposing, but not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be true, it would be mischievous to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and destructive to humane <hi>Society</hi> in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>first,</hi> this <hi>Aphorism</hi> or Assertion of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, viz, <hi>That a Sovereign or Supreme Governour</hi> (whether <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>unlimited</hi> it matters not) <hi>hath no Right, or forfeits the Right he had, unto his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if he be a Tyrant, or Governs otherwise than by the Laws of either God or man or both he ought to do;</hi> is False, because there is nothing in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> 1. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Scripture</hi> either of the old or new <hi>Testament</hi> to warrant the truth of it. For this being a matter of so important and universal a concernment as it is, in regard of all Times, Places and Nations, though God foresaw that some, nay many, very many of the Kings or Supreme <hi>Governours,</hi> both unlimited and limited, not onely of other Nations, but of his own People, would be <hi>Tyrants,</hi> that is, such as would govern their Subjects, not with Equity, Justice and Moderation, as they ought to doe; nor accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either to Divine or humane Laws (though of their own making) but according to their own Will and pleasures: yet there is no mention of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their Right to govern their Subjects that they incur by it, nor of any permission for their Subjects to rise or rebell, no nor so much as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves by any kind of force against them; much less to depose them or to set up others in the stead of them: which if they might have done, or
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94113:96"/>
if it had been best for them to doe so, God no doubt (having so special and peculiar a care of them and kindness for them more than he had for any other of the Nations) would have permitted them (at least) to have done what they could, to have freed themselves from so heavy a yoke, and told them how, and when, and in what case they might have done so: which because he hath not, we may be sure it was not his Will they should doe so, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it was not lawfull for them to doe so; and if not for <hi>them,</hi> then certainly 'tis for no other Subjects of any other Nation neither.</p>
                     <p>Again, besides this proof of the falseness of this Aphorism <hi>ab authoritate Scripturae negativè,</hi> From the authority of Scripture in a <hi>Negative</hi> way, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The</hi> 2. <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Scripture Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively.</hi>
                        </note> because there is nothing in <hi>Scripture</hi> to justifie the truth of it by: there be many <hi>Affirmative</hi> and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive places in <hi>Scripture</hi> to prove the contrary; namely, that <hi>Sovereign Princes</hi> or Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours do not forfeit their Right to their respective Governments though they be <hi>Tyrants,</hi> or because they are Tyrants; nor are their Subjects disobliged from their Allegeance and Obedience to them in all lawfull things because they are so. Such are all those places in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which command obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Sovereign or Supreme Governours that then were; and particularly to <hi>Nero</hi> himself <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Obedience to</hi> Nero <hi>himself, strictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Roman Emperour,</hi> who was not onely one of the worst of Men, but the greatest of Tyrants that ever was in the World. And yet it was in his time, and for subjection and obedience to him, and not to the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> as partakers of the Sovereignty with him, (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it) that those strict commands were given to the <hi>Christians</hi> of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94113:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those times, that were his Subjects, <hi>to obey</hi> him in all his lawfull commands, and <hi>not to resist</hi> him, not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, though they could not obey him, when he commanded what was sinfull or unlawfull.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is observable, that as the Prince then reigning, when these commands of obedience to him, and not resisting of him, were given to the <hi>Christians</hi> by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> was a most merciless and cruel <hi>Tyrant</hi> toward all his Subjects in general, and <note place="margin">And that when Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans under his actual perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> most of all to those that professed themselves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in particular: So it is observable (I say) that at this very time this cruel Tyrant did actually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the <hi>Christians</hi> in a most horrible and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious manner and measure; and yet even then, when and whilst they were so cruelly persecuted by him, they were commanded to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as dutifull and obedient Subjects towards him, and that <hi>for Conscience sake,</hi> and not <hi>for fear</hi> of punishment onely, or for fear of being worse and worse used by him; which the <hi>Apostles</hi> (who knew the mind of God much better than we do) would never have commanded them to doe, if <hi>Nero,</hi> by his tyrannical usage of them, had lost his right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them, or ceased to be their Sovereign.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as it is observable at what time these Precepts of obedience to <hi>Sovereign Princes,</hi> and of not resisting them, were given to their <hi>Christian Subjects,</hi> (namely, when the worst of <hi>Men,</hi> and greatest of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and first <hi>Persecutour</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was their Sovereign) so it is worth our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation also, to take notice of the Persons, whom the Holy Ghost made choice of to publish and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Why S.</hi> Peter <hi>and S.</hi> Paul <hi>made choice of, to preach up obedience.</hi>
                        </note> these Precepts unto the World. They were St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul;</hi> of whom the <hi>one</hi> had been
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94113:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reproved by <hi>Christ,</hi> whilst he was upon the Earth, for resisting the Magistrate, though it were in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Christ himself; and the <hi>other</hi> was reproved by <hi>Christ</hi> from Heaven, for obeying the Magistrate's sinfull commands by persecuting Christ in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: but both of them had now better learned <hi>Christ,</hi> namely, neither to <hi>obey</hi> the Magistrate when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to doe that which was sinfull, nor to <hi>resist</hi> him when he persecuted them for not obeying of him. And what they had learned themselves, they of all the rest of the <hi>Apostles</hi> were the fittest to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; because as the <hi>one</hi> of them was more peculiarly than any other of the Twelve, the <hi>Apostle of the Jews;</hi> so the <hi>other</hi> of them was as peculiarly the <hi>Apostle of the Gentiles;</hi> and both of them so by God's own appointment: so that the whole world being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture divided into <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the whole world or all Mankind might be taught this doctrine, which it so much concerns the peace of the world, that all men should learn and practice, namely, the Doctrine of indispensable either <hi>active</hi> or <hi>passive Obedience</hi> of <hi>Subjects</hi> to their <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> how ill soever they are governed or how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are oppressed by them.</p>

And herein (I say) the first and best of his Disciples follow'd his example; I mean the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians</hi> of the three first Ages, that is, all the <note place="margin">Whilst under Heathen and Tyrant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> while they were subject to Heathen and Tyrannical and persecuting Princes; and yet we do not reade that ever they did so much as make any the least doubt of the right, those Tyrannical and persecuting Princes had to govern them: much less did they upon the pretence of those Princes having forfeited their Right to their Government, ever take up arms either <hi>offensive</hi> or <hi>defensive,</hi> against any of them; as no doubt they might and would have done, if

account, or indeed upon any other account whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: much less is there any thing said in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> to warrant or justifie the deposing of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes by their Subjects, upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of male administration of their Government in any kind or any degree.

                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:94113:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which was done no doubt by God's special inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because God was so well pleased with it, that the Plague in the heat and height of it presently cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and <hi>Phineas</hi> was by God himself highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and rewarded for it. And yet I believe, <note place="margin">Those cases applied.</note> that if any man were indicted and arraigned either for Robbery or Murther, though those that he rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed were <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that is never so much his own or God's enemies, or if those that he killed were actually committing never so great a sin: I believe, I say, that one's pleading the <hi>Israelites</hi> robbing of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to justifie his <hi>theft,</hi> or the other's pleading of <hi>Phineas</hi> his killing of <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi</hi> to justifie his <hi>murther,</hi> would not save either of them from the Gallows: so neither will the pleading of what was done by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ten Tribes, (supposing it done by God's special Command or Approbation) justifie or excuse any other for doing what they did, unless they could make it appear they have the same Warrant, that they had for the doing of it; which I am sure is not now to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, no more than it is to be expected that the Sun should stand still, as it did once at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Joshua;</hi> or go backward, as it did another time at the entreaty of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> We are to be <note place="margin">No warrant hence for us to do the like.</note> governed, and to govern our selves by those <hi>Laws</hi> and Rules which God hath given to all mankind in general, and not by such extraordinary dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as God hath been pleased to give some men at some times in particular; and much less by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or fancied Enthusiasms or inspirations of our own; so that supposing this revolting of the ten Tribes from <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and the setting up of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> to have been lawfull, it will not prove it to be

lawfull for any other Subjects to doe so too upon the same pretence <hi>(viz.</hi> upon the pretence of being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so grievously oppressed) unless they have the same special Warrant of God for it.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>(2dly.)</hi> I affirm that what was done by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ten Tribes was an unlawfull and <note place="margin">The Revolt sinfull against the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</note> a sinfull action, I mean their revolting from <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> their lawfull Sovereign notwithstanding his Fathers or his own oppression of them, because it was a transgression of an everlasting Statute or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God (I mean the <hi>fifth Commandment</hi> of the Moral Law) whereby all mankind is obliged to honour and obey not onely their natural Parents, but all their lawfull Superiours, and especially him that is Supreme, who is <hi>Pater Patrioe,</hi> the Father as well as the Ruler of all his Subjects, and set over them by God to be so.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94113:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the words which God spake by <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet to <hi>Jeroboam</hi> were not, <hi>Thou shalt rend,</hi> but, <hi>I will rend the Kingdom out of the hand of</hi> Solomon, <hi>and I</hi>

But <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did both. For first, whether out of a distrust of God's performance of his promise, or <note place="margin">His distrust and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> out of an impatience to stay God's own time for it, no sooner was <hi>Solomon</hi> dead, but home comes <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not called by God but by a discontented party of the People, to whom after in all probability he had aggravated their grievances, and thereby incensed them as much as he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the present Government, he offered himself to be their Head, and as such marched with them, to expostulate and capitulate with their King, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping they would receive an unsatisfactory answer, as they did, and thereupon would presently make him their King, as they did also: So that he had it not from God, who onely had power to dispose of it, (for <hi>by him,</hi> as he himself tells us, <hi>Kings reign)</hi> but from the <hi>People,</hi> the People that were then under an obligation of obedience to a lawfull Sovereign and consequently had no power to dispose of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to become Subjects to another, no more than he had a right to become their King, untill he that promised him he should be so, had made him so, which he could and infallibly would have done in his own good time, without any thing done on <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s part but the relying upon the promise of God onely; which he distrusting or being too
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94113:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
impatiently ambitious to stay for the performance of it, took his own seditious and rebellious way for the hastening, as he did afterwards for the keeping of himself to be a King. For as he caused the ten Tribes to revolt from <hi>Rehoboam</hi> in order to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himself their King, so he caused them to revolt from <hi>God</hi> also by setting up other Gods, and other Priests, and other places of worship, thereby making a formal Schism in the <hi>Church,</hi> to prevent a possibility of re-union in the <hi>State.</hi> So that as he sinned and <hi>made Israel to sin</hi> for the getting, so he sinned and <note place="margin">How he made Israel to sin.</note> 
                        <hi>made Israel to sin</hi> much more for the holding and keeping of the Kingdom, which he might have had and kept much longer than he did, if he had stayed God's leisure for the having, and done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to displease God for the holding of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he would have done as <hi>David</hi> did, he should have had the success that <hi>David</hi> had, without sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himself, or making so many Thousands to sin with him and for him, as hedid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> was not onely told by the Propet <hi>Samuel</hi> that he should be King, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was by the <note place="margin">David<hi>'s case alike and his different be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</hi>

Lord's anointed.</hi> This was <hi>David</hi>'s resolution, and this should have been <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s resolution also, to have expected God's performance of his promise in his own time, and in his own way; and not have snatched the Crown out of God's hand, and put it himself upon his own head, before God had anointed his head for it.</p>

                     <p>It was not long before this, that <hi>Absalom</hi> by the counsel of <hi>Achitophel</hi> made use of the same artifice <note place="margin">Absalom<hi>'s rebellion rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the same artifice.</hi>

This they were so foolish as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, though their condition then was better than ever it had been before, or ever it was afterwards; for it was <hi>David</hi> a man after God's own heart that was then their King, and who as himself (or rather God's Spirit by his mouth) tells us, <hi>fed them with</hi>

                        <hi>a faithfull and true heart, and ruled them prudently with all his power;</hi> and if <hi>prudently,</hi> then <hi>justly</hi> no doubt also: and yet it was his not doing of <hi>justice</hi> that was made the pretence of the rebellion against him; and by whom? by <hi>Absalom,</hi> one whom the People knew to have been a murtherer of his own brother, and therefore not to be a very likely man to govern them either more justly, or more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than his Father did: so that as the pretence of their rising up against <hi>David</hi> was groundless, so their setting up of <hi>Absalom</hi> in his stead was folly and madness.</p>
                     <p>And now one would have thought, the ill success they had in that action would have made them more wary than to be tempted and prevailed with again, so soon at least as afterwards they were, to

another rebellion against the Grandchild of <hi>David</hi> upon another, and that perhaps upon as groundless a pretence as the former; I mean this of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> which we are now speaking of.

                        <note place="margin">The great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute was a Levy of men.</note> for the building of that glorious Temple of God in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was the wonder of the World, and for other his many and magnificent Structures; and that this <hi>Tribute</hi> and Levy was of the Persons of his Subjects for bond-service, that is to make them to work as slaves or bond-men under Task-masters, and that not for wages, but for meat and drink onely to maintain them in life and health and strength, to endure the hardship and toilsome labour they were put to.</p>
                     <p>But what Subjects of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s were these, <note place="margin">And that, not of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel.</note> that this heavy Yoke was laid upon? They were, saith the Text, <hi>The People that were left of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites, Hittites, Perizites, Hivites and Jebusites,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94113:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which were not of the children of Israel.</hi> The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren therefore of those aforesaid Nations, whom the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were not able utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, were those upon whom <hi>Solomon</hi> Levyed the aforesaid Tribute of men for bond-service. <hi>But of the children of Israel,</hi> (saith the Text, verse 22 of the same Chapter) <hi>did Solomon make no bondmen, but they were men of War, his servants and his Princes, and his Captains and his Rulers of his Chariots and of his Horsemen:</hi> which certainly were all of them very honourable and very profitable Employments.</p>
                     <p>And that this was so and no otherwise, we have it again attested, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9. where the Text repeating the former Narrative, that they were the Children of those Nations onely who were to be, and were not consumed, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> made bond-men, and made to pay Tribute; that is, he made some of them bondmen and the rest to pay Tribute. <hi>But of the children of Israel</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>did Solomon make no servants for his work,</hi> or to work in his building; neither did he for ought I can find make them pay any <hi>Tribute</hi> at all; nor indeed had he any need to doe so, having all the Nations from <hi>Euphrates</hi> to the border of <hi>Egypt</hi> his Tributary Subjects; so that not onely he but all <hi>Israel</hi> were so rich, that <hi>silver in Jerusalem was as stones in the street</hi> (saith the Text in one place) nay, <hi>it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon,</hi> saith the Text in another place. So that what this <hi>heavy yoke</hi> was that the ten Tribes complained of, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, unless they were sick of a surfeit of plenty, or weary of being too well at ease. And <note place="margin">People apt to grow weary of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</note> that there is such a sickness, such an <hi>Epidemical</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and that the Common People of all times
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94113:104"/>
and places are very apt to be infected with it, we have found by our own experience very lately; and I pray God we may not find it again very shortly; though never People had less reason to complain than we had then, or have now; or than the <hi>Israelites</hi> had (for ought appears from the History of those times) when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ten Tribes complained of the <hi>heavy yoke</hi> they groaned under, which, had it indeed been as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous as they said it was, or as <hi>Rehoboam</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it should be, yet would not that have been cause enough to warrant or justifie them in doing what they did, I mean their renouncing his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over them, or their Rebellion against him; their <hi>Rebellion</hi> I say, for so God calls it, who always calls both Things and Persons by their right and proper names. Men may, and often do <hi>call evil good and, good evil;</hi> but God doth not; or if he do call some things or persons by better names than in rigour and propriety of speech they deserve to be called by; as when he calls those that are his servants <hi>good men,</hi> and the works which they doe in obedience to him, <hi>good works,</hi> because for Christ's sake he accounts them to be so, and accepts and rewards them as if they were so, <note place="margin">In what sense some men and works are called good.</note> though neither the <hi>Men</hi> nor their <hi>Works</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and entirely <hi>good,</hi> or without any leaven or mixture of bad in them; and consequently God out of his gracious condescension, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our sincere, though weak endeavours to please <note place="margin">The Revolt is called Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note> him, may and doth call some things and persons by <hi>better</hi> names than they deserve to be called by; <note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 19. 2 Chron. 10, 19.</note> yet he never did call any thing or person by a <hi>worse</hi> name than in exact propriety of speech it was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94113:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
worthy of: And therefore that which God called <hi>Rebellion</hi> (as he did this of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s and the ten Tribes renouncing of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Sovereignty over them) was Rebellion; and what is <hi>Rebellion</hi> but the resisting or rising up against one whom we ought to obey? so that God by calling that which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ten <hi>Tribes</hi> did, a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> doth thereby declare that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> (notwithstanding the unwise answer he gave them, and the hard usage his threatning made them believe they were to expect from him) was still their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and still to continue to be so; otherwise their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of him and setting up another instead of him would not have been a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and I am sure if it had not been so, God would never have called it so; for every <hi>resistance</hi> is not a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but onely the resistance of one whom we ought to obey. We are commanded <hi>to resist the Devil,</hi> and to renounce the Dominion he usurps over us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is an <hi>

                        <note place="margin">1 Kings 12. 24. 2 Chro. 11. 4.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>I answer <hi>first</hi> in general that God in plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <note place="margin">The Answer in general.</note> words having said it was <hi>Rebellion,</hi> nothing that can be gathered out of any other words of the Text can make it to be no rebellion; for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection made out of God's word by men may be false, but God's words themselves must be true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> and more particularly to the first of the places before quoted, to justifie that which was done by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that it was but the doing of that which God by the Prophet <hi>Ahijah</hi> had foretold was to be done, I answer, that God's foretelling a thing <note place="margin">God's foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a thing to be done is not the cause of doing it.</note> to be done, doth not justifie or excuse either the doers or the doing of it; if either the thing it self be evil, or if he that doeth it hath no Commission from
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94113:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God for it; or doeth it with an ill mind, or by ill means, or to an ill end, a concurrence of all which circumstances there were in this fact of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s, and all of them evil and sinfull, and therefore all of them from his own evil and sinfull disposition, and none of them from God, but by his permission onely; and as the bare permission, so the bare fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of a thing to be done is no way the cause of the doing of it; and consequently can neither justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy nor excuse the doing of it, if it be evil in itself or done with an ill intention, or any otherwise in all respects than it ought to be done. The foretelling therefore of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> by <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet, that he should be King, and reign over the ten Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> can no more excuse him for the way he took to make himself King, nor the ten Tribes for assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in it, than <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet foretelling <hi>Hazael</hi> that he should be King of <hi>Syria,</hi> did justifie or excuse him for murthering <hi>Benhadad</hi> his Master, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The like case of</hi> Hazael, &amp;c.</note> that he might be king in his stead; or than God's foretelling the crucifying of <hi>Christ,</hi> did justifie or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse either the malice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in accusing, or <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>'s injustice in condemning of our Saviour.</p>
                     <p>As to the other place before objected, where God by the Prophet <hi>Shemaiah</hi> saith, <hi>the thing was from</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The evil of sin from God, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> 
                        <hi>him;</hi> I answer, that the thing, namely, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the ten Tribes, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as it was <hi>malum culpoe,</hi> An evil of sin, or as it was <hi>malum poenoe,</hi> An evil of punishment; that is, as it was an <hi>evil of sin</hi> in those that were the actours in it; and so it was not from God but <hi>permissivè,</hi> or by his permission onely; or as it was an <hi>evil of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> justly inflicted upon the house of <hi>David</hi> for the sin of <hi>Solomon,</hi> not the sin which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and

the ten Tribes did falsely (for ought appears in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the contrary) lay unto his charge, namely, the oppressing of his Subjects, but for his Idolatry, for his forsaking of his God, which as <hi>Ahijah</hi> told <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was the sin that God charged him withall, and for which God did not command or give <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> a Commission or leave to rebell against <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the Son of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but onely suffered him to doe so; for <hi>God</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us) as he is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>tempt no man to evil;</hi> but (as it follows in the same place) <hi>every one is tempted by his own lust;</hi> and so was <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> for it was not his zeal for God, but his own ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that made him doe what he did to get the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as appears by what he did, after he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, for the keeping of it; for it was the same lust, the same ambition that tempted him first to make <hi>Israel</hi> to sin by joyning with him in rebellion against his and their <hi>King,</hi> that tempted him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to make <hi>Israel</hi> to sin by joyning with him in Rebellion against his and their God, by setting up the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> to be worshipped by them.</p>
                     <p>Neither was the one of these actions of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> more or less from God than the other; for as they were both of them <hi>morally</hi> evil or sinfull in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and <hi>intentionally</hi> and designedly evil in the doers of them, so neither of them were from God; because God is not nor cannot be the authour or accessary of any such evil; but as they were evils of punishment, the former an evil of punishment to <note place="margin">The evil of punishment is from God.</note> the House of <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Idolatry, and the latter an evil of punishment to the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> for

the ten Tribes joyning in Rebellion with <hi>Jeroboam</hi> against their lawfull Sovereign; so they were both of them from God, as all evils of punishment are, whether inflicted immediately by God himself as Plagues, Famines, Droughts, Inundations gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are, and as the drowning of the whole World by <hi>Noah</hi>'s floud, and the burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah</hi> by fire rain'd down from heaven, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were: or whether they be executed by some men upon others, whether justly or unjustly, whether with or against God's command, whether by good men or bad, nay whether they be executed by Men or by Devils, (as those evils inflicted upon <hi>Job</hi> were) they are still from God, either as <hi>punishments</hi> and effects of his vindicativejustice to his <hi>Enemies,</hi> or as <hi>chastisements</hi> and effects of his fatherly care and kindness to his <hi>Children:</hi> so that whatsoever the evil be in it self, and how sinfully soever it may be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and executed by men, yet it may be most justly made use of by the Divine Wisedom either for the punishment of his Enemies, or for the bettering of his servants.

But <hi>Jehu</hi> when he was anointed was actually made King; for the Prophet who was sent to anoint him, when he poured the Oylon his head, (saith the Text) said unto him, <hi>Thus saith the Lord</hi>

from God for the doing of it; and as he had God's command to doe it, so he had God's approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and reward for it, after it was done; for the Lord said unto <hi>Jehu</hi> (saith the Text, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 30.) <q>Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit upon the throne of Israel.</q> But <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had neither God's command to doe what he did before he did it, nor God's approbation for doing what he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had done it; neither were <hi>Solomon</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> usurpers, as <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Jehoram</hi> were.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, as the Examples even of the best mens actions recorded in Scripture do not make <note place="margin">The general rule to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, unless there be a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> what they did to be lawfull, any farther than as they were agreeable to the general rule of all mens actions, the <hi>Moral Law</hi> of God; or as they had a special, a certain and a positive <hi>Dispensation</hi> from God the Lawgiver himself to doe something upon some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions otherwise than by the general Rule they were obliged to doe; and <hi>Exceptio in non except is firmat regulam,</hi> An exception to a Rule strengthens the Rule in things not excepted: So the doing of that which was justifiably done then, by virtue or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of such a Dispensation, is not justifiably to be imitated by any man or number of men now, when no such Warrant, no such Dispensation, from the Lawgiver himself, in so certain, so immediate, and so miraculous a manner as it was then, is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, whatsoever our mad <hi>Enthusiasticks</hi> may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the contrary.</p>

                        <q>Certainly there cannot (I think) be a greater injury done to the first Christians, who coming newly from the Discipline of the Apostles and Apostolick men, did better understand and more perfectly practise their Precepts, than there is done by them that think the reason why they did not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they were sure to die if they did not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not because they would not have done so if they could, but because they wanted strength to doe so.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which saying of <hi>Grotius</hi> I desire the Reader to take special notice of, the rather, because <hi>Grotius</hi> himself in the very same Section seems to make it lawfull for <hi>Christian Subjects</hi> to resist the <hi>Supreme Magistate</hi> in several cases; and some of them such, wherein the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> did not think it lawfull for them to doe so, as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself in his aforesaid saying tells us; and because it is upon the authority of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and what <hi>Grotius</hi> saith to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>resisting of Sovereigns</hi> by their <hi>Subjects,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth especially ground his justification of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> against our late Sovereign.

whole truth of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s meaning, appears by many of his following <hi>Aphorisms</hi> and Comments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, especially by those wherein (as if he were <hi>totius mundi arbiter,</hi> The Ruler of the whole world, or <hi>Rex regum</hi> and <hi>dominus dominantium,</hi> King of kings and Lord of lords, that is, a <hi>Protestant Pope,</hi> or the Catholick moderatour and decider of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies) <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>his Tract of obedience to rulers and howfar resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull</hi> àpag. 346. ad pag. 375. <hi>of his holy common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
                        </note> he boldly and Magisterially defines and states the <hi>Cases</hi> wherein <hi>Subjects</hi> may or may not resist their <hi>Sovereigns.</hi> For as of his special grace and favour he gives <hi>Kings,</hi> even limited Kings, leave to transgress their bounds to such or such a degree, without forfeiting their right to their Crowns, and without being lawfully resisted by their Subjects for so doing; so if they pass the limits he assigns them (as if he should say to <hi>Kings,</hi> as the King of Kings <note place="margin">Vid. ibidem à p. 375. ad p. 456.</note> saith to the waves of the Sea, <hi>Hitherto,</hi> O ye Kings, <hi>ye may go and no farther)</hi> then (saith he) they depose themselves, and then their <hi>Subjects</hi> ceasing to be Subjects, their rising up or making war against them can be no <hi>Rebellion.</hi>

                     <p>Whereby it plainly appears, that when he saith <note place="margin">But that they have no right to govern at all.</note> 
                        <hi>Tyrants have no right to their unlimited Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> his meaning is not that they have no right to govern tyrannically, but that they have no right to govern at all. For that <hi>Kings</hi> have a right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern tyrannically, or that they doe no injury to their Subjects, how much soever they do oppress them, I never heard of any <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> that was of that opinion but Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> onely.

                     <p>In all therefore that I have said hitherto for the justifying of my exception against this <hi>Aphorism</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, there is nothing, I am sure, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie either the <hi>Tyrannical</hi> Government of <hi>unlimited</hi> and <hi>despotical</hi> Sovereigns, or the illegal and <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Government of <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>political</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns; <note place="margin">Lawfull So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns not to be resisted;</note> but onely to prove that <hi>lawfull Sovereign Princes,</hi> whether <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>unlimited,</hi> are <hi>not to be resisted</hi> by their Subjects: which is no more than St. <hi>Paul</hi> asserts, speaking of the worst of Princes; nor no more than what may rationally, nay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, <note place="margin">According to the first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Kings by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</note> be collected from what <hi>Samuel</hi> said to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> when they would needs have a <hi>King,</hi> as other Nations had, and when God bids him tell them the manner of their King, or what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Kings</hi> they must expect to have sometimes, even such as all other Nations had sometimes, <hi>bad</hi> as well as <hi>good;</hi> and that they were to endure the <hi>one</hi> as well as the <hi>other,</hi> as all other Nations did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.

                     <p>And now let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> lay his hand upon his heart, and consider, who it is that in one place he calls <hi>a defier of Deity and Humanity;</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Samuel <hi>and St.</hi> Paul, &amp;c. <hi>blasphemed, as defiers of God and man.</hi>

                     <p>But is it possible, will some say, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> being so sober and discreet, and so meek a man (as he is thought to be) should publish in Print so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry severe a censure against Bishop <hi>Morley,</hi> or any man else that is called a <hi>Christian,</hi> because and onely because he maintains that and nothing but that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94113:115"/>
which was taught by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and was believed and practised by the next and best of their Disciples?</p>
                     <p>I answer, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> hath censured Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> as <hi>a defier of Deity and Humanity,</hi> and as an <hi>Enemy to God, to Kings, and to all mankind,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the places before quoted out of his printed Papers; and that he hath no other but the aforesaid cause for it, is evident likewise from what I have now said to disprove that Calumny: but the way he takes to induce his Readers to believe it, is worth the observation; it being the very same artificial <hi>jugling trick</hi> which I have observed him to make <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi>
                        </note> use of more than once before; I mean his putting a false <hi>Proposition</hi> of his own, instead or in the place of a true one of mine, and then inferring from the <hi>false</hi> one, what he knew could not be inferred from the <hi>true</hi> one, he chargeth me with what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from it.</p>
                     <p>Thus by misreporting what was affirmed by us and denied by him at the <hi>Savoy-</hi>Conference, he <note place="margin">Some Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it.</note> thence infers that I was <hi>grossly mistaken</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port I had made of what he said at that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                     <p>And thus again, because I had excepted against that <hi>Aphorism</hi> of his as false, which affirms <hi>all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Governours to be Tyrants, and to have no right to their unlimited Governments,</hi> He makes me say, that <hi>all humane Powers are not limited by God,</hi> and then infers that I am <hi>a defier of Deity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And so here likewise, because I say that <hi>lawfull Sovereigns are not to be resisted</hi> by their Subjects, though they be <hi>Tyrants,</hi> or though they do govern
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94113:115"/>
otherwise, than by God's or their own Laws they ought to govern, he would make his Readers to believe that I justify <hi>Tyranny</hi> it self, and that Kings may lawfully doe what they list to their Subjects, and take away what they list from them, their Lands, their Houses, their Wives, their Children, and their Lives also; and all this, because I say they are not to be resisted, if they doe so, by their Subjects. And doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> say so too, when he chargeth the Christians upon pain of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to resist <hi>Nero?</hi> who did all these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and more, and worse also; for he caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Nero<hi>'s cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>

                        <hi>all Mankind?</hi> I think he dares not; and yet if this Inference of his be good against me, it must from the same Premisses be good against St. <hi>Paul</hi> also; for the same Premisses will always infer the same Conclusion: and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> is, or Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> is not, upon this account, what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith he is, <hi>an Enemy to God, to Kings, and to all Mankind.</hi> But what is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then in the mean time? certainly either not so good a <hi>Logician,</hi> or so good a <hi>Christian</hi> as he would be thought to be.</p>

do) whether I say it be upon any or all of these accounts I know not: but this I know that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> as often as he mentions them, speaks very favourably of them, although they were (as much as the <hi>Orthodox Christians</hi> themselves were) for <note place="margin">and yet they for Bishops.</note> the Government of the Church by <hi>Bishops,</hi> and by such Bishops as the Orthodox Bishops then were and as ours now are, I mean <hi>Bishops</hi> of a different and Superiour Order to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and exercising <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction</hi> and authority over them.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Sovereigns highly accountable to God. The doctrine of Non-resistance, to the advantage of Subjects as well as of Kings. Hobbists, Papists and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, censured. Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s Aphorism justly excepted against, and the Bishop vindicated from being a Defier and an Enemy to God and Man.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe contrary doctrine whereunto which we maintain might have been suspected of <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to Kings,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls it,) if it had not been St. <hi>Paul's</hi> as well as ours; or if, because we teach that <hi>Kings</hi> are not to be resisted by their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Doctrine of non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, no flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to Kings, as Mr.</hi> B. <hi>calls it.</hi>
                        </note> it would follow therefore that we taught likewise, that such Kings as govern otherwise than by God's Laws and their own they ought to do, were not accountable to any, or not punishable at all for so doing. Whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> knows that we of the <hi>Church of England</hi> believe and teach that <hi>Kings</hi> the greatest of Kings, are as much nay more <note place="margin">Kings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished by him.</note> 
                        <hi>accountable</hi> to God, and punishable by God, either here or hereafter, for whatsoever they doe amiss, than the meanest of their <hi>Subjects</hi> are to them or by them; and so much the rather; because they are not punishable but by God onely.</p>
                     <p>And therefore as it would not onely be absurd but ridiculous, that because a man saith the Deputy <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, set forth by a like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
                        </note> Lieutenant or Viceroy of <hi>Ireland</hi> is not to be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned or punished by any in <hi>Ireland</hi> for what he doth amiss there; therefore he is not to be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned or punished at all; or that he whose Viceroy
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:94113:117"/>
he is, namely, the King of <hi>England</hi> may not or will not punish him, either there, or when he comes home: so it is equally absurd and ridiculous, to conclude (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> does) that Bishop <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> because he holds that <hi>Kings</hi> are not <hi>accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to or punishable by their <hi>Subjects,</hi> therefore he must needs encourage them to be <hi>Tyrants,</hi> as if they were not, or as if Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> thought and taught they were not, answerable to God and punishable by God for their <hi>Tyranny,</hi> either here or hereafter; and that not onely for their oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and ill usage of their Subjects, but for the dishonour they have done unto God, whose Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roys and Representatives they are; and therefore should be as he is, not onely <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> but <hi>mercifull</hi> and benign and <hi>gracious</hi> to all their Subjects. Thus we Believe and thus we Teach.</p>
                     <p>And withall we believe and teach also, That <hi>Subjects</hi> who suffer wrongfully, and yet patiently, <note place="margin">Subjects ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from wrongfull suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</note> under oppressing, Tyrannical and persecuting <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> (as the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> did, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced when they did so) shall be sure to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the sooner delivered from sufferings <hi>here,</hi> or to be finally so recompensed and rewarded <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> that they shall find to their unspeakable and endless comfort and joy, that it was good for them that they were so oppressed and afflicted. Thus I say do we believe, and thus do we teach both <hi>Kings and Subjects;</hi> and if both <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> did believe and doe as we teach them, neither would Subjects have cause to complain of their Kings, nor Kings to be jealous or afraid of their Subjects.</p>

                     <p>Such in relation to <hi>Kings</hi> are the <hi>Habbists</hi> and other the like Atheistical flatterers of Kings, who <note place="margin">The Hobbists censured on the one hand.</note> would make them believe, they may doe what they list, without doing any injury to their Subjects; and without being answerable to God for it; and that either because there is no God at all, or that there is no other life after this.</p>
                     <p>And such in relation to <hi>Subjects</hi> are the <hi>Papists,</hi> the <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who teach it to be lawfull for <note place="margin">The Papists and Sectaries on the other;</note> 
                        <hi>Subjects,</hi> when they are grieved and oppressed by their <hi>Sovereigns</hi> to such a degree, or (which is all one) when they think themselves to be so, to take up Arms against them; whereby they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be much more such, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> believed to be, I mean <hi>Enemies to God, to Kings, and to Subjects,</hi> and consequently <hi>to all Mankind</hi> than Bishop <hi>Morley</hi> is.</p>

Otherwise there might be <hi>Subjects</hi> which were Subjects to no-body, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>no Subjects</hi> at all: which is as absurd as to say there may be the Existence of a <hi>Body</hi> without the Existence of the <hi>Head</hi> of that Body, which was one of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s aforesaid Assertions.</p>

Again in all <hi>Bodies Politick,</hi> He or they that have the <hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> are above all the rest of the body whereof they are <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> and therefore cannot be Subject to any or all of them; and if so, then the same <hi>natural Person</hi> cannot be both a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> and a <hi>Subject</hi> too, which was another of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s aforesaid Assertions.</p>

                     <p>Again, <hi>Sovereignty</hi> is a thing which is in its own nature <hi>indivisible,</hi> so that in whomsoever it is, it is <hi>Wholly,</hi> and in whomsoever it is not wholly it is not at all; and consequently cannot be <hi>divided</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>equally</hi> or <hi>unequally,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> likewise saith it may be.</p>
                     <p>Finally, that it may be <hi>called</hi> a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> where One hath not the <hi>sole Sovereignty,</hi> is true, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that which <hi>is</hi> not a Monarchy, may be <hi>called</hi> a Monarchy) but that it may <hi>truly</hi> be so <hi>called</hi> is false; as it is false likewise, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is such a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the last of his aforesaid <hi>Assertions</hi> saith it is.</p>
                     <p>But of the two last of these <hi>Particulars</hi> I shall have occasion to speak more at large, when we come to examine, whether the Body Politick of <hi>England</hi> be such a <hi>mixt Body Politick,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith it is; and whether the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> thereof be not in the <hi>King</hi> alone, but so divided, as he affirms it to be betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> upon which <hi>Supposition</hi> onely he justifies,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94113:127"/>
or presumes to justifie the <hi>late Rebellion</hi> to have been <hi>a just war</hi> against the late King.</p>
                     <p>Whereby it plainly appears, that even in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own opinion, where the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> is not <hi>divided,</hi> but <hi>wholly</hi> in one and the same <hi>person</hi> (as it is not onely in all <hi>Despotical,</hi> but in <hi>all Kingdoms</hi> properly so called, whether <hi>Despotical</hi> or <hi>Political)</hi> or wholly in one and the same <hi>Coetus,</hi> or Assembly, (whether <hi>Aristocratical</hi> or <hi>Democratical)</hi> it ought not, it cannot be <hi>resisted</hi> without shattering in pieces the very essential constituting parts of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> by dividing the members from the head, which is all that I am concerned to prove at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; namely, that <hi>Subjects resisting their Sovereign, is inconsistent with the very being of a Body Politick,</hi> of what <hi>Species</hi> or denomination soever it is.</p>

                           <hi>Resistance inconsistent with peoples well being, as proving the occasion of Civil War. A case put by</hi> Grotius <hi>and several Instances proposed by him, which seem to allow Resistance, examined and cleared.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AGain, suppose it were not <hi>Inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>Being,</hi> yet if it be inconsistent with the <hi>Well-being</hi> of the <hi>Body Politick</hi> or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>resist</hi> or rise up in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> that is enough to prove it to be <hi>unlawfull;</hi> and consequently the endeavouring to make the People believe it to be lawfull, by <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> or <hi>preaching</hi> in defence of it, is <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>seditious,</hi> and such a thing as ought not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in a well-governed State, of any kind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                     <p>Now that this doctrine, <hi>That it is lawfull for</hi>

                        <hi>Subjects in any case to resist or rise up in arms against their Sovereign,</hi> is inconsistent with the <hi>Well-being</hi> of all <hi>Bodies Politick</hi> or Commonwealths of what kind or denomination soever, and consequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the welfare or well-being of all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> here in this World, methinks should need no other <hi>Argument</hi> to make it to be believed, but this one onely; that it undeniably makes all <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies</hi> to be always and unavoidably lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the worst of evils, that can befall any State <note place="margin">As being an occasion of Civil War, the worst of evils.</note> or humane Society, and that is a <hi>Civil War;</hi> which besides the horrible mischiefs it brings with

it; it commonly ends in a more insupportable <hi>Tyranny</hi> and bondage of the whole body of the People, than what was pretended to have been the cause of it. For proof whereof I might appeal not onely to the Testimony of all <hi>Histories</hi> of all <hi>Ages</hi> and of all <hi>Nations</hi> as well as of our own, but to the <hi>personal Experience</hi> of many thousands yet living, who have all of them seen, and many of them felt, what I have said of a <hi>Civil War</hi> to be true; namely, that it is the <hi>greatest</hi> of Evils a State is subject unto, and consequently ought not to be engaged in for the preventing, avoiding, or remedying of any that are <hi>less.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor are they (will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> say) the <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillo's</hi>

                     <p>I know that <hi>Grotius</hi> (who is often, but not always <note place="margin">Grotius <hi>puts a case, but contradicts himself and the Primitive Christians in his answer to it.</hi>

and practice of the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> and consequently to the doctrine of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and of <hi>Christ</hi> himself. For as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself tells us in one place, <hi>Consuetudo veterum Christianorum est op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima legis Christianoe interpres,</hi> that is, The custom of the old Christians is the best Interpreter of the Christian Law, in the general; so in this very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he tells us in another place, namely, in that before by me cited and which I desired to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; <hi>Nempe Christianis veteribus qui recentes ab Apostolorum &amp; Apostolicorum virorum disciplinâ,</hi>

                        <hi>eorum proescripta &amp; intelligebant meliùs &amp; perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ùs implebant, summam fieri injuriam puto ab iis, qui, quo minùs ipsi se defenderent in certissimo mortis pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculo, vires putant illis non animum defuisse.</hi> In which saying of his taking it for granted, that the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> which did best understand the <hi>Apostolical Precepts,</hi> and did most perfectly conform their practice thereunto, would not nor did not defend themselves, no not <hi>in certissimo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis periculo,</hi> when they were sure to be killed if they did not: and that not because they wanted either strength or courage, but because they thought as they were taught that it was not lawfull for them to doe so. And there cannot (saith <hi>Grotius</hi> in that place) a greater injury be done to those <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> than to think otherwise of them, that is, than to think that it was not <hi>for Conscience sake,</hi> but <hi>for want of strength</hi> that they forbore to defend themselves <hi>in certissimo mortis periculo,</hi> In the most certain peril of death; which is I think all one with <hi>in gravissimo &amp; certissimo discrimine,</hi> In the most grievous and most certain hazard; so that if it be lawfull for <hi>Christians</hi> to doe that

now <hi>ingravissimo &amp; certissimo discrimine,</hi> In the most grievous and certain hazard, which the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> who best understood (saith <hi>Grotius)</hi> the Apostolical doctrine, thought it not lawfull for them to doe then <hi>in certissimo mortis periculo,</hi> In the most certain peril of death, that is, in the very same case; it must be by virtue of some other <hi>Gospel,</hi> or of some <hi>special dispensation,</hi> that we have, and they had not; or that those Apostolical Precepts <hi>de non resistendo Supremam potestatem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentibus,</hi> Of not resisting those who have the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, were to be no longer in force, than untill the <hi>Christian Subjects</hi> should have power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to resist their <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> or at least to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves against them. Which opinion, how derogatory it is to the simplicity, sincerity and veracity of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and consequently how unworthy to be owned by any that owns himself to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> I think I have sufficiently proved already: nor can I suspect a man of so great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ingenuity, as <hi>Grotius</hi> was, ever to have been of this opinion, though I cannot see how he can be defended from leaning towards it, when he affirms, or seems at least to affirm, that may be done now by <hi>Christian Subjects,</hi> which was never done, nor never thought lawfull to be done in the very same case by the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> though they had strength enough to doe it, and though (saith he) they best understood the Apostolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and did most punctually comply with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. <note place="margin">He himself in effect disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his own Answer.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore lastly, it is observable, (and I am willing to observe it for that Great man's sake) that such a <hi>resistance</hi> of Sovereigns by their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94113:129"/>
even in such a case, <hi>in gravissimo &amp; certissimo discrimine,</hi> In the most grievous and most certain hazard, is not to be allowed (saith <hi>Grotius) Nisi cum hoc fortè additamento, si fieri possit absque maxima Reipublicoe perturbatione aut exitio plurimorum inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centium,</hi> Unless it can be done without a very great perturbation or disturbance of the Commonwealth, and without the destruction of very many innocent Persons: which in effect is all one, as if he had said, it is never to be done at all. For how there can be a forcible <hi>resistance</hi> of Sovereigns by their Subjects, or how Subjects can rise up in Arms, and make use of them either offensively or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively against their Sovereigns, <hi>Absque maxima Reipublicoe perturbatione &amp; exitio plurimorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentium;</hi> Without a very great perturbation of the Commonwealth, or without the destruction of very many innocent persons, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand: except we can imagine the <hi>Sovereign</hi> will have no Subjects to fight for him, (which <hi>Christ</hi> supposeth all Kings of this world have) on that there will be fighting without killing; or that none or very few of those, that are <hi>innocent</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, will be kill'd; which in a <hi>Civil War</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">De jure Belli ac pacis p. 112.</note> (which of all other Wars is commonly the most bloudy and most cruel) is not to be imagined. And consequently if <hi>Kings</hi> are not to be <hi>resisted</hi> by their <hi>Subjects,</hi> but in such a <hi>case</hi> as this, they are never to be resisted at all; because there can never be such a <hi>Case:</hi> so that <hi>Grotius</hi> his main Axiome, <hi>Summam potestatem tenentibus resisti jure non posse,</hi> That <hi>those who have the Supreme Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer cannot lawfully he resisted,</hi> is still safe and without exception.</p>

                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:94113:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Neither is the truth of it impeached by any of those several <hi>Instances,</hi> which he (I mean <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius)</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. For as to the <hi>first</hi> of those Instances, it speaks of such <hi>Kings,</hi> as were never Kings at all but <hi>in name</hi> onely, as the Kings of <hi>Lacedoemon</hi> were.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>second</hi> speaks of those that had been <hi>Kings,</hi> but ceased to be so by their own voluntary <hi>resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,</hi> as <hi>Diocletian</hi> did, and some of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings did also, and retir'd into Monasteries.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> speaks of such <hi>Kings</hi> as would <hi>alienate</hi> their Kingdoms unto <hi>Strangers,</hi> whom the <hi>Subjects</hi> may refuse to obey without <hi>resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their own <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> and are bound to doe so, not onely in regard of the <hi>natural Allegiance</hi> all <hi>Subjects</hi> owe to their <hi>natural Sovereign</hi> and to him <hi>onely</hi> as long as he lives, or as long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be their Sovereign; but in regard that after his death or after he voluntarily ceaseth to be their King, they owe the same Allegiance to his <hi>legal Successour</hi> in all <hi>Hereditary</hi> Kingdoms: And therefore (saith <hi>Grotius)</hi> the act or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of such an <hi>Alienation</hi> is <hi>null</hi> in it self and consequently is not at all <hi>obligatory</hi> to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>fourth</hi> speaks of such <hi>Kings</hi> as <hi>Verè hostili animo in totius Populi exitium feruntur,</hi> that is, Such Kings as would if they could destroy all their Subjects, and endeavour to doe so; <hi>Sed vix vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> (saith <hi>Grotius) id accidere posse in Rege men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis compote,</hi> But this (saith he) is hard to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined of any King that is <hi>mentis compos,</hi> that is in his wits, or that is not stark mad: and if he be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94113:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
stark mad, or not <hi>mentis compos,</hi> not in his right mind, then his <hi>case</hi> is the same with that of Kings that are <hi>Minors</hi> or <hi>Infants,</hi> and his <hi>Kingly Power</hi> is to be administred in his name by such, as by the Laws or Customes of his Kingdom, are to have the custody or care of him, while he continues in that condition, who are no more to be <hi>resisted</hi> by the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than the King himself was before he was in that condition.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>fifth</hi> instance is of such <hi>Kings,</hi> as <hi>In ipsâ delatione imperii,</hi> In the very making of them Kings are made Kings upon this express <hi>condition,</hi> That if they doe this or that, so or so, <hi>Subditi omni obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entioe vinculo solvuntur,</hi> The Subjects are discharged from all obligation of obedience to them: for then (saith <hi>Grotius)</hi> he that was <hi>King</hi> became a <hi>private person</hi> again. But I say, such a one was never a <hi>King</hi> at all, <hi>properly so called:</hi> because in the very Act, whereby he was made or rather called a <hi>King,</hi> he was indeed made a <hi>Subject</hi> to them (whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were) that had power to question whether he had done this or no, and to un-king him if he had, nay if he had not, if they should think he had, or say he had though they thought or knew he had not.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>sixth Instance</hi> is, when the <hi>King</hi> hath but a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Power;</hi> and the <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> have another part of it. But then say I (as I said before) the <hi>King</hi> is <hi>no King</hi> properly so called. I mean is no <hi>Sovereign,</hi> but a piece of Sovereign (if there can be such a thing,) and it is the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> He or They, that have the Sovereignty or the <hi>whole Sovereign power,</hi> that I say are in no case to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by their <hi>Subjects.</hi>

                     <p>As to the other of these two Instances, which <note place="margin">The fourth Instance.</note> may be meant of <hi>Kings properly so called</hi> (I mean such Kings as are indeed <hi>Sovereigns)</hi> namely the <hi>fourth,</hi> wherein upon supposition there were such a a King as would doe and did what he could to ruine his own Kingdom, and to destroy all his

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Several other Reasons, to prove the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulness of resisting, in any Case whatsoever. The Holy League in</hi> France <hi>and our late Rebellion brought in by way of Parallel.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ANd the Reasons for this, besides what hath been already produced out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> are; <hi>First,</hi> Because the object of <hi>humane Prudence</hi> in the constitution of <hi>humane Societies,</hi> and Kingdoms <note place="margin">Other reasons for non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> or Commonwealths, is not to prevent all such <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi> as possibly <hi>may</hi> be; no nor all such as (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the pravity and perversness of <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)</hi> ordinarily <hi>will</hi> be, and of necessity <hi>must</hi> be, even in the best constituted and best managed State or humane Society whatsoever. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Oportet esse Hoereses,</hi> There must be <hi>Heresies</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> not, as if it were not better there were none, but because as long as men are men, that is, such cross-grain'd creatures, and of such different <hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>Intellectuals</hi> from one another as they are, there cannot chuse but be some <hi>Heresies</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> so, and for the very same reason, <hi>oportet esse gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamina,</hi> there must be, that is, there cannot chuse but be <hi>Grievances</hi> in the <hi>Civil State</hi> or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth also. And therefore the object of <hi>humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> (seeing it cannot prevent or provide against <hi>all</hi> evils that may or will be in all <hi>States)</hi> it is as much as may be to prevent or provide against those that are the <hi>greatest</hi> rather than the lesser, and those that are likely to happen <hi>often,</hi> rather than those that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94113:133"/>
are not likely to happen at all, or very seldome; and those that are inconsistent with the <hi>being,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than those that are inconsistent with the <hi>well-being</hi> onely of a <hi>State</hi> or Body Politick. For as in the body <hi>natural,</hi> so in the body <hi>Politick,</hi> no <hi>reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> is to be prescribed or applyed that is worse than the <hi>disease.</hi> And therefore,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Any <hi>gravamina,</hi> nay all the <hi>gravami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> or grievances, that <hi>Subjects</hi> can suffer under their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> are to be endured, rather than they are to <hi>rebell</hi> or to rise up in Arms against him; because that will be the cause of <hi>more</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> evils, than any of these are, or can be, against which it can be made use of for a remedy: For no <hi>Tyranny</hi> can be so bad as <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and <hi>any</hi> Government, how Tyrannical soever, is better than <hi>none.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the saying of one of the wisest Statesmen that ever was in the World, <hi>Iniquissimam pacem justissimo bello antefero,</hi> I prefer, said he, the most injurious <hi>Peace,</hi> that is such a peace wherein men are obnoxious to the greatest injuries, before the most just <hi>War;</hi> he means the most just <hi>Civil War,</hi> or such a Civil War, as may seem to have the justest or most justifiable causes for it: because indeed any <hi>Civil War,</hi> upon what grounds or pretences soever it be undertaken, puts the whole body of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> into a much worse condition than it can be under any <hi>Government</hi> or any <hi>Governours</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. For whilst there is a <hi>Government,</hi> though neverso unjust or injurious, there is some authority and execution of <hi>Laws</hi> for the protection of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, if not of the <hi>Subjects</hi> against the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> yet of the Subjects against one another; but <hi>Silent leges inter arma,</hi> When rebellion is up there is no
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94113:133"/>
safety for any man against any man, not for Fathers against their Children, nor for Brethren against Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Non hospes ab hospite tutus,</hi> One friend is not safe from another. To conclude, <hi>Rebellion</hi> is the ingagement of the whole body of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> against it self, and will if it be not suppressed make it at length <hi>Felo de se,</hi> A murtherer of it self, and to end either in the <hi>desolation</hi> or <hi>dissolution</hi> of it self. So that whereas all other evils are but prejudicial to the <hi>well-being,</hi> This, I mean <hi>Rebellion</hi> or a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Civil War,</hi> is always in its <hi>tendency,</hi> though not always perhaps in the <hi>event,</hi> destructive to the very <hi>Being</hi> of all States and Humane Societies whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and consequently to the peace and welfare of <hi>Subjects</hi> as well as <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> that is, to all and every one of mankind. And therefore <hi>this</hi> being the <hi>greatest</hi> of all Evils, it is never to be made use of to prevent or redress any that are <hi>less,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently never to be made use of at all; because all other evils incident to a <hi>Body Politick</hi> are <hi>less</hi> than this, and that not onely taken <hi>singly</hi> but <hi>joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>And yet <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is one Reason more, why in humane prudence and according to the dictates of right reason, the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of Subjects against their Sovereign ought not to be allowed; no, not though possibly it might so happen that (humanely speaking) there could be no other way or means to preserve the very <hi>Being</hi> of the Body Politick: as for example, in one of the aforesaid <hi>Instances</hi> or Cases which is put by <hi>Grotius</hi> (but put by him as hardly credible) supposing there should be such a <hi>King</hi> as would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess so implacable a hatred to his <hi>Subjects,</hi> that he would if he could destroy them all; and that he
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94113:134"/>
will endeavour to doe so: The question is <hi>whether,</hi> because possibly there may be such a Case, there ought not to be some <hi>exception</hi> from the aforesaid general <hi>Rule</hi> of the unlawfulness of <hi>Subjects</hi> taking up of Arms to <hi>resist</hi> their <hi>Sovereign</hi> in any case whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; I answer No; and that not onely because St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his prohibition <hi>to resist the Supreme Power</hi> hath made no such exception, though one of the Supreme Powers, whom he forbid the Christians to resist, did wish the whole body of the <hi>Roman</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had but one head, that he might cut it off at one blow; and another of them had set the capital City of his Empire on fire, commanding his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to kill all the Citizens that endeavoured to quench the burning of their Houses; he himself in the mean while playing upon an Instrument all the time it was a burning: Neither will I insist upon the Judgment and Practice of the <hi>Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who though they knew their Sovereigns the <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi> had professed they would, and really did what they could to destroy all their <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Subjects;</hi> yet the Christians did not think that either this profession or practice of their Sovereigns (which was an evident and undeniable demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their implacable hatred against them) was sufficient to dispense with them for <hi>resisting</hi> of or for defending themselves against them: as was notably exemplified by what was done and suffered by <hi>Mauritius</hi> and his Legion according to that Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal story before recited. But I will not insist, I say, upon any Argument drawn from any religious <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick,</hi> to justifie my denial of any exception to be made to the general Rule of <hi>non-resisting</hi> of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns by their Subjects, or for dispensing with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94113:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to resist their Sovereigns in any case whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though possibly there may be such a Case (as <hi>Barclay,</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> out of <hi>Barclay,</hi> puts) even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians. But that which I insist on at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is this, that abstracting from the consideration of what <hi>God</hi> hath either <hi>commanded</hi> or <hi>forbidden</hi> in his <hi>Word,</hi> as likewise from the consideration of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> or of any other life after this, where men are to be rewarded or punished for what they have done here; it is not onely <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> but absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> to the peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and safety, and happiness of all mankind here in this world, that men should be taught and believe, that the <hi>resisting</hi> of Sovereigns by their Subjects is always and utterly <hi>unlawfull</hi> in any case whatsoever; <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Resistance unlawfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in</hi> Groti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>his Case.</hi>
                        </note> yea though possibly such might be the Case, as that they would all be destroyed, if they did not resist: and that for these reasons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Because it is not onely very <hi>improbable,</hi> but as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself saith scarcely <hi>credible,</hi> there should ever be any such Case.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because (according to a Maxime of our own Law) <hi>A mischief is better than an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience;</hi> that is, (as I conceive) it is better for a <hi>State</hi> to run the hazard of a greater future evil, which may either not happen at all, or (if at all) very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than for the avoiding of it to admit or submit to a <hi>lesser,</hi> whereunto it <hi>may</hi> always and <hi>must</hi> very often be obnoxious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because, if it be allowed to be lawfull for Subjects to <hi>resist</hi> their Sovereign in such a Case as <hi>Grotius</hi> puts, or in any other case whatsoever; it will be always and altogether as dangerous both to <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> as if it were granted in never so
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94113:135"/>
many other cases also; because <hi>that one</hi> may alway be pretended to be the present case, and the People may be always made to believe it is so, though it be never so improbable to be so.</p>
                     <p>As may appear by divers Examples besides those I have already quoted out of Scripture, especially that of <hi>David,</hi> who though he was the best of Kings that Nation ever had, yet his Son <hi>Absalom</hi> made the People believe that he neglected to doe them justice in hearing their complaints, and redressing their grievances, and thereby <hi>stole away their hearts</hi> from his Father, (saith the <hi>Text)</hi> and made them to rebell against him.</p>
                     <p>But to instance in one <hi>Example</hi> or two more, nearer home and nearer our own times.</p>
                     <p>It is not long since the Princes of the House of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> I mean the <hi>Guises,</hi> being excluded by <note place="margin">
                           <hi>An Instance, from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly League in</hi> France.</note> 
                        <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France</hi> from the chief managery of affairs, which they formerly had in that Kingdom, resolved to gain that by force, which they could not keep by the King's favour; and to that end, to stir up the People under some publick and plausible pretence to joyn with them in a rebellion against the King. But what that <hi>pretence</hi> should be, which the People should be baited withall, being debated by the chief of the Faction, and some being of one mind and some of another, <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> being head of the whole party, stood up and said; <hi>What need</hi> is there of any debate or consultation as to this particular? can there be a better, or more plausible, or more efficacious Motive to stir up the People to joyn with us against the King; than to <note place="margin">The Catholick Religion, the pretence there.</note> make them believe the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> is in danger, and that the King is not onely a favourer of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonotts</hi>
                        <pb n="243" facs="tcp:94113:135"/>
but a <hi>Hugonott</hi> himself in his heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it is absolutely necessary for all good <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> to joyn in an <hi>Association</hi> or <hi>Holy League</hi> for the defence of the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> and to oppose the bringing in of <hi>Hugonott Heresie</hi> against all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of all conditions whatsoever, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the King himself? It was easily agreed to by all the rest of the <hi>Conspiratours,</hi> that this was a very <hi>plausible</hi> pretence indeed, but withall so <hi>incredible</hi> as to the King's particular, as that it would not be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult onely, but impossible to make the People believe it, and consequently to make them rise up against the King upon that account; it being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known and believed that that King was as <hi>Bigott</hi> or zealous a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> as any was in <hi>France;</hi> having been himself not a <hi>Spectatour</hi> onely but an <hi>Actour</hi> also in the <hi>Massacre</hi> of the <hi>Hugonotts</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> not long before; and was still such a <hi>Devote,</hi> that he was never almost seen in publick but betwixt two <hi>Capuchins,</hi> with a <hi>Crucifix</hi> in his hand and his Beads at his girdle. Whereunto the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> replied laughing, <hi>Let me alone</hi> (said he) with the managing of that part of the affair. I will undertake within one month by those I will set on work (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> the <hi>Friars</hi> and other <hi>Popular Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers)</hi> to make the King to be believed over all <hi>France</hi> to be as arrant a <hi>Hugonott</hi> as any in <hi>Geneva.</hi> And so he did; whereupon that <hi>Rebellious Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which by its Godfather the <hi>Pope</hi> was called the <hi>Holy League)</hi> was made against the King, and as bloudy a War as ever was in <hi>France</hi> was raised and maintained by it; neither did it end with the death of the <hi>King</hi> (who was murthered by a <hi>Jacobin Friar)</hi> but continued against his <hi>Successour</hi> upon the same
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94113:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>pretence</hi> and with the same <hi>intentions:</hi> the deluded People in the mean time being made to believe by their <hi>Ghostly Fathers,</hi> that it was <hi>God's Cause</hi> they fought for, and that those that died or were killed in it, were sure to go immediately and directly to <hi>Heaven,</hi> without dropping into <hi>Purgatory</hi> by the way.</p>
                     <p>Another <hi>Example</hi> of the same kind we had here <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from our late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in</hi> England.</note> of late amongst <hi>Our selves;</hi> that is of the <hi>Peoples</hi> being stirred up by their <hi>Preachers</hi> to joyn with a factious, ambitious and discontented Party of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in a <hi>Rebellion</hi> against our late <hi>Sovereign Lord of ever blessed memory,</hi> upon as false and groundless a pretence, as that was against the King of <hi>France.</hi> For, as <hi>there</hi> the People were made to believe by their <hi>Popish Preachers,</hi> that their Religion was in danger, and that their King was an <hi>Hugonott</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> though as I said before he indeed was (as he prosessed himself to be) a very zealous and rigid <hi>Papist,</hi> and had given more than proof enough that he was so: Even so our People <hi>here</hi> were by their <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and other their <hi>Schismatical Preachers</hi> made to believe, that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion</hi> here was in very great danger, and <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion the pretence here.</note> that <hi>Popery</hi> was very likely to be brought in, because the King was a <hi>Papist</hi> or <hi>Popishly affected</hi> at least; whereas it was evident to all the world both by his Profession and his Practice, that he was as truly a zealous and devout <hi>Protestant</hi> as any the best of his Protestant Subjects, and moreover as resolute a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith as it is setled and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law in the <hi>Church of England</hi> against both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> as any King could or ought to be; I might add, <hi>as knowingly so too</hi> as ever any
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94113:136"/>
King was, but his Father onely. And yet thousands of his Subjects were made to believe that he was a <hi>Papist</hi> in his heart, and upon that account were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded and engaged to fight against him; nay many of them were made to believe, that the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> it self, as it was established by Law, was but disguised <hi>Popery,</hi> and that the <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> was but the <hi>Popish Missal</hi> or Mass Book trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into English, and that the <hi>Bishops</hi> with all the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> were an <hi>Antichristian Hierarchy,</hi> and were or would be all of them Vassals to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as soon as they had an opportunity safely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves to be so. Now if the People could be made to believe (as we see they were) that <hi>such a King</hi> as He was, and <hi>such a Church</hi> as Ours is, were <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> against all Evidence both of reason and of sense to the contrary; what is there that they cannot be made to believe? and consequently what security can there be for <hi>Kings</hi> from their <hi>Subjects,</hi> either for their Power or their Persons? or for <hi>Subjects</hi> from their <hi>fellow Subjects,</hi> or for preserving of the publick <hi>Peace</hi> for a moment onely? If there be any one, I say <hi>any one</hi> case of any kind in any degree, wherein <hi>Subjects</hi> may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without scruple of Conscience to <hi>take up Arms</hi> against their <hi>Sovereign;</hi> that <hi>one</hi> (as I said before) shall always be pretended and believed to be the <hi>Case,</hi> as often as the contrivers and trumpeters of <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> will have it to be so, though there be no ground or reason at all for it, as it is evident there was not in either of the aforesaid <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> or Examples.</p>
                     <p>I know there were other <hi>pretences</hi> besides that of <note place="margin">Other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made use of for the late Rebellion.</note> 
                        <hi>Religion,</hi> to justifie the <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the late King,

as his breach of <hi>Trust,</hi> his violation of <hi>Laws,</hi> his bringing or endeavouring to bring in <hi>Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it to be believed, though <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks it incredible that any King in his wits should do so) his professing himself an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the whole body of the <hi>People</hi> by making <hi>War</hi> against them all, (as if he meant to be a King without Subjects) and finally what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was thought to be most likely to make either his <hi>Person</hi> or his <hi>Government</hi> or both to be <hi>feared</hi> and <hi>hated</hi> by the whole Nation, though really and truly there was no more ground for any of them than there was for his purpose of bringing in <hi>Popery;</hi> which though the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the Faction knew well enough, yet they knew too that it would serve their turn as well as if it were true, if the People could be made to believe it was so, and withall that they might lawfully, nay that they were bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science with their Lives and Fortunes to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, their Wives and Children, from being made <hi>slaves</hi> (for that's the style it must run in) by the <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>Evil Counsellours,</hi> who ought to be brought to condign punishment by <hi>force,</hi> if it cannot be done by <hi>Law;</hi> against which the People were made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the King did protect those <hi>Evil Counsellours</hi> of his.

                  <p>The late War in <hi>England</hi> against the King proved to have been a Rebellion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> plead or argue in defence or justification of it.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The late War proved to have been made against the King, and consequently to be Rebellion. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Declaration discuss'd, together with the danger of Arbitrary Votes. The Judges opinion in the Earl of</hi> Essex <hi>his Case in Queen</hi> Elizabeths <hi>time. The</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Clergy charged with the Rebellion.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND thus having, as I conceive, sufficiently proved it to be unlawful for Subjects to rise up in Arms against their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> in any case or upon any provocation whatsoever; as being not only contrary to the Precepts of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> but to the Dictates of right <hi>Reason</hi> also: I thought there would have been no need of saying any more to prove the <note place="margin">The Bishops grounds to prove the late War unlawful.</note> 
                        <hi>late War</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> to be Unlawful; because I took it for granted, that it was a <hi>War</hi> made <hi>against
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94113:139"/>
the King,</hi> and that our King was our only <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and that those that made the War were but <hi>Subjects,</hi> meer Subjects, and no more than Subjects. But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That the late War was not made against <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grounds to justifie it.</note> the <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the King was not our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> at least not our sole Sovereign. And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That those that made the War were not meer <hi>Subjects,</hi> but had their share in the <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> and that in the chiefest part of the Sovereignty (namely the <hi>Legislative</hi> power) as well as the <hi>King</hi> had.</p>
                     <p>And upon these grounds he builds his <hi>Babel</hi> of confusion; and of the solidity of these grounds he is so very confident, that he saith he will confess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">His confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of these grounds.</note> to have been a <hi>Rebel,</hi> nay, a most <hi>perfidious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bei,</hi> and that he will <hi>offer his Head to Justice</hi> as a <note place="margin">H. C. p. 489, 490.</note> Rebel, if these grounds of his can be solidly confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Let us try therefore, whether they be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, as he presumes they are or no. I for my part am so far from thinking them to be so, that they seem to me to have no solidity at all in any of them.</p>
                     <p>We will begin with the first, <hi>viz.</hi> that the late <note place="margin">The first of them confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> 
                        <hi>War</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> was not a War <hi>against the King,</hi> and therefore could not be a <hi>Rebellion.</hi> The <hi>Consequence</hi> I confess to be good; But how doth he prove the <hi>Antecedent?</hi> why, he proves the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, namely, that the War was not against the <note place="margin">H. C. 476. <hi>ad sinem istius pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</hi> The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> King, <hi>because the Parliament declared it was not against the King, but only against his evil Counsellors, and his Delinquent Subjects, that misled him, and were his Enemies as well as the Commonwealths.</hi> And it was
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94113:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon this account, saith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that I served the Parliament; nor do I know (saith he) <hi>that I</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>ever fought against the King, unless every one of the Kings Soldiers was a King; or some one of them at</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B.</hi> perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ingaged in the War.</note> 
                        <hi>least.</hi> From which saying of his, I observe by the way, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself, in obedience to the Parliament, did himself personally fight against the <hi>Kings Soldiers,</hi> but not against the <hi>King,</hi> unless some one of those <hi>Soldiers</hi> he fought against was the King; as if no body can be said to fight against the <hi>King,</hi> but one that hath a personal Combat or Duel with the <hi>King.</hi> And perhaps the <hi>Parliament,</hi> not <note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments design in that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> thinking it time yet to speak out, did hope to make the People believe, that they made War against <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent Subjects</hi> only, and not against the <hi>King;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they did not, as the King of <hi>Syria</hi> did, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Chron. 18. v. 30.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their General and his Officers <hi>to fight with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther small nor great, but only with the King.</hi> It is true, the Parliament did not so: but it is true too, that they did not except the King from being fought with neither; nor consequently from being kill'd. For, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith, <hi>it is to be suppos'd those that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own confession in the case. H. C. p. 422.</note> 
                        <hi>fight would kill those with whom they fight:</hi> and then what might have become of the King, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had hapned to encounter him when he was a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with other of his Soldiers? But, to let this pass, as spoken of occasionally only, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us, that he and those that engaged with him in the late War <hi>were obliged to believe the Parliaments Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it was not a War against the King, because the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">H. C. p. 471.</note> 
                        <hi>Parliament were not only the most competent Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and Judges, but the chosen Trustees of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Liberties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:94113:140"/>
But whom or what doth Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> mean by such <note place="margin">By Parliament Mr. <hi>B.</hi> means the House of Commons.</note> 
                        <hi>Parliaments</hi> as the People are obliged to believe? surely not the <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> which is the true notion of a <hi>Parliament;</hi> no, nor the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> (who both of them together are but the Body of a <hi>Parliament</hi> without a Head.) For the reason which he gives, why they <hi>(the People)</hi> are obliged to believe them, is, because they are their <hi>chosen Trustees;</hi> but so are the House of <hi>Commons only,</hi> and not the <hi>Lords.</hi> So that whatsoever the <hi>House of Commons</hi> declare or remonstrate unto the People, is to be believed to be true, and just, and legal, and the People to act accordingly; and some there will always be that will do so.</p>
                     <p>For Example, the House of <hi>Commons</hi> in the late <note place="margin">The ground of <hi>Felton</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the D. of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> a Vote of the House of Commons.</note> Kings time Voted the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> (this Dukes Father) to be an Enemy to the publick; and therefore <hi>Felton</hi> thought himself obliged to kill him, and did so, and for no other reason but that only. For being presently apprehended and ask't why he did it? <hi>Look</hi> (said he) <hi>betwixt the Crown and Lining of my Hat, and you shall find the reason why I thought my self bound in conscience to God, and in duty to my King and Country to do it.</hi> And there (as he told them they should) they found a Paper sticht to the inside of the Lining with the aforesaid <hi>Vote</hi> of the House of <hi>Commons</hi> written upon it. And this was told me by a very credible Witness Sir <hi>Tho. Alisbury,</hi> then one of the Masters of Requests, but formerly Secretary for the Admiralty to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Duke, who was by when he was Murder'd, and heard the aforesaid Examination of <hi>Felton,</hi> and his justifying of what he had done upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the aforesaid <hi>Vote</hi> of the House of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:94113:140"/>
which was taken out of his Hat, and seen and read by the aforesaid Sir <hi>Tho. Alisbury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have repeated the Story of this matter of fact, <note place="margin">The dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of such Votes.</note> the rather, because there have been of late divers such <hi>Votes</hi> passed in the House of <hi>Commons</hi> against several Persons of eminent Quality and Dignity, who were all of them to be supposed to be innocent until they were proved to be guilty; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any such proof made, or any proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them <hi>per legem terrae,</hi> or according to the Law of the Land; as some of them were, so all of the like quality, that is, all the <hi>Nobility,</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a Major party of a House of <hi>Commons,</hi> as Enemies to the Commonwealth, or of King and Kingdom; and according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Doctrine, must by the People be believed to be so; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently they that are so Voted, how many, how great, and how innocent soever they are, they are to be exposed to have their throats cut by any <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Zealot,</hi> or (which is worse) to be torn in pieces by the inraged Rabble, as the two <hi>Dewitts</hi> were lately in <hi>Holland,</hi> and as Dr. <hi>Lamb</hi> was in <hi>London</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James.</hi> For it is but giving of the Word in such a season, and down goes that <hi>Voted,</hi> or rather that <hi>Devoted</hi> Person, and is knock'd on the head before he can open his mouth to speak for himself, when perhaps he is not the Man they took him for neither.</p>
                     <p>What is become in the mean time of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">No man safe in such cases.</note> Where is the security thereby provided, for the Lives, Liberties and Properties of <hi>Free-born English-men?</hi> when an arbitrary Vote of the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> if it be believed (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith it must be) by the People; and be put in execution
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94113:141"/>
(as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> cannot deny but it may be, because it hath been) may take away any mans life, how innocent soever, without any farther process, or a legal proof of any crime against him. For who is there that can secure himself from such a <hi>Vote?</hi> or that can be secured after he is devoted by such a Vote, from being killed by the next man that meets him in the Streets? for there be more <hi>Feltons</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter)</hi> than one; neither will the hanging of one discourage all the rest from hazarding their lives upon the same account, as long as they are possessed and actuated with the same principle, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that it is not only lawful, but a glorious and meritorious deed, to kill any man that is an Enemy to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and withal that he is obliged to believe that any, or as many, as the <hi>House of Commons</hi> shall declare to be so, are so.</p>
                     <p>It was high time therefore for the <hi>King</hi> to give a stop to such proceedings by dissolving the late <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> to prevent the proscribing of all that were about him and employed by him, and perhaps the remonstrating against himself also as their Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors had done against his Father: which <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons made use of for the destruction of the Kings Person.</note> made by the then House of <hi>Commons,</hi> as it was intended and made use of at first by the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> to begin and carry on their Rebellion against the King and his Party; so was it made use of at last also by the <hi>Independents</hi> for the destruction of the Kings Person: the pretended male-administration of the Government (which was the matter of the <hi>Remonstrance)</hi> being that for which he was indicted and condemned and put to death by the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi> And yet that very <hi>Remonstrance</hi> it was that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the place before quoted saith, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94113:141"/>
were obliged to believe, and consequently to act thereupon as afterwards they did, and yet good man he was in the mean time far from being <hi>guilty of any hurt to the Kings Person, or destruction of his</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hol. C. <hi>p.</hi> 489,</note> 
                        <hi>Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But why was he or the rest of the People obliged <note place="margin">Parliaments not infallible nor impecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s own confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</note> to believe either that <hi>Remonstrance</hi> or his <hi>Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the House of <hi>Commons?</hi> were they <hi>infallible</hi> that they could not be deceived themselves, or were they <hi>impeccable</hi> that they could not deceive others? neither the one nor the other: For Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells us, <hi>it is well known that Parliaments,</hi> quà tales, <hi>(as such) are not divine, religious, Protestant, or just: That sometimes the major part in either or both Houses may be the worst.</hi> And therefore I should think not always to be believed in what they declare, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be complied with by the People (whose <hi>Trustees</hi> they are) in whatsoever they command or undertake. For if They be such as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith They may be, may They not betray their trust, and act contrary to the Interest of those that trust them? Yes, saith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> they may, and consequently may (saith he) <hi>forfeit their power as well as Kings; nay, in some cases</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter) We are all,</hi> (that is the whole Nation) <hi>to take part with the King against the Parliament: as First, If they would depose</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Holy Com-w. <hi>pag.</hi> 437, 438.</note>

Ibid.</note> speaking of did, and did it most notoriously) <hi>there</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Peoples duty is to forsake them and to cleave to the King against them.</hi> But who shall be Judg whether they do so or no? or if there be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94113:142"/>
betwixt those between whom the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> is divided (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> supposeth it is betwixt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> here in <hi>England)</hi> and the one usurps, or is pretended to usurp upon the other; What then? why then, saith Mr. <hi>Baxter, it belongs</hi>

                        <hi>to the People to judg whose cause is best and to resist the usurping party.</hi> But the People (as he tells us in another place) <hi>cannot themselves judg for themselves;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence in the resolution of such cases.</note> and therefore (saith he) <hi>the Constitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment having made the Parliament the Trustees of our Liberties, hath made them our Eyes by which We must discern our dangers:</hi> And therefore (as he saith a little before in the same page) <hi>We are obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them as the most competent Witnesses, and Judges, and the chosen Trustees of our Liberties.</hi> So that if there be a difference betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> and the House of <hi>Commons</hi> would depose the <hi>King</hi> never so unjustly, or change the Government never so notoriously, or betray their trust never so perfidiously, yet if the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> themselves will not say they do so, but declare the contrary, the People are to believe them and to side with them against the <hi>King;</hi> yea, and against the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> too, if they joyn with the <hi>King:</hi> which how it can consist with the Doctrine of <hi>Co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> or with his own aforesaid Assertion, that <hi>in some cases</hi> the People are to cleave to the <hi>King</hi> against the <hi>Parliament,</hi> he were best to consider.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, thanks be to God, We have a <note place="margin">The Law a sure Rule.</note> better and a more certain <hi>Rule</hi> of right and wrong and to be guided in what We are to believe and do, than an arbitrary <hi>Vote</hi> of the major part of the House of <hi>Commons;</hi> and that is the known <hi>Law of the Land.</hi> For <hi>verissimum illud</hi> (saith <hi>Grotius) ubi semel

                     <p>If therefore the question be, Whether the <hi>late War</hi>

For when the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, at his Arraignment for Treason and Rebellion against the Queen, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he took up Arms without her Commission) pleaded that he did it <hi>for</hi> the Queen and not <hi>against her;</hi> because his meaning was only to remove <hi>Cecill</hi> and <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Raleigh</hi> and other evil Councellors that were about her, and were hers and the States Enemies as well as his; protesting then, as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> does now, that he meant not any the least hurt to the Queens <hi>Person</hi> or diminution of her <hi>Power:</hi> upon which often reiterated protestation of the Earls, especially that of his meaning no hurt to the <hi>Queens</hi> Person; the Sages of the Law, that were Assessors to the <hi>Lords</hi> that were his Judges, being askt by the Lords, what was the Judgment of the <note place="margin">The Judges Opinion in that case.</note> 
                        <hi>Law</hi> in that Case; <hi>Pronunciarunt, si quis attentaverit ita se firmare, ut Rex resistere non potuerit, Rebellionis tenetur,</hi> &amp;c. <q>They pronounced or declared that <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Item</hi> that the Law interpreteth that in every Rebellion there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy against the Life and Crown of the <hi>King;</hi> for a <hi>Rebell</hi> will never suffer the King to live or

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the force of <hi>Reason;</hi> because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but that he, which hath once given Law to his <hi>King,</hi> should never permit the King to recover his former authority, or to live, left at any time after he should revenge it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly</hi> and lastly, They confirmed it likewise by <hi>Examples</hi> drawn from our <hi>English Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the II. and <hi>Richard</hi> the II. both which being once by force of Arms gotten by their Subjects into their Power, were not long after Deposed and made away also.</p>
                     <p>I have repeated at large what was then said to be <note place="margin">Three Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations drawn from thence.</note> the <hi>Law of England</hi> by the authorised and sworn Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors of the Laws, I mean the Judges. And from what was said by them then in that particular Case, I observe,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That Arms taken up, or Forces raised by <hi>Subjects</hi> of what condition or upon what pretence soever, without the <hi>Sovereigns</hi> leave or commission, are in construction of Law taken up and raised against the Sovereign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> That such Forces so raised, against whomsoever or to what end soever they are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be employed, are in construction of Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not only to take away the Kings <hi>Power</hi> but his <hi>Life</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because the Law presumes, that those that have taken away his Power will not let
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94113:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him live, for fear he may recover his Power, and revenge himself of those that took it away from him; I cannot chuse but think that the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party, though they did not at first intend to take away the Kings <hi>life,</hi> yet after they had taken away his <hi>Power,</hi> and made him their Prisoner, and used <note place="margin">The Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would have done what the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents did, had they been let alone.</note> him so barbarously as they did whilst he was their Prisoner, I cannot chuse but think, I say, that (had not the <hi>Independents</hi> taken him out of their hands) they would have taken away his life at last also, though not by a formal publick judiciary Tryal as the <hi>Independents</hi> did; but some way or other they would have done it. For who can believe they would have suffered him to live, or at least to live as a King, whom They could not chuse but think they had provoked beyond a capacity of being Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by him, if ever he should be in a condition to be revenged of them? And why should We think they would have stuck at making him away in the dark or in a <hi>Prison,</hi> whom before they had so often indeavoured to kill in the open <hi>Field?</hi> For <hi>it is to be supposed,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Baxter, that those that fight would kill those they fight against;</hi> and therefore <note place="margin">Holy Com. <hi>p.</hi> 422.</note> it is to be supposed likewise (say I) that those that commissioned their Armies to fight against their King (as the <hi>Presbyterian Parliament</hi> did the Earl of <hi>Essex)</hi> did commission them likewise to kill the King if they could. For I never heard that the King was excepted from being fought against, and <note place="margin">The Kings Person excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in none of their Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssions.</note> consequently from being kill'd, in any of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions: or that so much as any private Instruction or Intimation was given to my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> or to any of his Officers, much less to all of them, to spare the King: such a one I mean as <hi>David</hi> gave to <hi>Joab</hi> and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94113:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Officers of his Army for the sparing of <hi>Absolom.</hi> So that there was no more care taken by the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for sparing of the <hi>King's</hi> life, than for sparing the life of any of those whom their Armies were commissioned to sight against and kill; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they were commissioned to kill the <hi>King</hi> as well as any of the rest They were to fight withal.</p>
                     <p>And if so, then not only those that commission'd <note place="margin">The Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Clergy taxed, as to the late Kings Death.</note> those that fought against the King, but those that stirred them up, and encouraged them to <hi>fight against</hi> the King, did stir them up and encourage them to <hi>kill</hi> the King also: and if so, how can the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Clergy</hi> of those times, especially the <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Parliament Preachers,</hi> be excused from being <hi>intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally</hi> guilty of the late <hi>King's death,</hi> before he was <note place="margin">Fid. Evangil. Armatum.</note> 
                        <hi>actually</hi> murthered by the <hi>Independents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But of all the rest how will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> excuse <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>B.</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> himself who tells us it is to be supposed that those that <hi>fight</hi> would <hi>kill</hi> those they fight against, and consequently that those that encourage them to <hi>fight,</hi> do encourage them to <hi>kill</hi> those whom they fight against, and withal confesseth <hi>that he encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thousands</hi> to do that which the <hi>Law</hi> calls <hi>fighting against the King;</hi> how will he, I say, excuse himself from being, <hi>consequentially</hi> at least, if not <hi>intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> guilty of the late Kings Death? How then can he with any ingenuity or sincerity say, that <hi>he was never guilty of hurt to the Person or destruction of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Hol. Com. <hi>p.</hi> 489, &amp; 490.</note> 
                        <hi>the Power of the King?</hi> And yet he doth say so, and that so confidently, that he professeth likewise that <hi>if either this or that</hi> (viz) <hi>that if either he was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>

                        <hi>of hurt to the Person, or destruction of the Power of the King, can be proved against him, he will never gain-say them that call him a most perfidious Rebell,

and tell him he is guilty of a far greater sin, than Murther, Whoredom, Drunkenness, and such like.</hi>
                     </p>

                        </note> it seems, that a <hi>Rebel</hi> is a worse man and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinner, than a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> or a <hi>Whoremonger,</hi> or a <hi>Murtherer,</hi> if he be indeed a <hi>Rebel,</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he doth not think so; which is a severer sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence than I durst have pronounced upon many of those that were indeed <hi>Rebels,</hi> but did not think <note place="margin">Some were Rebels, who did not think themselves so.</note> themselves to be so; but were misled by their <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual guides,</hi> who made them believe that to fight <hi>against the King</hi> was to fight <hi>for the King;</hi> and that all the while they were doing God and the King good service: which the greater <hi>diminution</hi> it was of their sin that were so deceived, the greater <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi> it was of their guilt that did so deceive them. And yet those, that were the least sinners of these <hi>Rebels,</hi> were according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s account greater sinners than <hi>Drunkards, Whoremongers</hi> and <hi>Murtherers:</hi> so that if he could as truly (as he doth boldly and frequently) charge most of the <hi>Episcopal</hi> Party with <hi>Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanness</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness,</hi> yet seeing he cannot charge them with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> against their Sovereign, they will still be less evil, how bad soever they are, than the best of those of his Party, if They were <hi>Rebels,</hi> as I think They have acknowledged themselves to be, by suing for and taking out their <hi>Pardons</hi> for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
                     <p>Neither can the <hi>Bishops</hi> and the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> be so answerable to God and the World for the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluteness,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Clergy under a just reproof.</note> 
                        <hi>debauchery</hi> and <hi>Profaneness</hi> of those of their Party (were it as general and as great as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it believed to be) as the

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOW that all those, that fought and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned and encouraged others to fight in the <hi>late War,</hi> were guilty of <hi>the Destruction of the</hi>

                        <hi>King's Power,</hi> is so undeniably evident and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that it needs no proof. Unless Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will say, that the <hi>King</hi> never had any <hi>Power</hi> at all; for I am sure they brought him to that pass by that <hi>War,</hi> that he had no power at all at last, witness his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at <hi>Holmby,</hi> where he was so far from having the <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> that he had not the <hi>Liberty</hi> of a <hi>Subject,</hi> neither as to the liberty of his <hi>Person,</hi> or of his <hi>Conscience;</hi> For they would not allow him one of his own <hi>Chaplains</hi> to assist him in the service of God. And to this diminution or rather annihilation of <hi>power</hi> was that good <hi>King</hi> brought by those, who were all of them commissioned by the <hi>Presbyterian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and many thousands of them encouraged by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth) <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Party who destroyed his Power, by Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s own confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion, Rebels.</hi>
                        </note> so that if those that were guilty of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the <hi>King's Power</hi> were <hi>Rebels,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith he will not gainsay but they were) then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and those of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94113:146"/>
were all of them <hi>Rebels.</hi> For it was whilst that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was in power, and it was by that power of theirs, that the <hi>King's Power</hi> was destroyed, and he left ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unable to defend himself against the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Anabaptists,</hi> and other <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> who after his <hi>Power</hi> was destroyed by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed his <hi>Person</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>And therefore supposing, but not granting, that <note place="margin">Nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can they be: absolv'd from the guilt of the King's murther.</note> neither Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> nor any other of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Party had intended any hurt to the <hi>King's Person;</hi> yet that will not absolve them from being guilty of the hurt that was done unto his Person, or of the <hi>King's murther:</hi> no more than those Thieves, who (as <hi>Salmasius</hi> saith) having robbed and disarmed a man, and left him bound hand and foot to be devoured of wild Beasts, because they do not actually hurt or kill him themselves, can be said not to be guilty of his death, if afterward by a Lion or a Bear or a Wolf he be destroyed and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>And thus much for proof that the <hi>late War</hi> was <note place="margin">The late War then was made against the King.</note> made against the <hi>King,</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls it) declared to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and consequently was a <hi>Rebellion</hi> properly so called; as likewise for proof, that those that were engaged or did engage others in that War, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever their intentions were or might be) they were all of them guilty of the destruction of the <hi>King's Power:</hi> and consequently <hi>perfidious Rebels,</hi> and worse than <hi>Whoremongers, Drunkards,</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers</hi> in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own judgment, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Protestation to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>We have done skirmishing with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn-hope, and a forlorn-hope it was indeed, if he
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94113:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did hope he could induce any to believe, not only against their reason, but against their sence also, that which verily I believe he doth not believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; namely, that the <hi>late War</hi> was not made <hi>against</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">And that though the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it was not.</note> 
                        <hi>the King.</hi> I am sure he did not, at least he was not bound to believe it (as he saith he was) because his and the Peoples <hi>Trustees</hi> for their Liberties (that is the <hi>House of Commons)</hi> had declared it was not: unless he will say that the <hi>House of Commons</hi> is such a body of men, as is either <hi>infallible</hi> or <hi>impeccable;</hi> so that whatsoever they or the major part of them declare must needs be so as they declare it to be, and that the People are bound to believe it to be so, because they have no other way to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but by their <hi>Trustees;</hi> and because these are such Trustees, as they are sure will not, cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the trust reposed in them: and yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself saith, (as I noted before) that the <hi>Major part</hi> of both <hi>Houses</hi> may be the worst, and such as the People are bound to take part with the <hi>King</hi> against them. How then can he with any ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or hope to be believed, say that he and the People were bound to believe, that the <hi>late War</hi> was not made <hi>against the King,</hi> because one or both Houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> had declared it was not? And yet this is the only Argument he brings for the proof of it.</p>
                     <p>But truth will out sometimes before a Man is aware, and though he takes never so much care to suppress it. For whereas in the place before quoted, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> (though he confesseth he fought <hi>against the Kings Soldiers)</hi> yet he affirms he fought not <hi>against the King,</hi> thereby implying that he thought it unlawful to fight against the King, though not against those commissioned by him: yet in another

Which saying of his seems to require some animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version upon it, as not being an absolute denyal of the <hi>Kings Sovereignty,</hi> or of the Kings being the <hi>highest Power,</hi> but of his being Sovereign or highest Power, <hi>during those times of division</hi> only; which seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that he was (even in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> opinion) the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> or highest Power <hi>before those times of division.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Unless Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will say (and there seems to <note place="margin">The Act, which the King past, for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sitting,</note> be some such secret intimation in that saying of his I last quoted) that the <hi>King</hi> himself gave away his <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> or that he made his <hi>two Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> partakers with him in it, when he passed an <hi>Act</hi> for their sitting until They themselves should be willing or content to be dissolv'd. I confess this was a very great alteration in the very fundamental constitution of the <hi>Government,</hi> and I confess the <hi>King</hi> passed such an <hi>Act:</hi> the very great streights he
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94113:148"/>
was then in, together with the minatory importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the two <hi>Houses,</hi> backt by the insolent and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous behaviour of the Multitude, necessitating him (as it were) to do that, which never any of his <hi>Predecessors</hi> did before him, (and I hope never any of his <hi>Successors</hi> will do after him.) I mean to pass such an <hi>Act</hi> as that was: Although that <hi>Act</hi> gave neither of the <hi>Houses</hi> singly, nor both of them <note place="margin">Gave them no more Power, than they had before.</note> jointly, any whit or jot of more Power (but only of sitting longer) than what They or their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors had before, or their Successors now have.

Did the <hi>Act,</hi> that gave them a Power to sit until they thought fit to be dissolved, give them Power to do all, or any of these things before specified? and many other, as bold, as bad and as illegal as any of those were? or because they had leave to sit as long as they listed, had they leave to do what they listed also? No, no; it was their ingrateful and ungraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abuse of the Kings too gracious favour to them, that was the cause of all those evils, that afterwards upon that occasion befel <hi>Him</hi> and the whole <hi>Royal Family,</hi> and all his <hi>Loyal Subjects.</hi> And therefore <note place="margin">The worst Act, that blessed King ever did.</note> of all the <hi>Acts</hi> that ever that good <hi>King</hi> did, I take the passing of the aforesaid <hi>Act,</hi> for the sitting of the two <hi>Houses,</hi> not during his, but their own pleasures, to be the worst, not only in point of <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>policy,</hi> as most prejudicial to the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in general; but in point of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi>

                           <hi>A Query resolved, whether a King Elective may not be Deposed, upon non-performance of conditions? Our King proved from Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s own Principles, to be a sole Sovereign.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT may not the <hi>People,</hi> that chuse one to be their <hi>King</hi> upon such or such conditions, upon <note place="margin">The Question.</note> his non-performance of such conditions <hi>Depose</hi> him or take away that Power over them they gave unto him? I answer, that if they chuse him to be their <hi>King indeed,</hi> and not in name and title only, <note place="margin">The Answer.</note> then he did thereby become their <hi>King indeed,</hi> that is, their <hi>Monarch,</hi> or <hi>Sovereign Lord</hi> over all of them; and consequently they did all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">1 Reason. <hi>The People upon their choice part with all the Power they had.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Again I answer that, even in <hi>Elective</hi> Kingdoms, <note place="margin">2 Reason. <hi>A King so cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen hath hic Kingly Power immediately from God, and not from the People, as Mr.</hi> B. <hi>grants.</hi>
                        </note> he that is chosen by the People to be their <hi>King</hi> hath not his Kingly Power from them that chose him, but from God: which is in express terms not only granted but asserted by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and he values himself upon it, as being upon that account a better friend to <hi>Kings</hi> than (as he saith) some <hi>Episcopall</hi> men are; and indeed if he were always and in all he saith consistent with himself he would not be so great an Enemy to <hi>Kings,</hi> as in this and many other of his <hi>Aphorisms</hi> (which I have colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of his Book of a <hi>Holy Commonwealth)</hi> he hath shewed himself to be. For if it be not the <hi>People,</hi> who chuse him to be their <hi>King,</hi> that give him his Kingly Power, but that he hath it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>God,</hi> I wonder by what right or authority they can pretend to take that from him, which not they but God hath given to him. Surely they will not say they may do it whether God will or no; and of Gods Will that they should do so, or may do so, They can have no declaration or significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but either from some plain positive standing Rule in <hi>Scripture</hi> or from special extraordinary and immediate <hi>Revelation,</hi> such as <hi>Abraham</hi> had for the sacrificing his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> or as <hi>Jehu</hi> had for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the House of <hi>Ahab.</hi> But as to this <hi>latter,</hi>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:94113:152"/>
as I hope Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is not yet Fanatick enough to pretend, so I am sure he can find no such declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or signification of Gods Will for the <hi>former,</hi> I mean in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> either of the Old or New <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> as They were always and universally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the first and best <hi>Christians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true indeed that in the Scripture God hath <note place="margin">Nothing in Scripture, for People to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul their Kings.</note> commanded <hi>Kings</hi> or Sovereign Princes to govern according to his and their own Laws too that are conformable unto his, and threatned them if they do not, and punished them when they have not. But where or in what place of the Old or New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament hath God appointed or permitted all or any of the <hi>People</hi> to do so? I mean, to punish their Kings by Deposing them, or by taking any part of the Kingly Power he had given them, away from them? Surely God did not only foresee but foretell, that many of the <hi>Kings</hi> of his own People the <hi>Jews</hi> would be, some of them <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and some of them <hi>Murtherers</hi> and <hi>Adulterers,</hi> and some of them <hi>Tyrants</hi> and great oppressers of their Subjects, as appears by <hi>Samuels</hi> Speech unto them at the Election of <hi>Saul</hi> their first King; but he doth not give them, or any order of Men among them there or any where else any either <hi>commission</hi> or <hi>permission</hi> authoritatively to enquire into their Kings Actions or to call them to an account for them. And therefore the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> were <hi>Kings indeed,</hi> and so are <note place="margin">

                        <hi>must be one and but one:</hi> and by <hi>but one</hi> he must needs mean but one Person, or but one <hi>Caetus</hi> or Company of men; and consequently in which soever of them it is, it must be solely and wholly: so that to be <hi>Sovereign</hi> and not to be <hi>sole Sovereign</hi> seems to be a contradiction <hi>in adjecto.</hi> From whence I argue, that if there must be a <hi>Sovereign</hi> or Supreme Power in every State or Body Politick, and that be the Sovereign or Supreme Power which by the Legal Constitution hath no Superior Power above it, then the <hi>Regal</hi> is the Sovereign or Supreme Power in <hi>England;</hi> because accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Legal Constitution of this Kingdom there is no Power Superior to it or Predominant over it, but all other Powers are derived from it and Subordinate and Subject and Subservient to it.</p>
                     <p>Again, if the Sovereign of one Commonwealth, State or Kingdom must be <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>but One</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then if the King of <hi>England</hi> be a <hi>Sovereign</hi> (as
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94113:153"/>
having no Superior he must needs be) he must be a <hi>sole Sovereign</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>Neither do I see how either of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions can with any colour of reason be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by assigning some Power in some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Persons, which by the Legal and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Constitution of this Kingdom is above the <note place="margin">The King hath no Superior to judg him, nor Peers to try him.</note> 
                        <hi>King,</hi> or at least equal to him. But as it is a Maxim of our Law (as I said before) that <hi>Rex in regno suo non habet superiorem,</hi> the King in his own Kingdom hath none above him; so it is a Maxim too that he hath not <hi>parem</hi> neither, none equal to him: so that according to our Law as there is none to <hi>judg</hi> him because he hath no <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,</hi> so there is no Way of <hi>trying</hi> him, because he hath no <hi>Peers;</hi> those whom We call <hi>Peers</hi> being his Subjects though They are <hi>Pares</hi> or Peers in relation to one another.</p>

                           <hi>The English Monarchy asserted against Mr.</hi> B. <hi>who would have the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>to be a mixt Commonwealth. My Lord Chief Justice</hi> Cook<hi>'s judgment on the point.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THIS one would think were enough to prove the King of <hi>England</hi> not only to be our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> but our <hi>sole Sovereign;</hi> and consequently the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to be properly and indeed (as it hath always been accounted both at home and abroad) a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or a Government in <hi>chief</hi> by one and by one only.</p>
                     <p>No, saith Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> it hath not always been accounted to be so. For <hi>it hath been a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,</hi>

                     <p>Whereunto I answer, that I never heard, nor I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <note place="margin">This Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie never heard of, till the late times.</note> believe ever any body else did hear of any such <hi>Controversie</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> at least as to the <hi>Civil Government.</hi> As to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Government</hi> indeed of the <hi>Church</hi> there hath been a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> be the Governor in chief of it; as likewise betwixt us and the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whether the <hi>King</hi> or a <hi>National Synod</hi> ought to have the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme managery of it.

                        <pb n="272" facs="tcp:94113:154"/>
of the <hi>State,</hi> there was never any question made (for ought I ever heard) by any of the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Dissenting Parties, but that it was <hi>Monarchicall,</hi> and that the King was the <hi>sole Sovereign</hi> of it and in it, before that Rebellious <hi>Parliament</hi> set up for a <note place="margin">The Rebell-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament modest at first.</note> share in the Sovereignty: which they did not at first neither; but did in all their Addresses to him acknowledg him to be their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and that not as they were particular Persons only, but as they were the representative Body of all the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> neither did the House of <hi>Peers</hi> ever make the least doubt of doing so also; nor of taking the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> as to their Sovereign. So that there being then no <hi>controversie</hi> of the <hi>Kings Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> over the whole Nation, whether diffusively or representatively considered; nor consequently whether this Kingdom were a <hi>Monarchy</hi> properly so called or no; this <hi>Controversie,</hi> (I say, there being then no such controversie in being;) could not be one of the causes of the War, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith it was; I am sure it was none of the causes then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p>And yet I am apt enough to think that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers <note place="margin">The secret design of some, from the first, to change the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> and promoters of the <hi>War</hi> that were then leading-men in the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> and some of them in the House of <hi>Lords</hi> also, did from the very beginning design and intend a real change and <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> it self, though They open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended but a <hi>reformation</hi> of abuses that were in it only.

But this They
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94113:154"/>
concealed for a long time from the main Body of their Party, for fear it might alienate most or many of them, that had any thing of Loyalty or Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from them. Or if they did communicate this <hi>arcanum,</hi> this secret of their grand design to any, it was only to those whom they were sure of, as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring such a change of the Government as themselves did, and whose help they were to make use of for the bringing of it about; I mean the popular <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> and other <hi>Schismatical Preachers;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <note place="margin">

                     <argument>
                        <p>Calvin <hi>answered, who though he allows not private Persons to resist, yet requires it of some Magistrates, whom he supposes the Guardians of the Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. No such Magistrates, as he supposeth, nor doth he say there are, and if there were, they would be extremely inconvenient to the publick. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion taxed by</hi> Grotius, <hi>who yet himself, supposing the Sovereignty shared betwixt the King and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in some case allows resistance.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND yet this so dangerous and so dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a subjection of Kings to their own Subjects doth Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> the <hi>Patriarch of the Presbyterians,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Calvin <hi>the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of the Presbyterians.</hi>
                        </note> approve of; I call him the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,</hi> because he was the first that after 1500 years Government of the Church by <hi>Bishops,</hi> invented and set up a Government of the Church by a Parity of <hi>Presbyters</hi> without <hi>Bishops;</hi> and this and this only can properly and truly be called <hi>Calvinism;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>What properly</hi> Calvinism.</note> whatsoever he holds besides, even the most rigid of his <hi>Tenets,</hi> having been held by some of the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>But this <hi>Calvin</hi> I say (though otherwise a very Learned and (as our judicious <hi>Hooker</hi> saith of him) <hi>incomparably the wisest man that ever the French Church</hi>

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94113:156"/>
not by the generality of the People; yet, <hi>Si qui nunc sunt</hi> (saith he) <hi>populares Magistratus ad mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randam Regum libidinem constituti (quales olim erant qui Lacedomoniis Regibus oppositi erant Ephori; &amp; quâ etiam fortè potestate (ut nunc res habent) funguntur in singulis Regnis tres Ordines, quum primarios con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus peragunt) adeò illos serocienti</hi> Regum <hi>licentiae pro officio intercedere non veto, ut si Regibus impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grassantibus, &amp; humili Plebeculae insultantibus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveant, corum dissimulationem nefariâ perfidiâ non carere affirmem; quia Populi libertatem, cujus se Tutores Dei ordinatione positos nôrunt, fraudulenter produnt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have put down this passage of <hi>Calvins</hi> in his own words, which for the <hi>English</hi> Readers sake may be thus translated. <q>If there be now (saith he) any such <hi>popular Magistrates</hi> constituted (I presume he meant legally constituted or appointed by Law) for the moderating or restraining the lust or unbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led appetites of Kings) such as were of old time the <hi>Ephori</hi> to the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Kings; and which Power also (as things now are) <hi>perhaps</hi> the three Orders or <hi>Estates</hi> have in several Kingdoms when they meet in <hi>Parliament)</hi> I am so far from forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them (saith he) to interpose their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for restraining the raging licentiousness of Kings; that if they do but connive at them, when they impotently domineer and insult upon the poor Commonalty, I do affirm that connivence of theirs is a nefarious persidiousness, because they do fraudulently betray the <hi>Peoples Liberty,</hi> whereof they know they are made the <hi>Guardians</hi> by Gods appointment.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which passage of Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> (wherewith he concludes his Book of <hi>Institutions)</hi> I observe that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94113:156" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he speaks not with that confidence and clearness as he useth to speak with, in declaring his judgment upon other occasions, nor as he doth in the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi> preceding this, in which he doth positively and resolutely condemn the <hi>resistance of Kings</hi> by their <hi>Subjects</hi> in any case or upon any provocation whatsoever; and for this he brings undeniable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and proofs out of Scripture, and answers clearly and solidly all objections to the contrary. But when he comes (with his <hi>deprivatis hominibus loquor,</hi> that is, I speak of private men) to tell us that by <hi>Subjects</hi> that are not to resist their Kings he means <hi>private Men</hi> only; what he gave with one hand he takes away with the other, by not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and allowing, but by obliging and injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some that are <hi>Magistrates</hi> to restrain their Kings from oppressing or <hi>insulting</hi> (as he calls it) over their People, and to bind their Kings as it were to the good behaviour; which how it can be done, if Kings have no mind to be so bound, but by force, he doth not tell us; and how it can be done by force without the assistance of <hi>private men,</hi> he doth not tell us neither; nor consequently without making private Subjects to resist their King, which as he told us before was utterly unlawful in any Case whatsoever. So that he seems, as to this point, to speak very doubtfully and warily. For first he doth not say there are <hi>now</hi> any such <hi>Magistrates,</hi> that are to be Umpires, as it were, betwixt Kings and their <note place="margin">His wariness in expressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> Subjects, with Power to curb and restrain Kings from governing of their People otherwise than they ought to do; such as (saith he) were the <hi>Ephori</hi> in relation to the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings: but he saith <hi>si qui nuno sunt</hi> (if there be any such Magistrates
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:94113:157"/>
now, as the <hi>Ephori</hi> were then) and as <hi>fortè</hi> (saith he) <hi>perhaps</hi> he doth not say <hi>certé,</hi> for certain, or <hi>absque dubio</hi> without doubt, the Conventions of the <hi>three Estates</hi> are in those Kingdoms wherein are such Conventions, (meaning I presume the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> and others, if there be any other of the like Constitution) so that if such a Convention or Assembly of the <hi>three Estates</hi> have no such Power as the <hi>Ephori</hi> had (as <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not positively affirm they have, but that <hi>fortè</hi> or <hi>perhaps</hi> they may have, and consequently that <hi>forté</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps</hi> they may not have neither) then hath <hi>Calvin</hi> this to say for himself, that if such <hi>Conventions</hi> or <note place="margin">The three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states have no such Power, as he supposeth.</note> 
                        <hi>Assemblies</hi> have no such Power (as most certainly they have not, nor ever had where Kings were <hi>Kings indeed</hi> and not in name only, as the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings were) he hath this (I say) to say for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that what he positively affirms afterwards, that such <hi>Magistrates</hi> or such <hi>Assemblies</hi> may and ought to do for the restraining and curbing of Kings, was only upon supposition that they were legally invested with the same Power over their respective Kings, as the <hi>Ephori</hi> were legally invested with over the Kings of <hi>Lacedaemon:</hi> which if it be not true (as he that saith but <hi>perhaps</hi> it is, doth thereby grant that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps</hi> it is not neither) then is not he chargeable with that which follows; namely, with this Opinion or Doctrine, that such <hi>popular Magistrates</hi> (as he calls them) or such representative <hi>Assemblies</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might and ought to do what the <hi>Ephori</hi> did. And thus these two little Adverbs <hi>Fortè</hi> and <hi>Ferè, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps</hi> and <hi>Almost</hi> do (as the <hi>Proverb</hi> saith) <hi>save</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Perhaps, a salvo for a Lye.</note> 
                        <hi>many a Lye,</hi> and are of great use to insinuate that unto others as true, which we are not sure of our
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94113:157"/>
selves; as also for the bringing men off from being answerable for what they so warily and doubtfully affirm, if they be questioned for it and undeniably convinced of the falshood of it.</p>
                     <p>And truly that <hi>Calvin</hi> himself did doubt, whether <note place="margin">Calvin <hi>himself doubts, whether there be any such Magistrates, as he speaketh of.</hi>
                        </note> there were any such <hi>Magistrates</hi> in any of those Kingdoms he seems to speak of, that had such Power and Authority in relation to their Kings as the <hi>Ephori</hi> had in relation to the Kings of <hi>Lacedaemon;</hi> I make no doubt at all: and that not only in regard of his <hi>Fortè, perhaps,</hi> which I have already spoke of; but also because he gives us not so much as one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </argument>
                     <p>AND first as to the first of these Particulars (I mean the <hi>Supposition</hi> it self) namely the <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Sovereignty</hi> or <hi>Supreme Power;</hi> the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>No such Case possible, as</hi> Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <hi>supposeth.</hi>
                        </note> very possibility whereof, that there should be such a thing in any Body Politick whatsoever, seems to be a contradiction <hi>in terminis</hi> in down-right terms, to what <hi>Grotius</hi> himself affirms to be an inseparable property of Sovereignty; namely, that it is <hi>quid per se indivisum,</hi> a thing of it self undivided, and by <hi>quid</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Sovereignty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible.</note> 
                        <hi>per se indivisum</hi> a thing of it self undivided, he must needs mean <hi>id quod suâ naturâ est indivisible,</hi> that which in its own nature is indivisible, or something that cannot be divided; because otherwise to say that Sovereignty or Supreme Power <hi>est quid per se indivisum,</hi> is a thing of it self undivided, should not distinguish it from any other subordinate Power which may be <hi>actu</hi> or <hi>per accidens indivisum,</hi> actually or by accident undivided, though <hi>potentiâ</hi> and <hi>per se</hi> potentially or of it self it may be divisible into never so many parts or particles.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94113:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
indivisibile,</hi> that which in its own nature is indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I cannot see with what congruity of reason it can be said to be divided, as <hi>Grotius</hi> in the very same period saith it may be, <hi>sivè per partes potentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les sive subjectivas,</hi> either by its potential or its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective parts. For as for that division of the <hi>Roman</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The division of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, no division of Sovereignty.</note> 
                        <hi>Empire per partes subjectivas,</hi> by its subjective parts; when the <hi>Eastern</hi> part of it was governed by one and the <hi>Western</hi> by another, and the <hi>Northern</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by a third, as it was by the three Sons of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> there was indeed a division of the <hi>Empire</hi> and a fatal one it was, but there was no divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sovereignty;</hi> for every one of the three was a Sovereign in his own part or portion of the Empire, just so as during the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Our</hi> English <hi>Heptarchy such.</hi>
                        </note> here in <hi>England,</hi> the Island was divided into <hi>seven</hi> several Governments, but every one of the seven was a <hi>Monarchy</hi> and had a <hi>Sovereign</hi> of its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent upon any of the other, so that there was then no more a division of Sovereignty than there was afterwards when <hi>Edgar</hi> became Monarch of the whole Island, or than there is now by the addition of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to it.</p>
                     <p>I know the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> did sometimes <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Partners in the Empire, upon what account.</note> 
                        <hi>sibi socios in imperio,</hi> take to themselves part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or companions in the Empire; but then the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> was either wholly and jointly in both of them, as it was in the two <hi>Consuls</hi> after the expulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kings, or as it is in the whole <hi>Venetian</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate at this day: or else he whom the Emperor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd as his companion in the Empire was thereby designed only to be his <hi>Successor,</hi> as the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> is now in <hi>Germany,</hi> but continued a Subject and subordinate to him that assumed or adopted him,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94113:161"/>
as long as he lived. So that in this case there was no <hi>division of the Sovereignty</hi> it self no more than in the former.</p>
                     <p>And much less can there be said to be a division of <note place="margin">The Case, when a King is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> the Sovereignty <hi>per partes potentiales</hi> by its potential parts (as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith they are called) when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is <hi>sui juris Regem eligens, quosdam actus (scilicet potentiae) sibi servet, alios autem Regi defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> that is, when a free People in chusing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a King reserve some Acts of Power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as well as they give others to their King; <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que tamen id fit quotiescunque Rex promissis quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damque obligatur,</hi> but I would not have this (saith he) to be understood to be the case when Kings are obliged or oblige themselves by certain promises on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; (mark that Mr. <hi>Baxter,) sed tunc id fieri intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendum est, si quid Populus adhuc liber futuro Regi imperet per modum manentis Praecepti, aut si quid sit additum Regem cogi aut puniri posse.</hi> 
                        <q>But this (saith he) that is, this division of Sovereignty, <hi>per partes potentiales</hi> by its potential parts or acts of Power, is to be understood when the People being as yet free enjoyn their King that shall be (and that by a standing Law or Precept which they will have always to be continued in force) to do or not to do this or that; or if any thing be added to imply that the King may be or is to be compelled or punished if he do otherwise.</q> Then or in this Case <hi>Grotius</hi> seems to think there is a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> it self betwixt the King (so conditionally elected) and the People so magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally electing him.

                     <p>And what is this but to be such a King as those of <note place="margin">A King thus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, a King in title only.</note> 
                        <hi>Sparta</hi> were? who as <hi>Grotius</hi> himself tells us were not <hi>Kings indeed,</hi> but in name and <hi>title</hi> only; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause indeed (as he tells us also) they were subject to the People or to the Judicatory of the <hi>Ephori</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the People by whom, <hi>si peccarent Reges illi in leges ac Rempublicam non tantum vi repelli pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, sed si opus sit puniri morte, quod Pausaniae Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoniorum Regi contigit;</hi> and therefore (saith he) those Kings (and consequently, say I, <q>all such Kings as those) if they offended against the Laws or against the Commonwealth they might not only be resisted by force, but if need were punished by death, as <hi>Pausanias</hi> one of their Kings was.</q> And this he affirms to be the case of <hi>omnium Principum qui sub Populo sunt,</hi> of all Princes who are <hi>under the People;</hi> and if they be <hi>under the People,</hi> they cannot

be <hi>over the People</hi> too, but the People must needs be over and above or superior unto them.

the War they made against him; as likewise for their taking away the Hereditary Lands which he held of them and under them, (it being indeed as much and all that can be said to that purpose) yet by <hi>Grotius</hi> his favour it is not enough to justifie what he saith in that before quoted place in his Book <hi>de jure Belli &amp; Pacis</hi> (which was the occasion of this digression) namely, that either there may be such a <hi>division of the Sovereignty</hi> betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as he there asserts; or that the <hi>States</hi> that are under the <hi>King</hi> may not only defend their part of the Power they derive from the King, against the King, but that the <hi>King</hi> may forfeit his part of the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> to Them by his invading of Theirs.</p>

                        <q>There is nothing more manifest (saith he) than that those Kings were just such Kings as those of the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> that is, Kings in name only; but really and indeed no more than the chief of the <hi>Optimates</hi> or the Nobility;</q> as he that was called <hi>Princeps Senatûs</hi> was in <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst it was an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocracy,</hi> or as the <hi>Duke of Venice</hi> or the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> now is.</p>

                     <p>But to return to what I was speaking of; I do not find (I say) that any <hi>Parliament</hi> properly so called, that is the <hi>King Lords and Commons,</hi> or that <hi>both</hi> or <hi>either</hi> of the <hi>two Houses</hi> joyntly or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally did ever <hi>declare</hi> or vote the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> to be no <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or that the <hi>King of England</hi> was not the Sovereign and <hi>sole Sovereign</hi> of and in this and all other his Kingdoms and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary I find that in all the <hi>Addresses</hi>

                     <p>From which <hi>Declaration</hi> published by that pious <note place="margin">Three things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from that Declaration of Hers.</note> and prudent Prince it is observable, <hi>First,</hi> That the aforesaid <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> was intended by Her, as well for the asserting of <hi>her own Supremacy</hi> over all Orders of men in her own Kingdom in all their capacities, as it was for the disclaiming and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing any <hi>foreign Jurisdiction,</hi> that was or could be pretended or claimed over all or any of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in any capacity whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> From this <hi>Declaration</hi> of Hers it is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be observed, that she will have <hi>her own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi> and Supremacy <hi>in omnes Ordines Regni,</hi> over all Orders and Estates of men here at home, to be asserted and sworn to before they shall swear to disclaim and renounce all <hi>foreign Authority</hi> and <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> And with very good reason; because it would have done her, and will do her Successors very little or rather no good at all, for their Subjects to renounce all Sovereignty from <hi>abroad,</hi> as long as they are taught or suffered to be taught that there
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94113:172"/>
are any other Sovereign or any other invested with any part of the Sovereignty here at <hi>home,</hi> but their Kings only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> From the aforesaid <hi>Declaration</hi> we may observe also that the <hi>Queen</hi> by the Injunction of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> professeth to claim nothing to be acknowledged or sworn to, but what <hi>de jure</hi> and <hi>jam olim,</hi> what anciently and of right did belong to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and consequently that the <hi>Supremacy</hi> or Sovereignty over all Estates or Orders of men in <hi>England</hi> was from all Antiquity, that is (as I conceive) from the beginning of <hi>Monarchy</hi> or ever since there were Kings in <hi>England,</hi> and that not <hi>ex dono Populi,</hi> by gift of the People or compact with the People, but <hi>jure</hi> by right; and by what Right? not <hi>jure Electionis</hi> but <hi>Hereditatis,</hi> not by right of Election but of Succession, and <hi>jure Coronae,</hi> by right of the Crown, as being inseparably annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Crown, or rather inherent in the Crown; there being none (as I have already proved) that can properly be called a <hi>King</hi> or Crowned Head (whether by <hi>Succession</hi> or <hi>Election)</hi> but he must be the supreme and <hi>sole Sovereign,</hi> over all in his own Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Which as to our Kings here in <hi>England,</hi> as it was <note place="margin">The Supremacy, the chief Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the Crown.</note> acknowledged by those <hi>Parliaments</hi> that enacted the <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> before the War; so is it by the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> since the War, or since the Kings return, and consequently since the Crowns restauration to those Prerogatives, that are of right belonging to it; of which the <hi>Supremacy</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi> over all in the Kingdom inclusively (as well as in relation to all without the Kingdom exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively) is the chiefest. For if there be any either

                        <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without</hi> the Kingdom either <hi>superior</hi> over him or <hi>equal</hi> to him, or <hi>partaker</hi> in any part of the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> with him, he cannot be said to be the <hi>only supreme Governour</hi> of this Realm, and of all other his Dominions and Countries, as by the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> those of the Kings Subjects that are to teach all the rest of their fellow Subjects are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not only to say but swear he is: nor is it so much as to be imagined that the <hi>King Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> would have obliged any to take such an <hi>Oath,</hi> if they themselves had not believed the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of it to be true.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Oath of Supremacy further explained. The Kings being declared the sole supreme Governor, cuts off all pretence at home as well as foreign claim.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I say <hi>the whole subject matter of it,</hi> for there be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <note place="margin">Two parts in the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy; the one Assertory, the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missory.</note> 
                        <hi>two</hi> several distinct <hi>parts</hi> of that <hi>Oath,</hi> both of which every one of them that takes it is equally obliged to swear unto; of which the <hi>first</hi> is <hi>Asserto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and the <hi>second Promissory.</hi> In the former he that swears asserts the <hi>Kings Sovereignty</hi> affirmatively, affirming him to have the <hi>sole supreme power over all</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">In the Assertory part two Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, one Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the other Negative.</note> 
                        <hi>Persons, in all Causes, within his Realms and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and then negatively by denying any <hi>foreign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> or any without his Dominions to have any <hi>Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> over any of his Subjects or to have any thing to do within his Dominions. And it is in regard of the <hi>latter</hi> of these <hi>two clauses</hi> only, that this <hi>Oath</hi> can
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:94113:173"/>
be said to be enacted and imposed for the discovery and conviction of <hi>Papists,</hi> and that not of all Papists <note place="margin">The later Clause discovers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> neither, but such Papists only as believe the <hi>Pope</hi> to have the supreme Power over all <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals</hi> at least, if not in <hi>Temporals,</hi> whose <hi>Subjects</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be in Temporals. But as to the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The former Clause asserts the Monarchy.</note> of these two Clauses in the <hi>Assertory</hi> part of this <hi>Oath</hi> which affirms the <hi>King</hi> to be <hi>sole Sovereign,</hi> or that he is the <hi>Only supreme Governour</hi> in this Realm, it seems principally, if not wholly to be intended to assert the Government of this Kingdom to be <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical</hi> and to make it be acknowledged to be so.</p>
                     <p>For by swearing that the King is <hi>the only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What intended by swearing the King to be the only supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</note> 
                        <hi>Governour of this Realm,</hi> &amp;c. they do virtually and by necessary consequence swear also that all other Governours within the Realm, as they do <hi>severally</hi> and <hi>joyntly</hi> derive their Power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning from him, so they are joyntly as well as severally <hi>subordinate</hi> unto him, and therefore none of them either severally or joyntly <hi>co-ordinate</hi> with him. Because, if <hi>any</hi> of them or <hi>all</hi> of them in any capacity were so, or believed by the Parliament to be so, the Parliament by enjoyning men to swear the King is <hi>the only supreme Governour of this Realm,</hi> must needs be chargeable with enjoyning Perjury, or which is worse, with compelling others to swear that to be truth which they themselves do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be so; which cannot be avoided but by concluding that the Injunction of the <hi>Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> by Parliament is a Declaration of Parliament, that this Kingdom is a <hi>Monarchy</hi> properly so called, because the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> or <hi>supreme Power</hi> is in <hi>one Person</hi> only, namely in the <hi>King;</hi> and if in him <hi>only</hi> then in him <hi>wholly</hi> also.</p>

                        <pb n="312" facs="tcp:94113:174"/>
And that this was the Parliaments meaning in <note place="margin">The distinction, which the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those two Clauses.</note> prescribing and enjoyning that <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> may farther and (if it be possible) more undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and demonstratively be made to appear, it is very observable that in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> prefixed before the Administration of that <hi>Oath,</hi> (which <hi>Rubrick</hi> is a part of the <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> as well as the <hi>Oath</hi> it self) it is said the Bishop shall cause <hi>The Oath of the Kings Supremacy, And against the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority of all Foreign Potentates,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>The form and manner of making of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>to be administred,</hi> &amp;c. It is observable (I say) that in the aforesaid <hi>Rubrick</hi> there is a clear and a very notable distinction made betwixt the two first Clauses of the <hi>Assertory</hi> part of the <hi>Oath,</hi> namely, betwixt the Clause affirming the King to be <hi>the only supreme Governor of this Realm,</hi> and the Clause deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any <hi>foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, or Potentate,</hi> to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority or Authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm. The distinction (I say) by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> made betwixt the <hi>two</hi> Clauses is very notable; for it is the <hi>first</hi> of them only that is called by the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick <hi>the Oath of the Kings Supremacy;</hi> whereas the <note place="margin">The first Clause is called the Oath.</note> 
                        <hi>latter</hi> is said to be <hi>against the Power and Authority of all Foreign Potentates,</hi> and therefore is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be called an <hi>Abjuration</hi> than an <hi>Oath.</hi> And <note place="margin">The second is rather an Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> yet it is this <hi>Abjuration</hi> only that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will have to be meant by the <hi>Oath of Supremacy;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this abjuration is not the Oath of Supremacy it self, but a Deduction only from the Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy. For because the King is the <hi>only</hi> supreme Governour of this Realm, therefore neither <hi>Pope,</hi> nor any other <hi>foreign Prince, Prelate or Potentate</hi> can claim or pretend to any <hi>Supremacy</hi> or part of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94113:174"/>
Supremacy here in this Kingdom. So that he that can truly swear the one may safely <hi>per modum se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelae,</hi> by way of consequence, swear the other also.</p>
                     <p>But though the truth of the <hi>former</hi> doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily infer the truth of the <hi>latter,</hi> yet the truth of <note place="margin">The former Clause infers the later; the later not the former.</note> the <hi>latter</hi> doth not necessarily infer the truth of the <hi>former.</hi> For though it be never so true, and never so undoubtedly acknowledged to be so, that no <hi>Foreigner</hi> or none without the Realm of what quality or denomination soever, doth or can justly pretend to the supreme or any part of the <hi>supreme Power</hi> either <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> here in <hi>England;</hi> yet supposing the <hi>supreme Power</hi> to be <hi>divided</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> supposeth it may be in some Kingdoms, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith it is here in this Kingdom) it will not follow I confess that the King <hi>is,</hi> or that the Parliament that made this <hi>Act</hi> and enjoyned this <hi>Oath</hi> to be taken, did thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the King <hi>to be,</hi> the only supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Realm. But the Parliament by injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Oath</hi> to be taken, and those that take it not only <hi>abjurare</hi> to abjure or for swear all foreign juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but <hi>jurare</hi> to swear positively and plainly, <hi>That the King is the only supreme Governour of this Realm over all Persons</hi> in all Cases and Capacities, do evidently declare that They themselves believe and acknowledg the King to be so, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatsoever <hi>division</hi> there may be of the <hi>supreme Power</hi> in other Kingdoms yet in this there is none.</p>
                     <p>For the first, the most immediate and most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deduction from this Proposition, (viz.) <hi>The King is the only supreme Governour of this Realm,</hi> is the excluding all others <hi>in this Realm</hi> from having any thing to do with the supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:94113:175"/>
of it. And therefore the swearing to this Proposition alone is called by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> the taking of the <hi>Oath</hi> of the Kings <hi>Supremacy;</hi> the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing abjuration of all <hi>foreign Authorities,</hi> being but a deduction and that not a primary but a secondary deduction from it.</p>
                     <p>And therefore 'tis a vain and senceless shift of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s for the avoiding of the dint of this <note place="margin">The Kings being the only supreme Governor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy from any other, as well at home as abroad.</note> Argument, which doth <hi>jugulum causae ferire,</hi> cut the very throat of his cause, to say as he doth, <hi>that the end of imposing and taking of this Oath was only for the excluding of all pretence to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy or to any part of the Supremacy here from abroad,</hi> and <hi>not for the acknowledging the Kings sole Supremacy here at home.</hi> Whereas it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Kings <hi>sole Supremacy</hi> here <hi>at home</hi> that is (as it is called by the Rubrick) <hi>the Oath of the Kings Supremacy,</hi> and not the excluding of all <hi>foreign</hi> claim or pretence to it; which to speak properly (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith he loves to do) is as I said before an <hi>abjuration</hi> rather than an <hi>Oath,</hi> or at most but the <hi>negative</hi> and <hi>consequent</hi> part of the Oath; the <hi>affirmative</hi> and <hi>antecedent</hi> part thereof being the assertion of the whole <hi>supreme Power</hi> in the Government of this Kingdom to be in the King and King <hi>only,</hi> and consequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive of any pretence to it, or to any participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by any either <hi>at home</hi> or <hi>abroad,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by any <hi>at home.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press abjuration of the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being in any at home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the King, as of its being in any abroad.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But why then, will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> perhaps say, was there not annexed to the <hi>positive</hi> part of this <hi>Oath</hi> an <hi>abjuration</hi> or express disowning the <hi>supreme Power</hi> or any part of the supreme Power to be in any <hi>here at home,</hi> besides the King, as
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94113:175"/>
well as there is an abjuration or an express dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning of it to be in any <hi>abroad?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer because there was no need at all of it, <note place="margin">The 1 Reason.</note> 
                        <hi>First,</hi> because he that hath sworn the <hi>Supremacy</hi> or supreme Power to be in the <hi>King only,</hi> hath <hi>eo ipso</hi> in that very thing, or by so swearing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworn the being of it, or any part of it, in any other besides the <hi>King.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it be replyed, that upon this account there needed not have been any <hi>abjuration</hi> or disowning of any <hi>foreign Authority</hi> annexed to the other part of it neither.</p>
                     <p>I answer, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That although really there <note place="margin">The 2 Reason.</note> was no need of an <hi>express</hi> or <hi>explicit</hi> disowning or renouncing of the <hi>one</hi> more than the <hi>other,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the swearing to the positive part of the <hi>Oath</hi> is <hi>implicitly</hi> and <hi>virtually</hi> a disowning or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of them both; yet because there had been antiently, and was then, and was like to be still, a claim to the <hi>Supremacy</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> (at <note place="margin">There is a claim to the Supremacy from abroad, no such pretence at home.</note> least in matters <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical)</hi> by some that were <hi>abroad,</hi> I mean by the <hi>Pope</hi> for himself and his Successors; therefore the Parliament thought it meet and prudent and in some respects neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, to add or annex to the <hi>Assertion</hi> of the <hi>Kings sole Supremacy</hi> here <hi>at home</hi> an express and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit <hi>Renuntiation</hi> of all the Right that was or could be pretended to it <hi>from abroad,</hi> but did not think it to be at all necessary to add or annex the like express or explicit renuntiation of any such Power to be in any here <hi>at home:</hi> because there was none then here at home so impudent as openly and avowedly to pretend to it, or to any part of it. For here are no <hi>Ephori,</hi> no Overseers or Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94113:176"/>
of the State, as there were in <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> nor no such <hi>Senate</hi> as there is in <hi>Venice,</hi> nor no such <hi>High and Mighty States</hi> as there are in <hi>Holland.</hi> For we have but <hi>One</hi> high and mighty, and he is so high and mighty that there is none but the <hi>Almighty</hi> that is above him, and all others in his own Dominions, how much higher and mightier they may seem to be in relation to one another, are equally below him and subject to him.</p>

An excellent project or expedient, as the deviser <note place="margin">The project of Co-ordination utterly inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with our Government.</note> of it thought, to make a <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or a <hi>Republick</hi> of a <hi>Kingdom:</hi> but he did not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it was liable to one little inconvenience, namely that it was utterly and absolutely <hi>unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,</hi> being altogether inconsistent with the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Constitution of our Government; which is not to have the <hi>two Houses of Parliament</hi> always in being as the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> was, and the Senate of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> is, or to assemble and meet when and where they will and to continue as long together as they will, as <hi>(Grotius</hi> tells us) the <hi>Ordines</hi> or States of <hi>Holland</hi> of right did, even whilst They had a King.

                        <note place="margin">The two Houses Petitioning the King a proof, that there is no Co-ordination.</note> in the year 42 did <hi>Petition</hi> the King, that he would be pleased to grant such things as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto him; but hence it will not follow that he was bound to do so, nay thence it will follow that neither he nor any of his Predecessors were bound to do so: for then they that were the boldest in their demands that ever met and sate in Parliament, would have claimed it as of right and not Petition'd for it as they did; at least, if they had vouchsafed to have Petition'd for it, they would have called their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition a <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> which they did not. So that by very <hi>Petitioning</hi> the King to grant those things, which they proposed as agreed on by <hi>both Houses,</hi> they acknowledged that the King was not bound by any Law, Custom, or Precedent from his Predecessors to consent to what <hi>both Houses</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on, and consequently that there was no such <hi>Co-ordination</hi> betwixt the <hi>King, Lords and Commons,</hi> by the fundamental Constitution of this Kingdom, as by the aforesaid A<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>An Ordinance of both Houses, no Law; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no legal Authority for the late War against the King. The Militia or the Power of the Sword, acknowledged by the two Houses themselves to be in the King. A Sermon of Arch-Bishop</hi> Ushers <hi>in the Isle of</hi> Wight <hi>Preached to the same Purpose.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOT a <hi>Law</hi> perhaps (may Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> say) properly so called, but an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>both Houses</hi> may, and that without the Kings consent to it, nay notwithstanding the Kings declaring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing against it, oblige all the People of <hi>England</hi> to do or not to do what the <hi>two Houses</hi> will have them, as much as any <hi>Law</hi> consented to by the King ever did or can do; nay, and may <hi>repeal</hi> any Law made by the King, by the advice and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of both Houses, any Law or Custom to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in any wise notwithstanding.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>per quam Regulam,</hi> by what Rule, Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> By what <hi>Law</hi> of God or man can this be done? Why, by an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>both Houses,</hi> which is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent at least to an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> properly so <note place="margin">
                           <hi>An Ordinance of both Houses, with Mr.</hi> B. <hi>equivalent to an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                        </note> called; and so it had need to be, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and more too, to warrant the doing of such things; such horrible mischiefs and Villanies as have been done against <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Sacriledg,</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> and by <hi>Subjects</hi> against their fellow Subjects by <hi>plundering,</hi> and <hi>imprisoning,</hi> and <hi>murdering</hi> one another, of which side soever they were; for all
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:94113:178"/>
will be put to the account of them that had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, I mean no legal and just <hi>Authority,</hi> to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to do what they did. And therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> you were best be very sure that the <hi>two Houses</hi> had <hi>Authority</hi> to make such a <hi>War</hi> as they did, not only without Commission from the King, but against the King, and to engage you and by you to <note place="margin">No legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the late War against the King.</note> engage so many thousands as you say they did in it. You were best I say be very sure of it; for it is not your <hi>head</hi> or your <hi>neck</hi> only which you say you are willing to hazard upon that account, but your <hi>soul</hi> it self, and the Everlasting Woe or Welfare of it, that lies at stake for it. Be not deceiv'd, God is not to be mocked: It is not the <hi>Confederacy</hi> of the <hi>two Houses,</hi> it is not the <hi>Covenanting</hi> of the <hi>two Nations,</hi> that can justifie either their commanding, or their being obeyed in any thing which God hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or not allowed them to command or to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by some <hi>known Law</hi> of his own or of the Land; neither of which I am sure can be produced by them.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it is not the <hi>redressing of Grievances</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Nor can any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence justifie it.</note> (had they been as many or more and as great or greater than the <hi>House of Commons</hi> in their virulent and malicious <hi>Remonstrance</hi> to the People represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to be) nor the <hi>Reformation of Religion</hi> (though there had been much more need of it than there was) no nor the truly <hi>intending</hi> (as well as <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending)</hi> never so good, or never so necessary an <hi>End</hi> for the <hi>publick Good</hi> either spiritual or temporal of the whole Nation, that can justifie the <hi>Means</hi> they made use of, if they had not <hi>Authority</hi> to make use of them: I mean in their taking of the Sword out of the Kings hands, where the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:94113:179"/>
the <hi>Land</hi> had placed it, and taking it into their own notwithstanding Gods and mans Law to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>For the proof of the <hi>first</hi> part of which Assertion <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>himself appealed to.</hi>
                        </note> of mine I appeal to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself; for amongst his many false, and impious, and pernicious <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms,</hi> he hath this true one, <hi>that it is not lawful for a Nation to fight for the preservation of their Religion,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Holy Com. w. p. 441.</note> 
                        <hi>or their worldly goods and liberties, without just autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and licence:</hi> Whereunto he adds by way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and illustration of his meaning, <q>That it is but a delusory course of some in these times that write many Volumes to prove, that Subjects may not bear Arms against their Princes for <hi>Religion;</hi> as if those that were against them did think that <hi>Religion</hi> only as the end, yea, or <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Liberty</hi> would justifie <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or that the <hi>Efficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing Cause</hi> were not necessary as well as the <hi>Final.</hi> Where bearing Arms against Princes is warrantable <hi>quoad fundamentum,</hi> as to the ground of it, this will warrant it <hi>quoad finem,</hi> as to the end of it.</q> A good End must have a good Ground. Again, for proof of the <hi>latter</hi> part of my Assertion; namely, that the <hi>Sword</hi> or the Power of making War was by Law in the Kings hand, and not in theirs, I appeal to the Acknowledgment of the <hi>two Houses</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The two Houses themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the power of the Sword to be in the King.</note> themselves, who after they had setled the <hi>Militia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the War was actually begun, yet knowing and being conscious to themselves that they had done it illegally and by usurpation of the <hi>Kings Authority</hi> without any Commission or leave from him for the doing of it, they make it one of the 19 <hi>Propositions</hi> they sent to the King when he was at <hi>York</hi> in the year 42. <hi>That his Majesty would be pleased to rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that course that the Lords and the House of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:94113:179"/>
Commons have appointed for the ordering of the</hi> Militia <hi>until the same shall be farther setled by a Bill:</hi> by which Proposition they do plainly confess, <hi>First,</hi> That they had taken the Sword, by having ordered <note place="margin">Some Remarks upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</note> the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they had no Commission or leave from the King for it, by saying it was done by their own appointment. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they knew they had intrenched upon his Authority by so doing. Why else should they desire his <hi>Majesty would be pleased to rest satisfied with what they had done in that particular at least</hi> pro tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore <hi>at the present, until the same</hi> (that is the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Militia)</hi> should be <hi>farther setled by Bill.</hi> Whereby, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They confess that the Power of setling it, and consequently of making any use of it, was not in them as yet by Law, until by a <hi>Bill</hi> consented to by the King it were made a Law; and consequently that the <hi>Ordinances of both Houses</hi> as they call'd them, did not nor could not make any thing they ordered to be done, legal or obligatory to the whole Nation. And hence or from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness <note place="margin">The invalidity of their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances made out.</note> of the insufficiency of their own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to justifie either before God or the World the lawfulness of doing what they had done and meant to do, it was that they so earnestly and so often press'd the King to pass their <hi>Ordinances</hi> into <hi>Acts.</hi> For though they did what they could to make the poor deluded People believe that their <hi>Ordinances</hi> were as legal, as valid, and as obligatory as <hi>Acts,</hi> for the draining of their Purses and exposing of their Persons; yet by their being so desirous as they were, (even after their victory and when the King was their Prisoner) to legitimate their spurious <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> by turning them into <hi>Acts,</hi> it is evident
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:94113:180"/>
they did not themselves believe what they and their Preachers made the People to believe concerning the validity of any of those <hi>Ordinances,</hi> especially that for <hi>taking up of Arms;</hi> as if the Power of the Sword and ordering of the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom to fight for whom and against whom they pleased, and upon what account they pleased, had been in them: which by what I have said it doth not only appear it was not, but that they knew it was not, but was and always had been in the <hi>Crown</hi> as the King tells them <note place="margin">The King asserts the Militia.</note> in his answer to the aforesaid <hi>Proposition</hi> of the two Houses, telling them <hi>that he will no more part with</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And that this is true in <hi>Divinity</hi> as well as by the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>A remarkable passage in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Arch-Bishop</hi> Usher <hi>at the Treaty in the Isle of</hi> Wight.</note> 
                        <hi>Law of the Land</hi> in relation to our King, I will cite the Authority of a <hi>Casuist,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seems to have a great reverence for and esteem of, though he were a Bishop and more than a Bishop; I mean Arch-Bishop <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sher,</hi> whose Reduction of Episcopacy Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> seems to approve; though the Arch-Bishop
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:94113:180"/>
himself (as I have been informed) would not own it to be his. This Great and Good man (I say) preaching before the last King at the Treaty in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> did in that Sermon of his positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in plain terms more than once or twice affirm the <hi>King,</hi> our King, <q>to be the <hi>fountain of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er under God within his own Dominions,</hi> and that therefore no Power could lawfully be assumed or made use of by any upon any pretence whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but as it was derived by Commission from the King.</q> These were his very words, whereunto he added, <q>
                           <hi>This is true Doctrine,</hi> were the King a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,</hi> or a <hi>Pagan,</hi> and much more when he is (as our King is) a <hi>Christian King,</hi> an <hi>Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King;</hi> and that not in profession only, but in practice also.</q> And then having somewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged himself in speaking of the Kings personal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Graces both <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>spiritual.</hi> 
                        <q>Now (said he) some that hear me may think I flatter him; indeed I do not, but I confess that what I have said of him, I have said to comfort him; for never any man of his quality had more need of it, both in regard of the unworthy usage he hath had, and the unworthy condition he is now in; which I hope, said he, will last no longer. For this (as he then added) is the <hi>49th</hi> year of his Age, and at the end of the <hi>49th year</hi> began the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> among the <hi>Jews;</hi> and then every bondman was made free, and every Prisoner was set at liberty; and every one that had been kept out of possession was restored to it. And if (said he) We be not worse than <hi>Jews,</hi> it will be so with us now also.</q>

heard that Great man discoursing of, with no less courage and resolution than with truth. And I have repeated it so often upon several occasions both at home and abroad for his honour, that I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve these for the most part were the very <hi>same words,</hi> or very near the very same <hi>numerical words,</hi> as well as the <hi>identical sence</hi> of that passage of his <hi>Sermon,</hi> which I have repeated.</p>

And to him I appeal for the verifying of what I have said as to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. But if any man shall, notwithstanding Sir <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>

                        <hi>Warwick</hi>'s attestation, think it to be incredible, that the two Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> being then in their <hi>Zenith,</hi> should indure any such thing to be said so much to their reproach and condemnation of their cause and of all their proceedings without any ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion upon him that said it; I answer, it was partly because they were then in their <hi>Zenith,</hi> so high
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:94113:181"/>
advanced and so highly elevated with the success God had (for our sins and for their obduration) permitted them to have, that they despised what any man did or could say against them; and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not have taken notice of it without inflicting some punishment or other upon him for it: which they could not have done (he being a man of such eminency not only in regard of his <hi>quality,</hi> but much more in regard of his <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and in regard of the very great <hi>reputation</hi> he had thereby acquired both at home and abroad) without exposing themselves to the envy and hatred of the whole World, and without doing themselves any good by it; and therefore all things considered, they thought it best to take no notice at all of it, as for ought I ever heard they did not.</p>
                     <p>Howsoever what I affirm that pious and learned <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> said (whether he said it or no) is true; namely, that the Power of the <hi>Sword</hi> or the Power of making <hi>War,</hi> though for their own defence only, or for never so good an end, was not in the <hi>two</hi>

                        <hi>Houses,</hi> but in the <hi>King,</hi> and in the King only, as they did themselves acknowledg; because at that very time, and at that very Treaty, one of the prime <hi>Articles</hi> which they mainly insisted on, was to have the Sword for so many years to be put into their hands by the Kings passing of an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> to that purpose, and for their raising of mony, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time for the support and exercise of that Power in what proportion they thought or should think fit, upon their Fellow-Subjects; all which they had done before by virtue of their <hi>Ordinances</hi> only: which either they did or did not think to be a <hi>legal and sufficient Authority</hi> for their taking of the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:94113:182"/>
                        <hi>Sword,</hi> and using it as they did; If they did think so, why might not the same authority have been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the continuance of it? and if so, what need was there of an <hi>Act</hi> for the trusting them with it but for a time only? But if they did not think their own <hi>Ordinances</hi> to be a legal and sufficient Authority for their taking of the Sword, and taxing of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the exercising all those other Acts of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power which they did for so many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by vertue of their own <hi>Ordinances</hi> only; why then <hi>habemus confitentes reos,</hi> We have their own confession, not only that they took the <hi>Sword,</hi> which neither the <hi>Law</hi> nor the <hi>King</hi> had put into their hands, and therefore were <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surpers</hi> of the <hi>Regal Authority:</hi> but had made use of it against the King, or, which is all one, against those that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned by the King, and therefore were <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and <hi>Rebels;</hi> as likewise that their own <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> were not legally sufficient to justifie their so doing, and consequently that they have not such a <hi>Legislative Power</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith they have, and which he is so confident of, as that he offers <hi>his head</hi> to the Block, if the reasons he gives for the proof of it be disproved; which I am now in the last place to try whether I can do or not.</p>

                     <p>As to the <hi>King</hi>'s own Acknowledgment, that there is such a division of the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> betwixt <note place="margin">Of his first Proof.</note>

And as to the <hi>Parliaments</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it (which he only saith they do and have done without naming any time when, or what <hi>Parliaments</hi> they were that did so) I have answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at large already, and that not only <hi>negatively</hi> by denying that any <hi>Parliament</hi> properly so called, that is, consisting of <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> did ever affirm or can in reason be supposed ever to have affirmed any such thing; but <hi>positively</hi> also, that all <hi>Parliaments</hi> even those that are improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called, I mean the Body without the Head, or as the two <hi>Houses</hi> only are called the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> even in this notion I say the <hi>Parliament</hi> hath <note place="margin">The Parliament hath always acknowledg'd the King their Soveraign.</note> always in all Addresses that have been made to the <hi>King</hi> by either of the Houses severally, or by both Houses joyntly, acknowledged the King to be their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and themselves to be his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and loyal <hi>Subjects;</hi> and that when they Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress themselves to Him not as so many several single Persons, or every one in his <hi>Personal</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, but as in their representative or <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> capacity, as they were one or both of the two <hi>Houses;</hi> and how they be <hi>Soveraigns</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> or partly <hi>Soveraigns</hi> and partly <hi>Subjects</hi> in one and the same notion, or under one and the same ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, is too subtil and airy a speculation for me to comprehend. But that which I did then and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:94113:185"/>
do now principally insist upon for proof of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> acknowledgments of the <hi>King's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty,</hi> or that the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> here in this Kingdom is in the <hi>King alone,</hi> and not in the <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> joyntly, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it, is the <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Oath of Supremacy proves it.</note> whereby in as positive and as plain words as can be devised, several <hi>Parliaments</hi> (properly so called) have declared and caused it to be sworn that the King is the <hi>only Supreme Governor</hi> of this Realm and of all other his Highnesses Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Countries, as well in all <hi>Spiritual</hi> and Ecclesiastical things and causes as <hi>Temporal.</hi> Which I repeat again, because (which I did not observe before) the <hi>Parliament</hi> by enjoyning Men to swear that the <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>only Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in Spirituals as well as Temporals,</hi> seems to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose or to take it for granted, that there were none that pretended to be the <hi>Kings Subjects,</hi> but would willingly and readily acknowledg the King to be the <hi>only</hi> Supreme Governour <hi>in Temporals,</hi> and consequently that there is no division of the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi> For it is the Soveraignty <hi>in Temporals</hi> only that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have to be so divided; for as to the Soveraignty in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> things or causes, I believe if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would tell us what lies at the bottom of his heart, we should find that he thinks neither <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Parliament</hi> have any thing to do with it; and consequently that there can be no division of that betwixt them. But of this we shall have occasion to speak more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

Which reasons of his are all of them reducible to this one of the <hi>Legislative power,</hi> or the power of making and repealing <hi>Laws</hi> for the whole Nation, which (as he saith) is not only a part but a principal part of the <hi>Soveraignty;</hi> and therefore if this be not in the <hi>King alone,</hi> but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith it is, the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> cannot be in the <hi>King alone,</hi> but must be divided betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi>

                        <hi>First,</hi> whether the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> namely that the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> is divided betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament,</hi> be true or no.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>2dly,</hi> supposing, not granting it to be so; whether he doth rightly infer from thence, that therefore the <hi>War</hi> made by the <hi>Parliament</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> was a just War and no <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First</hi> then as to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> it self, so far as <note place="margin">The Legislative power solely in the King.</note> it supposeth the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> to be a part and principal part of the <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> I grant it to be true; but as it supposeth the Legislative power to be partly in the <hi>King</hi> and partly in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> so as that the <hi>Laws</hi> are made by the <hi>Parliament</hi> as well as by the <hi>King,</hi> I affirm it to be false.</p>

                           <hi>By</hi> Parliament <hi>is meant, not King, Lords &amp; Commons;</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Parliament</hi> in this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> it cannot be the <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> because the <hi>Legislative power</hi> which is supposed to be divided betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> cannot be supposed to be divided betwixt the King and the King, as it must be if it be divided betwixt the King and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as the <hi>Parliament</hi> signifies the <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> and therefore by the word <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> here must needs be meant the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">but Lords and Commons, that is, the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> only, or the <hi>two Houses,</hi> as they make up that Body whereof the <hi>King</hi> is the Head. And in this sence the word <hi>Parliament</hi> is always taken, when the King and Parliament are spoken of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as distinct from one another; as when the <hi>King</hi> is said to call, or prorogue, or dissolve the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the <hi>Parliament</hi> to make Addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or to grant Subsidies to the King. And in this sence I think Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would be thought to understand the word <hi>Parliament,</hi> when he saith the <hi>Legislative power</hi> is divided betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> that is, betwixt the King and the two Houses of Parliament. Though there be many passages in this Book of his <hi>Holy Common-Wealth,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament often understands the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
                        </note> where speaking of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> he must needs mean the <hi>House of Commons</hi> exclusively to the <hi>House of Lords;</hi> as when he tells us the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> is to be believed by the People, because they are the Peoples Representatives and Trustees, where by <hi>Parliament</hi> must needs be meant the House of <hi>Commons</hi> only, they and not the House of <hi>Lords</hi> being the Representatives and the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees of the Commons. And so again when he
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:94113:187"/>
saith the King is obliged to pass such Laws <hi>quas Vulgus elegerit,</hi> which the People or Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shall make choice of; he must needs mean that the King must needs pass such Laws as the <hi>House of Commons</hi> will have him to pass; so that the whole Legislative power is to be in the House of <note place="margin">and in effect lodges the whole Legislative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in them.</note> 
                        <hi>Commons</hi> alone exclusively to the <hi>Lords</hi> as well as to the <hi>King,</hi> and to the <hi>King</hi> as well as to the <hi>Lords;</hi> the <hi>King</hi> being only to declare that to be Law, which the House of <hi>Commons</hi> without the concurrence of the <hi>Lords</hi> had voted to be so; and this we saw and felt it come to at last; and that it may not come to it again (for it seems to be furiously driving that way) it concerns the <hi>Lords</hi> as well as the <hi>King</hi> to consider.</p>
                     <p>But I will not in this debate take advantage of this notion of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> I mean as it is often taken by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for the <hi>House of Commons</hi> only; but I will consider it, as it is taken for both Houses, and that not only severally but as in conjunction with one another.</p>
                     <p>And as thus considered, the next Inquiry is, how they come to be so, or whence they have <note place="margin">How the two Houses come to be a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> their Parliamentary existence and continuance, I mean their being and continuing to be <hi>two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament;</hi> and consequently whence they have the power of doing what they do, or legally can do, whilst they are <hi>two Houses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Lords Temporal</hi> say they are of the <hi>Lords House</hi> by their Birth-rights, because they are <hi>Lords;</hi> and the <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi> say they are of the House of Lords, because they are Representatives of the Clergy, or because they are Bishops: I

answer it is true indeed they are so, or have a right to be so, when there is a <hi>House of Lords,</hi> because they are constituting parts or members of it; but neither of them can be actually and existingly of the House of Lords, before there is a House of Lords, and there is not, nor cannot be actually a House of Lords, or any existence of such an House, until the King summons both the <note place="margin">The Lords sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by the King.</note> 
                        <hi>Lords Temporal</hi> and the <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi> to come and meet together at such a time, in such a place; and when upon such a summons, or by virtue of the King's command, they do come and meet together at such a time, in such a place appointed, and then and not till then they are a <hi>House of Lords.</hi> The like may be said as to the <hi>House of Commons.</hi> For if the <hi>Knights</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses</hi> shall say when they are met, that they are the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> because they are chosen <note place="margin">The Commons chosen by the People, with the King's leave.</note> by the <hi>People</hi> to be their Representatives; 'tis true they are so; but who gave the <hi>People</hi> leave or power to choose them to be their Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, or to be that Body which we call the <hi>House of Commons?</hi> Was it not the <hi>King?</hi> could the <hi>People</hi> have done it without the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority inabling them to do it, or could they refuse to do it when he commanded them to do it? If not; then though the choice of those that are to be of the <hi>House of Commons</hi> be from the <hi>People,</hi> yet the Peoples power to choose them being from the <hi>King,</hi> it is that which makes them after they are chosen to be the House of Commons when they meet together; which must be when and where the King pleaseth:
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:94113:188"/>
So that after they be chosen by the People to be the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> or to be the representative body of the People; yet are they not the House of Commons, nor the representative body of the People, till they meet at the time and in the place by the King appointed, at least so many of them as are agreed on to be sufficient to make them act as a <hi>House,</hi> or in their representative capacity. The like in proportion may be said of the <hi>House of Lords</hi> also. So that <hi>both Houses of Parliament</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The King gives the Parliament its being and continuance, as he pleaseth.</note> (as such) have no <hi>existence</hi> or being at all until the King gives it them by calling them together, nor <hi>continuance</hi> in being any longer than he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to continue them. For as when he saith unto them, <hi>Come,</hi> they must come; so when he saith unto them, <hi>Go,</hi> they must go, according to the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and established Constitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Which being so, I wonder how the <hi>two Houses</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The two Houses therefore, not co-ordinate, nor sharers in the Soveraignty, with the King.</note> can be said to be <hi>co-ordinate</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> or how the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> can be said to be divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>two Houses,</hi> when neither of them are Houses till he makes them to be so, nor continue to be Houses any longer than he will have them to do so. Indeed if the <hi>two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament</hi> were Bodies that were always in being as the <hi>Senate of Rome</hi> was, and as the Senates of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> now are; or such as might assemble and meet together, when and as often as they pleased, and continue together as long as they pleased, as the <hi>States of Holland</hi> may and do now; and as <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us they might <note place="margin">Vid.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:94113:188"/>
he means as were called Kings, but were no more Kings indeed than those of <hi>Sparta</hi> were, as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> himself tells us in the same place; if I say our two <hi>Houses of Parliament</hi> were such a <hi>Senate</hi> as were always in being, or might be so when they pleased, and continue so as long as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, there might perhaps be some pretence for their having some part in the <hi>Soveraignty.</hi> But when they have no being at all till the King gives it them by calling them together, and are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to what they were before, that is, to no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, whensoever he pleaseth to dismiss them; I cannot imagine in what sence the <hi>two Houses</hi> of Parliament can be said, either to be <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> with the King, or to have any share in the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> or Kingly power. I am sure that according to the established constitution of our Government, as they have not yet, so it is and always will be in the Kings power to prevent their Usurpation of any such power, (as long I mean as he keeps the power of calling and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missing, that is, of making and unmaking them in his own hands) and confequently of acting any thing in their Parliamentary capacity to the prejudice of the <hi>Crown</hi> or of the <hi>People:</hi> I say to the prejudice of the <hi>Crown,</hi> or of the <hi>People;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">What hurts the Crown, hurts the People.</note> what is really prejudicial to the <hi>Crown,</hi> is really prejudicial to the <hi>People</hi> also; howsoever or by whomsoever the People may be and are often made to believe otherwise, and are not to be convinced of their error but by their feeling only.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT although it be the King's <hi>Summons</hi> of them or calling of them together that makes them to be the two <hi>Houses,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that inables them to act as the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or in their Parliamentary capacity; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they cease to be two Houses, or to have any power to act in a Parliamentary capacity, when the King pleaseth to dismiss them: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may say, that as long as they are two Houses, or as long as the King permits them to sit together in their Parliamentary capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, they have a <hi>Legislative power</hi> or right of <note place="margin">The Legislative power a branch of Soveraignty.</note> making <hi>Laws</hi> together with the King for the whole Kingdom, and consequently are partakers of the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> with the King also, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Laws</hi> for the whole Nation being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly one of the Essentials of the <hi>Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or supreme power. We are therefore in the <note place="margin">How far the two Houses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that.</note> 
                        <hi>3d.</hi> place to inquire, what the <hi>two Houses</hi> do or legally can do as to the making of our <hi>Laws,</hi> and whether that be enough to entitle them to be
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:94113:189"/>
properly called <hi>Legislators,</hi> or if I may so speak <hi>Collegislators</hi> with the King.</p>
                     <p>All that ever I heard that either of the <hi>two Houses</hi> severally, or both of them joyntly could legally do in order to <hi>Law-making,</hi> is but the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and proposing or offering unto the King such <hi>Bills</hi> or materials as they think fit to be made <hi>Laws</hi> by the King, if he think them fit to <note place="margin">They only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Bills.</note> be made Laws also. Here is the two Houses <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultra,</hi> hitherto they may go but no further: And sure it is not the proposing of any thing to be made a <hi>Law,</hi> that is the making of a Law, or that can prove the Proposers to be the <hi>Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> especially if he to whom they propose it may choose whether he will make it a <hi>Law</hi> or no; as there was never any doubt made but he might before the rebellious Parliament in the late Kings time broached the contrary, together with many other <hi>Anti-monarchical Paradoxes,</hi> to justifie their own Anti-monarchical and rebellious Practices, against the known Laws, Customs and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kingdom; of which this was one of the most essential, that as the <hi>Houses</hi> had a liberty to pass and propose <hi>Bills</hi> to the King; so the <hi>King</hi> might as he saw cause or thought fit, make or not make them to be or not to be <hi>Laws,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Royal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent makes them Laws.</note> by giving or not giving his <hi>Royal assent</hi> unto them. For it is the Kings <hi>Fiat</hi> or the stamp of Royal Authority upon them that makes those <hi>Bills</hi> to become <hi>Laws,</hi> obliging all the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the obedience of them, or for non-obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Penalties appointed by them; So that the <hi>Bills</hi> are but the <hi>materia ex quâ,</hi> the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:94113:190"/>
matter out of which <hi>Laws</hi> may be made; but the <hi>forma per quam,</hi> the <hi>formalis ratio,</hi> or intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal and specifical form, by which what were before <hi>Bills,</hi> become <hi>Laws,</hi> is the obliging power <note place="margin">by giving them an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging power.</note> which the King by his <hi>Fiat</hi> breaths into them, as God doth the Soul into the Body, to make it a living and a rational Creature. And therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who (being so Metaphysical a man as he is) as he must needs know that it is <hi>forma</hi> or <hi>causa formalis,</hi> the form or formal cause, <hi>per quam res est quod est,</hi> which makes every thing to be what it is; must needs know too, and (if he have any ingenuity) confess likewise that from whence and whence only the <hi>Laws</hi> have their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging power (which is <hi>formalis ratio Legis,</hi> that which makes Law to be Law) from thence and thence only those Laws must have their being also; and consequently if it be the King's <hi>Fiat</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The King alone our Lawmaker.</note> only that gives those <hi>Bills,</hi> that are by the two Houses presented to him, an obliging power over the whole Nation, thereby making them of Bills to become <hi>Laws,</hi> the King and none but the King must needs be the sole efficient or maker of those Laws. For as <hi>Forma est causa per quam res est quod est,</hi> so <hi>Efficiens est causa à quâ res est quod est,</hi> As the <hi>Form</hi> is the cause <hi>by which</hi> the thing is what it is; so the <hi>Efficient</hi> is the cause <hi>from which</hi> the thing is what it is; by introducing that <hi>form,</hi> which makes it to be what it is. If therefore the <hi>Law</hi> hath its obliging power (which is its <hi>form,</hi> or that which makes it to be Law) from the <hi>King</hi> and the King only, the <hi>King</hi> and the King only must needs be the <hi>efficient</hi> and <hi>sole ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:94113:190"/>
cause of Law,</hi> and consequently the whole <hi>Legislative power</hi> must needs be in him only: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> can prove that the <hi>two Houses</hi> of Parliament can of themselves, and by their own Authority only, make their <hi>Bills</hi> to be <hi>Laws,</hi> or at least that they joyn with the King in making them to be so. For if it be the Kings own arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary consent only which makes that to be a <hi>Law</hi> which was no Law before he consented to it, then must it needs be confessed that the <hi>King</hi> is the <hi>sole efficient</hi> of all <hi>Law,</hi> and consequently the only <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver</hi> in his own Kingdom, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the very learned, judicious and truly pious, and conscientious Casuist Doctor <hi>Sanderson</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who in his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>This I say was the judgment of that very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">His Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for an excellent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suist.</note> pious and very judicious Casuist Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> concerning the only proper adequate subject of the <hi>Legislative power</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> who was Professor of <hi>Casuistical Divinity</hi> in the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> as long as the <hi>Rebellious Parliament</hi> would suffer him to be so; and who would in all probability (if he might have been suffered to have continued some few years longer) have left us a truer and more exact and compleat body of <hi>Casuistical Divinity</hi> than any the World hath been so happy as to see yet, and in which the World hath more need to be truly and thoroughly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, in order to peace here and happiness here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, than in any other part either of <hi>Polemical</hi> or <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Divinity, the Essentials of the <hi>Creed</hi> excepted only.

                     <p>But when I say this, I would not be understood to mean what I say, of all that sate in both or ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">All that slaid and sate in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, not censured.</note> of the two Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that made War against the King; for I do verily <hi>believe</hi>

there were <hi>many</hi> (and I <hi>know</hi> there were <hi>some)</hi> both of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> that after the King was driven away, stayed and sate in both Houses, and did what they could to hinder the rebellious and outragious proceedings of the factious Party, which was predominant in the one House as well as in the other. But the Tyde was too strong, and those good Men too few to stemm the current, or to prevent the overflowing of it, as it did, over all the banks and boundaries of Obedience to the <hi>Laws,</hi> as well as of Allegiance to the <hi>King;</hi> And therefore, as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> when he tells us the two Houses of Parliament were the <hi>best Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in all the World,</hi> he tells us too, that by the <hi>two Houses</hi> he means the <hi>Majority</hi> of the two Houses; so when I say they were <hi>

                        <note place="margin">The Answer according to that Opinion.</note> cannot make any <hi>Laws</hi> without the Kings consent, yet the <hi>King</hi> may make Laws without their consent in some cases; namely, when the publick safety is concerned that such a <hi>Law</hi> or such Laws should be made, though one or both of the <hi>Houses</hi> will not consent to it. In such a Case I say (not according to mine own but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s opinion) such a <hi>Law</hi> or such Laws may be made by the <hi>King</hi> without, nay, against the consent of both Houses; and <hi>à paritate rationis,</hi> for the same cause and by the like reason, <hi>Mony</hi> may be raised; if without raising of Mony, a <hi>Naval</hi> Force (for example) as may be sufficient for the preservation of the Kingdom from immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers by a foreign Invasion cannot be had; and then (according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Hypothesis)</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ship-Money justified, upon Mr.</hi> B.<hi>'s grounds.</hi>
                        </note> what can be said against raising of <hi>Ship-money</hi> by the late King? he being the Judge of the greatness and imminency of the danger, and that it could not stay for a <hi>Parliamentary Supply,</hi> there being no Parliament then sitting, and the greatest <hi>Extraparliamentary</hi> Judicatory of the Nation ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been advis'd with by the King, and given him their opinions that he might legally do what he did; certainly these things considered, if Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Aphorism</hi> be true, the King's raising or indeavouring to raise <hi>Ship-Mony</hi> without consent of Parliament, was not so hainous a violation of the <hi>legal constitution,</hi> which he was obliged or
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:94113:197"/>
had obliged himself to govern by (especially after it was by his consent condemned in Parliament) as to be made (as it is by Mr. <hi>Baxter)</hi> one of the principal causes of his siding with the <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the <hi>King.</hi> For if the King were <hi>maximè dignus istâ contumeliâ, indignus ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui faceret tamen;</hi> if he did never so much deserve this affront, yet it did not become Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to give it him: not only because by the highest Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature then in being it was declared to be legal; but because according to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declared in this <hi>Aphorism,</hi> the King might have done it supposing it necessary for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the publick, though it had not been legal.</p>
                     <p>But this shall not be my <hi>Answer</hi> to the aforesaid <hi>Objection.</hi> I remember what I have said before <note place="margin">The Bishop's own answer.</note> upon another Occasion, (viz.) that <hi>A mischief is better than an Inconvenience;</hi> which I think is a maxime of our Law, and the meaning of it is (as I conceive) that it is better to run the hazard of a very great Evil, which possibly may, but is very unlikely will, befall us, than for the avoiding or preventing of it to make use of such a Remedy, as frequently may be and probably will be made use of, when there is no such Occasion for it or need of it. And so that which was used as a <hi>Remedy</hi> for the present, may prove a <hi>Malady</hi> for the future, in the Consequence of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for <hi>answer</hi> to the aforesaid <hi>objection,</hi> I will not say that the <hi>King</hi> can make <hi>Laws</hi> to oblige the whole Nation without the consent of both Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> though never so much for
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:94113:198"/>
the publick good, or never so necessary for the preservation of the whole Kingdom: but this I will say, that though such <hi>Laws</hi> cannot be made <hi>without their consent;</hi> yet it is not they, nor <note place="margin">Though Laws are not made without the Peoples consent in Parliament, yet that consent doth not make them Laws.</note> their consenting to them that makes them to be Laws. For then either the <hi>Bills</hi> would be <hi>Laws</hi> assoon as they were passed by both Houses, or the being passed by the <hi>two Houses</hi> must oblige the <hi>King</hi> to pass them also; but neither of these is true, according to the legal and fundamental constitution of our Government; as appears not only by the constant <hi>Practice</hi> to the contrary, but by the frequent and importunate <hi>Addresses</hi> made unto the late King by the two Houses of the rebellious Parliament, to make their <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ordinances of themselves not Laws.</note> to be <hi>Laws</hi> by his consent to them; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly being so high as they were then, they would never have done, if they had thought that either their Ordinances were Laws, or had the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory power of Laws before the King gave it to them; or that he might not if he would, refuse to give it. So that it being not only the <hi>Kings consent,</hi> but his free, arbitrary and voluntary <note place="margin">The King's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent gives being to the Laws.</note> consent that gives being to all <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power</hi> (properly so called) must needs be in the <hi>King</hi> and in the King only. The Legislative Power I say <hi>properly so called,</hi> I mean the very making of that to be Law which is Law, abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting from whatsoever it is that goes before, or that follows after it is made; for certainly neither of them can be essential to the making of it, and yet both of them may be very requisite for the making of the Laws to be such as may the more
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:94113:198"/>
willingly be obeyed by the People. Now by what goes before the making of <hi>Laws</hi> here with <note place="margin">How the two Houses concur to the making of Laws.</note> us, I mean the considering, debating and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>both Houses</hi> what shall be proposed to the King by them, to be by him made to be Laws; and by what follows after the King by his <hi>Le Roy le veult</hi> hath made them Laws, I mean the solemn Preface or Preamble to them, whereby it is declared that there was a concurrence of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> to the making or enacting of them: because the subject matter of them was prepared and agreed on by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and then and not till then proposed to the King by them to be made Laws by him; So that the <hi>subject matter</hi> of our Laws is and always must be from the <hi>two Houses,</hi> or at least from their <note place="margin">The matter of the Laws from the Parliament, the Form from the King.</note> agreement and consenting to it. And in this respect it is, that they may be said to <hi>concur</hi> to the making of our <hi>Laws,</hi> though they do not make them. For it is (as I said before) not the Matter, <hi>ex quâ res est,</hi> out of which a thing is made, which is prepared and proposed by the <hi>Houses,</hi> but the Form, <hi>per quam res est,</hi> by which a thing is what it is, which is wholly from the <hi>King,</hi> that makes what the Houses propose to him to be made a Law, to be a Law; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he may do or refuse to do as he pleaseth, yet because he can make nothing to be Law, but what by the Agreement of both Houses is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to him to be made a Law by him; and consequently though our Laws are not nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made by them, yet they are not nor cannot be made without them neither; therefore I say
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:94113:199"/>
they do <hi>concur</hi> to the making of them, though they do not make them. They <hi>concur</hi> to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, because the Legislative matter, or the <hi>matter,</hi> whereof Laws are made and must be made, is from them; but they do not <hi>make</hi> them, because the <hi>form,</hi> whereby they are made to be what they are, is not at all from them, but solely and wholly from the King; and consequently he is the sole efficient or maker of them.</p>
                     <p>And yet because he cannot make them but of <note place="margin">Why the Laws said to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by King, Lords &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> such materials as are by the two Houses prepared and proposed unto him, therefore they are said in the common and modern stile to be <hi>enacted</hi> not by the King only, but by the <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> that is, by the King and the two Houses also, to the end that the People who are to be governed by them may (as I said before) the more willingly submit to them, when they know that although they are called the <hi>Kings Laws,</hi> as being made by him; yet the materials whereof they were made were first devised, debated, digested and agreed on, and then suggested to the <hi>King,</hi> not only by the <hi>Lords,</hi> but by the House of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> also, that is, by their own Representatives and Trustees, and consequently in effect by their own selves; when they know this, I say, they must needs be the more willing to submit to them.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The Preface of our Laws doth not prove the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power to be in the Parliament. The Old stile of enacting Laws why changed by</hi> Henry <hi>the VIII. and why since resumed.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AND this, and no more than this, is the meaning of the <hi>modern</hi> form of prefacing <note place="margin">The Modern stile of enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws.</note> our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> which we call <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> when they are said <hi>to be enacted by the King, Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, and by the Authority of the same;</hi> which I call the <hi>modern stile,</hi> because antiently it was otherwise.

                     <p>For from the first of our Parliaments (record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Poulton)</hi> which was in the 9th. of <hi>Hen. III.</hi> to the 15th. of <hi>Hen.

                        <pb n="356" facs="tcp:94113:200"/>
was never used; but during all that long Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of <hi>Eleven Kings</hi> Raigns, and the very many several <hi>Parliaments</hi> held by them, the making, ordaining and passing of <hi>Laws,</hi> was in the <hi>Kings</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Antient stile or form.</note> name only, sometime with this addition, <hi>by</hi> or <hi>with the Advice and consent of his Bishops, Earls, Barons, &amp;c.</hi> without naming the <hi>Commons:</hi> and sometimes <hi>by the advice of His Bishops, Earls, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>at the request of the Commonalty,</hi> or <hi>at the special request of the Commons;</hi> and sometimes <hi>with consent of the Commons as well as of the Lords.</hi> But still and always the making or enacting of the Laws is said to be <hi>by the King alone;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in these words, <hi>We of Our meer free will have given and granted,</hi> which is the stile of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the great Charter it self; sometimes in these, <hi>The King willeth and commandeth;</hi> and sometimes in these, <hi>It is by the King made, provided and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This I say was the stile all along, which was used in passing of <hi>Laws</hi> or <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> until the 15th. of <hi>Hen. VIII.</hi> for about 300. years. And then indeed it began to be changed from, <hi>Be it</hi>

                        <hi>Enacted by the King, with the advice and consent of the Lords and Commons,</hi> to <hi>Be it enacted by the King, Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons;</hi> but not constantly.

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:94113:200"/>
it is said that <hi>at the humble Petition and suit of the Lords and Commons in that Parliament assembled, the King did declare, ordain and enact by the Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In the same old stile likewise runs the first Act of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Be it ordained and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the Queen our Soveraign Lady; with the consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and of the Commons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The like we find in the Raign of <hi>Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> as may be seen in the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> made by Her, and prefixed in our Common-Prayer-Book to another <hi>Act</hi> of the same kind made by our present King. For in that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the stile is, <hi>Be it enacted by the Queens Highness, with the consent of the Lords and Commons in this Parliament assembled,</hi> &amp;c. And in that of our present King it is, <hi>Be it enacted by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, by the advice and with the consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and of the Commons in this Parliament assembled,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>So that the first of the two Proofs Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alledgeth for the <hi>Legislative power</hi> in the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B.<hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Legislative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from the Preface of our Laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conclusive.</hi>
                        </note> as well as in the <hi>King,</hi> and consequently their participating with him in the <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> is not so convincingly conclusive from the stile used in the <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> as he would have it thought to be; but that it <hi>may without immodesty be contradicted,</hi> though he tells <note place="margin">Holy Com. p. 462.</note> us it cannot; because, saith he, <hi>the Laws expresly speak their Authority, when they say: Be it enacted
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:94113:201"/>
by the King, Lords and Commons in Parliament and by the Authority of the same. It is not</hi> (saith he) <hi>upon their Petition or Proposal only, but by them or by their Authority.</hi> But did the <hi>Laws</hi> anciently speak thus at all? or do all of them speak thus <note place="margin">All the Ancient and several Modern Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against him.</note> in all our modern and later <hi>Acts?</hi> I think I have given him Instances of both sorts to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and such and so many Instances as must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Question, if it be to be decided by the speaking of the <hi>Laws,</hi> either in regard of their <hi>Antiquity</hi> or <hi>Plurality.</hi> For (as I said before) all Laws made before <hi>Hen. VIII.</hi> speak and speak expresly the <hi>King,</hi> and none but the King, to be the maker of them; as may appear by the Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before given, and of many more that might have been given, even as many more as there were <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> during the Reigns of so many Kings for 300. years; during which time I cannot find so much as one single instance of any Law which is said to be <hi>enacted by King, Lords and Commons,</hi> but <hi>by the King, with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Lords and Commons,</hi> when most is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to them, I mean to the <hi>Commons;</hi> for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is <hi>upon the request,</hi> and <hi>sometimes upon the humble Petition of the Commons,</hi> and <hi>with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and consent of the Lords,</hi> that the Law is said to be enacted by the King. So that if (as I said before) the question of who are the <hi>Law-makers</hi> be to be decided by the speaking of the <hi>Laws</hi> themselves (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> calls it) as either they are more venerable for <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or considerable for <hi>Plurality,</hi> the King and none but the King must be acknowledged to be the Enacter or the maker of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="359" facs="tcp:94113:201"/>
And truly one would think that those <hi>Laws</hi> that are most <hi>ancient,</hi> and consequently nearest in time to the first Institution of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> though they were not the most in number, were most to be credited for speaking most properly of who they were that made them <hi>then,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who it is that makes them <hi>now.</hi> Unless Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will say it was the King, and <hi>King alone</hi> indeed that made the Laws, in Parliament <hi>then;</hi> but it is the <hi>King, Lords and Commons,</hi> or the <hi>King and Parliament</hi> that makes them <hi>now;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the King is not so much a King now as He was then, and that the constitution of the Kingdom it self is changed from <hi>Monarchical</hi> to <hi>Aristocratical.</hi> But then I must ask him by whom and when this great change was made? Was it by him that brought in this new stile of, <hi>Be it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the King, Lords and Commons,</hi> &amp;c. That was <hi>Hen.</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> who was not a Man likely to <note place="margin">Why Henry the VIII. chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Old stile.</note> give away any of his Authority, or to part with any part of his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> to his own <hi>Subjects,</hi> who rescued it from the <hi>Popes</hi> incroachments: And yet perhaps even He meaning to make use of the <hi>Parliament</hi> for the countenancing whatever he had a mind to do, though never so extravagant in it self, though never so offensive to Foreign Princes his Allies, or never so injurious to his own Children, because he thought it would be serviceable to his own ends, (after he had forced the two Houses to consent to what he listed to enact) to joyn them with himself in the enacting of it, as well as by assenting to it, to make it so much the more plausible, or at least so much the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:94113:202"/>
less grievous unto the People. Otherwise it is most certain that never any King of <hi>England</hi> after the making of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> reigned so despoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and arbitrarily as he did; or whom the two <note place="margin">His meaning in it could not be, to part with any of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.</note> Houses of Parliament stood so much in awe of, as they did of Him: as appears by his making them consent to the doing and undoing, to the enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repealing of whatsoever he would have to be done or undone, to be enacted or repealed. And therefore it is not to be imagined that such a King as he was did mean by changing of the stile, to lessen the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> it self, which was in his Predecessors, by admitting those, whom he used as he did, the two <hi>Houses of Parliament,</hi> to a participation of any the least degree of <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as he never meant to do so, so they, <note place="margin">Nor was it so understood, by either King or Parliament.</note> the two <hi>Houses of Parliament,</hi> did not then, or ever since, (for ought I ever heard) understand that to be the meaning of the Alteration from <hi>Be it enacted by the King with the consent of the Lords and Commons,</hi> to <hi>Be it enacted by the King, Lords and Commons,</hi> to signifie that either the <hi>Kings</hi> power, as to the making of <hi>Laws,</hi> was less or the <hi>Parliaments</hi> greater than it was before this alteration of stile. For if it had been understood either by the <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> to signifie any such thing; as the <hi>King,</hi> (especially such a King as <hi>Hen. VIII.</hi> was) would never have suffered the alteration of the former to the latter; So the two <hi>Houses</hi> who are jealous enough of their Power and Priviledges would never have suffered the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the latter to the former again, (as it
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:94113:202"/>
was altered by King <hi>Edward,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s three immediate Successors; and as it is altered by our present King in the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.)</hi> For as the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the former to the latter could not have been made without the <hi>Kings,</hi> so the alteration of the latter to the former, could not have been made without the consent of the <hi>two Houses</hi> neither.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I verily believe that if any thing <note place="margin">Most likely it was to please the People.</note> at all was meant by the alteration of the former stile to the latter, it was only <hi>ad faciendum Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> to gain the People, that the People might more willingly receive and submit to the Laws, when they were made, (especially such of them as might seem to pinch them in their Purses) when they were said to be enacted by the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> or by the Lords and their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives, and consequently by themselves, as well as by the King; for <hi>Volentibus non fit inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> where there is consent, there is no injury.</p>
                     <p>And yet again lest by this alteration of <hi>stile,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Why the Old stile resumed since.</note> and misinterpretation of it, the <hi>Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of being the sole <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sole <hi>Law giver,</hi> might be thought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, by being communicated to either or both Houses of <hi>Parliament;</hi> therefore the first, most ancient, and withal the longest continued stile of, <hi>Be it enacted by our Soveraign Lord the King, by the advice and with the consent of the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled,</hi> was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the first alteration of it resumed by the three next succeeding Princes; as it hath been
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:94113:203"/>
also now of late by our present Soveraign, and by all of them with the consent of the Lords and Commons thereunto.</p>

                     <p>For answer whereunto I might say in the <hi>first</hi> place, that it was not till after 200. Years from the <hi>first Parliament,</hi> that we read of in our Book of <hi>Statutes,</hi> namely, not until the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi>

the Head to direct and govern it, as the natural Head doth the Body natural, and more than so; for the natural Head, though it directs and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, yet it doth not give its Being to the Body natural, but the Parliamentary Head gives its very Being it self to the Parliamentary body, as being made what it is by his Call, and dissolved into what it was at his pleasure, that is, into so many single and private Persons as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I have already shewed.</p>
                     <p>And truly if we mark the words well, <hi>By the Authority of the same,</hi> cannot be meant the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">What meant, by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the same.</note> of those that are assembled in Parliament, but of the <hi>Parliament</hi> it self wherein they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, which is as it is commonly truly and properly called the <hi>Kings great Council,</hi> or the Kings <hi>High Court of Parliament.</hi> It is by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">The Parliament the King's great Council, and High Court.</note> therefore of that <hi>great Council,</hi> or by the Authority of that <hi>High Court,</hi> that our Laws are said to be enacted: But whence is it that this <hi>great Council,</hi> or this <hi>High Court</hi> hath its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? <note place="margin">Their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the King.</note> Is it not from the King? Is it not from Him that makes them to be such a <hi>Council</hi> and makes them to be such a <hi>Court</hi> by his calling and assembling them together? So that to say <hi>Be it enacted by the Authority of the Parliament,</hi> is no more in effect, than to say <hi>Be it enacted by the King in Parliament,</hi> or, <hi>Be it enacted by the Kings Authority in his great Council, or in his High Court of Parliament.</hi> For as all <hi>Inferiour Courts</hi> are, and Act by the Kings Authority, so is, and doth the <hi>High Court of Parliament</hi> it self also; for <note place="margin">They act in that respect, as other Courts do.</note> as it doth not, nor cannot make it self, no more
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:94113:204"/>
than the Inferiour Courts do or can (for if it did or could, it might meet as often, and subsist as long as they listed themselves) so their acting when they are a Court, is as the Actings of other Courts are (if they Act as they ought to Act) in and by the same Authority from whence they have their Being; for <hi>Agere sequitur esse,</hi> acting follows upon being, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> often (but sometimes very impertinently) tells us. And therefore as in all other Courts, because they are the <hi>Kings Courts,</hi> the <hi>Judgments</hi> that are there given, and the <hi>Decrees</hi> that are there decreed, for interpreting, applying and moderating of Laws already made, are the <hi>Kings Decrees,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Judgments,</hi> because they are made by his Authority, or by an Authority derived from him and delegated by Him, and might if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be executed by him in Person, as some of them have been by some of his Predecessors; so in the <hi>High Court of Parliament,</hi> where Laws are to be made, the <hi>Laws</hi> that are there made are the <hi>Kings Laws,</hi> and that not only as being made <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Why our Laws called the</hi> King's Laws.</note> in one of his Courts, but made in a formal and solemn manner, either by himself personally and immediately; or by special Commission granted and authoriz'd by him to do it for him. For it is the <hi>Le Roy le veult</hi> (whether pronounced by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or by any other authoriz'd by him) that makes the <hi>Law.</hi> So that it is the <hi>Kings Will</hi> and the King's will only to have it a <hi>Law</hi> that makes it a Law, and not any Act antecedent or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of either or both the Houses of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>

But why then are our <hi>Laws</hi> called <hi>Acts of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Why called</hi> Acts of Parliament.</note> 
                        <hi>Parliament?</hi> Because, as I said before, they are made by the King in Parliament: Yea but they are said to be <hi>Enacted by Authority of Parliament;</hi> that is, say I, by the King's Authority in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But they are said to be enacted <hi>by the Lords and Commons,</hi> as well as by the <hi>King;</hi> but it is not said they are enacted by the Authority of the Lords and Commons, as well as by the Kings. So that by enacting <hi>by Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> is meant by the Lords and Commons, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising or consenting to the matter of them, as appears by the indifferent use sometimes of one of the forms, and sometimes of the other, as I observed before. Whereunto may be added, that <note place="margin">Advice or consent some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times intitles to the Act.</note> it is not unusual to ascribe the doing of a thing to Him or them that are but the advisers of it, or consenters to it. Thus we call that an <hi>Order of Council,</hi> which is ordered by the <hi>King in Council,</hi> or by the advice of his Council. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Saints shall judge the World,</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 2.</note> Christ himself saith, that his <hi>twelve Apostles shall sit upon twelve Thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 19. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>Israel.</hi> Yet it is certain (as <hi>Christ</hi> tells us in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place) that <hi>the Father hath committed all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>to the Son,</hi> and hath joyned none in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission with him. So that it is <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ done</hi> that shall absolve those that shall be absolved and shall condemn those that shall be condemned, which are the proper Acts of a Judge <hi>quatenus</hi> as he is a <hi>Judge,</hi> and therefore of none but him that is a Judge. How then can the <hi>Saints</hi> be <note place="margin">The Saints judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World, applied to this case.</note> said <hi>to judge the World,</hi> or the twelve <hi>Apostles</hi> be
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:94113:205"/>
said <hi>to judge the twelve Tribes?</hi> Why they do it by consenting to and approving of the judgment which shall be given by <hi>Christ,</hi> whether it be the sentence of absolution or condemnation, upon whomsoever it is pronounced. So though it be the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>King only</hi> that properly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth make the <hi>Laws,</hi> yet because he never makes any Laws, but such as are agreed on and consented to by both <hi>Houses of Parliament;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>two Houses</hi> of Parliament may, in the same sence that the <hi>Saints</hi> are said <hi>to judge the World,</hi> be said <hi>to make our Laws,</hi> that is, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the King's making of them to be Laws: But yet with this difference (which is indeed no small one) that <hi>Christ</hi>'s judging of the World <note place="margin">The difference in the Case.</note> needs not the approbation or consent to it ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently or consequently either of <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi> but the <hi>King</hi> according to the legally esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished constitution of our Government cannot make a <hi>Law,</hi> but the matter of it must be ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently agreed on by both Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as a fit subject for the King to make a Law of in their Opinions, if he please, and if it be so in his opinion also. So that the <hi>King</hi> is finally the only and sole <hi>Judge,</hi> whether what is agreed on and propos'd by them as fit to be made a Law be fit to be made a <hi>Law</hi> or no; and if he thinks it fit to be so, it is he and none but he, that by his <hi>Le veult</hi> makes it Law.</p>
                     <p>So that to conclude this Point, the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The four Causes of our Laws,</hi> viz. <hi>Efficient, Matter, Form and End of them, explain'd.</hi>

                        <hi>causa à qua,</hi> whereby or by whom the matter of the Law is made to be a Law, is the King and the King only; the <hi>Formal</hi> cause, or the cause <hi>per quam res est quod est,</hi> by which a thing is that thing which it is, or that whereby it actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, and is effectually made to be a <hi>Law,</hi> is the <hi>Kings declaration</hi> of his <hi>Assent</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> to make it a Law by those <hi>Nomothetical</hi> or <hi>Legislative</hi> words pronounced by himself or in his Name, <hi>Le Roy le veult;</hi> the <hi>Final</hi> cause, or the cause <hi>propter quam Res est,</hi> for which or for the sake whereof a thing is, is <hi>Bonum Publicum,</hi> the Publick good. So that the consent of the <hi>two Houses</hi> to what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note place="margin">What kind of Cause, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the two Houses is.</note> to be made a <hi>Law,</hi> is but that which we call <hi>Causa sine quâ non,</hi> a Cause, without which a thing is not to be; which indeed is a <hi>condition</hi> rather than a <hi>cause,</hi> but such a condition as is so necessary for disposing of the <hi>matter</hi> to receive the <hi>form,</hi> that the <hi>efficient</hi> cannot introduce the form without it, though he be not necessitated to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the form by it; that is, it is such a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> as without which the King cannot make what is so conditioned to be a Law, though it do not necessitate him to make that to be a Law which is so conditioned, so that as I said before, it is but <hi>Causa sine quâ non</hi> only, which is indeed no cause at all.</p>
                     <p>And this I think enough to prove the <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Legislative power and the Soveraignty in the King only.</note>

And yet upon this <hi>Supposition,</hi> and upon this supposition only, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> concludes, <hi>first</hi> that <note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>By the <hi>first</hi> of which <hi>Conclusions</hi> he seems to think that there is no <hi>Monarchy,</hi> but where the Government is <hi>Despotical</hi> and Arbitrary; <hi>ubi Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitria Principum</hi> (as <hi>Justin</hi> saith) <hi>pro Legibus sunt;</hi> where the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Soveraign</hi> is the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Subject:</hi> And such indeed were the first, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Eastern Monarchies</hi> of the World; and <note place="margin">The Eastern Monarchs not altogether Arbitrary.</note> yet not altogether so neither, as appears from the 7th. compared with the 15th. Verse of the 6th. Chapter of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel;</hi> for as in the former of those Verses, we find there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation by a <hi>Senate</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> of all the <hi>Presidents, Governours, Counsellors</hi> and <hi>Captains</hi> of the Kingdom of <hi>Persia</hi> for the making of a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> by the King, which he did by his signing of it; so in the latter of those Verses we find also that it was a <hi>standing Law</hi> of, or amongst the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that no <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Statute</hi> made by the King, with the advice of an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the chief Men of his Kingdom, could be changed or repealed without the consent (as I presume they meant) of those that advised the King to make it.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Truth is, that it is not the Governing <hi>by Law</hi> or <hi>without Law</hi> that makes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be <hi>Monarchical,</hi> but the governing <note place="margin">What it is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates a Monarchy.</note> of <hi>One over all;</hi> whether his way of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be Arbitrary, &amp; <hi>Despotical,</hi> or Legal and <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> Ours indeed is <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Political;</hi> but for all that it is <hi>Monarchical,</hi> because it is but <hi>One</hi> that governs us all. He governs indeed, and is obliged, and hath obliged himself, by his <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath,</hi> to govern <hi>by Law:</hi> but it was not his <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> that made him <hi>King;</hi> for
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:94113:207"/>
all our Kings are as much Kings before they take the <hi>Oath,</hi> as they are after the taking of it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it their governing <hi>by Law</hi> that gives them their <hi>Right,</hi> nor their not governing by Law that can take away their Right they have unto their Crowns: for then there must be some <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory</hi> above them to judge betwixt them and <note place="margin">No Judicatory above the King.</note> their People, whether they have forfeited their Right or no; and if they have, to take the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of it; And if there be such a <hi>Judicatory,</hi> it is indeed no <hi>Monarchy,</hi> though it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Kingdom</hi> (as that of <hi>Sparta</hi> was) as I have proved at large already. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> therefore, if he will prove this Kingdom of ours to be no <hi>Monarchy,</hi> he must prove there is some such stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Judicatory</hi> here amongst us as the <hi>Ephori</hi> were in <hi>Sparta.</hi> If he saith the <hi>Parliament</hi> is such a <hi>Judicatory,</hi> He must prove it to be a <note place="margin">The Parliament no such Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory.</note> Court or Judicatory always in being, as that of the <hi>Ephori</hi> was, and as the <hi>Senate of Venice</hi> is, and not such a one as must not meet but when the <hi>King</hi> calls them; and must be gone when he bids them; and such a <hi>Judicatory</hi> is our <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> according to the Legal Constitution of this Kingdom. And how such a <hi>King</hi> as ours can be liable or obnoxious to such a <hi>Judicatory</hi> as this, (which he may make or unmake as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth) so as to be question'd, or tried, or judged, or condemned by it, as the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings might be, and were by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and as the Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> may be and have been by their <hi>Senate,</hi> let Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tell us if he can. For my part I cannot imagine the Practicability of it (I mean
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:94113:208"/>
the practicability of it <hi>de jure,</hi> as to right) in any Case, or upon any Provocation whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>And therefore when our <hi>Law</hi> saith <hi>the King can do no wrong,</hi> the meaning is not (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) <note place="margin">The King can do no wrong, how meant.</note> that the King cannot do that, or command that to be done, which is really a <hi>wrong</hi> or injury to any, or perhaps to many, or all of his Subjects, as <hi>David</hi> did, when he numbred the People, for which sin 70. Thousand of them were swept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Plague in three days: But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that <hi>Maxime</hi> in our Law I say (as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive) is, that if the King should do or cause to be done never so great a wrong, yet he is not legally accountable, or questionable, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishable for it by any power on Earth, and much less by any of his own Subjects. Whereunto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Maxime</hi> of our <hi>Law</hi> seems to be a Witness, which tells us, that <hi>the Crown takes away all</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Another Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime to that purpose.</note> 
                        <hi>defects,</hi> or that he who is <hi>King,</hi> is not chargeable with or answerable for whatsoever he hath done amiss. And hereunto the <hi>Law of God</hi> bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness also. For in this sence it was, that King <hi>David</hi> confessing those two great sins of <hi>Adultery</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>King</hi> David <hi>accountable to God alone;</hi>
                        </note> and <hi>Murder</hi> unto God, saith: <hi>Against Thee Only have I sinned:</hi> not as if he thought he had not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned very highly and heinously too against <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> by defiling the <hi>one</hi> and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>other;</hi> but because he was not <hi>accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> to, or punishable by any but God for it. Any other Man of the Nation, that had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either of those Crimes, must by God's own <hi>Judicial Law</hi> have been put to death for it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy. How came it to pass then that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:94113:208"/>
who was notoriously guilty of both those capital Crimes, was never called to account for either or both of them? The reason is plain, because there was none that had Authority to call him to an account for it: not any other King; for all <hi>Kings</hi> (properly so called) are equal, as to the right of non-subordination to one another, and <hi>Par in parem non habet Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi> a Peer or equal hath no right of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over his equal or Peer; and much less <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in Superiorem,</hi> an Inferiour over his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: for such are <hi>Subjects,</hi> of all Qualities and in all Capacities, in relation to their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But did <hi>David</hi> then escape unpunished?

                     <p>But of the punishment which <hi>Kings</hi> are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from God, I have spoken before, as likewise why Kings, who are <hi>Monarchs</hi> or <hi>Kings indeed,</hi> cannot be question'd or called to account for any thing they have done, or may be supposed to have done amiss, because they have no <hi>Superiour.</hi> That which I am now doing, is to prove our <hi>King</hi> to be a <hi>Monarch,</hi> because he hath no <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour;</hi> nor is ever a whit the less a <hi>Monarch,</hi> because, according to the legal Establishment or constitution of our Kingdom, our Kings cannot make <hi>Laws</hi> for their <hi>Subjects</hi> without the consent of their <hi>Representatives,</hi> that is, without their Subjects own consents in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For I demand, how comes it to pass that they <note place="margin">The Peoples priviledge of consenting to their Laws, a favour at first of the Kings.</note> cannot? Is it not because they did at first, out of their meer <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> to their <hi>Subjects,</hi> give away the Power they had formerly of doing otherwise? <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> from whom our Kings ever since derive their Right and Title to the Crown, could and did make <hi>Laws</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">William <hi>the Conqueror made Laws without their consent.</hi>
                        </note> for the People, without asking or having their antecedent consent to them.

                        <hi>Government,</hi> next to that of the <hi>Paternal,</hi> was no doubt the subduing of the weaker by the stronger, who governed those whom they had subdued <hi>arbitrarily</hi> and <hi>despotically,</hi> as the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> successively did the Inhabitants of this <hi>Island,</hi> when they master'd them at first, though afterwards they governed them by <hi>Laws,</hi> but by Laws imposed upon them, and not antecedently consented to or proposed by them.</p>

When this way of proceeding was first brought in is not expresly set down, for ought I can find in any of our <hi>Historians:</hi> I am sure it was not so <hi>ab initio,</hi> from the beginning, as appears by the contrary practice during the Government of this <hi>Island</hi> by all the aforesaid <hi>Nations</hi> before the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> nor by the <hi>Normans</hi> after the Conquest, until the Raign of the aforesaid <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> if it were so then; for that is not expresly, (as to the making of <hi>Laws)</hi> recorded neither.

                           <hi>Tis likely the Custom of not making Laws without the Peoples consent began under</hi> Henry I. <hi>with that other,</hi>
                        </note> King, who did first call together such an <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> as was then first and hath been ever since cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Parliament</hi> (I mean an <hi>Assembly</hi> consisting of all the <hi>three Estates,</hi> and not of the <hi>Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> only, as was the Custom in former times) and because his <hi>End</hi> in constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and calling together such an <hi>Assembly,</hi> was to let the <hi>People</hi> see that he would not take away <note place="margin">of not raising Mony without their consent.</note> their <hi>Money</hi> from them, (as his <hi>Predecessors</hi> had done, when and how and to what degree they pleased) but would be content with what the People themselves should, by <hi>Representatives</hi> of their own choosing, willingly and freely of their own accord think fit to give him, believing that the Money so given, would be as much, and perhaps more, but certainly much more easily raised, and less grudgingly paid, than what might by force, against their wills, be extorted from them. This (I say) being one of the <hi>Ends,</hi> why that wise and prudent Prince did first constitute such an <hi>Assembly</hi> for the more easie and plausible pretence of <hi>raising of Money</hi> by the consent of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:94113:211"/>
those that are to pay it, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that another of his Ends was to make the <hi>People</hi> more willing to submit and to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the <hi>Laws</hi> (when they were made) by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such a <hi>Constitution</hi> as required the <hi>Peoples consent</hi> to the making of them, before they were made; which <hi>Constitution</hi> hath been continued ever since.</p>
                     <p>But that it was at first by <hi>Grant</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> after he was actually King, and not by any <note place="margin">However it was, it was not by Compact but by Grant.</note>

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:94113:219"/>
there be some that do as good as say one to another, as that rebellious backsliding and ever-murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generation of the <hi>Jews</hi> did; <hi>Let us us make us a</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And why so? why so soon so weary of well-being? Is there any Nation under heaven in a <note place="margin">No reason for it,</note> better, nay in so good a condition as we are? Are not we the only People of <hi>Europe</hi> that are in <hi>Peace,</hi> when all our Neighbours are in War with one another?

So that if ever it might be said of any, it may now most emphatically be said of us; <hi>Happy are the people that are in such a case.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yes! may some men say, if we were sure to continue always as we are; but we are afraid we <note place="margin">The pretended ground of it.</note> shall not; we are afraid of <hi>Popery,</hi> we are afraid of <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> which may take away all we have from us, that is or ought to be dear to us.</p>
                     <p>But why should we fear, where no fear is? Is not our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>Liberty,</hi> and our <hi>Properties</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The ill effect of causless fears.</note> secured unto us by the Laws? and by such <hi>Laws</hi> as can never be repealed but by our own consents? Did not such a needless fear as this make us <hi>rebell</hi> against our late Gracious Soveraign <hi>Lord the King,</hi> and by that <hi>Rebellion</hi> make our fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nay the basest and vilest and meanest of our fellow Subjects, to be Lords over us? And if ever we come into such a slavery, or any
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:94113:219"/>
slavery at all again, it must be by such a <hi>Rebellion</hi> produced by such a pretended fear, or by a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Invasion</hi> invited by our divisions amongst our selves, that must be the cause of it.</p>
                     <p>Never was there a better <hi>Constitution of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> than ours is; nor ever was there better se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity <note place="margin">The Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Government.</note> for the keeping of it as it is, than we have. Never were there <hi>Subjects</hi> that had more and greater, or so many and great <hi>Priviledges</hi> as <note place="margin">The Subjects Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</note> the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> have; neither do our <hi>Kings</hi> deny them to be of right due unto them, as appears by the late Kings answer to the <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right;</hi> but due unto them not by <hi>capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> and <hi>contracts</hi> with them, before they were Subjects; but either by <hi>Donations</hi> or by <hi>Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of our Kings to them, when they were and as they were their Subjects.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it denied, but that the <hi>People</hi> now have and of right ought to have <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Their represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</note> 
                        <hi>in Parliament</hi> of their own choosing: But that this was not nor could not be always so, and that it was by the Kings meer Grace and favour when it first began to be so, appears by what I have already observed concerning the first <hi>Parliament</hi> (properly so called) here in <hi>England,</hi> instituted by <hi>Henry</hi> the first, and as <hi>Daniel</hi> (one of the most judicious of our <hi>English Historians)</hi> tells us, after the manner of <hi>Normandy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that ever since it hath bin so I deny not neither; namely, that the People have had, have, and ought to have such Representatives in <hi>Parliament</hi> of their own choosing, but to represent them, not as they were (no body knows when)
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:94113:220"/>
as <hi>Freemen</hi> before they had Kings or were under any Government at all, but as they are now and have been ever since, and were long before there were <hi>Parliaments,</hi> I mean as <hi>Subjects,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently such as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confesseth have no other lawful way of redressing their Grievances, if they have any (though never so great or so many) but their <hi>Representatives</hi> complaining and petitioning the King for the relief of them; and <note place="margin">The duty of those Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives.</note> that either by desiring him to put the Laws in execution, already made in favour of them (as they did in the late Kings time by the <hi>Petition of Right)</hi> or to Enact (if need be) new Laws for explanation and confirmation of the old ones, or to punish those, by whom the Legal Rights and Priviledges of the People have been Violated. All this I grant the <hi>Peoples Representatives in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> may, and if there be cause for it ought to do, and that not as they are the Peoples Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives only but their <hi>Trustees</hi> also: nay and <note place="margin">How to act as Trustees also.</note> more than this, namely, not to promote or give their consent to the making of any such <hi>Laws</hi> as may be prejudicial to the publick, though they may seem to gratify, or may seem to be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the People; nor to hinder the passing of such <hi>Acts</hi> as are really for the Peoples good, though perhaps to the <hi>Major,</hi> that is, the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise and least judicious part of the People them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they may seem to be otherwise. And therefore their <hi>Representatives</hi> and <hi>Trustees</hi> as they are to consent or dissent, so are they to judge for them what is or what is not to be consented to by them in behalf of them. They are not always
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:94113:220"/>
the <hi>best Husbands</hi> for the People that are most sparing of their Purses; especially when the refusing to part with some may hazard the loss of all. Neither is every thing that is got from the <hi>King,</hi> a gain to the <hi>Subjects;</hi> for the King's power may be too little to protect, as well as too great, to oppress them; and according to the present conjuncture, the former is much more to be feared than the latter: And therefore the best service that can be done for the People by their Representatives in Parliament is to keep the <hi>Balance</hi> even betwixt the <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> and the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> by not <note place="margin">An even Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to be kept betwixt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Priviledge.</note> indeavouring to intrench upon the one or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the other, but always and above all things to remember that as they are themselves <hi>Subjects,</hi> so they are <hi>Representatives</hi> of Subjects, and <hi>Trustees</hi> for Subjects, as they are Subjects; and therefore are not to treat the King as if they were <hi>Coordinate</hi> or Copartners with him in the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty:</hi> but as it becomes <hi>Subjects</hi> and the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives</hi> of Subjects, and such as have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being there in that capacity, and have the liberty of promoting or hindring the <hi>Laws</hi> that are to be made for those they represent, from the meer Grace and Favour and Goodness of the King and his Predecessors; and therefore the <hi>King</hi> is not by them, nor by those they represent, to be esteemed to be less a King, or less their King, or less their Soveraign, than he was before; no <note place="margin">The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</note> more than a <hi>Father</hi> is less a Father or hath less the Authority of a Father, the kinder and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent he is unto his Children; or a <hi>Husband</hi>

and conducing to their end in writing,</q> (that is) to the derogating from the Supreme Power of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> either by imbasing it with the mixture of some less noble <hi>species</hi> of Government with it, or to weaken and enfeeble it by dividing of it.

                     <p>And certainly it would be so, if the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> did but know or would but consider <note place="margin">The happy condition of English Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> in how much more happy a condition they are or may be if they will, (and would be if it were not for their seditious <hi>Preachers)</hi> than any other Subjects in the World are, or ever were, I had almost said or indeed can be, under what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment soever, if they be not situated as we are: Because no Government upon the <hi>Continent</hi> can be safe from being suddenly invaded and over-run by its confining Neighbours, if he or they that

have the Supreme Power be not enabled to raise such Forces and Mony to pay them without staying for the advice or consent of his or their Subjects, as may be sufficient to defend them from their <hi>Enemies,</hi> and which being raised may be made use of for the oppressing of their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi> Whereas we being <hi>Islanders</hi> intrenched and surrounded by the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and consequently not being in danger of being suddenly surprized and over-run by any from abroad, our Kings have obliged themselves to raise no Mony (without which no formidable Forces can be raised and maintained) by any <hi>Taxes</hi> or Impositions upon their Subjects without their own consent in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> thereby securing both the liberty of their Persons, and Property of their Goods unto them, and that they shall never be put to any charge but for the necessary defence of themselves, and for their own safety and welfare, as well as for the Honour of the King and their Country.</p>
                     <p>This, together with many other <hi>Priviledges</hi> which the Subjects of this Kingdom have above <note place="margin">An Account of a Sermon, the Bishop preacht before the Long Parliament, in commendation of the English constitution, both in Church and State.</note> all other Subjects in the World that I know or ever heard of, made me presume (when I was One of the four first that was appointed to preach to the <hi>House of Commons</hi> of the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> in the late King's time) to tell them and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove unto them that the <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> both <hi>of Church and State,</hi> as they were here by <hi>Law</hi> established (abstracting from the ill managery which might be in either through the faults or frailties of some particular men) were both of them the best in their kind that were in
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:94113:224"/>
the Christian World: that of the <hi>State</hi> for the reasons before specified, and that of the <hi>Church</hi> because it was the only Church (now extant) that professed and maintain'd both the <hi>Apostolick Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Apostolical Government:</hi> All other <hi>Christian Churches</hi> in the World, <hi>East, West, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> failing either in the one or in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or both of them; and besides, because the Government of our <hi>Church</hi> was more agreeable with <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and with such a Monarchy as ours is, than either <hi>Popery,</hi> or <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or <hi>Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is, or any other that can be devised by the wit of Man is or can be. And therefore I did hope they would not think of making any change or alteration in the legal and fundamental Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution either of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie what they should find to be otherwise than according to the <hi>legal Constitution</hi> it ought to be in either of them, by causing the <hi>Laws</hi> of the one and the <hi>Canons</hi> of the other to be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. This I say I presumed to preach to the then <hi>House of Commons,</hi> as fearing there were many amongst them that were given to change, though not such and so horrible a change as they made afterwards both in the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> For truly could I have foreseen, and had told any of their Grandees then (though it had been <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself) as the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> told <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> that he and those that joyn'd with him should do such things as afterwards he did, he would I believe have answered me as <hi>Hazael</hi> did the Prophet, What, do you think I am a Dog, that I should do such horrible and barbarous
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:94113:224"/>
things as you speak of? And yet both of them I mean <hi>Hazael</hi> and <hi>Cromwel</hi> did such things after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; so dangerous a thing it is to leave the Road and to wander in by-paths: For as <hi>Grotius</hi> well observes, <hi>Verissimum illud, omnia incerta esse simul ac à jure recessum est:</hi> No man knows whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is going when he is once out of the right way, nor whither the Devil may drive him, when he will not be led by Gods direction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I concluded, that in my humble opinion the best and wisest prayer that any could make unto God in the behalf of this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> was, that if either of them had swerved from what it was or ought to be according to its legal consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it might be reduced to its right frame and temper according to the standard; and that never Alteration or Innovation might be made in the fundamental constitution of either of them.</p>
                     <p>And this <hi>Declaration</hi> I thought my self obliged in conscience to make, though I knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that many of my <hi>Auditors</hi> would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with it, as indeed they were, as I found by their usage of me afterwards, though then it was too early to make any shew of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was presented with a Piece of Plate with this Inscription, <hi>Donum Populi Anglicani,</hi> as the other first three Preachers were, but not desired, as they were, to print my <hi>Sermon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I repeat this matter of fact to let the World <note place="margin">The reason, why this Account given.</note> know that, though I was then by some thought and said to be a <hi>Puritan,</hi> as I am now by others thought and said to be a <hi>Papist,</hi> I was then, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:94113:225"/>
ever had been, as I am now; and am now as I was then, and by the grace of God ever will be, a <hi>true Son</hi> of the <hi>CH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCH of ENGLAND,</hi> as it was then and is now by Law established; and consequently a <hi>loyal Subject</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> whatsoever either <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians</hi> may think, or rather make others believe they think of me. I am sure mine own conscience bears me witness, that I was always what I pretended my self to be, and all that knew me heretofore, and do know me now (whether <hi>Protestants, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> or <hi>Presbyterians)</hi> will I am confident bear me witness that I was always as I am now both in <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> in relation both to the <hi>Secular</hi> Government of the <hi>State</hi> and the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Government of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to the <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government over them both.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Over them both</hi> I say; for there being two main parts or members of every <hi>Body Politick,</hi> and <note place="margin">Church and State both sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Monarchy.</note> consequently of <hi>Monarchy</hi> (especially amongst <hi>Christians)</hi> namely the State <hi>Civil</hi> and the State <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> if both these Parts or States of the <hi>Body Politick</hi> be not governed in chief by one and the same Person, they cannot be said to be parts or members of the same <hi>Monarchy.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>A like danger to Monarchy from Popery and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Our Church-government justly commended. Division-mongers or Separatists as justly censured.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BOth these <hi>States</hi> are not nor cannot be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by one and the same Person, where the <note place="margin">Popery and Presbytery both destructive to Monarchy.</note> State <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> or Government of the Church is either <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> because the State <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> if it be <hi>Popish,</hi> will be governed in chief by none but the <hi>Pope;</hi> and if it be <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> (Presbyterian I mean in the heighth, as it was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and would have been in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland)</hi> it will be governed in chief by none but it self; the one, to wit <hi>Popery,</hi> introducing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Soveraign;</hi> and the other, to wit <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> introducing another <hi>Soveraignty</hi> into the same body Politick, and consequently they are both of them destructive unto <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither can a Prince be <hi>Soveraign</hi> so much as <hi>in civilibus,</hi> in civil affairs, as long as another besides himself (either abroad or at home) doth claim and exercise a Soveraignty over the same Subjects, though it be but <hi>in Ecclesiasticis,</hi> in Church-affairs only.</p>
                     <p>Because those that pretend to a Soveraign Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in <hi>Ecclesiasticals,</hi> (as indeed both the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi> and the <hi>National Synod</hi> do pretend) must
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:94113:226"/>
needs pretend likewise to a Soveraign Power of judging what is <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and consequently by affirming what they please to be <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> they may govern how they please even in those things that are meerly <hi>Civil</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>So that supposing two distinct Supreme Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, one <hi>Civil</hi> and the other <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> in <note place="margin">Two Supremes in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent.</note> the same Body Politick or in the same Kingdom, (as there must needs be, if the Government of the Church be either <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian)</hi> there cannot choose but be perpetual clashing betwixt those <hi>two Jurisdictions</hi> and the abettors of them, the one continually either affronting and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, or being affronted and undermined by the other.</p>
                     <p>And then let it be considered how the <hi>People</hi> in the mean time (who in several respects must be supposed to be equally subject to them both) must needs in case of contrary commands (there being no <hi>Appeal</hi> from the one unto the other) be distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and confounded betwixt them both; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible (as <hi>Christ</hi> himself tells us) for a man <hi>to serve two Masters,</hi> of the which one is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate unto the other; and as impossible like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is (as the same <hi>Christ</hi> tells us) for <hi>a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom divided within it self,</hi> and consequently against it self (as every Kingdom having two <hi>Soveraign Powers</hi> in it at the same time must needs be) <hi>to stand,</hi> that is, to continue firm and stable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling at one time or other into such terrible Convulsions of Schisms, Factions and Seditions, as will finally bring it to Dissolution.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="409" facs="tcp:94113:226"/>
Many sad <hi>Instances</hi> of this truth we read of in <note place="margin">History and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience have taught us the inconvenience of the one and the other.</note> our <hi>Chronicles</hi> whilst the usurped and exercised <hi>Ecclesiastical Supremacy</hi> in this Kingdom was in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> but none so sad, as those we our selves have seen and felt of late, whilst the <hi>Presbytery</hi> exercised in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> laid claim to, the same power. For indeed <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> (though they look divers ways with their Heads;) yet they are tied together like <hi>Samson</hi>'s Foxes by their Tayles, carrying the same Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of combustion, wheresoever they come, I mean the same Principles of <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> against Soveraign Princes and Estates, if they will not be ruled by them.</p>
                     <p>And therefore as our Kings <hi>Predecessors,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem themselves and their People from the slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">No fear of either's Return.</note> of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> did wisely and couragiously drive out <hi>Popery;</hi> so it is not to be doubted but his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> that now is, to prevent the same or a worse bondage to the <hi>Consistory,</hi> will with the same wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and courage keep out the <hi>Presbytery;</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed where it governs in chief (as it would do wheresoever it is) a bondage by so much worse and more ignominious than <hi>Popery,</hi> by how much worse it is to be subject to many Tyrants than to one, and by how much less it is ignominious for a King to be a Vassal to a foreign Prince, than to all or any of his own Subjects.</p>
                     <p>But thanks be to God, we have no reason to fear that either our <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> will ever think of introducing either <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> to be predominant here amongst us, having had so sensible an experience formerly of the <hi>one</hi>

and lately of the <hi>other;</hi> especially being already possessed, as we are, of such an <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A just commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> 
                        <hi>Government,</hi> as was instituted by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> universally received and approved by the <hi>Primitive Christians;</hi> and by <hi>Law</hi> establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed amongst our selves: a <hi>Government</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no power at all above the King, nor to no power under the King neither but from him, and by him, and for him: a <hi>Government</hi> enjoyning <hi>active</hi> obedience to all lawful commands of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority; and <hi>passive</hi> obedience when we cannot obey actively, forbidding and condemning all taking up of Arms <hi>offensive</hi> or <hi>defensive</hi> by Subjects of any quality or in any capacity against their <hi>Soveraign</hi> (whatsoever he be either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his <hi>Intellectuals,</hi> or his <hi>Morals,</hi> or his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)</hi> in any case, upon any pretence, or upon any provocation whatsoever: Finally, such a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> as hath no relation to any foreign Prince or State to protect or assist it from abroad, nor any foundation in the Body of the Common People to rise up for it or with it at home; but having all its dependence under God upon the <hi>Crown;</hi> and all its security in and by the <hi>Law;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if at any time it happens to transgress against either, (as some times by the faults or frailties of particular men, I will not deny but it may) yet even then or in that case it will easily be corrected and reduced into order; and that by the ordinary course of Justice, without char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Subject or endangering the Peace of the Kingdom by levying a War to suppress it; and without fear of an <hi>Invasion</hi> from abroad, or an
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:94113:227"/>
                        <hi>Insurrection</hi> at home in defence of it; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the same case be probably affirmed of either of the former.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore such an excellent constitution of Government both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> as we <note place="margin">What duty we owe to such a Constitution.</note> have, and both of them by <hi>Law</hi> established, that which we have to do in the first place, is to be thankful to God for it, who hath not dealth so with any other Nation, and then not only to live quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peaceably and contentedly under it for the present; but to do what we can in our several places and stations for the upholding and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating of it, that our Posterity may have cause to bless God for it and for us also.

But to return unto what I was speaking of; what I have said already is enough to prove, that a <hi>Presbyterian Heir</hi> of the Crown would do what <note place="margin">The Sectaries will not indure <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s nor one another.</note> he could to bring in and set up the <hi>Presbyterian Government,</hi> (which can no more consist with <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the State, than it can with <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in the Church) and make us all <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> as well as a <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And what the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> did against us, and would have done against the <hi>Independents</hi> by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Independents</hi> did against them by the <hi>Army.</hi> And so no doubt would any other of the <hi>Schismatical Parties</hi> have done against all the rest that were not of their perswasion, if they had got the power into their hands.</p>
                     <p>But none of them (may some of their Friends <note place="margin">They and the Papists much alike, as to cruelty.</note> say) would have been so cruel as the <hi>Papists,</hi> who hold it not only lawful but meritorious to put <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that is, all that are not Papists, to death.</p>

Did not the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Sectaries</hi> that joyned with them in the War against the King, think so too, when they kill'd as many as they could of the <hi>Royal Party,</hi> and when their Preachers incourag'd them to do so, which he that doubts of let him read <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium armatum</hi> for his conviction.</p>
                     <p>But that they will say was but in the heat of blood, whilst the War lasted; afterwards they suffered us to live amongst them. And so (say I) do the <hi>Papists</hi> too, and to enjoy not only their lives, but their liberties and their legal possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and goods also, in many, nay in most places where there is no <hi>Inquisition;</hi> which was more than we of the <hi>Church of England</hi> (especially we of the <hi>Clergie)</hi> were suffered to enjoy here under the Raign of either the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> or <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi> And whether they would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <note place="margin">Their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples much what the same,</note> to blood, as well as the <hi>Papists,</hi> upon the account of <hi>Religion</hi> only, I have reason to doubt; or rather I have no reason to doubt but they would; for as it is a <hi>Popish</hi> opinion that all <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> are to be put to death, and that all that are not <hi>Papists</hi> are Hereticks; so it is a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> opinion that no <hi>Idolater</hi> is to be suffered to live, and that all <hi>Papists</hi> are Idolaters, as likewise that all the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Episcopal Party</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are <hi>Papists,</hi> and consequently <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> that is, such as by the Law of God are to be put to death.</p>
                     <p>And if they did not put this doctrine in practice here, as they have done in <hi>Scotland</hi> (witness the <note place="margin">And practices too, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</note> murder of the late <hi>Primate</hi> there upon the account

The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> her self did not at first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with that extremity of Rigor against those she calls <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as she did afterwards.

And who can tell whether it might not have proceeded to deprivation of life also, as well as the <hi>Roman Inquisition</hi> doth, if it had gotten po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authority enough to support it?</p>
                     <p>We know that the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who made a great part of that <hi>rebellious Army</hi> against the <hi>late</hi>

And first the <hi>Means</hi> that must be made use of to prevent such an <hi>alteration</hi> must be <hi>lawful,</hi> evidently and undoubtedly <hi>lawful,</hi> and that both in relation to the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and in relation to the <hi>Law of the Land</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>excluding</hi> of the <hi>right Heir</hi> from his Inheritance seems to be contrary to both; and <note place="margin">The Exclusion of the right Heir, against the practice of all Nations;</note> by the <hi>right Heir,</hi> I mean the first-born, or him that is nearest in bloud to him that is, or was for, merly in possession. And that such a one hath a right of <hi>succession,</hi> from which God would not have him to be excluded, appears by the almost <hi>universal practice</hi> of all <hi>Nations</hi> in all Ages and in all Places, which Practice being every where and almost the same among those, that in all things else differ so much from one another, must needs proceed from some <hi>Principle</hi> common to them <note place="margin">And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently against the Law of Nature.</note> all; and what can that be but the <hi>Law of Nature?</hi> and what is the Law of Nature but the <hi>Law of God</hi> himself <hi>written in mens hearts?</hi>

                     <p>And therefore it was according to this <hi>Law</hi> (before there was any <hi>positive Law</hi> of God or Man in the case) that <hi>Jacob</hi> in blessing of his Children <note place="margin">Jacob<hi>'s three eldest Sons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Birth-right.</hi>

by death also, that <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> the two next eldest Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> lost the priviledge of their <hi>Birth-right</hi> also; namely for being guilty of the horrible <hi>murder</hi> of the Inhabitants of the whole City of <hi>Shechem.</hi> And thus <hi>the dignity of Excellency and the dignity of Power</hi> came to be the Inheritance of <hi>Judah, Jacob</hi>'s fourth Son, because the three <hi>Elder Brothers</hi> had <hi>forfeited</hi> their Right thereunto by being guilty of such <hi>Crimes</hi> as were punishable by death: which guilt of theirs being given by their Father <hi>Jacob</hi> as a reason why, or cause for which they were <hi>disinherited;</hi> from thence we may infer, <hi>first,</hi> that naturally or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> the <hi>Eldest;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the next in bloud hath a <hi>right to inherit</hi> before those that are younger, or those that are farther off: And <hi>(2dly)</hi> That they are not to be <note place="margin">Two Cases of disherison.</note>

                        <hi>Law</hi> can be prejudicial to him, or to any right of his, all <hi>Laws</hi> being to look <hi>forwards,</hi> and not <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> (that is) to enjoyn or prohibit something for the future upon such or such Penalties for the disobeying of them, but not for the punishing of any thing that was done before there was any such Law for the prohibiting of it; so that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, but not granting that by such a <hi>Law</hi> the Heir of the Crown might justly be <hi>excluded</hi> from the succession <hi>for the future;</hi> yet he that is Heir <hi>at present,</hi> and was so before any such Law was made, cannot (as I humbly conceive) upon such a pretence be <hi>excluded</hi> without violence done unto the Law, as well as injury done unto himself.</p>

                     <p>We are not therefore to fear it will be attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to be done <hi>by force:</hi> Nor that it can be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected if it should be attempted to be done <hi>by fair</hi>

                        <note place="margin">The Case much different then, from what it is now.</note> was but begun to be planted in this Kingdom, and had not taken root enough for the setling and growth and continuance of it, much the <hi>major part</hi> of the People being still Popishly affected in their
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:94113:239"/>
Hearts, though they were by the Laws then in force restrain'd from the open profession of it; as appear'd by their so readily and so gladly returning (as most of them did) to it, and by their not only accepting but desiring and purchasing the <hi>Pape's Absolution</hi> for revolting from it. So that it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easie for <hi>Queen Mary</hi> to make that <hi>Alteration</hi> which she did by repealing such <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> as she found in favour of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and to re-enact or restore such as were for the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Popery,</hi> which she found to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by Her Predecessor. And to make this work of hers the more easie, she did and could without any legal impediment to the contrary bestow all places of Trust, Power and Profit, <hi>Civil, Military</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> upon such as were as zealous as she her self was for the suppressing of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,</hi> and setting up of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion instead of it.</p>
                     <p>Whereas now the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> has been setled here in <hi>England</hi> for above fourscore years before the Rebellion and above twenty years since, and the <hi>Popish</hi> suppress'd for twenty years longer, even during all the time of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> it self, whilst the <hi>Sectaries</hi> usurped the Supreme Power, and whilst the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion of the <hi>Church of England</hi> was suppress'd and persecuted also.

                     <p>IF it be objected that if the <hi>Successor</hi> be a <hi>Papist,</hi> there is no <hi>Oath</hi> he can take, but he <note place="margin">An Objection; that a Popish Successor will be absolv'd from his Oath.</note> may be and will be by the <hi>Pope</hi> easily and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>absolved</hi> from the <hi>Sin</hi> in taking it, and from the <hi>Obligation</hi> to keep it.</p>
                     <p>I answer first, that the same <hi>Objection</hi> will be as valid against a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> as against a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I <hi>Answer,</hi> that if the security of the <hi>Government</hi> and the Peace and Welfare of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">A threefold Answer.</note> it, and the <hi>Majority</hi> of the Peoples <hi>represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> (without which it cannot be done) consent to it, it is no more than in many other cases is done already.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I answer, that in this very case All the <hi>Papists</hi> (who if they be not a great number, I wonder why we should be so much afraid of them) all the <hi>Papists</hi> (I say) who are all of them <hi>Free-men,</hi> and as Freemen have a right to choose and be chosen into the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> and some of them by Birth to be <hi>Peers</hi> of the Realm, yet are all of them excluded from both <hi>Houses,</hi> and so are all <hi>Out-law'd</hi> and <hi>Excommunicated</hi> persons, and such are or should be all the <hi>Sectaries</hi> that will not come unto our Churches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Did not both Houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> make it one of the conditions of Peace with the
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:94113:244"/>
late King, that none that had serv'd him against them should be capable of sitting in either of the <hi>Houses</hi> for Twenty one years to come? And why might not the <hi>King</hi> with much more reason have demanded the exclusion of all those that had fought for the <hi>Parliament</hi> against Him from the same priviledge? Or why may not those that will not oblige themselves by <hi>Oath</hi> to maintain the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> legally established by <hi>King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> be much more reasonably, and much more justly and equitably excluded from having any thing to do in the <hi>Government,</hi> or in the making of our <hi>Laws</hi> than those that would not take the <hi>Oath of Abjuration</hi> and of being faithful to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it was illegally set up without <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> were excluded not only from choosing or being chosen into <hi>Parliaments,</hi> but from having any protection or benefit of the <hi>Laws</hi> by the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start <hi>Free-state,</hi> (as they call'd themselves) but were indeed no better than <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Robbers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not therefore to be doubted but that such a <hi>Law,</hi> as is made in <hi>Scotland,</hi> may by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">A reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Test;</note> respectively be made in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> also; Neither is it to be doubted but that such a <hi>Law,</hi> if it were made, would be the best <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> that can be given against the bringing in of <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary Government;</hi> especially if the <hi>rightful Successor</hi> will not oppose but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the making of such a <hi>Law</hi> here, as I do verily believe, and as all reasonable men have reason to believe, he will; because he did not only consent to, but promote the making of that Law in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And if he be willing not only to <note n="*" place="margin">Which if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to by the Successor, no reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but it will be kept.</note> consent to,

but to promote the making of such a <hi>Law</hi> here, why should we not believe that he intends and resolves to keep it and maintain it also, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his own private perswasion in point of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> may be for the present (for God may and I hope will perswade <hi>Japheth</hi> to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem)</hi> or continue to be for the future? For if he did not intend and resolve it should be kept when it is made, and consequently that <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government</hi> should be kept out by it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more imprudent than to promote the making of such a <hi>Law,</hi> whereby all that have or are to have interest in the making and repealing of Laws, and in all places of trust and power, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Military</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> in both Kingdoms, are to be obliged by <hi>Oath</hi> never to consent to the alteration of the Government, <hi>as it is now by Law established,</hi> nor consequently to the bringing in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary Government;</hi> which <hi>Oath</hi> when they have taken, as they cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd with for the breaking it, if they would, so they would not if they could; being such as are to be supposed to be enemies both to <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> and therefore such as would do, what legally they could, for keeping out of both, though they were not sworn, and much more being sworn to do so. And therefore it is not to be supposed that the <hi>Successor</hi> intends or means to attempt the bringing in of either of them, if he be willing such a <hi>Law</hi> should be made, as will make it exceedingly difficult, if not utterly impossible for him to do it. Let us try therefore whether He will not consent to the making of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:94113:245"/>
such a <hi>Law</hi> here, as willingly as he has done in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and let the consenting or not consenting to the making of such a <hi>Law</hi> here, as there is there, and the taking, or refusing to take such an <hi>Oath,</hi> as by that Law is prescribed to be taken by those that are to choose, or to be chosen <hi>Members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> for the future, be the <gap reason="foreign">

And of their <hi>Original reserved rights</hi> they may <note place="margin">The Peoples Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</note> pretend to as many as they please; for it is but their saying they are so, and the People must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be so; because they are not their <hi>Representatives</hi> only, but their <hi>Trustees</hi> also; and therefore it is by their Eyes (says Mr. <hi>Baxter)</hi> that <note place="margin">H.

For it is <hi>Christ</hi> and Christ alone, or <hi>Christ</hi> and none but <hi>Christ</hi> shall judge the World, as a <hi>Judge</hi> properly so called, that is, <hi>authoritativè,</hi> or by his own inherent power and Authority: But the <hi>Saints</hi> are said to judge the World <hi>approbativè,</hi> by assenting to and approving of the judgment given by <hi>Christ,</hi> as just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; so that in propriety of speech, they are not to be called <hi>Judges,</hi> but <hi>Assessors</hi> and Assenters only.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, as to the making of our <hi>Laws,</hi> it may be truly said, that the <hi>King alone</hi> is the maker <note place="margin">How the Laws made by the King alone, and yet jointly by the King, Lords and Commons.</note> of them; because it is by the King and by the King alone, that they are made to be Laws, which were before no Laws; and yet it may truly (though not

so properly) be said too, that they are made by the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>two Houses</hi> of Parliament; because they do consent to the Kings making of them to be Laws, and not only so, but also because they do not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the making and publishing of them <hi>after</hi> they are made Laws by the King, but they must consent to have them made Laws by the King, <hi>before</hi> the King can make them to be Laws. And yet for all that, it is the King and the King alone who by his <hi>LE ROT LE VE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LT</hi> or his <hi>FIAT</hi> doth make them to be <hi>Laws.</hi> In which operative and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious words neither of the <hi>Houses</hi> concur with him; and yet it is by those words only, or alone, that what was before but a <hi>Bill,</hi> that is, an <hi>Embryo,</hi> or at most but <hi>materia disposita,</hi> matter fit to be made a Law of, is informed and enlivened with that obliging po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authority both <hi>directive</hi> and <hi>coactive,</hi> which makes it to be a <hi>Law.</hi> So that all the <hi>two Houses</hi> can be said to do towards the making of a <hi>Law,</hi> is to give it a <hi>posse fieri,</hi> a capacity to be made a Law, but it is the <hi>King,</hi> and the King only that gives it its <hi>factum esse,</hi> its being made so; and yet because the <hi>King</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by his <hi>Fiat</hi> give it its <hi>factum esse,</hi> till it be agreed on by the <hi>two Houses,</hi> and because the <hi>two Houses,</hi> by their agreeing on it, do give it its <hi>fieri posse,</hi> or make it ready and fit to be made a <hi>Law;</hi> therefore it may truly (though not properly) be said to be made joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>by the King, Lords, and Commons;</hi> because though it be not made by the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> but by the <hi>King only,</hi> yet it cannot be made without them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is, without their doing something antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, without their doing whereof the <hi>King</hi> cannot make <hi>Laws.</hi> And this was that, and all that, which the late King meant, when he said that the <hi>Laws</hi> of

this Kingdom were made <hi>jointly</hi> by the <hi>King, Lords, and Commons,</hi> that is, (according to the old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary stile) <hi>by the King, with the consent of the Lords and Commons;</hi> or if you will, by the <hi>King,</hi> but not without the consent of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons.</hi>

                           <hi>Some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> ad hominem, <hi>to convince</hi> Mr. B <hi>of this mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                        </note> not affirm, that a thing can <hi>properly</hi> be said to be done by him or them, without whose <hi>consent</hi> it cannot be done.

                     <p>Again, supposing Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is of the opinion of the <hi>Protestant Churches</hi> abroad, that there can be no <hi>marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> without consent of <hi>Parents,</hi> and supposing that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to be true; yet I suppose neither Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Ministers</hi> of those Churches, will say <note place="margin">

                     <p>Many other <hi>Instances</hi> of the like nature might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but this is enough to prove the thing we have in <note place="margin">A brief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearsal of our Law-making.</note> hand, namely, that though in some sence it may be said that our <hi>Laws</hi> are made by the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> or by the <hi>King, Lords and Commons,</hi> because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:94113:251"/>
be made by the <hi>King,</hi> without the consent of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> yet properly speaking, it is the King alone, who by his <hi>LE ROY LE VE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LT</hi> makes them to be <hi>Laws,</hi> in which Law-making Act of his, neither of the <hi>Houses</hi> do joyn, or are joyned with him; and therefore the Laws so made cannot properly be said to be made by the King and them joyntly.</p>
                     <p>And yet because they cannot be made by the King without their antecedent consent to them and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of them, they may truly be said to <hi>concur To</hi> the making though not <hi>In</hi> the making of them. And this, and no more but this, was undoubtedly the late Kings meaning, when he said the <hi>Laws</hi> were made here in <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>King, Lords, and Commons,</hi> or upon their proposing such and such <hi>Bills,</hi> being first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by them, to be made <hi>Laws</hi> by him.</p>

                     <p>And as this was the stile in relation to making of <note place="margin">How in our Monarchy.</note> Laws in a <hi>Democracy,</hi> when and where the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was in the <hi>People;</hi> so <hi>à paritate rationis,</hi> upon the like reason and account, in a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> where the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty is in One, the stile ought to be <hi>Populus rog at, Rex jubet;</hi> the People requests, and the King grants.

And as touching the former, I advised him to reade <hi>Hooker's Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> so touching the latter Bishop <hi>Bilson;</hi> but what Book of Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi>'s? Not that of <hi>Christian Subjection,</hi> as he would make his Readers to believe it was; but his Book of the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Government of Christ's Church</hi> in defence of Episcopacy. So that in saying <hi>I advised him to reade</hi> Hooker <hi>and</hi> Bilson, and adding, <hi>that he found
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:94113:255"/>
more in them than he approved for resisting and restraining of Kings;</hi> it is evident, that he did fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciously <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s fallacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in giving the account as he does.</hi>
                        </note> intend to make his Readers believe,</p>
                     <p>First, That I advised him to reade both those <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours</hi> for his better information in one and the same thing: whereas that for which I advised him to reade Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> was the justification of the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and outward <hi>form of worship</hi> in our Church; and that for which I advised him to reade Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> was to convince him that the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> had been always governed, as ours is, by <hi>Bishops.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, By what he saith he would have it be lieved also, that the thing for which I advised him to reade the aforesaid Authours, was to inform him what he was to believe concerning the lawfulness or unlawfulness of <hi>Princes</hi> being <hi>resisted</hi> by their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi> whereas in that Book of Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi>'s, which I advised him to reade, there is nothing at all of that Argument, nor in Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> neither.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He would make his Readers to believe also, that I approve of what both or either of those Two <hi>Authours</hi> hold to the prejudice of <hi>Princes;</hi> but he himself doth not; and consequently that he is a better friend to Princes than either they or I am. For if I advised him to reade <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Bilson,</hi> as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, and I confess I did, and to reade them, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, whose opinion touching the <hi>resisting of Kings</hi> by their Subjects <hi>I</hi> approved of (as he insinuates,) but <hi>He</hi> did not; he must needs imply, not onely that <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Bilson</hi> were, but that I am more for the lawfulness of <hi>Kings</hi> being <hi>resisted</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained</hi> by their <hi>Subjects,</hi> than he is: Whereas if he had intended to have dealt fairly and ingenuously,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:94113:256"/>
either with me or his Readers, he should have told them not onely that I advised him to reade <hi>Hooker</hi> and <hi>Bilson,</hi> but what Books of theirs I advised him to reade, and to what end and purpose I advised him to reade them, which was (as I said before) to reade Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> for the justifying of the <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> of our Church, and Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> for the justifying of the <hi>Government</hi> of our Church by <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> and neither of them to that end and purpose which he would have his Readers believe I did, <hi>(viz.)</hi> touching the lawfulness of the <hi>restraining and resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Kings by their Subjects;</hi> for which he saith there was more in them than he could approve of, and yet no more than I must needs be thought to approve, because I recommended the reading of them to him: and consequently that I (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) was more for <hi>restraining</hi> and <hi>resisting</hi> of Kings by their Subjects, than he was; so that by conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Books of those <hi>Authours</hi> they were, which I advised him to reade, and upon what Subject, and to what end I advised him to reade them, and, which is worse, by substituting another Subject matter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of that which I advised him to reade them for, (wholly foreign to it,) his <hi>fraudulent</hi> dealing with his Readers, as well as with me, is so <hi>apparent,</hi> that it cannot be denied, and so <hi>foul</hi> that it cannot be excused.</p>
                     <p>But supposing it had been true, that I had advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to reade both those <hi>Authours</hi> upon the same <hi>Argument,</hi> and that Argument had been concerning the <hi>restraining and resisting of Kings;</hi> yet I see no reason why he should say, that he found <hi>more in them for the restraining and resisting of Kings than He did approve.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>FOr first, as for Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> (supposing the three last Books of his <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy</hi> to be set forth without any alteration or Interpolation, as he left them, which many suspect they were not) but supposing, I say, they were all of them set forth as he left them, yet there is nothing to be found in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of them, or in any of his former Books, for the lawfulness of <hi>resisting</hi> of Kings by their Subjects in any case, or upon any provocation whatsoever: but on the contrary in the <hi>Eighth</hi> or last of those three Books of his <hi>Ecclesiastical Policy,</hi> wherein <hi>ex instituto,</hi> On set purpose, he treats of the <hi>Power of Kings</hi> in the managery both of <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical</hi>

                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Hooker<hi>'s judgment of Kingly power; whether he be King by choice,</hi>
                        </note> Affairs, though he supposeth most Kings to have been originally <hi>chosen</hi> by the <hi>People,</hi> as a Man is chosen by a Woman to be her <hi>Husband:</hi> yet as the Power of a <hi>Husband</hi> is not from the <hi>Woman</hi> that chuseth him, but from <hi>God;</hi> so the <hi>Kingly Power</hi> is not from the <hi>People</hi> that chuse such or such a Man to be their King, but from <hi>God</hi> onely: so that as the Woman cannot take away the power of a <hi>Husband</hi> from her Husband, after he is her Husband; so the People cannot take away the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> power from their King, after he is their King.

that is a Government of Kings governing by Laws in a free and voluntary manner condescended</hi>

                        <hi>unto.</hi> And thus this Kingdom of ours of <hi>Despotical</hi> became <hi>Political,</hi> by our Kings limiting and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves by Laws of their own and their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours making, and much more by restraining themselves from making any <hi>Laws</hi> at all, but such as the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to. And this is all the restraint that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> acknowledgeth our Kings to be Subject to; and is this more than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth or can approve of? This doth not hinder the Government to be truly <hi>Monarchical,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith it is not; nor the <hi>Supremacy</hi> to be wholly in one Person, both as to Ecclesiastical and secular affairs, as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> saith it is, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith it is not.

                     <p>And first he tells us, <hi>That this is an hereditary</hi>

                        </note> is not this more in favour of such <hi>Kings</hi> as ours is, than you approve? I am sure it is more than you did approve, when (as you tell us in your <hi>Holy-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth)</hi> you were bound to submit to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government,</hi> as set over us by God, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <note place="margin">
                           <hi>pag.</hi> 184.</note> for Conscience sake, and to behave your self as a <hi>loyal Subject</hi> towards them. But what was that <hi>present Government?</hi> It must be one or other of those Governments betwixt the late King's <hi>Murther</hi> and his Son's <hi>Restauration,</hi> which in Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were all of them <hi>

                     <p>Again, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> might find more in Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Of the King's Supremacy.</note> than he could approve or had approved, for limiting the descent of the <hi>supreme Power</hi> here with us, to the next in bloud, or the <hi>right Heir,</hi>
                        <pb n="473" facs="tcp:94113:258"/>
without exception: so in regard of the <hi>supreme Power</hi> itself as it is vested in our King, he might find more in Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> than he did approve, not for the <hi>restraint</hi> but <hi>extent</hi> of it, and that in regard both of <hi>persons</hi> and of <hi>things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And first of <hi>Persons:</hi> For Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> speaking of our King's <hi>Supremacy,</hi> saith, that <q>thereby it is <note place="margin">Over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> intended and meant to exclude partly foreign Powers, and partly the Power which belongeth in several unto others, contained as parts in that politick Body over which the King hath Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;</q> in and by which words, all <hi>Persons,</hi> as well within as without the Kingdom, are excluded from having any part in the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> or supreme Power here in <hi>England;</hi> None <hi>without</hi> the Kingdom having any thing to doe with it, and All <hi>within</hi> the Kingdom being subject to it. And this is the true interpretation of the <hi>Oath of Supremacy;</hi> whereby (as I have proved before) the King is acknowledged to be the <hi>onely</hi> supreme Governour <hi>in</hi> as well as <hi>of</hi> this Kingdom, and by consequence exclusively not onely in relation to any that do pretend from <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,</hi> but also from any that may pretend <hi>at home</hi> to have any part <hi>in</hi> or <hi>of</hi> the <hi>Supremacy</hi> with him. Whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will have the <hi>Oath of Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>This again more than Mr.</hi> B. <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves.</hi>
                        </note> to be understood as intending <hi>onely</hi> to exclude <hi>foreign</hi> Pretenders to any Supremacy here, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Successours; but not to exclude some that are at home, namely the <hi>Parliament</hi> from having a part of it. So that in respect (I mean in respect of the extent) of the <hi>King's Supremacy</hi> over <hi>all Persons</hi> in all capacities, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> might find more in Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> than he could approve of <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>King's Supremacy over all Persons</hi> in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:94113:259"/>
and consequently his being the <hi>onely Supreme Governour</hi> being utterly inconsistent with the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> betwixt the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upon which he grounds his defence of the late <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and lays a foundation of the like Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Generation to Generation for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AS for Bishop <hi>BILSON</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith I advised him to reade, I confess I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say <hi>He</hi> hath nothing for the <hi>resisting of Kings</hi> by their Subjects in any of his Books; but this I can say, that he hath nothing to that purpose in that Book of his which I advised Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to reade;
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:94113:260"/>
no, nor in any of his Books hath he so much for <hi>resisting of Kings,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself in his Book of the <hi>Holy Commonwealth.</hi> And therefore I wonder he should say he found <hi>more in BILSON, for the resisting and restraining of Kings than he could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> was one of my Predecessours in <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bishop</hi> Bilson <hi>in an errour about resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
                        </note> the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and much more before me in Learning than he was in Time: but <hi>Bernardus non vidit omnia,</hi> and the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedst and best of Men are but Men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may err; and good men, very good men, may be the apter to fall into some kind of errours, both <hi>speculatively</hi> and <hi>practically,</hi> by indulging too much even to their good affections. And therefore <note place="margin">The ground of his errour.</note> I believe it was his <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>true Religion,</hi> and his <hi>compassion</hi> to those that were <hi>persecuted</hi> for it, that made this Learned and Good Man say so much as he doth (which is more than I wish he had) in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of taking up of Arms by the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Scotch Protestants</hi> in defence of themselves and their Religion, against their several respective Princes. And I think we ought to believe that it was for the same reason (and not for reason of State one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did at the same time assist with Men, Money and Arms, all the aforesaid <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> against their aforesaid <hi>Sovereigns.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But yet, for all that, I do not think that either <note place="margin">The censure of it.</note> the <hi>Queen</hi> did well in doing what she did, or that the <hi>Bishop</hi> did well in writing what he writ in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of them; because I do not think they themselves, I mean the subjects of those Princes, did well in making that resistance, which they did, contrary to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and to the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:94113:261"/>
                        <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Christians.</hi> And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that upon this consideration, during the time of our own troubles, I have often thought, and <note place="margin">A Remark upon our late Rebellion.</note> sometimes said to some of my familiar friends, that I was afraid that God had permitted the Peoples ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing up in <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> here, because the Crown had assisted, and so eminent a Church-man had excused the rising up of other Princes Subjects in Rebellion against them abroad. For though ours had not really the same provocation to rebell, as the Subjects of those Princes had <hi>(viz.)</hi> of being <hi>persecuted</hi> and oppressed for Conscience sake, and for professing the <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as they were; yet they pretended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be so, and so may Subjects of any <hi>Prince,</hi> or of any <hi>Religion,</hi> at any time, and whether truly or falsely it is all one, as to the endangering of the publick Peace and Welfare of all Kingdoms and States: which will be always in danger of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> if but in any one case onely it be allowed to be lawfull for <hi>Subjects</hi> to <hi>resist</hi> those that have the <hi>supreme Power;</hi> and of a <hi>foreign War</hi> also, if the Rebellious Subjects of one Prince or State may be lawfully assisted by another State or Prince, because they are of the same <hi>Religion,</hi> whether the true one or a false, (as I said before) it makes no matter: <note place="margin">Religion, true or false, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirits men alike.</note> for it is not the trueness of any Religion, but Mens believing it to be the true, and onely <hi>true Religion,</hi> that makes men think they are obliged in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to contend for it, as appears by some Mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as zealous for the maintaining and propagating of <hi>Judaism,</hi> and <hi>Mahometanism,</hi> as others are for <hi>Christianity;</hi> and amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> so many of them being as zealous, and perhaps more zealous
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:94113:261"/>
for <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> than others are for <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Orthodoxy:</hi> And we see the <hi>Papists</hi> have their <hi>Confessours</hi> and their <hi>Martyrs</hi> as well as <hi>Protestants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore if a <hi>Protestant King</hi> may assist <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Not safe, nor lawfull for one Prince to assist ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Rebel-Subjects.</note> 
                        <hi>Rebels</hi> against their <hi>Popish Kings,</hi> because they are of his (which he believes to be the onely true) Religion: why may not a <hi>Popish King</hi> for the very same reason assist <hi>Popish Rebels</hi> against their <hi>Protestant Kings,</hi> because he believes the <hi>Popish</hi> to be the onely true Religion also? and consequently as long as there are diversities of <hi>Religion</hi> in the World (as there will be till the Worlds end) there will be no security of <hi>Peace</hi> or safety at home or from abroad, either for King or Subjects. The great and good God therefore, who is the <hi>Authour of Peace, and lover of Concord,</hi> as he will not have Subjects to resist their Princes, so he will not have one Prince to assist another Prince's Subjects in their Rebellion against him, in any case, or upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatsoever.

                     <p>What shall we say then? Are we not to help those that are persecuted for the professing of our

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Bishop charged with helping to bring Mr.</hi> B. <hi>and his party under. By his party he means not the Presbyterians, but all the Nonconformists.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MR. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Preface to his Book of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> addressing himself to the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and me, saith, <hi>You have above all men I know effectually helped to bring us under:</hi> but whom he means by <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> or what he means by <hi>bringing them under,</hi> he doth not tell us, nor how We have done it <hi>effectually</hi> or <hi>more effectually than any he knows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</hi> But sure it is some heinous crime or other (at least in his opinion) that he intends to charge us with. And therefore he should have done well to have expressed more fully and clearly, what he meant by it: But seeing it hath not pleased him to do so, we must guess at his meaning as well as we can, both in regard of the <hi>Thing</hi> he saith We have done, and of the <hi>Persons</hi> We have done it unto.</p>
                     <p>And first for the <hi>Persons,</hi> whom he means by <note place="margin">Whom he means by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</note> 
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> I should have thought he had meant the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> but that by <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> must be meant some, of whom he himself is one, and he hath not onely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his being a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but takes it for an injurious and scandalous expression of an <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Indignation</hi> against him, to be said to be the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesignanus,</hi> or Standard-bearer of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> being no <hi>Presbyterian</hi> himself, and therefore could <note place="margin">He disowns himself to be a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</note> not be their <hi>Antesignanus,</hi> or not theirs onely. But why might not he be a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> then, when I
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:94113:263"/>
thought he was so, though he was not so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, nor be not now? For sure he hath not been <hi>semper idem,</hi> Always of the same O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. Time was when he was an <hi>Episcopari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> or he would not have been ordained by a <hi>Bishop</hi> (as he saith he was) nor would not have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to what he did; And yet whatsoever it is that he is for now, I am sure it is not <hi>Episcopacy</hi> in the controverted Notion and sense of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his disclaiming his being a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> now, doth not prove he was not so then when I thought he was. But supposing I was mistaken in thinking <note place="margin">And takes it for an affront to be thought so.</note> him to be a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> I know not why he should take it as an affront to be thought to be so: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidently and confessedly a <hi>Dissenter</hi> from the Government, and publick way of Worship, as it is established by Law in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> I thought it was more for his Honour to be thought and treated with as a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> than as one of any other of the more novel and more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Sects;</hi> which though they all of them have <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> for their Mother, yet they had not all of them <hi>Calvin</hi> for their Father, but are the bastard issue of unknown Sires.</p>
                     <p>Besides I had reason to think that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Why called their</hi> Antesig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanus.</note> was of the same persuasion that his <hi>Commilitones,</hi> his Fellow-Souldiers, in the Dispute at the <hi>Savoy</hi> were, who were always taken for <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and did not take it for a Reproach, but rather for an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be thought to be so. And if it be honourable to be of such, or such a party, it is much more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be the <hi>Antesignanus,</hi> or leader of such a party.</p>
                     <p>And therefore thinking as I did, for the reasons aforesaid, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to be a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:94113:263"/>
hearing he had been a <hi>Souldier</hi> in the late War, and having observed how he had behaved himself as a <hi>Leader</hi> in the aforesaid Dispute at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> I thought I could not call him a more proper name in relation to <hi>both</hi> his <hi>Professions,</hi> I mean that of a Warriour, and that of a Disputer, than that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesignanus,</hi> a Standard-bearer.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps I may be mistaken all this while in thinking Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> takes it ill to be called either <hi>Antesignanus,</hi> or <hi>Antesignanus Presbyterianorum:</hi> Whereas it is his being called <hi>Antesignanus</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> onely, and not of the other <hi>Sects</hi> as well as of that, which offends; it being a diminution of his just Title to be the <hi>Antesignanus</hi> but of one <hi>Sect</hi> onely, whereas he undertakes the defence of all the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> so far forth at least as they refuse to conform to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> how much soever they may differ among themselves; as appears by the <hi>Title page</hi> of one of his last Books, published last Year, but written (as he saith) many Years before, and called, <hi>An Apology for the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists Ministry, containing their Reasons for their Preaching, and an Answer to the Accusations urged as Reasons for the silencing about</hi> 2000 <hi>by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> Morley, <hi>Dr.</hi> Saywell, <hi>Mr.</hi> Durell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From which Title of that Book of his, it is manifest that <note place="margin">

                        </note> he owns himself an <hi>Apologist</hi> for all the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi> at least for all their <hi>Preachers,</hi> and especially for all those that were <hi>silenced,</hi> which were all that had been <hi>Preachers</hi> before, (of what <hi>Sect</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination soever,) which would not subscribe and submit to the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> after the King's Restauration.

                        <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents:</hi> for all these were <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> and every of these <hi>Sects</hi> had their <hi>Preachers,</hi> who were all of them equally silenced by the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity;</hi> and therefore must be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongst those for whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth himself to be an <hi>Apologist;</hi> and indeed if they be not, I think he will hardly make up one of his 2000 <hi>silenced Preachers.</hi> If he say that in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid <hi>Title</hi> to that Book of his, it is the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists Ministry,</hi> or the Ministers of the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What his Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are.</note> that he pleads for; I demand whether by the <hi>Ministry</hi> he means onely such as have an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Call</hi> by publick Authority to the Work of the Ministry, or to the teaching of others; whether that calling be by the <hi>Episcopal</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian</hi> way of Ordination?

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>How Mr.</hi> B. <hi>and his party have been brought under, and how they brought in the King.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE are therefore now in the second place to guess as well as we can, at what he means <note place="margin">What he means by bringing them under.</note> by <hi>bringing</hi> him and the rest of the <hi>Nonconformists <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder.</hi> There is none of them, I believe, but would be <hi>uppermost</hi> if they could; for <hi>Pride</hi> is inseparable from <hi>Schism,</hi> and it is the downfall of Pride to be brought <hi>under.</hi> The Two chief Sects of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> have had their turns in being uppermost; the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> whilst the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> whilst the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> had the power: of which two <hi>Sects</hi> it may be said, as it <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Independents and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians like</hi> Caesar <hi>and</hi> Pompey.</note> was of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey;</hi> the one, to wit, the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,</hi> like <hi>Caesar,</hi> could not <hi>ferre priorem,</hi> could endure none to be <hi>above</hi> them; and the other, to wit, the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> like <hi>Pompey,</hi> could not
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:94113:265"/>
                        <hi>ferre parem,</hi> must needs have all to be <hi>under</hi> them; and therefore each of them having been <hi>uppermost</hi> before, they must needs be very angry with all those who have helped to bring them both <hi>under,</hi> after they had domineered so long as they had done. And of those that have helped to bring them under, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Me,</hi> that We two, of all men he knows, have been the chief.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>under whom,</hi> or <hi>under what</hi> is it that We have helped to bring them? Sure it must be under some Person, or some Thing, that they would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have been brought under; otherwise they would not have been angry with us, or complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of us for so doing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder whom</hi> is it therefore that We have helped <note place="margin">
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder whom they are brought,</hi> viz. <hi>the King.</hi>
                        </note> to bring them? Is it not He under whom they ought always to have been under, namely, the <hi>KING,</hi> their natural <hi>Liege-Lord</hi> and <hi>Sovereign?</hi> But they had brought his <hi>Father</hi> under them, and therefore were the more unwilling to be brought under his <hi>Son,</hi> for fear he might remember and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge what they had done unto his Father. And though they have found the contrary (to the praise of his incomparable <hi>Clemency</hi> be it spoken) yet (such is their <hi>Ingratitude)</hi> they seem to be as weary of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the <hi>Son,</hi> as they and their Predecessours were of being under the <hi>Father;</hi> as appears by their taking the same ways, and using the same Arts to dissaffect and stir up the People against the one, as their Predecessours had done formerly against the other. But I hope, though <hi>the People now rage so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, and some of the Rulers take Counsel together against the Lord, and against his Anointed,</hi> yet that which they <hi>imagine</hi> (namely, <hi>to break the bands of
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:94113:265"/>
their Allegiance asunder, and to cast away the cords thereof from them)</hi> will prove but <hi>a vain thing;</hi> for <hi>he that sitteth in Heaven shall laugh them to scorn, the Lord shall have them in derision;</hi> and will <hi>keep up</hi> him, whom he hath set up over us and them too, and will <hi>bring down</hi> those (how many and how mighty soever they may seem to be) that shall dare to rise up against him.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> will say, that he and his <note place="margin">
                           <hi>How Mr.</hi> B. <hi>and his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty brought in the King.</hi>
                        </note> Party, for whom he doth apologize, are so far from being concerned in what I have said, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>under the King,</hi> that they were the Men that <hi>brought in the King</hi> to reign over them, and us too; and that if it had not been for them he had never been brought home as he was. The former clause of which saying of theirs I utterly deny; for they kept him <hi>out</hi> as long as they could, and would have done so for ever if they could have established any other Government; but that if it had not been for them he had not come home as he did, is true <hi>in one sense,</hi> that is, he had not come home from having been banished, and forced to live abroad so many Years together, which they were indeed the cause of; but <hi>in another sense,</hi> namely, that he came home as he did without any capitulations or conditions of restraint put upon him, They, I mean the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> were so far from being the cause of, that they did what they could to hinder it; and I could name the place where a <hi>Consultation</hi> was held by the Grandees of the Faction, to oblige him, before he came home, to consent to those very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions which were made by the <hi>Parliament Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> to his Father at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> which would have lest him but the Name of a King onely;
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:94113:266"/>
but the <hi>curst Cow</hi> had <hi>short horns;</hi> the <hi>Army</hi> was in better hands than it had been; and he that was Commander in chief of it, having purged out all that would not comply with his loyal Intention to bring in the King <hi>as a King,</hi> he frustrated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of those that would have brought him in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled, or not have brought him in at all; which were all the <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> and especially those of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party, who though they did not, because they could not hinder the <hi>King's Restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in that manner he was restored, nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their being brought under him, so far as to own and acknowledge him to be their King, by taking a <hi>pardon</hi> from him for what they had done against his Father and himself; yet they do not, nor will not own him as all <hi>Subjects</hi> ought, and as all <hi>good Subjects</hi> do own their <hi>Kings,</hi> by obeying their <hi>Laws.</hi> And perhaps, that which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> means by the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi>'s and my helping to bring him and his Party <hi>under,</hi> is the bringing of them under the obedience of the <hi>King's Laws,</hi> by silencing such as will not obey them.</p>
                     <p>What the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> hath done in that kind I know not; but this I am sure, that neither he <note place="margin">An account of Ministers si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced by the Bishop.</note> nor I could have obeyed the Laws our selves, if we had not <hi>silenced</hi> those Preachers that would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to what they were enjoyned by Law; and which if they refused, We that were Bishops were enjoyned by Law to silence them as we did, how few or how many soever they were of them; though I verily believe they were not half the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> speaks of. In the Diocese of <hi>Worces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whilst I was Bishop there, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was the onely man whom I silenced; and since
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:94113:266"/>
I was Bp. of <hi>Winchester,</hi> which is now above 20 Years, I do not think the <hi>Nonconforming Ministers</hi> I have si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced have been half so many, I mean half so many men silenced as there have been years since; which I do not say to ingratiate my self with the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Party,</hi> as if I would not have silenced more if there had been more to silence; that is, if there had been more in possession of any Benefice or Cure of Souls in that <hi>Diocese,</hi> who refused to conform to all, that by the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> they were enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conform unto: but I say it, to shew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of the silencing 2000 in all, when there were so few silenced in that Diocese of <hi>Winchester;</hi> which is none of the least, though there be some greater.</p>
                     <p>Besides, I presume Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> means by his 2000, <note place="margin">Intruders as well as Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conforming Ministers put out.</note> not onely such as were put out of their Livings or Cures, for refusing to conform, or for their <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> onely; but such as likewise were put out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were <hi>Intruders</hi> into other mens Livings (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself was) and consequently were by Law compellable to yield possession to the right owners that were then living, who perhaps were some Hundreds of those Thousands. I am sure all We of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> that were abroad with the King, and all those that were at home, and had been put out, because they would not take the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till after the King's and the Church's Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by being restored to what was our own before, must needs dispossess many of those whom Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> would have thought to have been put out for <hi>Inconformity</hi> onely.</p>
                     <p>But supposing all that were put out or silenced, had been put out and silenced for <hi>Nonconformity</hi> onely;
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:94113:267"/>
and supposing too that there were 2000 of them; yet how the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>I</hi> did more to the bringing so many of them under that penalty than other <hi>Bishops</hi> did, or than all Bishops were bound to do, I do not understand; unless he means that We did it more <hi>effectually</hi> than any other of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops did; which is to cast an imputation of Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence at the breach of the Law in favour of the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi> upon all the rest of our Order, which I think none of them will own as a favour from him. For my own part, as I did willingly consent to the making of that Law, (I mean the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)</hi> so I did as willingly put it in execution, where I was obliged to do so; as believing it not onely to be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equitable,</hi> but in an high degree <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> if not absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> also.</p>

it for a very great Mercy and Favour from God and the King, that they had onely the <hi>Liberty</hi> and opportunity of doing more mischief taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, when their <hi>Lives</hi> might most justly have been taken away for the mischief they had done before.

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:94113:270"/>
generally thought to be as conscientious as any of them (namely, Bp. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Connant)</hi> did; <note place="margin">Some have conformed.</note> as perhaps many other <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>conscientious</hi> men did also. But they were not one of an hundred, will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> say, in comparison of those that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Why the rest did not; whether for Conscience, as Mr.</hi> B. <hi>saith.</hi>
                        </note> did not, nor could not <hi>conform:</hi> True, I confess, as to those that <hi>did not,</hi> but whether all that did not, <hi>could not,</hi> is a thing, with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s good leave, may be doubted, whatsoever he hath said to the contrary; as when he saith, that to think any that do not <hi>conform,</hi> would not conform, if they could with a good Conscience, is to think them all to be <hi>Fools</hi> or <hi>mad Men,</hi> for preferring Poverty before Plenty, Want before Wealth, Contempt before Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Respect, and Imprisonment before Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which no man in his Wits either would, or ought to do, if he might chuse whether he would so or no without sin. And therefore Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks we must needs grant it is nothing but fear of sinning against God that makes the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi> not that they <hi>will not,</hi> but that they <hi>dare not</hi> conform to what the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> as well as of the <hi>Church</hi> require of them.</p>
                     <p>As if all the <hi>Nonconforming Ministers</hi> that were put out of the Livings they were in, or that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Inconformity are uncapable of any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment in the Church, are therefore all of them <hi>men of Conscience,</hi> and that whatsoever they ought to doe and will not, or will doe and ought not, it is <hi>for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> or for Conscience sake onely, or for fear of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against God if they did what they doe not, or did not what they doe; that is, if either they did <hi>conform</hi> when they are commanded, or did not <hi>preach</hi> when they are forbidden. But is there, or can there be no
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:94113:271"/>
other cause of their not doing what they should doe, and their doing what they should not doe, but <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> onely? May it not be <hi>peevishness</hi> in some, and <hi>perverseness</hi> in others? May it not be <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> in the <hi>Leaders,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> in those that are led by them?</p>
                     <p>I remember, that when Bishop <hi>Brownrig</hi> (who is one of the few Bishops that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> vouchsafes to <note place="margin">

                        </note> speak well of) and I went together to the <hi>Treaty</hi> with the late King at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> he being one of the Three <hi>Divines</hi> named by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and I one of the Three named by the <hi>King,</hi> (though very unworthy I confess to be so,) when that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bishop (I say) and I went together in his Coach towards the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> (I remember not now upon what occasion it was, but) I remember very well that I ask'd his Lordship whether he knew Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> and he answered me he did, and had known him from his first coming to <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Pray, <hi>my Lord,</hi> said I, was he always a <hi>Nonconformist?</hi> No, said he, far from it in his practice, as well as in his judgment, even untill the beginning of these times. How came he then, said I, to be so suddenly, and so strangely changed from what he was? Why said the Bishop, he saw the Tide was turning, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a good opinion of his own parts, he thought if he was one of the foremost in coming in, he might be one of the foremost, if not the foremost of all the Leaders of the whole Party, as you see (said he) he is: adding that the hope to be head of a Faction was a powerfull Temptation. And why might not the same Temptation prevail with many others, that thought as well of themselves as Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> did, and consequently might have the same hopes that he had.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="499" facs="tcp:94113:271"/>
But why then (may it be said) did not the same <note place="margin">A probable reason why some refused offers of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,</note> men, when the Tide turned again, at the King's coming home, turn with it; especially such of them as were invited by the offer of considerable <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> if by <hi>conforming</hi> they would make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves capable of them? I answer that some of them did so; and that those that did not, might be kept from doing it for fear of losing the <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> they had gotten in the <hi>Nonconforming Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> which though it were down for the present, yet it might, they thought, get up again, as it had done formerly, when it was lower than it was then. In the mean time, some of those few that had such <hi>Offers</hi> made them, and finally refused them, took time to deliberate whether they should refuse them or no: thereby plainly shewing that they were not then fully resolved in point of <hi>Conscience,</hi> that a man might not either be a <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Dean</hi> of a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral</hi> without sin, though they had formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and covenanted against both. Neither did their finally refusing of them prove the contrary: for though they might, and did, think it lawfull to accept of those offers, and consequently lawfull to <hi>conform</hi> to the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in order to their being capable of them, yet they might, (as I said <note place="margin">To wit, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their party.</note> before) so value the <hi>Interest</hi> they had in their <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> (which as they knew they should lose by <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting,</hi> so they knew they should improve by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing</hi> those Offers,) that for that very reason onely they did finally refuse to accept of them; but not till they had made their advantage of such offers having been made unto them; namely, the indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves by so much the more unto their <hi>Party,</hi> by how much the more they might have
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:94113:272"/>
had, if they would have gone off from them: which being made known to those that were their <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> as it could not chuse but make them the more beloved and esteemed; so it could not chuse but make them to be more liberally and largely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and maintained also, that they might not be altogether losers by the refusals of such Offers. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> made any such advantage of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal of the Bishoprick of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> or no, I know not; but this I am sure of, that at a meeting betwixt him and others of his Party, with Bishop <hi>Henchman,</hi> me, and others of our Party, at a Booksellers Shop in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, Mr. <hi>Calamy</hi> sitting next to me, did whisperingly ask me what the Bishoprick of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> was worth yearly, I told him it was commonly valued at 1500 <hi>l. per annum;</hi> whereunto he replied nothing, but that he thought it had not been worth so much. Why he asked me this question, and whether he made use of my answer in order to the improving the Interest he had before in his own <hi>Party,</hi> either in point of <hi>Credit</hi> or <hi>Profit,</hi> let others guess; but that he asked me such a question, and that I gave him such an answer, I averr <hi>verbo Sacerdotis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereunto I might add, that many would have <hi>conformed</hi> that did not, especially many of those <note place="margin">Many stood out, in hopes of a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that were beneficed in the <hi>Country,</hi> if they had not been made believe by the <hi>Grandees</hi> of their Party in the <hi>City,</hi> that there would be shortly a <hi>Toleration</hi> granted upon easier terms than those required by the Act of <hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> if doing what they doe out of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> or because they are obliged in Conscience to doe so, be a sufficient <hi>Plea</hi> to justifie the <hi>Dissenting Ministers</hi> in transgressing of the <hi>Law,</hi> why should it not justifie the <hi>Popish Priests</hi> for transgressing of it also?

Minister</hi> without <hi>degrading</hi> him also? Yea, and without taking away any thing that is essential to his Office?

make use of it, though he have done or may doe never so much hurt by the exercise of it: <hi>because he will be guilty of Sacrilege</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter) if he do not, and of the highest degree of Sacrilege that can be, it being much more sacrilegious</hi> (saith he) <hi>to alienate consecrated Persons than consecrated Things from the Service of God.</hi> And for proof thereof he tells us, <hi>That our Canons enquire after all such as alienate themselves from the Ministry to which they were ordained, and turn to other Callings;</hi> adding, <hi>We dislike not that Canon, but we wish our observance of it might be thought but a pardonable fault.</hi> As if this <hi>Canon</hi> which forbids men to quit their <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Calling,</hi> and to betake themselves to any other <hi>Lay Profession,</hi> did oblige all those that are <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> or have been <hi>ordained</hi> to be <hi>Ministers,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the exercise of their Ministerial Function, though by lawfull Authority, and for never so just cause they are forbidden to doe so: because forsooth he will be guilty of <hi>Sacrilege</hi> if he do not: so that he that is once <hi>ordained,</hi> and thereby <hi>consecrated</hi> to serve God in the <hi>Ministry,</hi> though he be never so <hi>heretical,</hi> or <hi>schismatical,</hi> or <hi>fanatical</hi> in point of <hi>Opinion;</hi> or never so <hi>factious,</hi> or <hi>seditious,</hi> or <hi>rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious,</hi> or <hi>lewd,</hi> or <hi>debauched</hi> in point of <hi>Practice,</hi> he must not be forbidden to doe the work he was <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> to doe: or if he be forbidden, he must not forbear to doe it notwithstanding, <hi>because it will be the highest degree of Sacrilege, except Apostasie it</hi>

Argument also, which is a deduction from several Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> obliging those that have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">From scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authority.</note> them the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to be <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>faithfull,</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> in the <hi>preaching</hi> of it.

                     <p n="4">IV. But his <hi>fourth</hi> main Reason (as he calls it, <note place="margin">

                        </note> why those he pleads for must <hi>preach,</hi> though they be <hi>forbidden)</hi> is a <hi>main</hi> one indeed (if it were a true one,) namely, <hi>That they should sin against the Law of Nature it self, nay even the great radical Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so far as to be guilty of the murthering of mens Souls, if they did not preach though they be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> by what Authority or for what cause soever: for so he must mean, or else he saith nothing to the purpose, and if he means so, he condemns the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> for forbidding so many <hi>hundreds</hi> or <hi>thousands</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith are <hi>silenced,</hi> because they will not <hi>conform,)</hi> and consequently for doing
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:94113:275"/>
what they can to make so many <hi>hundreds</hi> and <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands</hi> to sin against the <hi>radical Law of Nature,</hi> and to be guilty of <hi>murthering</hi> God knows how many Mens Souls.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may say, are but Men, and Men that may err in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what God hath forbidden, and in forbidding what God hath commanded, as they do (saith he) in this particular, and are not therefore to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not and professed they would not obey the <hi>High Priest</hi> and the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> when they did forbid them to <hi>preach</hi> any more in the name of <hi>Christ;</hi> the like, saith he, the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Orthodox Christians</hi> did, though the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> Emperours forbad them to doe so.</p>
                     <p>But is there the same Reason, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or the <note place="margin">No such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of preaching now, as in the primitive times.</note> same necessity for your <hi>preaching</hi> now (supposing you would preach nothing but what you should preach) as there was for their preaching then; when <hi>Paganism</hi> had taken and kept possession of the World for 4000 years together, and <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> was to be planted instead of it, when the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest</hi> was so very great, and the <hi>Labourers</hi> so very few? Whereas <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Orthodox Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> (as you your self witness) is (thanks be to God for it) already planted here; and though every <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> be not so well provided for, either with <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi> for a Minister, or with so able a <hi>Minister</hi> as I wish they were, and hope they will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need of your assistance; yet there is none, or very few, if any, but such as can reade <hi>divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> wherein are all <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Psalms</hi> read once a month, and all the rest of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> once a year, and the <hi>Creed</hi> and the <hi>Decalogue</hi> twice or
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:94113:276"/>
thrice a week, besides the teaching of the <hi>Church-Catechism,</hi> wherein is the Churches own Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> the <hi>Lords-Prayer,</hi> and of the Nature, Use and Ends of both the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> together with how we are to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the receiving of them, and the benefits we are to receive with them and by them. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whether this, (if there were no more than this) be not enough, by God's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon it, for the conversion and saving of Souls? But over and besides all this, there are, or may be, <note place="margin">The Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended for excellent Sermons.</note> without their help, as good <hi>Sermons,</hi> as any they can make, read or preached, every <hi>Sunday,</hi> even by those that cannot make Sermons themselves; and <hi>Sermons</hi> upon such Subjects, or Heads, or Common places, as are most <hi>fundamental,</hi> and most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and profitable for the People to be instructed in, both for their <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> in order to the making of them good <hi>Men,</hi> good <hi>Christians,</hi> good <hi>Subjects,</hi> and every way such as they ought to be in all their Relations; and that in so plain, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, and so familiar a way of Expression, as that none that have any degree of common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but may understand them; and if it be not their own fault, be edified by them. And all this without any danger of being led into any <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal</hi> or <hi>practical</hi> Errour, without being in danger of being made <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> by hearing of them. This being the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar excellency of those <hi>Sermons,</hi> I mean the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> above all other <hi>Sermons,</hi> that all men may be edified and made better, and no man can be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted or made worse by them; for they are all of them <hi>clean corn,</hi> without any mixture either of

                        <hi>tares,</hi> or of <hi>chaff,</hi> either of noxious and hurtfull, or of vain and unprofitable Ingredients with it; which no man can be sure of from any other <hi>Sermons</hi> but these, or such as these are onely; which can have nothing of the <hi>frailty,</hi> nor the <hi>folly,</hi> or the <hi>malice</hi> of him that delivers them in them: which all other <hi>Sermons</hi> of every Man's own Composition have, or may have in a greater or less degree, and none had in a greater, than those that were preached in the late times by them, whose preaching again Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth so earnestly plead for.</p>
                     <p>But the reading of a <hi>Homily,</hi> will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> say, is not <hi>preaching,</hi> or if it may be called <hi>preaching,</hi> it <note place="margin">The efficacy of those Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> is such kind of preaching as hath no <hi>Life</hi> nor Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in it to work upon Mens Minds and Affections that hear it: Not so much perhaps, Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as if it were delivered <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> by word of Mouth, by him that was the Composer of it: but to say it hath not, nor cannot have any <hi>efficacy</hi> at all, is <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus sermo,</hi> a very hard saying, and such as doth not consist with their own practice; I mean their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions,</hi> which they seem to think to be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary after a <hi>Sermon,</hi> as <hi>contracting</hi> or <hi>betrothing</hi> before <hi>Marriage.</hi> And do they think those <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">An Argument drawn from their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of Sermons.</note> of other mens <hi>Sermons</hi> to be of no <hi>Efficacy</hi> to make them that hear them the better for them? If they do think so, why do they place so much of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the use of them? If they do not, let them for shame grant as much efficacy to the repetition of the <hi>Church Sermons,</hi> (I mean the <hi>Homilies)</hi> or if not to the repetition of them, yet at least to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the <hi>Prophets Sermons</hi> in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> in the <hi>New,</hi> as they do to the repetition of those <hi>Sermons</hi> that are
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:94113:277"/>
preached by themselves; which though they may think to be better than our <hi>Homilies,</hi> yet I hope they will not prefer them before, or compare them with <hi>Christ's Sermon on the Mount,</hi> or with those Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> which were dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and are daily read or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in all and every one of our Churches, how meanly soever they are provided for otherwise.

For as <hi>for maintenance</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter) we expect not any.</hi> Speak for your self, Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> I remember the time when an eminent Man of <hi>your Party,</hi> that is, for the <hi>Parliament</hi> against the <hi>King,</hi> had more than twice as many <hi>Spiritual Cures</hi> at once, and some of them of greater value, than any <hi>conformable</hi> man hath or can have by Law: and his <hi>Apology</hi> for it in Print was, that he had but one <hi>Living</hi> of his own, and the rest he did but keep, untill good and <hi>godly Pastours</hi> could be provided for them; but he kept the <hi>Profits</hi> of them also, though he was not <hi>resident</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any one of them, no not so much as upon that which was his own, being an <hi>Intruder</hi> into the Headship of a <hi>College.</hi> I remember too when the <hi>Churches</hi> in divers great <hi>Towns,</hi> which had a great number of Souls, and but little maintenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, were wholly neglected, and the neighbouring little <hi>Villages,</hi> where the <hi>Cures</hi> were small but the <hi>Tithes</hi> were great, were seized on by the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the Faction; which was an evident proof that they valued the <hi>Fleece</hi> more than the <hi>Flock;</hi> and that they would not then, as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith they will now, serve God for nought. But
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:94113:278"/>
would not the <hi>Papists</hi> doe so also? Yes, perhaps <note place="margin">Why not to be accepted.</note> they would, will Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> say, but it would be in order to the <hi>destroying</hi> and not the <hi>edifying</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> and have we not reason to fear that their offering to preach <hi>gratis</hi> is with such a meaning and Intention also? We are sure they have done so, and we are not nor cannot be sure they will not doe so again, as long as they continue at that distance, as they do, from us.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Popish Priests</hi> being so <note place="margin">The Popish Priests under a greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of preaching.</note> persuaded, as they are, namely, that all <hi>Protestants</hi> are <hi>in a State of damnation,</hi> have a more rational pretence for the necessity of their <hi>preaching</hi> to us than our <hi>silenced Ministers</hi> have, or can have, even upon this account, that unless they doe what they can to make us <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> they are guilty of our perishing everlastingly. But I hope our <hi>silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Ministers</hi> do not think us in such a state of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as we cannot be delivered out of, but by their preaching, as the <hi>Popish Priests</hi> may and do think us to be.</p>
                     <p>But whatsoever either of them may think of the <note place="margin">Neither of them to be permitted;</note> 
                        <hi>need</hi> we have of their <hi>preaching,</hi> and consequently of their own <hi>obligation</hi> to preach, though they be forbidden; we that do believe they would doe more hurt than good by their preaching, do believe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that we are obliged in Conscience to restrain them from preaching, though there were a greater want of Preachers and preaching than there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.

onely in <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth's time, but in <hi>Queen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi>'s time also, for divers years together; yet none of the <hi>Popish Priests</hi> were suffered to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their stations, but very many <hi>Cures</hi> were supplied with men of very mean abilities, till they could be better provided for, rather than hazard a relapse into <hi>Popery</hi> by employing any that were Popishly affected in the work of the Ministry.

And such are not onely those that are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>unable</hi> to teach, or are notoriously <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> in their lives and conversations; but such as are <hi>heretical</hi> or <hi>schismatical</hi> in their opinions, such as are <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>So this being agreed on betwixt us; the next <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Ministers Mr.</hi> B. <hi>pleads for, are such as, he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, ought to be silenced.</hi>
                        </note> thing in question betwixt us is, whether those that are <hi>silenced</hi> are such as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth ought to be silenced or no; for if they be, he confesseth likewise, that no pretence of <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> can warrant their <hi>preaching,</hi> and much less oblige them to preach. For the deciding of this question therefore, whether those that are <hi>silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> are justly silenced or no; there remains one,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:94113:280"/>
and but one question more, and that is who shall judge and finally determine whether they that are silenced, be or be not such, as ought to be silenced, or restrained from preaching. Surely they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves must not be their own judges: but who must then? why, <hi>who but the Magistrate?</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Baxter) who in Church cases and religion hath</hi>

                        <hi>be not the executioner of the Clergy's sentence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or against his own conscience and judgment.</hi> Where by the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> I hope he means the <hi>supreme Magistrate;</hi> and by his <hi>judgment,</hi> he means his judgment according to <hi>Law:</hi> For the <hi>Law</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">The Law is a declaration of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but the Law, is the declaration of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>Magistrate's publick judgment,</hi> in giving whereof he neither is nor can be the executioner of any other man's sentence; but all <hi>subordinate Magistrates</hi> (whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical)</hi> are the <hi>executioners</hi> of the supreme Magistrate's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or sentence, and are no farther binding or to be obeyed than they are so.</p>
                     <p>Now that the <hi>supreme Magistrate</hi> with the advice and consent of his <hi>great Council</hi> hath given his <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> not onely who are, and who are not to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated to <hi>preach</hi> in publick or in <hi>Churches,</hi> appears <note place="margin">What kind of Preachers tolerated, what not, is there set down:</note> by the <hi>Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity;</hi> as likewise that he hath given his judgment also, that those who are not to be tolerated to preach <hi>in publick</hi> or in <hi>Churches,</hi> are not to be tolerated to preach <hi>in private,</hi> nor in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles</hi> neither, appears by those other <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> whereby such preaching is forbidden, and such penalties as are therein specified are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:94113:281"/>
upon the transgressours of them. Lastly, as those <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> are undeniable evidences who are, and who are not to be tolerated to <hi>preach</hi> either <hi>publickly</hi> or <hi>privately,</hi> according to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick judgment of the <hi>State;</hi> so the reasons why such <hi>preaching</hi> and such <hi>Preachers</hi> are prohibited <note place="margin">With the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of such restraint.</note> are declared in the <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Prefaces</hi> of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Acts:</hi> for example, the Title to one of those Acts, namely that of <hi>decimo tertio</hi> of our present King, is this, <hi>An Act for the safety and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Majesty's person and Government against treasonable and seditious practices and attempts:</hi> and in the Preface to the said Act it is said, that <hi>the Lords and Commons assembled in that Parliament deeply weighing and considering the miseries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of well nigh</hi> 20 <hi>years before his Majesty's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py return, and withall reflecting upon the causes and occasions of so great and deplorable confusions; the growth and increase of which</hi> (they say) <hi>did in a very great measure proceed from a multitude of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sermons, Pamphlets and Speeches published with a transcendent boldness, from which kind of distemper</hi> (say they) <hi>as the present age is not wholly free, so posterity may be apt to relapse into them if a timely remedy be not provided; Therefore</hi> (say they) <hi>We the Lords and Commons having duly considered the Premisses, do most humbly beseech your Majesty that it may be enacted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By which <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>preface</hi> it plainly appears, <note place="margin">A descant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> that the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> did believe, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the safety of the <hi>King's person,</hi> nor of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> could be secured, if such kind of <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> as had in the late times been the stirrers up of the People to rebellion were not

restrained from preaching for the future, unless they would give some such security as the <hi>Parliament</hi> should think fit to require, which was their renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Covenant</hi> and their subscription to the <hi>Act</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The security, which the Law requires from Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> 
                        <hi>of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> which was enacted by the <hi>King,</hi> by the advice and with the consent of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> the year following.

                     <p>But this <hi>Act</hi> not proving effectual enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the danger, for preventing whereof it was enacted, because those that were forbid to preach publickly and in <hi>Churches,</hi> did preach the same doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines in <hi>Conventicles</hi> and in corners, confirming <note place="margin">The ground of the Act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles.</note> their old, and making more and more new <hi>Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi> and being more and more followed because they were forbidden to preach in publick; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two years after this, there was another Act made by the same Authority, the <hi>Title</hi> whereof is. <hi>An Act to prevent and suppress seditious Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</hi> and the <hi>Preface</hi> or <hi>Preamble</hi> thereof is, <hi>That for the providing of farther and more speedy remedies against the growing and dangerous practices of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sectaries and other disloyal Persons, who under pretence of tender Consciences do at their meetings contrive Insurrections, as late experience hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Be it enacted,</hi> &amp;c. And then tells us <hi>first,</hi> what shall be taken for a <hi>seditious Conventicle,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles.</note> namely, any meeting or Assembly in any place

Where you see that it is the Highest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Magistrate <hi>(whom Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>will have to be judge in Church cases, and of whom he is to tolerate and countenance, and whom he is not to tolerate but to punish)</hi> it is he, I say, who by and with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and consent of his great Council of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> hath judged all such aforesaid Assemblies to be <hi>seditious Conventicles,</hi> and consequently all the <hi>Preachers</hi> in them to be <hi>seditious Preachers;</hi> and I <note place="margin">Who seditious Preachers.</note> hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not deny, because he hath granted it already, that all <hi>seditious Preachers</hi> are to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained;</hi> and if they are to be restrained, and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by those that are the proper <hi>Judges</hi> whether they ought to be restrained or no: certainly there can be no reason to <hi>excuse,</hi> and much less to <hi>justify</hi> the preaching of those that are so restrained after they are restrained, and during such their restraint; and therefore all those reasons alledged by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the aforesaid Book of his called <hi>An Apology for</hi>

                        <hi>the Nonconformist Ministers,</hi> are to no purpose as to the proving of that which they are alledged to prove, namely the obligation of those <hi>silenced Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> to preach in <hi>Conventicles,</hi> whom he pleads for though they be silenced, and silenced by those whom he confesseth to have authority to silence them, and whom he confesseth likewise to be the proper judges whether they are to be silenced or

no; and though that for which they are forbidden to preach in <hi>Conventicles</hi> is because such meetings and such preachings are <hi>seditious</hi> and dangerous as to the safety of the King's Person, as well as of his Government; which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confesseth (in a place before quoted) to be one cause why men may be justly restrained from preaching; and how they that are <hi>justly restrained from preaching</hi> can be <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to preach,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is to prove when and how he can.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, all that I can imagine Master <note place="margin">The very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles, whatever people doe there, are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious.</note> 
                        <hi>Baxter</hi> hath to say is, that though they preach in <hi>Conventicles,</hi> yet they do not preach <hi>Sedition,</hi> or any thing that may disaffect their Hearers either to the <hi>King</hi> or to the <hi>Government.</hi> But what if they that sit at the helm, and whose office and duty it is to take care <hi>nè quid detrimenti Respublica capiat,</hi> That the Commonwealth get no harm or come to no damage, do believe, and have reason to believe, that you do and will preach that in private now, which they know you have preached openly and often heretofore, and have no reason to think, but that you are the same men still that you have been always, even since the very beginning of the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> that is, such as have been always and ever will be undermining the <hi>established Government</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State?</hi> may they not, I say, that sit at the Helm, in order to the securing of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick peace of the Kingdom and safety of the King, may they not in point of <hi>justice,</hi> nay ought they not in point of <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>conscience</hi> too, upon the aforesaid consideration to forbid such <hi>meetings?</hi>
                        <pb n="522" facs="tcp:94113:284"/>
And if they may and ought to forbid them, the very <hi>Meetings</hi> themselves after they are forbidden are <hi>seditious,</hi> whatsoever they say or doe when they are met; because by the Eye of the Law they are looked upon as meeting to doe that, for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof the Law forbids them to meet.</p>
                     <p>And whereas one of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s chief reasons <note place="margin">One main reason of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them, to prevent the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Souls.</note> why they were obliged in <hi>conscience</hi> to preach though they are forbidden it, because they shall be <hi>guilty of the murthering of Souls</hi> if they do not; (the murthering of such Souls he means as might have been saved by their preaching, and do perish for want of it) one of the main reasons why the King by advice of his great Council hath forbidden them to preach, is to prevent the <hi>murthering of Souls and Bodies</hi> too by their preaching, I mean the Souls and Bodies of such as are by them and their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching disaffected to the Government both in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> and made ready and resolute to undermine and overturn both, whensoever there shall be an opportunity of so doing, which they would never have thought of, if it had not been for such <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> and such <hi>preaching.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> confesseth <hi>he incouraged many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands to ingage in the late War:</hi>

                        </note>: which if it were a <hi>Rebellion</hi> (as no doubt it was, though perhaps he did not think it to be so) was to engage them <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Souls,</hi> whether they kill'd or were kill'd, in a damnable action: And who can tell whether he and those that are principled as he is, may not even now be encouraging <hi>many thousands</hi> more to

                        <hi>see that he was mistaken in the main cause nor dared to repent of it, nor forbear to doe the same if it were to doe again in the same state of things:</hi> that is, if there were, or if there should be such a <hi>War</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>King</hi> and the two Houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> as there was then, he would encourage as many thousands as he did then to engage against the King. And hath not the King, having such fair warning given him, good reason to prevent the making of <hi>Parties</hi> by men that are thus minded; and that not for his own sake onely, nor onely for their sakes, that may be endangered in their bodies and their goods for adhering to him, but even for their sakes also, who may by such <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> be persuaded and encouraged to <hi>rebell</hi> against him, and consequently not onely to a hazard of the loss of their <hi>lives,</hi> but to a certainty of the loss of their <hi>Souls</hi> without repentance, which is hardly to be hoped for those that dye in an <hi>Act of sin,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially so great as that of <hi>Rebellion?</hi> And therefore for this reason onely, if there were no other, those that are <hi>silenced,</hi> ought not to <hi>preach</hi> for fear of <hi>murthering of Souls</hi> by their preaching: which is all I have to say to this particular, and which if it be not enough, I hope one or other of those my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brethren, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> to whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> addresseth his <hi>Plea</hi> for the liberty of the <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> to preach notwithstanding their being silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Act of Parliament, will more fully and more at large examine and confute that <hi>Treatise</hi> of

                     </argument>
                     <p>AND now I am come at last to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the last of those <hi>injurious Reflexions,</hi> which in the beginning of this Book I observed to have been made upon me by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and for the confutation of which I principally intended all that I have written; though many other things (which I thought not of at first) occasionally fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, have made that which I meant should be but a small <hi>Tract</hi> to swell into a large <hi>Volume;</hi> but now I am in, and have gone so far, I must go through with it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Reflexion</hi> therefore which I am now to speak of, is in Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Answer to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Sermon towards the end of it; the words are these: <hi>I must say, that when some Prelates made it their great business to silence, shame and ruine us, and drive</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The words of the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion.</note> 
                        <hi>us far enough from persons of power, undertaking to preserve the Protestant Religion better without us than with us, and after all cry out themselves that we are in danger of Popery, by their own Pupils and Disciples whose instruction they undertook, men will

have leave to think of this awake, and to judge of Causes by Effects.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These, I say, are the words of that Reflexion, which I complain of as <hi>intentionally</hi> aimed at me (though <hi>obliquely</hi> and by circumlocution onely) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in the latter part of it. For as for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">The Bishop not peculiarly concern'd in the former part of those words.</note> part of that saying of his, where he speaks of <hi>some Prelates that made it their great business to silence, shame and ruine them,</hi> that is, him and the rest of the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> though I doubt not but he means <hi>me</hi> for one of those <hi>Prelates,</hi> and one of the chief of them, because he tells me and the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> in plain terms, that <hi>we two of all he knows have effectually helped to bring them under;</hi> yet I do not take my self to be <hi>peculiarly</hi> concern'd in this whether it be truly or falsly averr'd by him; and therefore though I could tell him and tell him truly, and prove it too, that I never made it any of my business to <hi>shame</hi> or <hi>ruine</hi> him or any of the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> or to <hi>silence</hi> any more of them than by <hi>Law</hi> I was not onely allowed but obliged to silence; though I could say this (I say) and more too to prove that I never did any the least injury to any of them, but have shewed kindness to some that had dealt hardly with me, namely to Mr. <hi>Langley</hi> of <hi>Pembroke</hi> College, who having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into my Canonry of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> never allowed me one penny out of it during above 12 years I was abroad, nor after I came home made me any recompence: yet thinking I was one would doe good for evil, he had the confidence to write to me, and to intreat me to befriend him for the renewing
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:94113:287"/>
of a Lease he held of <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, as being their Visitor I did it for him. Though, I say, I could make proof of this, yet I will not insist upon it; that which I except against is a false and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflexion upon me <hi>particularly,</hi> being contained in the words that follow, <hi>(viz.) driving us</hi> (that is him and those of his Party) <hi>far enough from Persons</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This, I say, is the <hi>Reflexion</hi> I complain of as <hi>false</hi> and <hi>injurious,</hi> and as being my self more <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly</hi> aimed at in it than any other of the <hi>Prelates</hi> he before spake of For though here as well as there, he makes use of the plural number, as if he meant what he saith of more than one, yet that which he saith of them he knew would be understood by those, by whom he would have it to be understood, to be meant of <hi>me,</hi> or if not of me onely yet of me <hi>principally</hi> and especially; because he and others perhaps of his Party had heard from Mr. <hi>JONES</hi> and others from them, that I had caused the said Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to be put out of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s service, having been before a Chaplain to his <hi>Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> Family; to his <hi>Family</hi> I say, for he was never <note place="margin">

Neither was it for his being one of them (though perhaps he was one of them in his heart) that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was put out of the Duke's service, but for behaving himself otherwise than he ought to have done in it; but how that was I forbear to say, because he is dead: onely I must say that I was neither <hi>Judge</hi> nor <hi>Witness,</hi> nor <hi>Plaintiff</hi> nor <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Bishop no way concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put out of the Duke's service.</note> nor any way a <hi>party</hi> in the case, no nor knew not any thing of the matter it self or of the cause of it, untill after it was done, as Dr. <hi>Killi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grew,</hi> then Clerk of the Closet to the Duke, and Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> then and now one of the Duke's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, will I doubt not be ready to testify if it were <hi>tanti,</hi> worth the while, to call them to it. But <hi>first</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that Mr.</hi> Jones <hi>is meant by Mr.</hi> B. <hi>for one that was driven away.</hi>
                        </note> that it was this Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> means for one and (as I verily believe) the onely one (though he speaks in the plural number) that <hi>was driven away from a Person of power</hi> by any of the <hi>Prelates</hi> is more than probable; because it is true (as I said before) that Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was once in the Duke's service, and because it is true likewise that he was put out of the place he had there, and thereupon growing angry and discontented it is very likely that he applied himself to the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Party, and to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as one of the most eminent of that Party, and told him that it was the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> that had caused him to be turn'd out of the Duke's service; for that there was a good correspondence betwixt Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and him after he was turn'd out of the Duke's service, appears by the great <hi>Encomium</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gives to a Book of his, which he calls <hi>An Excellent
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:94113:290"/>
Historical Treatise,</hi> and saith <hi>he is sorry that Book</hi>

                        <hi>is not more commonly bought and read;</hi> and so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is the <hi>Printer</hi> of it also.</p>
                     <p>Again, as for the aforesaid reasons, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>And that the Bishop of</hi> Winton <hi>is meant by the Prelate who drove him away.</hi>
                        </note> must needs mean Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> for one at least (if not the onely one) that was driven away from a <hi>Person in power;</hi> so, <hi>secondly,</hi> by the <hi>Prelate</hi> that drove him away he must needs mean me, because speaking of the <hi>Persons of power</hi> from whom he was driven, he calls them <hi>the Pupils and Disciples</hi> of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or Person whosoever he was that drove him away from them. Now though I never had the honour to be <hi>Tutour</hi> to the <hi>Duke,</hi> yet it is true that I had undertaken the <hi>instruction</hi> of the <hi>Dutchess,</hi> even almost from her Childhood, and therefore she might properly enough be called my <hi>Pupil</hi> and my <hi>Disciple</hi> as long as she continued in the way which I had instructed her to walk in, which I am sure she did, with an extraordinary zeal to make others to walk in it also, as long as I continued with her. But, of this I have given the world a large and I hope a satisfactory account already. That for which I speak of it now, is onely to prove, that as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> means Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> by him that was driven away from the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Dutchess,</hi> so he means <hi>me</hi> by him that drove him away from them.</p>
                     <p>For farther proof whereof I appeal to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself, and desire him to name one man more if he can, that he thinks to have been of their <hi>Party,</hi> that was driven away by me or any other <hi>Prelate</hi>
                        <pb n="531" facs="tcp:94113:290"/>
from any <hi>Person of power</hi> since the King's return; which if he cannot (as I am confident he cannot) as he must needs mean Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> onely, by the party driven away, so he must needs mean <hi>me</hi> by the <hi>Prelate</hi> that did drive him away; as likewise by the <hi>Persons of power,</hi> he must needs mean the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Dutchess of York,</hi> from whom he was driven, or removed.</p>
                     <p>But neither by <hi>me,</hi> nor for that cause, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it thought to be, was Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> discharg'd from officiating in the <hi>Duke's</hi> Family; for (as I said before) he was not then thought to be one of that <hi>Party,</hi> but professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a great zealot for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as it is by Law established, and therefore his help to keep out <hi>Popery</hi> could not be refused upon the account of his being a <hi>Dissenter,</hi> if it had been so necessary and efficacious, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have it thought to have been. And much less was that the cause of his removal, which Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> in that <note place="margin">

                        </note> most false and scandalous Pamphlet of his (call'd <hi>ELTMAS the Sorcerer)</hi> pretends it was, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That he the said <hi>Jones</hi> was removed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> to the end that he might not hinder the said Bishop's design, which was the more easily to work upon the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Dutchess</hi> in order to their quitting of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> which it seems the Bishop thought he could not effect as long as so able and zealous a Champion for the <hi>True Protestant Religion</hi> as Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> was, was suffered to continue either in their Highnesses grace and favour, or in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:94113:291"/>
and therefore did artificially contrive the putting him out of both. And to make this to be believed was the scope and end of the writing and publishing of the aforesaid libellous <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of that Pamphlet.</hi>
                        </note> which I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had the perusal before it was published, and perhaps was the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father</hi> that gave it the name of <hi>Elymas the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> thereby implying, that as <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer withstood Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and sought to turn away <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the deputy Governour from the Faith which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached, so the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> removed Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> that he might not hinder him from perverting the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Dutchess;</hi> which though Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth not say in plain terms, yet he insinuates and intimates as much, when he concludes the <hi>Reflexion</hi> I am now speaking of with these words, <hi>Men that are awake must have leave to judge of causes by their effects,</hi> thereby implying that <hi>if the Pupils and Disciples</hi> were perverted, He whose Pupils and Disciples they were must needs be the Perverter of them. And then taking it for granted that the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Dutchess</hi> were my <hi>Pupils and Disciples,</hi> or at least one if not both of them, he leaves it to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from their change (which he takes for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted also) what is to be thought of me, who am supposed to have been their <hi>Tutour</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that I think I may without breach of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty take Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> his Libel called <hi>Elymas the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer</hi>

obscure and oblique) <hi>Reflexion;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I have published in answer to that may serve to clear me from the imputation of this also.</p>
                     <p>And yet there is one thing in this <hi>Reflexion</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s, which I will not deny to be true, so far at least as I am concern'd in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That some (I think he might have said all) of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> nay and all of the <hi>Prelatical Party</hi> also, <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served better without the Dissenters than with them.</note> do believe, <hi>that the Protestant Religion may be preserved better without them than with them.</hi> For if by the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> he means the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion <hi>as it is by Law established</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> (which is the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> we would have to be preserved) nothing can be truer, than that we were better undertake the <hi>preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it (even against the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves) without than with the <hi>Dissenters</hi> from us; who the more and stronger they are, the more are we weakned, rather than strengthned by them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to defend our selves against them with <hi>one hand,</hi> as well as against the <hi>Papists</hi> with the <hi>other,</hi> and sometimes to defend our selves against them both at once. For though I doubt not but the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>schismatical Protestants</hi> here amongst us do mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate, and mean to doe what they can to destroy one another at last, yet that which both of them agree in to be done first, is the pulling down of us, in order to the setting up of themselves afterwards. And hence it is that the <hi>Papists,</hi> who are much the cunninger Gamesters, do make the <hi>Sectaries</hi> to play their Game for them, by making as many
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:94113:292"/>
divisions as they can amongst us, to the end, that <hi>dum singuli pugnant universi vincantur,</hi> while we fight in single parties, we may all, the whole body of us, be beaten and worsted. And I pray God it prove not to be so at last.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the aid and <hi>assistance,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks we of the <hi>Church of England</hi> have from the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> for the inabling us to defend our selves against the common Enemy the <note place="margin">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>Papists,</hi> puts me in mind of what the ingenious <hi>Boccalini</hi> saith of <hi>Spain,</hi> that when it was weighed by it self, the <hi>weight,</hi> that is, the power, wealth and strength thereof was very considerable; but when they put the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> first, and then the Dutchy of <hi>Millain</hi> into the Scale, thinking thereby to add much to the weightiness of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Monarchy,</hi> they found it to be much lighter, and the less considerable both in strength, power and wealth than it was before: And so no doubt the <hi>Church of England</hi> of it self alone would be more healthfull, more strong, more vigorous, and every way more able than it is to preserve the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion,</hi> and to defend it self against <hi>Popery</hi> and all other <hi>heretical</hi> opposition or invasion from without, if there were neither <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> nor <hi>Independents,</hi> nor <hi>Baxterians,</hi> or any other <hi>Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> from it, lurking in it; who whilst they seem to be zealous to keep out <hi>Popery</hi> do <hi>effectually</hi> (though not <hi>intentionally)</hi> make way for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in.

                  <p>AND now having sufficiently, and (as I hope) satisfactorily, to all indifferent and impartial <hi>Readers,</hi> justified what I have truly said of Mr. <hi>BAXTER,</hi> in that <hi>Letter</hi> of mine with the <hi>Appendices</hi> thereunto so long ago Printed; and vindicated my self from all those <hi>false and injurious reflections,</hi> which in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse passages of several of his <hi>Books,</hi> he hath either plainly and directly, or obscurely and obliquely made on me; which was all I intended to do; I should here make an end of giving my self or the World any more trouble, did I not foresee, that there might one or two <hi>Objections</hi> more <hi>de novo</hi> anew be made against me, which I think I ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>

The <hi>former</hi> of which is, That supposing I have <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> sufficiently proved, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at the <hi>Savoy</hi> assert and maintain, what I in my long ago Printed and now reprinted <hi>Letter,</hi> do affirm he did assert and maintain, concerning things <hi>sinful by Accident;</hi> yet seeing that since then, he hath in a <hi>Treatise</hi> purposely written upon that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, declared himself to be otherwise minded, than I say he was at that <hi>Conference:</hi> I ought in Charity to have forborn upbraiding him with what he said then.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto I <hi>answer,</hi> that the difference betwixt <note place="margin">The Answer.</note> me and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as to that particular, being whether I had falsly charged him or no with what he had said at the aforesaid <hi>Conference</hi> (as he in an Address to his Parishioners at <hi>Kidderminster</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends I had) I was necessitated in mine own defence to prove I had not charged him falsly, but that (howsoever his mind be changed since) he did <hi>then</hi> assert and maintain, what I in my Sermon at <hi>Kidderminster</hi> did affirm he had asserted and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at that <hi>Conference;</hi> as it was presently after that <hi>Conference</hi> attested in Print by the subscriptions of the now Bishops of <hi>Ely,</hi> and <hi>Chester,</hi> who were two of the three Disputants on our part, and are yet (God be thanked) alive to confirm and justifie the truth of their <hi>Attestation</hi> (if need be) which hath never yet, though it was Printed above 20 years ago, been excepted against either by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself or by any of his <hi>Party,</hi> and consequently, is as good as acknowledged and confessed to be true. And if that <hi>Attestation</hi> of theirs be true, all that I affirm to have been asserted by Mr. <hi>Baxter, of things sinful by Accident,</hi> at that <hi>Conference,</hi> must
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94113:294"/>
needs be true also, whatsoever he hath said and published in any of his Books since to the contrary. Which I take for a sufficient <hi>answer</hi> to the <hi>former</hi> of the aforesaid <hi>objections,</hi> if any such shall be made by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or by any other in his behalf hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the <hi>latter</hi> of the aforesaid <hi>Objections,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> which I foresee may be made against me also, (and which is of much more moment than the former) namely, that it was uncharitably done of me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish such a Collection of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Aphorisms</hi> against all <hi>Monarchies</hi> in general, and this <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> of ours in particular, as I did at first with that <hi>Letter</hi> of mine above 20 years since; and much more uncharitably done of me now, not only to reprint, and publish those <hi>Aphorisms</hi> again with some others of the same kind out of the same forge, but to aggravate the hainousness and dangerousness of them in relation to <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> as I have done in this <hi>Book</hi> of mine, to make him more and more odious to those that are in Power at present, as one that is not only not to be suffered to <hi>Preach,</hi> or <hi>Write,</hi> but to <hi>Live</hi> in a Monarchy; and all this, after he hath disclaimed and recanted what he writ before, and what I except against in those <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of his.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>answer</hi> therefore hereunto is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> having been <hi>silenced</hi> by me <note place="margin">The Answer.</note> when I was Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and coming to me to know the cause of it; I told him it was, because he had Preached in my <hi>Diocese</hi> without asking my leave, or having any licence from me for it; and that now I could not give him such a <hi>Licence,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of what he had asserted and maintained
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94113:295"/>
at the Conference in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> but principally in regard of many of those <hi>Positions</hi> or (as he calls them) <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of his in his Book of the <hi>Holy-Commonwealth,</hi> which were inconsistent with <hi>Kingly Government:</hi> and this I told him in the presence of the then Dean of <hi>Worcester</hi> Dr. <hi>Warmestry,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Isaack Walton,</hi> then my Steward, which he tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no notice of in his <hi>Narrative</hi> of the cause why I continued his <hi>suspension,</hi> and would not suffer him to <hi>Preach</hi> any more in my <hi>Diocese;</hi> but making his friends at <hi>Kidderminster</hi> to believe it was only for what he had asserted at the Conference in the <hi>Savoy</hi> (whereof he made a false relation also) I thought it neither improper nor unnecessary to annex to that <hi>Letter</hi> of mine (which I had written in answer to that <hi>Narrative</hi> of his) that Collection of <hi>Aphorisms</hi> out of the aforesaid Book of his, that the World might be judg whether the Author of such <hi>Maxims</hi> as those, were fit to be a <hi>Preacher</hi> in such a <hi>Kingdom</hi> as this, or no; and this (I say) was the cause why I <hi>Printed</hi> them at first.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reason why I have <hi>reprinted</hi> those <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms</hi> as well as that <hi>Letter,</hi> with an Addition of some others to them and aggravations of them, was to justifie my exceptions against them, and to shew, that I am not <hi>a Defier of Deity and humanity,</hi> nor <hi>an Enemy to God, to Kings and to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would have me thought to be) because I do not think all <hi>unlimited Governours</hi> to be <hi>Tyrants</hi> because they are unlimited, or that lawful and rightful <hi>Kings,</hi> if they be <hi>Tyrants</hi> or govern tyrannically, may therefore be lawfully <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted</hi> or deposed by their <hi>Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94113:295"/>
3. And <hi>lastly,</hi> if I have indeavoured to shew the falseness and dangerousness of this and other of his <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> subservient to the same end, it is not to make him, but those <hi>Maxims</hi> of his odious, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others only that may be hurt by them, but to himself also, that he may repent of them; which if he have done, and done it as he should do, and as himself professed he would do, if he were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there were cause for it; I am sure he will not, he cannot be offended with the aggravating the <hi>hainousness</hi> and <hi>dangerousness</hi> of any of those <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>practises,</hi> which he himself hates and detests more than any body else can, if he have truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of them; which if I should take for granted that he hath done since, yet if he had not done it before those <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of his, which I excepted against, were first Printed, it was neither <hi>unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,</hi> nor <hi>impertinently,</hi> no, nor <hi>unnecessarily</hi> done of me neither, to let the World know upon what false grounds, and by what fallacious and seditious Maxims and Principles Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had undertaken to justifie the late horrid <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and to justifie himself and those <hi>Thousands,</hi> whom (as he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth) he had perswaded to do as He did <hi>(viz.)</hi> to <hi>Rebell</hi> and <hi>Fight</hi> against the <hi>King;</hi> which he was so far from having repented of, when I first Printed those <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> that he tells the World in Print, not above a year or two before, <hi>that he durst not repent of it, nor forbear the doing of the same, if it were to be done again, in the same state of things.</hi> Neither did the World or I hear any thing from him to the contrary till many years after; and whether what he published then, or hath published since, be a sufficient proof that He is not still of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94113:296"/>
same mind he was, when he published those <hi>Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms,</hi> may well be doubted. In the mean time those <hi>Aphorisms</hi> of his being of so dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the publick, and having upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count been the main cause why I would not suffer the <hi>Author</hi> of them to <hi>Preach</hi> in my <hi>Diocese,</hi> until he had as publickly <hi>recanted,</hi> as he had <hi>asserted</hi> them, I thought my self obliged to <hi>publish</hi> them, when I did publish them first, to let the World see I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to do what I did to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> when I did it, how well soever he might behave himself after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>And as this was the reason why I <hi>Printed</hi> them at first, so the reason why I have <hi>Reprinted</hi> them now, was partly to justifie my former <hi>exceptions</hi> against them, and the dangerous <hi>consequences</hi> of them; and partly to vindicate my self from being <hi>a Defier of Deity and Humanity, and an Enemy to God, to Kings, and to all mankind</hi> (for excepting against but one of them only) as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith I am; and partly likewise to show, that there is still just cause to doubt that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> may still be of the same judgment, as to the holding of the same <hi>Seditious</hi> and <hi>Rebellious Principles,</hi> as He did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, notwithstanding any thing He hath written as yet to the contrary. The two former would have been reason enough for my Reprinting of those <hi>Aphorisms,</hi> though it were never so certain or so evident, that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had really and sincerely <hi>recanted</hi> them all. The third I add <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> over and above, and wish with all my heart there were no cause to doubt but that he had really and sincerely <hi>recanted</hi> them all, or at least those that are most dangerous and prejudicial to the safety, peace,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94113:296"/>
and welfare of our own King and Kingdom; which I am afraid he hath not done, either by what he hath said in that Paper, which he would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a <hi>Recantation</hi> of some of those <hi>Aphorisms</hi> in his <hi>Holy Commonwealth,</hi> or by the professions he hath made of his <hi>Loyalty</hi> in the second Part of his <hi>Plea for the Non-Conformists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>first,</hi> As to the Paper which he calls a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s. Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as to the Time, very tardy.</hi>
                     </note> We are to observe the time when it was Printed, which was in the year 70, just 10 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Kings</hi> coming home. How long may we think it would have been, if the <hi>King</hi> had not come home at all, or if <hi>Richard</hi> the Son could have held by force, what <hi>Oliver</hi> his Father, (whom Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> magnifies so much) had gotten for him by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of his Master? And truly if this <hi>Recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> had been the effect of a true and hearty <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> I cannot imagine what should be the cause of its coming forth no sooner; unless he was so long before he was convinced that he had done amiss in writing what he had written, or in doing what he had done, during the time of the <hi>Rebellion;</hi> so that his heart indured as long a Siege as that of <hi>Troy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would give him leave to make any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment at all, that he had writ or done any thing to be recanted or repented: But what if the <hi>King</hi> should have suspended his <hi>Pardon</hi> as long as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> did his <hi>Confession?</hi> What might have become of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in the mean time? And yet surely <hi>Confession</hi> and Contrition ought to precede forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness both <hi>in foro Poli,</hi> and <hi>in foro Soli</hi> too, and as well with men as with God. And truly it would have been more for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s own credit, and for the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> satisfaction, if it had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94113:297"/>
been so; I mean, if he had publickly <hi>Recanted</hi> what he ought, and as he ought to have Recanted, both in point of judgment and practise, a great deal soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than he did; as either before the Kings coming home, (which had been indeed the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the most proper and most <hi>acceptable time)</hi> or at least assoon as he had the first opportunity for it after the Kings coming home. And such an <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> he had, if he could have found in his heart to have made use of it; I mean that time when the <hi>King</hi> was graciously pleased (though he knew well enough what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had written and done against his Father and himself) to give him leave to <hi>Preach</hi> before him in the <hi>Chappel-Royal.</hi> Then, then (I say) was the <hi>time,</hi> and there the <hi>place,</hi> for him publickly, and humbly, and solemnly upon his Knees to have prefaced his <hi>Sermon</hi> or ensuing Discourse <note place="margin">His Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King.</note> with a self-accusing, self-condemning <hi>Exomologesis,</hi> or Confession made in his own, and in the name of his whole <hi>Party;</hi> I mean the contrivers, abettors and promoters of, and actors in that most unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and inhumane Conspiracy and <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the late King, and ended it with a <hi>quorum pars mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na fui,</hi> of which company I my self made a great part: which would have become him much better (speaking of <hi>sins inconsistent with a true faith)</hi> then the Harangue he made against <hi>drunkenness,</hi> and <hi>swearing,</hi> and <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>profaneness,</hi> and loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life, without saying any thing at all against <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> or <hi>lying,</hi> or <hi>standering,</hi> or <hi>pride,</hi> or <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> or <hi>covetousness,</hi> or <hi>sedition,</hi> or <hi>rebellion;</hi> as if those sins were not <hi>inconsistent</hi> with true faith as well, or as much as the former. But <hi>those</hi> he knew were thought to be the sins of those of the <hi>Kings,</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94113:297"/>
and <hi>these</hi> of those of <hi>his own</hi> party; as if <hi>our</hi> sins and not <hi>theirs,</hi> and consequently <hi>we</hi> and not <hi>they,</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> and not the <hi>Parliaments</hi> Party, had been the cause of that unnatural <hi>War,</hi> and consequently of all those horrible mischiefs that were done in it; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the dismal consequences and effects of it; and so indeed in a late Book of his, he is not afraid nor ashamed to tell us in plain terms. But this <hi>Sermon</hi> of his was made, it seems, before he was convinced he had sinned in incouraging so many <hi>thousands</hi> (as he saith he did) to the War against the King: so that the time of his <hi>Recantation</hi> was not yet come, though I presume he stayed not so long before he sued out his <hi>Pardon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but when the time was come, when he thought fit to publish that Paper which he calls a <hi>Recantation,</hi> (which was eight or nine years after he <note place="margin">The manner of his Recantation.</note> had Preached the aforesaid <hi>Sermon</hi> before the King) let us see what manner of <hi>Recantation</hi> it was, or whether it was such a one as can make an impartial and judicious peruser of it believe without doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is so sincere, as an ingenuous and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Recantation ought to be. For besides the <hi>tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness</hi> of its coming forth, (which I noted before, and which argues some other motive besides convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of conscience for the publishing of it) it is farther observable. <hi>First,</hi> That the wording of it wants that clearness and plainness, which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Recantation ought to have; and, <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That it is so clog'd and restrained and limited, and shackled as it were, with such and so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and conditions and proviso's, that <hi>such a muddy-brain'd man as I am</hi> cannot tell what to make of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94113:298"/>
And first as to the want of <hi>clearness</hi> in the word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Not clearly worded.</note> of it, when he speaks of all he pretends to <hi>Recant</hi> in that paper, he doth not say <hi>I profess my repentance,</hi> that ever I held it, but <hi>that ever I published it:</hi> he might have said as well and perhaps as truly, I am sorry that Bishop <hi>Morley</hi>'s collection of so many false and pernicious <hi>Aphorisms</hi> out of that Book hath made me <hi>profess my repentance for the publishing of them.</hi> Howsoever it is not his professing his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the <hi>publishing</hi> of them can prove he repents the <hi>holding</hi> of them, or that he is not still of the same judgment, because though he be so it is not safe for him to profess himself to be so; every <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is not a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there is a difference betwixt <hi>times</hi> and <hi>seasons:</hi> that may be safe or seasonable to be said or done, or written and published at one time, that can be neither seasonable nor safe at another. So that we cannot conclude Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to be of any other mind now, than he was before, from his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he is <hi>sorry,</hi> no nor from his being sorry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that he had formerly declared his judgment as he did.</p>
                  <p>Again, as the want of <hi>clearness</hi> and plainness in <note place="margin">Clog'd with Proviso's.</note> the wording of that pretended <hi>Recantation,</hi> may make the <hi>sincerity,</hi> so the clogging of it with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>proviso's</hi> may make the <hi>ingenuity</hi> thereof to be suspected, as if it had been extorted, and not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. For it looks as if he that makes it were afraid he had overshot himself, and said too much, or might be thought by those of his own Party to have said too much in that little he had said before; and therefore he adds the subsequent <hi>proviso's,</hi> which, if what he had declared before was real and sincere, are all of them needless and impertinent, and worse
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94113:298"/>
than needless and impertinent, if he means to limit and restrain what he said before by them, as he seems to do, especially by the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>last</hi> of them. For as in the <hi>first</hi> of those <hi>Proviso's</hi> he tells us <hi>he doth not reverse all the matter of that Book,</hi> which he told us before he did Recant, and <hi>that not only for some by-passages in it, but in respect of the very scope of it:</hi> so in the <hi>last</hi> of those <hi>Proviso's</hi> he protests <hi>against the judgment of Posterity,</hi> (which all sincere and ingenuous Writers do usually appeal unto) as likewise against the judgment of all others <hi>that were not of the same time and place</hi> (he should have said of the same Party and Perswasion also) <hi>as to the censuring either of that Book of his or the revocation of it;</hi> as being ignorant of the true causes of them both; and then concludes, that these things provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>(viz.)</hi> if he may be allowed to except as much of the matter of the Book (he pretends to Recant) from being <hi>reversed,</hi> as he pleaseth, and upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that neither the <hi>Book,</hi> nor the <hi>Recantation</hi> of it be censured by any but by whom he pleaseth, he did vouchsafe to <hi>publish</hi> that Paper which he would have taken for a <hi>Recantation:</hi> to which aforesaid <hi>Proviso's</hi> I wonder he did not add one more, That he might be allowed, whensoever he saw cause for it or had need of it, to substitute one <hi>Proposition</hi> instead of another, a false one instead of a true one, or a true one instead of a false one, and then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer what he pleased from it; for so as he hath done often in other places, so he hath done once in this scrap of a <hi>Recantation</hi> also, making me to say that there were some lawful Governors <hi>unlimited by God,</hi> and thence inferring that I was a <hi>defier of Deity and Humanity,</hi> when what I said was, that of lawful
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94113:299"/>
Governors some were <hi>unlimited by men;</hi> but of this I have said enough before; and (as I think) I have said enough now touching the insufficiency of this <hi>recantation,</hi> to prove that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is really and seriously otherwise minded in point of judgment than he was when he published these <hi>Aphorisms</hi> which I have now Reprinted.</p>
                  <p>Neither can the contrary hereunto be concluded <note place="margin">His vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous professions of Loyalty.</note> from any, or all of those glorious, or rather vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious <hi>professions</hi> of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> he makes in behalf of himself, and of his own Party, in the fourth Chapter of the second Part of his <hi>Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists Plea for Peace</hi> which can signifie nothing, unless he and they do renounce those disloyal and seditious <hi>Principles,</hi> which in his Book of the <hi>Holy Commonwealth</hi> he makes use of to justifie the <hi>War</hi> made by the two Houses of <hi>Parliament</hi> against the late <hi>King;</hi> as first, <hi>That this Kingdom of</hi> England <note place="margin">Some of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> 
                     <hi>is not a Monarchy, and consequently that the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not wholly in the King.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty is divided betwixt the King and the two Houses of Parliament.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that the two Houses of Parliament may lawfully take Arms, and make War with the King in defence of their own part of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, and of the trust reposed in them by the People; and that the People may, and ought to assist them when they do so.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That the People are represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Parliament not only as Subjects,</hi> (for so he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth their Representatives are only to complain and supplicate for them) <hi>but as Contractors, before they were Subjects, with him that was to be their King, before he was King,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">He justifies the late War.</note> 
                     <hi>Duellum,</hi> a just and a lawful War; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, such a War, as may be made at any time hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the same Premisses, or by vertue of the same Principles; and therefore he tells us in plain terms, not only that he <hi>did not,</hi> but that he <hi>durst not</hi> repent of having been engaged in it himself, nor for having engaged so many <hi>thousands,</hi> (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth he did) in it; not then perhaps; but hath he not repented of it since? <hi>Videtur quòd non:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Most likely that he is of the same judgment still.</note> not having yet renounced any of those <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> or <hi>Premises</hi> from whence he infers the <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> he is still to be supposed to hold the conclusion he infers from them; nay, and that he will hold it still, and do as he did then upon the like occasion; for so he tells us himself in the place before quoted, where he saith that as he <hi>durst not repent of what he had done in the aforesaid War;</hi> so he <hi>could not forbear the doing of the same (if it were to do again) in the same state of things.</hi> 'Tis true indeed he tells us in the same place, that if <hi>he were convinced he had sinned in what he had done, he would as willingly make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Recantation, as he would eat and drink when he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94113:300"/>
is hungry or thirsty.</hi> But neither he, nor any of the <hi>Non-Conformists,</hi> that ever I heard of, hath as yet made any such a publick <hi>Recantation;</hi> and therefore we may rationally, and charitably enough too, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they are still of the same <hi>Judgment</hi> they were then, and consequently that their <hi>Practice</hi> will be the same it was then, when the like opportunity invites them to it; which though I hope it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be, yet we are not sure but it may be, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be too confident and secure that no such thing will be.</p>
                  <p>For mine own part, I must confess, as I always <note place="margin">Two Plots car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on.</note> have been, so I am still of this opinion, that ever since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> there have been and are <hi>two Plots</hi> carrying on, sometimes more openly, and sometimes more secretly, the one by those that call themselves the only <hi>true Catholicks;</hi> the other by those that call themselves the only <hi>true Protestants;</hi> and both of them against the Government as it is established by Law both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> And as there always hath been, so there ever will be Plotting by both these <hi>Parties,</hi> until both of them be utterly disabled, and suppressed; for as for making Peace with either of them, I take it, by reason of the perverseness of the one, and peevishness of the other, and the pride of both, to be a thing not to be hoped for. I am sure the way proposed by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Book called <hi>The true and only way of Concord of all Christian Churches,</hi> will never do it; which Book of his, though (as I said in my <hi>Preface)</hi> I did not intend to answer, as being abundantly, and superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> B<hi>'s true and only way of Concord.</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94113:300"/>
to the end proposed by it; I will tell him plainly, and in a few words, what is my opinion of it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that it is so far from being what he saith it is, <hi>The true and only way of Concord in all Churches,</hi> that I verily believe that if all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the World were actually in as perfect Peace and <hi>Concord,</hi> both in themselves, and with one another, as ever they were or ever can be (hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly speaking) here in this World, that which he calls <hi>the true and only way of Concord,</hi> (if it were or could be admitted) would in a very short time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce such and so many unavoidable and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable <hi>differences</hi> and <hi>dissentions,</hi> both <hi>speculative</hi> and <hi>practical,</hi> as well in matter of <hi>belief</hi> as in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>worship,</hi> that there would be no such thing to be seen as <hi>order,</hi> or <hi>unity,</hi> or <hi>peace</hi> in all the Churches of any one <hi>Province</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and much less, in all the Churches of the <hi>Christian World.</hi> This <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church</hi> of ours therefore being according to the <hi>legal establishment</hi> thereof, of so sound, so health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, so orderly and so well compacted a constitution as it is, and which by long experience we have found so agreeable to the established Government of the <hi>State,</hi> that we cannot make any alteration in the <hi>one</hi> without great disordering of the <hi>other;</hi> Let us not give ear to any of those Church and State <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks</hi> or <hi>Empericks,</hi> who if we let them alone a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer, will never leave mending, till they have marr'd all.</p>

                     <p>LET the Reader know, that whereas the Bookseller hath in the Catalogue of my Books, named my <hi>[Holy-Commonwealth, or Political Aphorisms]</hi> I do hereby recall the said Book, and profess my Repentance, that ever I published it, and that not only for some by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passages, but in respect of the <hi>secondary</hi> part of the <hi>very scope.</hi> Though the <hi>first</hi> Part of it, which is the defence of <hi>God and Reason</hi> I recant not.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. That though I dislike the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergies writing so much of Politicks, and detest Ministers

                     <p>OUR SOVERAIGNE LORD, With His Estates of Parliament Considering, That albeit by many wholsom Laws made by his Royall Grand-father, and Father, of glorious memory, and by himself, in this, and His other Parliaments, since His happy Restauration, the Protestant Religion is carefully asserted, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished and secured, against Popery and Phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism: Yet the restless Adversaries of our Religion, doe not cease to propagat their errours, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce His Majesties Subjects, from their duty to God, and Loyalty to his Vice-gerent, and to overturn the established Religion, by introducing their Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and delusions, into this Church, and Kingdom. And knowing, that nothing can more encrease the numbers and confidence of Papists, and Schismatical dissenters from the Established Church, than the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine neglect of putting in Execution the good Laws
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94113:303"/>
provided against them, together with their hopes to infinuat themselves, into Offices, and places of trust, and publick Imployment. THEREFORE, His Majesty, from His Princely and pious zeal, to maintain and preserve the true Protestant Religion, contained in the Confession of Faith, recorded in the first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, which is founded on, and agreeable to the written word of GOD; DO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETH, with advise and consent of His Estates of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Require and Command, all his Officers, Judges, and Magistrats, to put the Laws made against Popery, and Papists, Priests, Jesuits, and all persons of any other Order in the Popish Church, especially against sayers and hearers of Mass; Venders and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersers of forbidden Books; And Ressetters of Popish Priests, and excommunicat Papists: As also against all Phanatick Separatists from this National Church; Against Preachers at House, or Field-Conventicles, and the Ressetters, and harbourers of Preachers, who are Intercommuned; Against disorderly Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms, and Marriages, and irregular Ordinations, and all other Schismaticall disorders, To full and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous execution, according to the Tenour of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Acts of Parliament thereanent provided. And that his Majesties Princely care to have these Laws put in Execution, against those Enemies of the Protestant Religion, may the more clearly appear: HE DOETH, with advise and consent foresaid, STATUT and ORDAIN, That the Ministers of each Paroch, give up in October Yearly, to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Ordinaries, true and exact Lists of all Papists, and Schismatical-withdrawers from the publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in their respective Paroches; which Lists are to be subscribed by them; and that the Bishops give in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94113:303"/>
a double of the saids Lists Subscribed by them, to the respective Sheriffs, Stewards, Bailies of Royalty, and Regalitie, and Magistrats of Burghs, To the effect the said Judges may proceed against them according to Law: As also, the Sheriffs, and other Magistrats foresaids, are hereby ordained to give an account to his Majesties Privy-Council in December yearly, of their proceedings against those Papists, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Separatists, as they will be answerable at their highest peril. And that the diligences done by the Sheriffs, Bailies of Regalities, and other Magistrats foresaids, may be the better enquired into by the Council, the Bishops of the respective Diocesses, are to send exact doubles of the Lists of the Papists, and Phanaticks, to the Clerks of Privy Council, whereby the diligences of the Sheriffs, and other Judges foresaids, may be controlled and examined. And to cut of all hopes, from Papists, and Phanaticks, of their being imployed in Offices and Places of publick Trust. IT IS HEREBY STATUT and ORDAINED, that the following <hi>Oath</hi> shall be taken by all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in Offices, and places of publick Trust, Civil, Ecclesiastical, and Military, especially by all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, and all Electors of Members of Parliament, all Privy-Counsellors, Lords of Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Members of the Exchequer, Lords of Justici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and all other Members of these Courts; all Officers of the Crown, and State; all Arch-Bishops and Bishops; and all Preachers and Ministers of the Gospel whatsoever; all Persons of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, named or to be named Commissioners for the Borders; all Members of the Commission for Church Affairs; all Sheriffs, Stewards, Bailies of
