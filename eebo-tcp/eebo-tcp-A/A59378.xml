            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Publiſhers Preface
TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>IT is a Truth notoriouſly known to all conſidering Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in this Nation, that ſince the happy Diſcovery
of the late <hi>Helliſh and Damnable Popiſh Plot,</hi>
againſt the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of His <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
and againſt our <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and
eſpecially upon the Trials of ſeveral of the <hi>Conſpirators</hi>
many deep Artifices have been uſed by the <hi>Plotters</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming
the <hi>Kings Witneſſes,</hi> and for invalidating of their
<hi>Teſtimonies;</hi> for theſe ends witneſſes have been fetch'd
from <hi>Saint Omers,</hi> and have appeared at ſeveral <hi>Trials,</hi>
but how ill they acted their parts, and how unworthy they
were of the names of Juſt and lawful <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> all men
know. Beſides theſe we may remember, <hi>Mr. READ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS,</hi>
endeavouring to take off <hi>Mr. BEDLOE;</hi> and
<hi>PRICE</hi> and <hi>TASBOROUGHS</hi> Tampering with <hi>Mr.
Dugdale,</hi> though all iſſued in their own ſhame; and they
<pb facs="tcp:95547:3"/>
all receiv'd their juſt demerits. Nor can the deſigns, of
<hi>Knox, Osborn,</hi> and <hi>Lane,</hi> to take off <hi>Doctor Oates's</hi>
Evidence be obliterated, it is well known how they alſo
made uſe of <hi>Mr. Dangerfield,</hi> who, as himſelf acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
was engaged through the wicked and malicious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> the <hi>five Popiſh Lords</hi>
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and their Accomplices in a horrid and
damnable deſign of charging the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<hi>Plot</hi> againſt the preſent Government and Religion
by Law eſtabliſhed. A very fine trick to take the Odium of the
Plot off from themſelves; But it pleaſed <hi>Almighty God</hi>
out of his Infinite mercy to this Diſcoverer, and to many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Perſons that were to be accuſed, yea to the whole
Kingdome, to bring him to a true ſenſe of the guilt he had
contracted, and to a Reſolution to make a <hi>free Diſcovery</hi>
of whatever he had been Privy to, in this <hi>Deſign;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Popiſh Cauſe</hi> ſtill being expoſed, by diſcovering the
Artifices above, they were put upno new contrivances to
hide it, or blaſt the diſcovery of it, ſeveral of which are in
the following Informations fully laid open.</p>
                  <p>One Thing I dare not omit here, <hi>Viz.</hi> My own Obſervation
all along in the progreſs of this Matter, That ſince the firſt
Diſcovery of this Plot, when ever the <hi>Kings Evidence</hi> hath
ſeemed to be as it were at a <hi>Bay,</hi> as diſcouraged by the
Power or Policy of malevolent Perſons, then by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the <hi>Moſt High</hi> another Witneſs hath riſen up to
retrieve and confirm what before ſeemed to be at a loſs:
Thus after the endeavours to diſparage and vilifie <hi>Dr. Oats,</hi>
in came <hi>Mr. Bedloe,</hi> then <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi> to aſſert, and
more fully to evince the <hi>Truth of the Doctors Teſtimony,</hi>
which was then and ſince, by many intereſted Perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to be ſhaken. After this <hi>God</hi> raiſed up <hi>Mr.
Praunce,</hi> who fully diſcovered the <hi>Horrid and Bloody
Murther of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> and confirmed
the <hi>Plot</hi> in ſeveral particulars, <hi>Viz.</hi> As to the deſigned
Murther of his <hi>Sacred Majeſty,</hi> the Right Honourable the
<pb facs="tcp:95547:3"/>
                     <hi>Earl of Shaftsbury,</hi> and others: And ſince him a <hi>Cloud of
Witneſſes,</hi> to put the Plot paſt diſpute, have appeared, as
<hi>Mr. Jeniſon, Mr. Smith, Mr. Bolron, Mr. Mowbray,
Mr. Turbervil, Seignior Franciſco de Faria,</hi> and ſeveral
others: And beſides this <hi>Plot in England,</hi> there hath been
another, altogether as cruel and bloudy, carried on in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which hath been fully diſcovered by ſeveral Perſons of
good Credit, as <hi>Mr. Hetherington, Mr. Macnemarra, Mr.
Boork, Mr. Fitz-Gerald, Mr. Sampſon,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding theſe great diſcoveries how many
wilfully (or at leaſt pretendedly) ſhut their eyes, but <hi>tho
they will not ſee</hi> (according to that Scriptural Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
yet in time, <hi>they ſhall ſee and ſhall be aſhamed,</hi> for
the hand of God hitherto hath been <hi>more</hi> then ordinarily
ſeen in theſe matters.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> hath here before him a few of the very
many <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Popiſh Adverſaries</hi> againſt the <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers
of their Plot.</hi> Enough to ſatisfie any unprejudic'd
and unbiaſſed man of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of the <hi>Plot,</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ince ſuch wayes as theſe, <hi>viz. Stabbing, Forſwearing</hi> and
<hi>Burning,</hi> were to be uſed to take off thoſe that revealed it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Information</hi> you have before you is <hi>Mr.
Wrights,</hi> who hath fully diſcovered, the ſeveral ways
wherein he was inſtructed for the taking off <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi>
and having ſo great opportunities to have muthered him,
his Preſervation is only to be aſcribed to the wonderful
mercy of <hi>God,</hi> and that failing, his next work was to
blaſt his Reputation, by Swearing <hi>Subornation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi>
againſt him, but when this was to be done his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
miſgave him, and <hi>God</hi> at length brought him to
diſcover the whole Intreague.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>Information</hi> is that of <hi>Thomas Launder,</hi>
who hath alſo diſcovered the ſeveral ways by which he was
perſwaded to take off <hi>Mr. Dugdale,</hi> and when it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that he was not a Tool for their purpoſe, then to
ſacrifice <hi>Mr. Dugdale</hi> to their fury, the houſe in which
<pb facs="tcp:95547:4"/>
he lay muſt be fired, in order to deſtroy him, but herein
alſo <hi>God</hi> wonderfully appeared for his Preſervation.</p>
                  <p>That none of theſe <hi>Gracious Providences</hi> of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>
may be loſt upon this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> but all improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with wiſdome to an humble acknowledgment and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Obedience, ought to be the Prayer of every <hi>True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third contains a <hi>Horrid ſtory</hi> of <hi>Romiſh Prieſts,</hi>
and their followers impiety, a ſtory, the like (but among
<hi>Papiſts</hi>) has not been heard of, no wonder that a <hi>Dying
Traytor</hi> may go out of the world with a <hi>Lie in his Mouth,</hi>
ſince ſo notorious falſhoods as theſe are allowed by their
<hi>Prieſts</hi> themſelves, ſince ſuch Truths, may be ſo ſolemnly

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> coming from beyond the

                  <p>This was about the year 1672 or 1673, and to
the beſt of my memory he did then belong to

Lady <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> of <hi>Clinrickard</hi> in <hi>Covent-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and was from thence advanced to be the
Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> his Steward, which place I ſuppoſe
he ſtill holds.</p>
                  <p>After the diſcovery of the Helliſh and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Popiſh Plot I gave him a viſit in <hi>German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi>
and told him the talk of the Town about
his Lord, whereupon he replyed, dear Child it
is a falſe thing, and my Lord is as clear as the
Child unborn, and is with the King at <hi>New-Market,</hi>
and as great a Favorite as any one what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
It is well, ſaid I, if it prove ſo, and he told
me I need not fear it.</p>
                  <p>When ſtrict enquiry was made after the
Murtherers of Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Pleſſington</hi> was upon ſuſpition taken into the
Cuſtody of Mr. <hi>Wickham</hi> a Meſſenger, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Saturday</hi> Night came to the Ship Tavem
without Temple Barr with his Keeper, whether
he ſent for me, and when I came to him, after
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95547:5"/>
ſome other diſcourſe, told me his condition, and
pull'd out a ſmall book with a lock and key to it,
which his keeper immediatly ſearched, but upon
peruſal of it, reſtored it to him again; then at his
requeſt I went to the Lord <hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſters</hi>
to acquaint his Lordſhip with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Charge, and to beg his Lordſhips
favour: his Lordſhip ſent for me into his Bed-Chamber,
and asked me how Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> did,
and after I had delivered my Meſſage, he bad
me remember his kind reſpects to Mr. <hi>Pleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington,</hi>
and tell him he did not think it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſo ſoon to move for his enlargment, but that
it ſhould not be long before he ſhould hear from
him. It was upon the Lords day, that I waited
on the <hi>Marques,</hi> and on the <hi>Tuſday</hi> following
he was diſcharged and came to return me thanks
for my care and paines, adding, that he would
not be ungrateful to me when occaſion ſhould
ſerve. Whereupon I replyed; Sir I am very
glad that you have ſo good a friend, meaning
my Lord <hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> to which he
thus anſwered, Ah Child if you were in my
condition, you would have as good and better.</p>
                  <p>Upon the firſt rumour of Mr. <hi>Stephen Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi>
diſcovery Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
whether I knew him, I told him yes
very well; upon which, he anſwered, that he
was ſorry that I knew ſuch a baſe fellow or words
to that effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95547:6"/>
And after Mr. <hi>Dugdales</hi> coming to Town, he
obſerving a great intimacy betwixt us; Told me,
that he would come oftner to ſee me, but that he
did not care to ſee <hi>Dugdale;</hi> and yet at the ſame
time would expreſs his deſire to ſee him, but
would bid me take no notice of it to <hi>Dugdale,</hi>
and was very frequently asking queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him, alwayes ſpeaking very ſcurrilouſly
of him.</p>
                  <p>He told me he was very well ſatisfied of my
truth and honeſty, and that it ſhould not be long
before I ſhould know more of his mind, which
diſcourſe was ſoon over.</p>
                  <p>Not long after he came to me again, and told
me he wanted ſome ſecret diſcourſe with me, and
thus went on. You are (ſaid he) <hi>Dugdales</hi> Barber
ſtill; yea (ſaid I) I am; pray (ſaid he) where do
you trim him? I anſwered in my ſhop, with three
or four Souldiers about him. Do you, ſaid he, never
trim him privatly? I told him I never yet had, but
was once asked by him to trim him at his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at the Cock-pit. VVell ſaid he, if that fellow
were aſide it would be well for him that did it, and
he thought me a very fit man to be imployed in that
affair, and went on making me very fair promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of great rewards, and at length came to a ſum
certain, ſaying that If I would deſtroy him or blaſt
his Evidence, I ſhould have ſeven hundred
pounds paid me. And to confirm me that he was
real, he bid me make proviſion to have it ſecured
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95547:6"/>
to me, accordingly I ſpoak to Mr. <hi>Reaves</hi> an
Apothecary, and one Mr. <hi>Croſs,</hi> at the <hi>Horſhoo</hi>-Tavern,
both in <hi>Chancery-lane,</hi> about ſecurity for
ſuch a ſumme, Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi> went twice with me to
ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> about one of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds, but my great neceſſity dayly encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon me, I was the more inclined to attempt
Mr. <hi>Dugdales</hi> perſon, which accordingly I did,
after this manner. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> being late one
Evening at the <hi>Horſeſhoo</hi>-tavern in <hi>Chancery-lane,</hi>
ſent ſo me (as he uſed frequently to do,) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
him home to his Lodging at the Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
and calling a Coach we two only went into it,
this was an opportunity I had expected, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
had provided a Dagger, which coſt me
3s. and 6d. which I bought at a ſhop near <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ford</hi> houſe; when we came into the <hi>Strand</hi> near
<hi>Summerſet</hi> Houſe, I ſitting oppoſite to Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
in the Coach felt how low his bodice came,
that I might know were to ſtab him ſecurely, but
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> miſtruſted me ſo far that he called to
the Coach-man to ſtop, but I perſwaded him on,
but at <hi>Charing-croſs,</hi> I again was attempting him,
and he again was calling to the Coach-man to let
him out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I endeavoured to perſwade him that
I intended him no harm, yet he ſtill ſo far miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, that when we came to the <hi>Cook-pit,</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
ſtept out of the Coach, and paid the
Coach man, and gave him a 1 s. more then his pay
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95547:7"/>
to carry me back to the Horſ-ſhooe Tavern, I
would have come out with a deſign to follow
him, pretending to return by water, but he would
not admit of it, but would have the Coach-man
carry me back. When I ſaw I had miſſed this
opportunity of Murthering him, I bid the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
take notice where I had left him well, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he might be diſpatcht by ſome other hand,
and that I ſhould be queſtioned for it. The Coach
ſtood at the Sarazens head in <hi>Camomil</hi>-ſtreet near
<hi>Biſhopſ gate,</hi> this was in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> 1679.
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> perceiving his perſon was attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
obſcur'd himſelf for ſeveral dayes, and then
his Enemies reported, that he was run away
from his Evidence, which Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
he beleived I had given Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
his Paſ-port for another world, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to me then at the Horſeſhooe Tavern, he
gave me thirty Guinnies; but Mr. <hi>Croſs</hi> comming
into the room at that inſtant of his delivering
them me, I immediatly return'd them him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
not deſiring any Eye witneſſes of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his gold, at which he ſeemed to be very
angry.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this ſome unexpected trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
overtaking me, I was for the ſecurity of my
perſon obliged to quit my Habitation, and the
Night before I went, I met with Mr. <hi>Pleſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
near middle row in <hi>Holbourn,</hi> and told him
I feared I could not performe my promiſe to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95547:7"/>
him, becauſe I wanted mony to carry on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
he deſired me to be as true to him as he
would be to me, and then gave me three Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and ordered me to meet him the <hi>Monday</hi>
following at <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> this was in <hi>September</hi>
1679, but I failed then meeting him.</p>
                  <p>I then took a lodging in <hi>Wapping,</hi> unknown to
Mr. <hi>Pleſſington,</hi> but he meeting Mr. <hi>Leacroff</hi> of
<hi>Walton</hi> in <hi>Stafford ſhire,</hi> my very good friend, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him where I was, and pretended that I
had much damnified him, in not meeting him at
<hi>Billings-gate</hi> according to appointment, Mr.
<hi>Leacroff</hi> told him that I was under a Cloud, at
which he ſeemed very ſorry, and ſaid, he might
notwithſtanding have met me, for he knowes I
deſign him no hurt but ſhould have met him for
his advantage.</p>
                  <p>After this he underſtanding that I was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a <hi>Cheeſmonger</hi> in <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> cauſed me fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to viſit him in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and if at any
time I was queſtioned whether I went, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to make uſe of my own Friends names
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Shenton</hi> in the Minte, Mr.
<hi>Hubbard</hi> at Sir <hi>George Whartons,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi>
at Sir <hi>Jonas Moores,</hi> any of which names
would have gained me admittance.</p>
                  <p>At one of our meetings there, I told him that
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had appointed me to meet him on
ſuch a day (which day I then told him) at the
<hi>Fleece</hi> Tavern at <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> then he deſired
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95547:8"/>
me to call of him, that day before <hi>I</hi> went to <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
which I did, and dined with him at his Lords
Lodging in the <hi>Tower,</hi> it was the day after His
Grace the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> returned from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>When we had dined Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to an Ale-houſe in the <hi>Tower</hi> near the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
Houſe, the Houſe had the Model of a
ſhip or two hanging in it. There came two or
three Gentlemen with Mr. <hi>Pleſſington,</hi> who impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned
me to get Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> away from <hi>Billins-gate</hi>
by water, deſigning to attempt him upon the
water, as I ſuppoſed. I told them I would go to
him to the <hi>Fleece</hi> and ſee what Company was
with him, and if he were alone would acquaint
them. Accordingly I went, and found two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with him, and a third came to him whilſt I was
with him, but I had ſtaid there longer than they
expected, ſo that when I returned back to the Dog,
they were gone, and had taken with them my Cane,
which I left there.</p>
                  <p>The next day I went to Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> for my
Cane, who ſaid to me we miſſed a brave opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Yeſterday, I replyed, not as good as when I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
my deſigne upon him in the <hi>Strand,</hi> no ſaid he,
but have at the third time, and then he ſeemed to
ſuſpect me for refuſing the thirty Guinnies at the
<hi>Horſeſhoo</hi>-tavern, which I told him I did fearing Mr.
<hi>Croſs</hi> ſhould diſcover ſomething of our deſigne,
hang him (ſaid he) if he do, weel tell him another
ſtory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95547:8"/>
I then asked him what I ſhould ſay to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that asked me how I came ſo ſoon to want
monies, when I ſo lately had ſeven hundred
pound to put out to uſe; Pugh (ſaid he) tell
them that it was mine, and that I being (as you
feared) concerned in the Plot, you were to put
it out in your name for my uſe, in which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
his directions.</p>
                  <p>But be ſure ſaid he, that you continue to blaſt
<hi>Dugdale</hi> all you can, for we can have no fitter
perſon for the purpoſe than your ſelf, but I will
ſuddainly be with you again, and contrive a way
for you to do it more eaſily and effectually.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly he came on a <hi>Saturday</hi> ni<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ht
and lay with me, an then told me that I being
a witneſs or Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> in the Trial of <hi>Price,</hi>
might do them the ſervice they deſired, by
ſwearing that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> profered me I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
maintenance, and protection as a Kings E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
if I would ſwear againſt Sir <hi>James
Symons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gerard,</hi> and others, this I promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do; but before the trial having ſeriouſly
conſidered what it was that I was about to do,
my purpoſe was altered, and therefore deſired
Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> to put it off, and told him I
would be out of the way before I was ſubpaena'd,
deſigning to go to <hi>Chelmsford</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> but he
would by no meanes conſent to it, and ſo I was at
the trial of <hi>Anne Price</hi> and <hi>John Tasborough,</hi> but
did not ſwear againſt <hi>Dugdale</hi> as I had promiſed,
and as they expected, at which I after perceived
they were much ſtartled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:95547:9"/>
Soon after Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> coming to me; told
me that I had loſt my ſelf, and that I was not the
man he took me for, and after ſome other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſaid that if I would yield my ſelf forſworn
in what I had witneſſed at the Trial, he would
get a Friend to ſpeak to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and
did not in the leaſt queſtion but by his meanes to
get me a Pardon for Perjury. And he then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
me to ſay that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> threatned me
(if I owned a word of our meeting at <hi>Billings-gate,</hi>
or of his promiſes to me) that he would
bring two to ſwear Treaſon againſt me and have
me hanged, or at leaſt ſuch Crimes as ſhould
cauſe me to be Pillored.</p>
                  <p>And at his inſtigation I did tell ſeveral in and
about <hi>London,</hi> that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a Rogue, and
that I would do his buſineſs for him 'ere long,
that he had made me forſwear my ſelf to do
him a kindneſs, with more ſuch notorious fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoods.</p>
                  <p>About four days after the Trial, I was upon
ſuſpition apprehended for a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and carryed
before Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> but was releaſt by the
meanes of a Letter from my Honored Friend,
Sir <hi>Humphery Doleman,</hi> this was in <hi>February,</hi>
1679.</p>
                  <p>After this I began to ſtand firm to the Popiſh
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95547:9"/>
Intereſt, and was intended to be a witneſs againſt
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> in the Trial of the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> and
Sir <hi>James Symons,</hi> this was in the beginning of
the year, 1680.</p>
                  <p>That which confirmed me more to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſt
was the miſinformation I had receiv'd by their
meanes concerning Mr. <hi>Dugdale, viz.</hi> That he
was the cauſe of my being apprehended for a
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> and that he deſigned miſchief againſt me,
and that he had profered ten pounds, to take
me before the Lord <hi>Aſtons</hi> Tryal; with which
I acquainted Sir <hi>Thomas Whitegrave,</hi> who bid
me if any trouble of that Nature came upon
me, to ſend to Mr. <hi>Thomas Robinſons</hi> in <hi>Curſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi>
Alley, where he and his Son <hi>Bromley</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and either of them would be my Baile. Sir
<hi>Thomas</hi> was ſubpaena'd as a witneſs for the
Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and was a witneſs for the Lord
<hi>Stafford,</hi> I therefore was forced frequently to
ſhift my lodgings, and was entertained at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General <hi>Egertons,</hi> he being from home: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a ſhort time Mr. <hi>Germin Drayton,</hi> Butler
both to Mr. <hi>Heningham</hi> and Sir <hi>James Symonds,</hi>
and one <hi>Samuel Holt</hi> a <hi>Black ſmith</hi> to the Lord
<hi>Aſton</hi> of <hi>Tixal,</hi> which <hi>Holt</hi> was alſo a witneſs in
the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> trial, came to me frequently
to the Bull-tavern in <hi>Southampton</hi> ſtreet, Mr.
<hi>Drayton</hi> oftner than the other, and did interceed
with me to write ſomthing that might blaſt <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95547:10"/>
which I did, and he called for it at the time
appointed.</p>
                  <p>Two or three dayes after Mr. <hi>Drayton</hi> told
me that he muſt bring a Gentleman to ſpeak with
me, but would not name him, accordingly the
next day he called me, and we went together
to the <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>Kings ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Blooms-bury,</hi>
whether he brought one Mr. <hi>Longner,</hi> repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be the Lord <hi>Staffords</hi> Solicitor, vvho thus
accoſted me; that he was glad to ſee ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
a good face appear in their cauſe, and that
any one would take me for an honeſter man
than ever <hi>Dugdale</hi> was, adding that Sir <hi>James
Symons</hi> was better able to perform than <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
was to promiſe, and that I ſhould not
need to fear a gratuity; for they were the
ſtrongeſt ſide. Upon this I replyed, that I
was I ready to ſerve them in ſuch ways, as
they ſhould propoſe to me, then they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me to write a Paper to Deſtroy <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi>
Evidence, I told them that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
written one, yea ſaid Mr. <hi>Drayton,</hi>
but this we now deſire, is to ſatisfie Sir <hi>James
Symonds,</hi> yet I often denyed them for that
very reaſon, becauſe I had before given them
one, but at laſt agreed to vvrite a Paper in
their method, and they vvere to pick the beſt
out of both for their purpoſe, which when
done, I vvas to ſvvear to, I cannot undertake
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95547:10"/>
to remember the very vvords of it, but
they dictated to me, and I wrote to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I can, I bleſs GOD for it, with a ſafe
Conſcience ſwear, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did at a
private meeting betwixt him and my ſelf prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me money and a maintenance, and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as one of the Kings Evidence, if I would
ſtand by and ſwear for him againſt Sir <hi>James
Symons,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gerard</hi> and others; this I do
neither for fear nor favour, nor in hopes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
future gratuity, as I hope to be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>SIMEON WRIGHT.</p>
                  <p>This was by their direction, and then Mr.
<hi>Drayton</hi> invited me to the Kings-bench Priſon,
whither I went, and after Dinner, Sir <hi>James
Symonds</hi> ſent for me to him to Mr. <hi>Coolings,</hi>
and when I came, told me he hoped I was
ſenſible how great his future gratitude ſhould
be, and that he hoped I would ſtand and fall
by them when occaſion ſhould ſerve, and that
he was ſorry that he had no occaſion for me
at preſent, and then thruſt twenty ſhillings into
my hand.</p>
                  <p>Many other contrivances they had which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95547:11"/>
I omit, becauſe I would not be tedious, but can
eaſily prove this, and a great deale more. This
paper before mentioned, is the Paper that <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Viſcount Stafford</hi> produced in Court, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Trial.</p>
                  <p>They have another Paper of this nature;
would they be ſo juſt to produce it, which I
delivered to Mr. <hi>Drayton,</hi> but I know not in
whoſe hands it is now; Mr. <hi>Henry Lee</hi> (Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff
to <hi>Walter Heningham</hi> Eſq; who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
to be one concern'd in this Helliſh Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Plot,) did frequently make it his buſineſs
to revile and aſperſe Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> eſpecially
about the beginning of <hi>October</hi> laſt, to one Mr.
<hi>Moore,</hi> at the Houſe of <hi>Thomas Aſpery,</hi> of <hi>Aſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> then
queſtioning him for, and asking his name, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
his name was <hi>Simeon VVright</hi> a <hi>Barber,</hi>
in <hi>Chancery-lane;</hi> by which it is very plain, that
he was knowing to my being imployed to ruine
Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> as aforeſaid, as indeed he was,
and therefore made uſe of my Name to obſcure
his own.</p>
                  <p>They had within three Monthes laſt paſt,
told me, that theirs is the ſtrongeſt ſide, and
have given me ſevere charge to ſtand or fall
with them, and not be danted, from which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95547:11"/>
I did all that in me lay, to blaſt
Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> whereever I came; but it hath
pleaſed God to bring me to an acknowledgment
of the truth, partly by meanes of His Majeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies
late Proclamation, for the encouragment of
witneſſes, and partly by the good Advice of
ſeverall Friends, but eſpecially my own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
prompting me to this Declaration of the

INFORMATION
OF
Thomas Lander
OF
Shutborrow in the County of Stafford,
Taken upon Oath <date>the 24th of December, 1680.</date>
before me Edmund Warcup, Eſquire, one of his
Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace for the County
of Middleſex, and City and Liberties of Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
as followeth; viz.</head>
                  <p>THIS Informant ſaith, That having been
employed as a Workman ſeveral times at
the Houſe of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> at <hi>Tixall</hi> in
the County aforeſaid, he was ſollicited by
Mr. <hi>Francis Hind,</hi> Steward to the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> to
become a Witneſs againſt <hi>Stephen Dugdale,</hi> late
Steward to the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> any way to invalidate
or take off his Evidence in relation to the Popiſh
Plot, and he ſerved this Informant with a <hi>Subpoenae</hi>
to come up to <hi>London</hi> for that purpoſe, at the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95547:14"/>
late intended Tryal of the ſaid Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> in <hi>June</hi>
laſt paſt; but before his coming up, the ſaid Mr.
<hi>Hind, Francis Aſton,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and
<hi>Thomas Sawyear,</hi> Servant to the ſaid Lord <hi>Aſton, &amp;c.</hi>
ſent for this Informant into a private Room in the
ſaid Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe; and there told him, That
if he would ſwear ſuch things as ſhould be dictated
to him by the Perſons aforeſaid, to invalidate or
take off the ſaid <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Evidence, he ſhould
have ſuch a Reward as ſhould be to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and not want for Money and Horſe, as
might become a man of better Quality than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
And this Informant agreeing to their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
came up to <hi>London</hi> accordingly.</p>
                  <p>They perſwaded this Informant likewiſe to ſwear
that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a Cheating Rogue, and had
cheated this Informant and many more in the
Country, whilſt he was the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Steward.
To which this Informant anſwered he would, and
ſaith that <hi>Hind</hi> told him, That if he would do
according as they directed him, that he ſhould
(beſides the Rewards agreed upon) have his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
born in coming to Town, in ſtaying here, and
going down again. And likewiſe ſaith, that he was to
ſwear that <hi>James Anſell,</hi> (being a Witneſs in ſome
things relating to the Diſcovery of the Plot) was
a Perjured Rogue, and a Thief, and had perjured
himſelf ſeveral times; and all ſuch other things
as they ſhould dictate to him when he came up
to <hi>London,</hi> in order to take off both their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And ſaith thoſe that promiſed to make
good his Reward for ſo doing, was Mr. <hi>Herbert
Aſton,</hi> his Lordſhips Uncle, <hi>Francis Aſton,</hi> Son to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95547:14"/>
the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Sawyear,</hi> Servant to
the ſaid Lord <hi>Aſton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Informant ſaith, That being in <hi>London,</hi>
and my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Tryal not being come on,
he received no more of his Reward but his bare
Charges; however they faithfully promiſed him
when he had made good what he had promiſed
them to ſwear, he ſhould have his full Reward
made good to him.</p>
                  <p>And this Informant ſaith, That in <hi>September</hi>
laſt going up to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe, he was
made very welcome, and after ſome time was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by one of the Servants of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s,
where Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> lay; and this Informant told
him, at one <hi>Richard Perkins</hi> next Houſe to his own
in <hi>Shutborrow,</hi> about a Mile diſtant from my Lord
<hi>Aſton</hi>'s; the ſaid Servant, after ſome diſcourſe had
with this Informant, told him that he might do
them good ſervice, and have a good Reward for
his pains, if he could deviſe to ſet fire on the
Room where Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> lay, and burn him in
his Bed. To which this Informant anſwered, that
if he ſhould do ſo, he ſhould burn his own Houſe,
and endanger the whole Town: To which the
Servant replyed, that it were better that his Houſe
and the whole Town were burnt, rather than he
(meaning Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>) ſhould eſcape, who was
a Rogue, and had betray'd his Lords Secrets, with
ſeveral other Gentlemen; he at the ſame time tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
this Informant, that he ſhould if he would
undertake it) be well rewarded to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
but perceiving this Informant not to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95547:15"/>
willing? told him he was a Coward, he would
not undertake to do ſo good a piece of ſervice.
The ſaid Servant at the ſame time went to one <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Moore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> another Servant of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s,
who was to join with this Informant in the ſaid
Fact; and this Informant going home, ſaw the
ſaid <hi>Walter Moore</hi> walking about the ſaid Houſe
that was ſo to be fired; and this Informant not
being willing that ſuch a wicked Act ſhould be
done, acquainted one of his Neighbours with it,
and ſo a Watch was ſet to preſerve the ſaid Houſe
where Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> lay, and all the Town, that
night, and all the time after ſo long as Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
ſtayed there: This Informant having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
heard the ſaid <hi>Moore</hi> ſay, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a
Rogue for having betrayed his Lords Secrets:
And likewiſe ſaith, that when this informant was
to be a Witneſs for the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> one <hi>Samuel
Holt</hi> who was another Servant of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s,
and alſo one <hi>Sawyear,</hi> being <hi>Subpoena'd</hi> up as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
for my Lord <hi>Aſton;</hi> they told this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,
that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a Perjured Rogue,
for laying the Plot of the Presbyterians upon the
Papiſts, and if they or either of them could meet
the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> conveniently, they would do his
buſineſs for him: And ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Holt</hi>
had received a ſum of Money for the ſaid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
as likewiſe the ſaid <hi>Walter Moore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Informant ſaith, That all thoſe things
which were ſo by them, as aforeſaid, dictated to
him, were altogether falſe, to any knowledge of
this Informant, in relation to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95547:15"/>
and the ſaid Mr. <hi>James Anſell.</hi> And ſaith that
ſeveral other Matters and Perſons he knows of
that were concerned herein (this Informant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always made privy to moſt of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
in this nature) that would almoſt hang
them, which he is unwilling to diſcover againſt
them, for that they are related to him.</p>
