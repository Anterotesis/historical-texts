            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have underſtood of your deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for the publiſhing of a <hi>Libell,</hi> lately fram'd againſt me. And though (perhaps) the harme that I ſhould have received thereby, would have been but ſmall, yet my obligation unto you, never ceaſeth to be great; and this argueth a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care in you of my tranquillity, not to ſuffer that any, the leaſt noiſe ſhould diſquiet it. I know not (<hi>my Lord</hi>) if this be not to handle with too much niceneſſe and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, a man that makes profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Philoſophy</hi>; it were enough
<pb facs="tcp:3675:12"/>
that publike <hi>Authority</hi> ſhould ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me from the <hi>tempeſt,</hi> without exempting me from the <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>duſt,</hi> and that it would guard my <hi>Retrait</hi> from <hi>ſavage</hi> beaſts, without frighting away the <hi>flies</hi> alſo, and ſuch importunate <hi>Inſects.</hi> But (<hi>my Lord</hi>) the goodneſſe which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for me, extends farther then to ordinary juſtice. You take not only care for my <hi>repoſe</hi> amidſt the <hi>hurry</hi> and tumult of <hi>Europe,</hi> but you would have the world alſo ſhew a <hi>reſpect</hi> unto my retiredneſſe, and that being <hi>ſequeſtred</hi> from men. J ſhould be alſo placed beyond the levell and reach of <hi>Detraction.</hi> Yet this Fiend did purſue S. <hi>Hierome</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the Grotts of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and to the foot of our <hi>Saviours</hi> cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, there <hi>ſhe</hi> found him (as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates himſelfe) although he had
<pb facs="tcp:3675:12"/>
thought to <hi>hide</hi> himſelfe. If this inſolent <hi>Thing</hi> had no regard of an admirable <hi>ſanctity,</hi> and a place <hi>guarded</hi> with <hi>Angels,</hi> me thinks a vulgar <hi>innocence,</hi> retired within an ill fortified village, muſt not expect any favourable treaty. But to paſſe from common conditions to the learned <hi>Tribe</hi>; If in all ages, there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſeditious ſpirits, that rebelled againſt the <hi>Chieftaines</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> and diſcipline, and if in the memory of our <hi>fathers,</hi> it was ſpoken openly at <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was a ſimple <hi>Sophiſter,</hi> J think they deale cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly with me in this Country, if they be contented to call me a ſimple <hi>writer.</hi> That great blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the name of <hi>Aristotle (my Lord)</hi> was D. <hi>Ramus,</hi> who afterward, though he was a <hi>Catholique,</hi> was taken for a <hi>Huguenot,</hi> at the maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre;
<pb facs="tcp:3675:13"/>
And indeed, ſome did believe that God permitted this to come to paſſe by a juſt judgement; and that the <hi>Tutelar</hi> Angell of good <hi>Letters,</hi> took the pretext of <hi>Religion,</hi> for to revenge the injuries that were done to <hi>Reaſon.</hi> There is one this day alive in <hi>Germany,</hi> a petty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Grammer, an enimy of common and generall verities, and an accuſer of <hi>Cicero</hi>; who (not long ſince) hath put forth ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, where he preferres a bill againſt his own Judge, and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the precedency ever allowed unto that <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Latine</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that (<hi>my Lord</hi>) the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall conſent of all the world, ſtrengthned by a preſcription of 18. centuries of years, is not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient title for to warrant the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of that <hi>Roman,</hi> againſt
<pb facs="tcp:3675:13"/>
the prevaricating quirkes of this <hi>Barbarian.</hi> Indeed, this is a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of no good example, but yet ſince it is ſo, and that it doth litle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile <hi>Virtue,</hi> to be conſecrated by time, and to be crowned by the people, for to make it inviolable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the practiſes of ſome private Humors. There is no reaſon that I ſhould complaine before ſo many <hi>Worthies,</hi> that have bin ſo ill intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, and that I ſhould be had in any conſideration, where <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> are not in ſafety; an ordinary man ſhould not make moan, for ſuffering the ſame deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which extraordinary Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have undergone; and I cannot with modeſty, deſire or expect from you, that you ſhould reforme the world for the love of me; nay, J know (<hi>my Lord</hi>) that this litle
<pb facs="tcp:3675:14"/>
diſorder, is of ſome good uſe in a common-wealth; and it were to be wiſhed, that malice would buſy it ſelfe thus, about things of ſmall importance, that it might not think of buſineſſes of higher conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Thoſe that have hitherto beſtowed their pains, in depraving the ſence of my words, and in falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying my works, had (perhaps) ere this time, forged mens <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> and minted falſe coines; And he that now deſires from you a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, would have ſtood in need of a <hi>Pardon,</hi> it may be, if it had not been for me. It is better by farre, that injuſtice ſhould exerciſe it ſelfe upon my books, than that it ſhould vexe and <hi>implead</hi> againſt all that is good and ſacred in a civill ſociety; that unjuſt men ſhould rather toſſe and tranſpoſe words, invert and
<pb facs="tcp:3675:14"/>
pervert periods of ſpeeches, than remove the bounds of lands, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh their <hi>Neighbours</hi> houſes; To ſay the truth, this is the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent way that <hi>vice</hi> can imploy it ſelfe in, and I believe I have not a litle deſerv'd from the common-wealth, for keeping at worke theſe ten years, ſuch an infinite number of idle companions, who (certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) would have been dangerous Commonwealths-men, if they had not choſen rather to have been ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous <hi>Cenſors.</hi> It is well, that the heat of their braines, is <hi>exhaled</hi> out this way, and that their intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance takes this courſe; and that to prevent their fury, men give ſome ſcope and liberty to their folly. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them therefore this exerciſe (<hi>my Lord</hi>) they cannot chooſe but make uſe of their time, which they will
<pb facs="tcp:3675:15"/>
imploy farre worſe, if you doe not permit them to imploy it thus. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>giddy</hi> Youth to ſpend their heat and fury upon a ſenſeleſſe ſubject, and a dead letter, which is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peable either of joy or ſorrow. As long as theſe <hi>Pen-fencers</hi> only beg the <hi>Seale</hi> of your <hi>Authority,</hi> be no niggard of the <hi>Prince</hi> his grace and favour, and abate ſomething of your wonted ſeverity and rigour. If it were anew &amp; unuſuall thing, it may be, I ſhould be contented to have the firſt <hi>Libell,</hi> which branded me with injuries be ſuppreſſed, but ſince there is now a pretty <hi>Library</hi> of them, I am in a manner well pleaſed it ſhould ſwell and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and I take a delight to build me a <hi>moniment</hi> with thoſe ſtones, which <hi>Envy</hi> hath hurl'd at me, without doing me harme. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:3675:15"/>
it no diſgrace to be cenſur'd by ſome men, becauſe I account it no credit to be favour'd by them: I intend not to canvaſſe for voices, nor labour a myſterious ſecret, whereby I may gaine the generall applauſe of the world. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained what I deſired, (<hi>my Lord</hi>) if I have obtained your approbation, as being derived from an un-erring <hi>principle,</hi> and from an <hi>Jntelligence</hi> moſt perfectly <hi>illuminated.</hi> God hath beſtowed on you, a <hi>ſoveraigne</hi> judgement, before the <hi>King</hi> had committed to your hands, his <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne</hi> Juſtice. And you were moſt powerfull in Reaſon, before you were ſo in <hi>Authority.</hi> J need not have recourſe to <hi>this,</hi> knowing that the <hi>other</hi> is no way againſt me, and I eſtime it more glory to me, to have pleaſed you, than I would
<pb facs="tcp:3675:16"/>
think it ſatisfaction to have my enimies proſcribed by you. Your ſpeeches of me upon every occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo full of reſpect, your own <hi>pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture</hi> that you beſtowed upon me a yeare agoe, for a pledge of your Affection, your imparting to me the riches of your writings, I mean thoſe writings, that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated with the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> and were full of the <hi>greatneſſe</hi> of your <hi>Maſter,</hi> which ſeemed to me ſo farre to tranſcend the ſtrength and vigor of this age, and ſo nearly reſembling the <hi>Roman Majeſty.</hi> In a word (<hi>my Lord</hi>) each moment of that happy afternoone, which I had the honour to paſſe away within your cloſet, are <hi>priviledges,</hi> which I doe value above that which you denied a <hi>Fantaſme,</hi> or the Succeſſor of <hi>Philarchus.</hi> I dare not rehearſe

                  <hi>COurteſie</hi> never denies reſpect to any man, and thinkes no mans Preſents meane but her owne. This was it (no doubt) that made You ſpeake of mee in ſuch a high ſtraine and ſet ſo great a price upon my booke, which (indeed) is but the worſt part of your <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</hi> J ſee you will not alter your courſe, or forget your ancient civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for the which J am infinitely obliged unto you. And if ſome men would needs perſwade me that at other times you handle me ſomething rudely, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe you doe it with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile hand; on the contrary, J ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3675:21"/>
that in your familiar letters you give a true coppie and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of your ſelfe, but in actions of Ceremony, men require another countenance &amp; more ſtudied gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; otherwiſe <hi>Sir,</hi> my nature can beare with my friends, and J am not of ſo delicate a ſenſe as to complaine of pettie wrongs which J ſuffer. Beſides, that J doe not at all medle with that ſcience of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which teaches to rente our <hi>Saviours</hi> Coat into 1000 peices, &amp; to implead and cavill againſt every word of his <hi>Teſtament.</hi> This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doth rather exaſperat mens ſpirits, than compoſe affaires, and multiply doubts, inſteed of encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing charity. If J were put to my choyce, J would take a litle leſſe of that which puffeth up, and a litle more of that which edifieth. <hi>Truth</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:3675:21"/>
is not the purchaſe of hot blood, or of incenſed choller, or a diſturbed imagination. The <hi>Labyrinthes</hi> of <hi>Logick</hi> are not the eaſieſt way to heaven, and oft-times God hides him-ſelfe from them that ſearch him with over-much curioſity. You will avouch (J am ſure) all that J ſay, and this too <hi>Sir,</hi> that the beſt quarrels prove nought, and of bad conſequence, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Doctors prove the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their Brethrens ſoules, if they tend not to the peace of the Church; for my part, J can with other vulgar Chriſtians, but wiſh for it; but you can with the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much towards it, &amp; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſhall preach and teach this, J ſhall aſcribe unto you one of the principall parts of that holy

work: But while we expect that this peace be advanced through the grace of God, &amp; that we draw neerer every day one to another, nothing hinders, but that we may maintaine innocent commerce, &amp; traffick in things lawfull. There is no law rightly interpreted that is repugnant to that of Humanity, &amp; doth not accord with the law of <hi>Nations.</hi> If our opinions differ, it is not neceſſary that our affections ſhould diſagree; the head and the heart have their ſeverall motions, and actions diſtinct; and morall vertue can reconcile &amp; unite what the intellectuall might ſeparate.

Let us ſpeake no more of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: there is nothing here within but proſperity, ſince the <hi>Ordinary</hi> hath arriv'd: and J muſt recall a language which J have forgotten, ſince you doe reſtore a paſsion to me which J had loſt. J thought there was no diſpoſition to any joy left in me, yet notwithſtanding from a litle ſparke rak'd up in my boſome, you have kindled ſuch an exceſſe, that J never felt the like;

ſuch inebriations of the ſpirit, and ſober tranſportments <hi>Philoſophy</hi> hath obſerv'd in extraordinary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.

                  <hi>Fortune</hi> is not ſo rich as to preſent me with any thing that might countervaile the leaſt pledges of your Amity.

for the greateſt buſineſſe that I did dureing my abode there. Jn lieu of theſe, I will forgive <hi>Paris</hi> for all the unquiet nights, and other miſchiefes I ſuffered there. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine no more of its impure aire, or the jangling of bells, or of the juſtling and dirt of the ſtreets. And though I could not carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thence but the bare <hi>Idea</hi> of your entertainment, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that you defrayed the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of my journey in it, J can live here (yet awhile) upon your charges, &amp; feed my thoughts a long time with what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from your mouth.

               <p>YOur ſorrow is too <hi>accurate,</hi> and ſtudied, to be true; and an afflicted perſon that writes ſuch brave things, hath no great need of any thing of mine to ſolace him. J will therefore forbeare a taske<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I conceive to be ſo

but give your friend his due, &amp; lend him never a graine. This is (in truth) a moſt accompliſh't man, &amp; who at the age of 22 yeares, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted wiſe even by the <hi>Italians,</hi> that lately thought wiſdome was their own free-hold. He hath with his great knowledge mingled much goodneſſe: the ſharpneſſe of his underſtanding is tempered and allaied by the ſweetneſſe of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and his modeſtie doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and conceale much of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. He never pardons himſelf, though he doth beare with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmities in others; and that Piety which he doth practiſe, gives reſpect unto all, but ſtrikes a terror in none. Loe <hi>Sir,</hi> the teſtimonie which I adde unto yours: which I would beſtow upon an enimie that deſerv'd it, but would not upon a

friend that wanted merit. His knowledge is attended on by other vertues, and it hath furniſht him with excellent <hi>moralitie</hi>: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, it ſhould be ſolitarie and of litle uſe. I tell you nothing of the late experiment I have found of it in your <hi>Letter</hi> which he wrote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: Beſides that my beſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage would be farre below my apprehenſion of if; I know withall too well the power of his <hi>Rhetorick</hi> to conteſt with it; ſince he hath got ſo many advantages over me, he muſt needs have that of civility and complements too; and my ſilence muſt not be accounted any more the effect of modeſty but of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence of his <hi>Letter.</hi> I ſend it you back becauſe you would have it ſo, and becauſe you may make ſome uſe of it in your <hi>Cabinet</hi>; but I

to ſhew them. With <hi>them,</hi> I doe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine my old age with credit, and look as trimme as upon ſolemne daies of Ceremonie. They ſerve me both for to ſupport and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for moveables of neceſsity, and oſtentation too. But the worſt is, that I have nothing here for to requite ſo rare a Preſente, but the ſhape and lineaments of a <hi>vulgar</hi> man, and the ſad repreſentation of my own viſage. As it were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt that I ſhould pretend to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: ſo it is a very <hi>ſoleciſme</hi> that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larchus</hi> calls me a <hi>Narciſſus.</hi> But there are alwaies fooliſh paſsions, and idle curioſities in the world.

               <p>YOur <hi>Letter</hi> was to me an old novelty, and J received it but in the begining of December, though it had been at my houſe ſince <hi>Auguſt</hi>: To unfold this ridle, J muſt tell you, I am newly return'd from a long voyage, and that I found your Letter here at my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall. You may believe, that the name of a man that is deare unto me, did, at firſt encounter of my eye affect me with joy; and that it is no ſmall ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to me, to ſee that I hold a place in a memory, that is ſo occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied and fully fraught as yours. This is to lye downe among a <hi>bed</hi> of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3675:58"/>
when I lye among ſo many brave <hi>Poems,</hi> and rare <hi>diſcourſes</hi> which you containe, is a walking <hi>Library.</hi> And if it be lawfull to tell out the reſt; to be the friend of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Mondory,</hi> is to be a <hi>Favorite</hi> of a thouſand Kings; for indeed you doe ſo lively repreſent unto us the majeſty and magnificence of former ages, that we muſt confeſſe that your repreſentations, are the glorious <hi>Reſurrections</hi> of thoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> which you doe perſonate. And things being thus, take it not amiſſe that in my anſwere I muſt contradict you. You cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the bonnet of <hi>Herod</hi> with that of <hi>Monſ.</hi> the <hi>Advocate</hi> — without doing ſome injury to Royall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and avileing their Purple and Diamonds; without doing your ſelfe a bad office, in leſſening, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3675:59"/>
obſcuring in me thereby (if you could) the great <hi>Idea</hi> which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of you, the day that I ſaw you with that Bonnet. But you may be pleaſed to humble your ſelfe; you cannot deface or blotte out of my memory that firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion and <hi>Image</hi> of majeſty which you there left; and J cannot figure you in my thoughts, but with a commanding accent, and the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a <hi>Master,</hi> farre tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending that inferior <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> which works but by intreaties and remonſtrances. Yet J ſpeak not this, as though J would alwaies conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you under the name and ſhape of another; or that I beleeve, if that you ſhould quit the <hi>Theater,</hi> you would be out of all imployment in the world. The <hi>Letter</hi> which you were pleas'd to write unto me,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3675:59"/>
doth ſufficiently witneſſe, that <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> is your naturall endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that without borrowing from any, you can traffick in very good things of your own. Suſpect not then that I ſhould recant to your prejudice, after this new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of extolling you. On the contrary, J am ready (if need be) to adde ſomething to my former teſtimony. I have many reaſons to reſpect you, and J think I may doe it with the licenſe of our ſevereſt Schooles. Since that having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the ſtage, and purg'd it from all obſcenity, you may glory in this, that you have reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cild <hi>Comedy</hi> with —<hi>Pleaſure</hi> with <hi>Virtue.</hi> And though for my part I ſtand in need of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, yet ſince I deſire not to enjoy but thoſe that are cleanly and which doe not violate honeſty, I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3675:60"/>
doe (with the common voice) give you thanks for the care you have taken, to provide fit remedies, and Antidotes againſt Melancholy, and other untoward paſsions. But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, calling to mind that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed my contentation ſometimes, for the end of your action, and that you aimed oftentimes at me alone, I were ungratefull if I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that I am</p>

my owne lazineſſe would cauſe me to apprehend <hi>it</hi> as a fortune, under whoſe weight J ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually groane and not a place of any eaſe; and J doe leſſe eſteeme of a place of Government that might cumber me, then a <hi>field</hi> of liberty that may ſolace me. Jf you goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time into <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> and doe me the honour to take my houſe in the way, you will verify what J ſay to you; and avouch, that if J were as well cured of all maladies as that of <hi>Ambition,</hi> I had not many wiſhes to commence. Jt is true that ſome company (like that of <hi>Monſieur</hi> your <hi>Brother</hi>) is wanting unto me; and if this were added to my <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage,</hi> J durſt contend with <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> for happineſſe.

Yet he is ſo good &amp; love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he will not, I ſhould learn this diſtaſtfull truth from him; and loves rather to commend a fault, then diſcover it, in a man that is deare to him. He hath written ſuch

                  <hi>polite</hi> things to me, and in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that I dare not ſend forth any replie after his anſwer, leaſt I ſhould be undone by ſo unequall a compariſon. I muſt not attempt this great Deſigne, for the ſucceſſe thereof muſt needs be unlucky, though I ſhould make uſe of <hi>Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries</hi> and demand ſuccours of all the <hi>Latiniſts</hi> of our <hi>Province.</hi> You ſhall tell him then, if you pleaſe, that I doe acknowledge the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage his ſtyle hath over mine, and I think it no diſparagement that I muſt ſtill owe him what I ſhall never be able to pay him. You are kind enough yet <hi>Sir,</hi> to aſſure <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Habert</hi> the Abbat, &amp; <hi>Monſieur</hi> de la <hi>Chamber,</hi> of the conſtancie of my ſervice; and how impatient I am, that the world doth not yet know, in what regard J hold their

vertues. It ſufficeth me that they accept and allow of my affection, and that they teſtifie it unto you with a nod. For to deſire <hi>Letters</hi> &amp; not tickets from them, were to be ignorant of the preſent condition of their life, and the homage that they performe to our <hi>Monarch,</hi> who beſt deſerves it.

               <head>LET. XXXI. To Monſieur De —</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Write unto you with a heart wounded with ſorrow, and make my moane to you, for the ſiniſter opinion, that you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of me, upon the firſt evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that was ſuggeſted to you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me. J thought I had given you a ſufficient aſſurance of the <hi>ſmoothneſſe</hi> and plainneſſe of my ſoule, that you ſhould not have ſo eaſily doubted of it, and entertaine a beleefe ſo injurious to amity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had communicated your jealouſies to your friends, and made them cleere enough. You know <hi>Sir,</hi> more then any other, that my paſsions are not cloſe and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3675:76"/>
reſerved, but I carry my ſoule ſtill in my forehead. When I was not as yet, ſo farre your ſervant as now I am, I did not uſe much <hi>Artifice,</hi> and diſsimulation to perſwade the contrary; and thence you might have deduc'd an infallible conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that if J had chang'd my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, J would not have deceived you with new proteſtations of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. I doe therefore religiouſly proteſt unto you, that honouring you with that <hi>zeale</hi> as I doe, you could not inflict a greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon me, then the <hi>forfeiture</hi> of your favours. But moreover, I doe ſweare to you by all that is <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> in the world, that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing that might deſerve ſuch a cruell puniſhment. After this me thinks you might be confirm'd in the truth, but pardon me if I tell
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3675:76"/>
you, you ſhould have been ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and that I doe extremely wonder, that a weak and groſſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, ſhould quite ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face in your thoughts, the good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions, which J thought I had left there. J cannot hinder mens miſ-conſtructions of me, or binde <hi>Interpreters</hi> from doing violence, and putting my words upon the rack, to make them depoſe things which were farre from my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Sophiſters</hi> make uſe of a true propoſition to inferre an erroneous concluſion; and <hi>Pettifoggers</hi> ſtill cite the Law, to authoriſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, &amp; yet none will taxe Truth to be the cauſe of Error, or Law the mother of injuſtice. I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but my own thoughts (which are ſound and innocent) not thoſe of my adverſaries, which are full of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3675:77"/>
malice and rancor. J am reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable for the things that J have written, and ready withall to maintaine them. But all the <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and fancies of men are not in my power. Every man can make a nimble and ſubtle decipherer of another mans intentions. The ſame picture, according to ſeverall <hi>lights</hi> and poſtures, may have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall repreſentations; and oftentimes there is a great difference between a Text and the Commentaries, the meaning of the <hi>Author</hi> and the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſmes</hi> of <hi>Grammarians.</hi> I ſaid that I knew <hi>ſome ſtrange inſufferable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and no way fit to poſſeſſe and ſway free-borne men.</hi> Therefore I ſaid, that a man, whom J doe infinitely eſteeme and honour was of that humor. Loe here <hi>Sir,</hi> (not to ſay halfe of what I think of it) a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3675:77"/>
very unworthy a <hi>Logician,</hi> and which is as farre from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as from my particular ſenſe. Indeed it was not you, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd it, yet you ſhould not have entertain'd it at ſecond hand; and if it did not ſeeme to you to be pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably falſe, yet you might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murr'd a while, and ſuſpected it; you have done your ſelfe wrong and me too, in conceiving ſo bad a thought of your own merit and my fidelity; in expreſsing that you have ſome diſtruſt of your ſelf, who are of no mean value, and but very litle confidence in me, whoſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſomething worth. I have but litle skill in <hi>fallacies,</hi> and a mean Jugler may ſometimes gaine credit with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nevertheleſſe, I ſhould never have been thus ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd and deluded, and when you
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3675:78"/>
have wrote to me in a dozen Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at leaſt, that you knew ſome men that <hi>wrote pernicious Books,</hi> and maintain'd <hi>Hereticall Propoſitions</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did not yeeld to ſuch an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that this did reflect upon me; and when you ſent a Lackey into this Province, I did not forbeare to ſend you commendations by him. You ſee that I am ſtung, and therefore am ſenſible. If your love were not deare unto me, I could well-enough beare your neglect of me; and if my <hi>zeale</hi> to you were not ſtrong, I ſhould endeavour to ſolace my ſelfe, after your ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating of me. But becauſe I love, I would be requited with love; and I cannot brook to be taxt with a fault, which I thought did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo much as ſuſpition. <hi>Sir,</hi> I am upon the point to publiſh a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3675:78"/>
new Volume of <hi>Letters,</hi> where there be ſome which I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto you, and others, where I make mention of you, as your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues did oblige me; and where will be one alſo, wherein (as ſome would perſwade you) I am injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to you. How I pray, can all theſe agree? can I be both your friend and your foe at once? can I blow with the ſame mouth, both hot and cold? can the literall ſence favour you, and the allegoricall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you? can I doe you wrong, when J muſt needs wrong my ſelfe? ſhall I give an occaſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt by ambiguous termes, where I muſt make my ſelfe ridiculous by apparent contradictions? This was it <hi>Sir,</hi> that was ſuggeſted to your credulity, and which you did not reject at firſt acquaintance, as J had
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3675:79"/>
reaſon to expect from your good diſcretion. Theſe were the falſe ſurmiſes which were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, wherein you found more ſemblance of truth, then in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere proteſtations which J made to you. I cannot conceive (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you have continued your friendſhip towards me, and that I too have not loſt my reaſon) how you could imagine, that I intended in a bravery to diſingage you, and by <hi>thoſe aukeward ſpirits which I had knowne,</hi> I aim'd directly at you, and might not deſigne ſome other as well. J know a great many of the <hi>Gaſcons,</hi> and as there be ſome of them very moderate, ſo alſo there be others that are not ſo. I know ſome of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Corſica,</hi> and J am not ignorant of their naturall gentleneſſe; I know ſome <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:3675:79"/>
and I know how agreeable is their Yoake with that which they call <hi>Caſtiga-vellacos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly you may believe that I have not travel'd blindfold, and I had in vaine converſed with men, if I had not endeavour'd to know them; and yet in this particular, men would faine make all my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be terminated in you, and that I have pardoned a thouſand <hi>Humorists</hi> in the world (to whom my propoſition might be applied) for to violate you. They ſurmiſe, that having an aime to wound ſome body, I made choice of one of my chiefeſt friends for my marke; and that I have murmur'd cloſely and in darke language, that <hi>He is rough and violent,</hi> whom J pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime every where, and with loud accent, ſo <hi>completely wiſe and noble.</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:3675:80"/>
I will not cite unto you mean teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, for the confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this truth. I can alleadge <hi>My Lord,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of — and <hi>My Lord</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> of — of whom is here queſtion made. They know both of them, how farre J am your ſervant, and with what fervency J did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your honour, and intereſts, on a time when occaſion was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. J am willing to believe that your other friends, might ſerve you in ſome ſteed in ſome other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, but in this here, all the whole company (J except no man) was mute. There was not any there, but my ſelfe that ſpake ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly in your behalfe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things that did reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; and the boldneſſe of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection carried me ſo farre, that the <hi>Lords,</hi> whom J now nam'd unto
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3675:80"/>
you, did give me a publicke teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and profeſſed, (though with a litle diſguſt) that I was too good a friend to make a <hi>Courtier</hi> of I am therefore ſomething aggrieved at this time, to be requited thus with obloquie, where I thought I had deſerved thanks; to have preſerv'd my fidelity inviolable towards you, and now to be accuſed of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; to be the only man in your defence on that occaſion, whereof you have cauſe to boaſt, and now to be the onely man of whom you complaine. I doe not uſe to value my ſervices which I performe to my friendes, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſtand up for them man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, without making unto them an account of my proweſſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Sir,</hi> this betraies griefe, more then preſumption, and may bee
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3675:81"/>
term'd defending, rather then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding; Theſe are reſentments which accompany innocence that is offended; and which your facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (abuſed by the malice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) doth force from my heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my will. I will not conceale it from you, you have made a deep wound in it, it makes me think in all my dreames of the injuſtice which I ſuffer at your hand, &amp; you had utterly loſt any friend, that had been leſſe firme then my ſelfe, by putting him to ſuch a hazard. Wherefore <hi>Sir,</hi> for all the revenge that I deſire for the injury which I have received, take it not amiſſe, that I give you this Advice, that you give leſſe credit hereafter to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and more to your ſelfe; that you would be more jealous of thoſe opinions that you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3675:81"/>
upon your firſt acquaintance of a buſineſſe, and leſſe affected to the rumours of the Citty, which are not grounded upon any ſolid foundation. You ſhould conſider the place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence theſe quaint Newes have travelled; weigh the circumſtances of the thing, examin by what <hi>ſpirit</hi> the accuſer was led thereunto: and not examine <hi>His</hi> perſon onely, and paſsion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, but alſo the deſervings of the <hi>party</hi> accuſed, his manner and behaviour of life, and his former actions: ſuſpend your judgement at leaſtwiſe, untill time ſhall give you a more exact and particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of buſineſſes; otherwiſe you ſhall never want diſquiet &amp; vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and you ſhould thus but feed upon ſuſpicion and diſtruſt, which are very unwholſome viands. Men
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3675:82"/>
muſt not ſend you relations of whatſoever an undiſcreet friend or ſome rude ſturdy ſervant, or ſuch and ſuch a neighbour ſhall report unto — they muſt have more care of the tranquillity of your minde; and likewiſe for your part, you muſt not ſweare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the teſtimonies of all the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> that have a plot upon your credulity, and take pleaſure in the paine and exerciſe which they put you unto. If you allow an open gate for all tales and ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to enter in, they will throng in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your houſe apace, and <hi>firſt come, firſt heard.</hi> To day, they will inform you (and perhaps with ſpecious colours too) that your <hi>Privado's</hi> doe divulge your ſecrets; &amp; to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that your <hi>Domeſticks</hi> doe rob and rifle you; and at laſt that all the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3675:82"/>
world is your enimy, &amp; all private conferences are but conſpiracies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you. I conjure you <hi>Sir,</hi> for your owne peace, not to give ſo much credit to thoſe things which doe no way concerne Religion, nor to abandon your ſelfe to thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, who pretend to diſpell me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, when they are fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to whiſper follies into your eares, and to calumniate with a good grace: make a diſtinction betwixt the fraudulent <hi>Arts</hi> of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites and the freedome of ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men; betweene thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore <hi>Fortune,</hi> and thoſe that regard nothing but <hi>Vertue.</hi> For my part, I declare freely unto you that if <hi>Monſieur</hi> the — were rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and would commit his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency to your hands, I ſhould not doe <hi>that</hi> to regaine your favour.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3675:83"/>
what I doe now performe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our friendſhip. At leaſtwiſe I ſhould be more ſtern &amp; ſtubborn (then I am) in my diſpleaſure, and more obſtinate in ſeeking to you, &amp; leſſe ſollicitous of the event of my ſeeking. But I have not yet the skill to complie with the times, and to be ſtill on <hi>Fortunes</hi> ſide; I profeſſe ſuch an <hi>austere</hi> honeſty &amp; goodnes that is not of the preſent times. I would take a pleaſure to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of my friend in <hi>exile,</hi> and be his fellow-priſoner, I would runne under his <hi>Ruine</hi> to beare it off, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I could not help him to ſtand faſt &amp; ſubſiſt. Your <hi>Fortune</hi> being ſo well eſtabliſhed as it is, doth not require any ſuch proofe and triall of fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But it is certaine that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſire of me any <hi>experiments</hi> of love ſo hazardous, but I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

that there remaine but the <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> &amp; the <hi>Will,</hi> wherein I have (perhaps) ſome nook &amp; ſeat.

               </opener>
               <p>BE of good courage, and ſtart not at the opening of my pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; I doe aſſure you before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that it is not my <hi>Ghoſt</hi> that talkes to you, &amp; that the Letter that I write unto you, doth not come from the <hi>other world.</hi> The rumor which was ſcattered concerning my death, hath not killed me; and I am yet, (ſince it is the pleaſure of God) a witneſſe of his works, and an <hi>Adorer</hi> of his power. I have ere this, received the alarme of the like newes; but J am no longer credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to dreams and preſages; my ſoule doth not labour with thoſe <hi>popular</hi> infirmities: and I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3675:88"/>
with that <hi>Grecian,</hi> that all the wiſhes of enimies, all the impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Poets,</hi> and all the falſe bruits of <hi>Fame,</hi> are not able to bring on our <hi>destiny</hi> one houre the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. There is a <hi>Gentleman</hi> in <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogne,</hi> who is Chronicled to have been ſlaine in the Battle of <hi>Yury</hi>; &amp; he is yet very well notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and means to live long. J am <hi>Sir,</hi> of the ſame humor too, and confeſſe to you, that J doe not much hate my life, though J have litle cauſe to love it. Your <hi>Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> indeed, did not beleeve this: they have handled me as though I had been dead indeed, and have imagined withall, that they be my rightfull Heyres <hi>ex aſſe,</hi> having ſeiz'd upon the firſt papers of mine that they could meet with. J am ſomething apprehenſive of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3675:88"/>
and it ſhould grieve me if <hi>Monſieur</hi> — ſhould be the <hi>Author</hi> of it; becauſe J ſhould then endure it with more impatience yet. To ſay truth, if this be not to wound &amp; violate (downeright) the law of Nations, it is (at leaſt) to deflowre and taint it: and you will confeſſe with mee, that it could not bee pleaſing unto me, that the — ſhould be publiſht without asking my conſent thereunto. Had it been ſo, J ſhould not have been (perhaps) very averſe, and J ſhould have deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him only to alter ſomething for my ſake, and ſomething for his owne. For though his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be paſsing good, yet you know well, that our <hi>Grammarians</hi> doe not allow his ſtile for regular; and though their ſcruples be ill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet they muſt be conſidered.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3675:89"/>
That which I would faine have changed, and where I thought I had ſome ſmall intereſt, was one word, which my ancient Enimy had already miſerably mangled; and which, (not wanting ſpirit and life in its naturall place) doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble thoſe delicate plants, which dye as ſoone as they be tranſplanted from their own <hi>banks.</hi> But reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies come now too tardy. J muſt comfort my ſelfe againſt this, as well as other injuries. This is but dallying to former wrongs; and ſuch <hi>pinches</hi> ſhould well be borne with, by a man that never uſeth to complaine of <hi>Treaſons</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates.</hi> For your ſatisfaction <hi>Sir,</hi> let it ſuffice that I have a perfect knowledge of your wiſdome and Honeſty, and that I would truſt you with my life, my honour, and my
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3675:89"/>
fortunes. If J had had ſo baſe a thought as to ſuſpect you in this dealing, J ſhould believe that J were bound to doe <hi>penance</hi> for my ſuſpition. J know that you are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way virtuous, and my firme friend, as I am very really</p>

               <p>I Have received your incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Book: in the which (after a long and tedious peruſall) my <hi>Grammer</hi> could finde no conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3675:90"/>
nor my <hi>Logick</hi> common ſence. This is not the firſt time that that poore <hi>Wit</hi> hath ſtrayed ſo. He hath been, this long time ridiculous without being facetious, and hath been a laughing-ſtock to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and an object of pitty to the wiſe. The late <hi>Monſieur</hi> — did uſe to call him the greateſt enimy that ever <hi>Reaſon</hi> had, betweene <hi>Cales</hi> and <hi>Bayonne</hi>; and ſaid, he was a foole in two ſciences, and in foure languages. Nevertheleſſe if our friend ſhall think him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſome traces of his pen, let us indulge him that exerciſe, with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that he be not violent, and that he put not himſelfe to a heat; that (if it pleaſe him) he doe not deal ſeriouſly with him, or arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at all points, againſt an <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> that deſerves not any encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3675:90"/>
but with pinnes. As for the — you wrong your ſelfe, for to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt the moderation of my ſpirit. Jn the eſtate that J have ordered and ſetled <hi>it</hi> in, I have leſſe paſsion then the King of the <hi>Stoicks</hi>; and J muſt be excited for eight daies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, to the cruelty of hateing any man whatſoever, for one halfe an houre. It is not my intention to write againſt <hi>Monſieur</hi> — but to diſcourſe with him; and I have not ſo litle wit, but that J can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his perſon from his cauſe. He hath obliged me with ſo good grade, and ſpoken of me in ſuch high language &amp; <hi>ſumptuous</hi> termes, that I cannot doubt of his reſpect, or his affection towards me. And he ſhall likewiſe ſee my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, through the whole <hi>file</hi> of my Diſcourſe; wherein I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3675:91"/>
to temper my ſelfe ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, that if I perſwade him not to my opinion, I ſhall not make my proceedings odious; and if I doe not reſt ſatisfied with what he ſaith, I ſhall contradict him but obliquely, and with a kind of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſe,</hi> which ſhall not be diſtaſtfull unto him. This will be (perhaps) the firſt example of modeſty, that hath been heard of among the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants</hi> of this age; and we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to thoſe of that ſide, who talke outragiouſly in <hi>Problems</hi> of ſmall importance; that the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of honeſt men are without choler, and that generous enemies live better togither then malicious <hi>Burghers.</hi> For the reſt <hi>Sir,</hi> I deſire you to continue the paines that you have begun, &amp; to ſend me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with J may fortify all the <hi>Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:3675:91"/>
that are liable to aſſault and battery. I ſhall feare nothing being ſtrengthned with ſo powerfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors; and you will juſtify my cauſe if it be good, or give it a colour of juſtice, if it be not ſo. See what an enterpriſe it was in you to love me: You could never have conceived a more pernicious deſigne for your ſelfe.

               <p>IT is now three Months that I have expected <hi>Monſieur d' Auvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> that I might be informed of the ſtate of your health: But have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lately underſtood that it is not ſo currant as I could wiſh it, and mine being not ſo firme, that J could adventure upon a journey, J have diſpatched one towards you to learne the truth thereof. It will be an incredible eaſe to my mind, if I finde that it was but a falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme, or that your ſickneſſe by this time be over-paſt. J doe hope for one of the two (<hi>Madame,</hi>) becauſe J doe paſsionatly deſire it; but J be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to beleeve that it is long

               <p>I Am (ever this Month) confin'd to my bed, where I received your Letter directed from <hi>Roan.</hi> To read there the continuation of <hi>your</hi> ſickneſſe, could not (you muſt think) be any aſſuagement of <hi>mine.</hi> J beſtow a thouſand curſes upon the waters of <hi>Fórges,</hi> for impairing your health. <hi>Propertius</hi> hath not been more liberall, or beſtowed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3675:106"/>
more upon the <hi>Baiae</hi> that kill'd <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> his Nephew. But a maine difference is, that <hi>this</hi> man was a <hi>Poet,</hi> and did but <hi>act</hi> griefe: but I am truly afflicted; and true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip doth <hi>really</hi> ſuffer more, then flattery can <hi>perſonate.</hi> J am very ſorry that — hath not demean'd himſelfe towards you ſo well as he ſhould have done; and if you have reſolv'd upon his <hi>ruine,</hi> I doe not mean to ſtep in between him and it, and undertake his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I doe ever ſide with all your paſsions without premeditation; and <hi>that</hi> man that doth not pleaſe you, hath no <hi>allurements</hi> ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as can render him pleaſing to me: nevertheleſſe if this mans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence were <hi>veniall,</hi> and your juſtice could be ſatisfied; J would adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to beg his pardon, and would
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3675:107"/>
become his ſurety, that he ſhould willingly undergoe all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that you would inflict upon him, to regaine your favour. There are ſome buſineſſes betweene <hi>us,</hi> that force me to diſſemble a litle, and doe not permit an apparent <hi>rupture,</hi> if there come not from you an expreſſe order to the contrary. But being once freed out of this tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moile, if he be ſo unlucky as to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you againe, I declare unto you that I doe even now renounce him; and J had rather forget my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, then to carry affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons repugnant to yours. Your <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> is too generous to oblige (ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) a man whom he never knew; and J had rather beleeve, that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of me, is but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of your love, then to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be an apprehenſion of any
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3675:107"/>
merit in mee. J doe purpoſe a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age beyond the ſeas the next year; If J take ſhip at <hi>Diepe,</hi> as J hope to doe, J ſhall not faile to goe and kiſſe <hi>His</hi> hands at <hi>Röan</hi>; &amp; to make him ſee that the <hi>Monſter,</hi> that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goulu</hi> ſpeaks of, is a <hi>tame</hi> Beaſt, (at leaſt) and capable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If J did exceedingly rejoyce at the newes, when a <hi>Canonſhip</hi> was beſtowed upon you, J forgot how farre this <hi>Dignity</hi> was below your <hi>deſerts.</hi> It ſufficeth me, that I give you ſome teſtimony that I am not ſorry for it; and that J conſider it (as in the croude) among other Benefices that ſhall fall upon you; knowing that ſome few mens lives (that be not yet dead) are the onely obſtacles to your <hi>Virtues.</hi> J expect by the firſt <hi>Poſt,</hi> ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

many; But men muſt not alwaies, be judged by the lineaments of the face, and <hi>that averſation</hi> is unjuſt, which ſprings only out of deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p>I Have returned no anſwere to your Letter, in regard J have been cumbred (lately) with ſome domeſtick affaires, which would allow me no leaſure to write; it is your <hi>Prerogative,</hi> to be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſeverall things at once: you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſo calme, that you can read a <hi>Dialogue</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch a dozen buſineſſes too at once, with a reſolve to dye an houre after. For my part, one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is enough to <hi>imploy</hi> me, and it is impoſsible for me to <hi>reconcile</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and Buſineſſe. That which you tell me of <hi>Monſieur</hi> — is true. The Letter which he wrote unto
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3675:124"/>
me is an abridgement of all his Books; and J cannot returne an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, though J would, but by the <hi>meſſenger</hi> that goes the next year from <hi>Angouleſme.</hi> But though it hath been told you, yet be pleaſed not to believe it, that this Letter of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends me, or that <hi>mine</hi> hath given any offence. Only upon occaſion of one litle word, he took a hint to ſport it after his ordinary manner, and to make a new ſhew of his old manner of boording. We muſt be indulgent to our friends mirth, and give way (a litle) to their <hi>jolly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</hi> Nay, a man ought not to doe his enimy all the diſcourteſies he can; and to be very ſenſible of a wrong, is to adde <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> to it.

A thouſand <hi>Chartells</hi> cannot tempt me to one <hi>Duell,</hi> and J can be more coward, then the <hi>Hott-ſpurres</hi> of the times are quarrelſome.

What was wont to tickle and pleaſe me, hurts me. An <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack</hi> and an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> I eſteeme alike. Thoſe ſimple termes of <hi>ſtile, phraſe,</hi> and <hi>period,</hi> are ſo harſh to my ears, that they make my head ake. If it

But you will confeſſe notwithſtanding, that the bottome of this heart is not bad.

               <p>MY ſpirits have been ſo dull and heavy theſe three daies, that it is beyond imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Never did any man looſe the <hi>reliſh</hi> of all Books and <hi>Arts</hi> as I did; and hence you may gather that <hi>that</hi> which you ſent me, was very <hi>delicate,</hi> when it procur'd an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to a <hi>languiſhing</hi> man. You have ſtrangely altered me in a moment: my ſoule is touched to the quick; and you have made it ſo hungry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge, that I have no mind to any thing but to your <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> If you will ſet up a <hi>Sect,</hi> J am ready to <hi>enrole</hi> my ſelfe, at leaſt wiſe I
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3675:137"/>
will ſubſcribe willingly to that <hi>franke</hi> doctrine, which maintaines its liberty againſt the <hi>uſurpations</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; and is contented to ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>lawfull</hi> power, but not to be ſlave to the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man. I ſpeak <hi>Sir,</hi> as J believe: Doubtleſſe your work will laſt, and to give you your full due, J muſt give it in your own language: noble an act of the <hi>Soule,</hi> is not the weakeſt argument we have of <hi>its</hi> immortality; and if any ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after take in hand this ſubject, he will be beholding to you for this new argument, which your mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty would not permit you to make uſe of. Certainly there were no reaſon nor colour, that the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring ſhould be of a better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the <hi>mother,</hi> and that thoſe <hi>productions</hi> which muſt encounter
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3675:138"/>
                  <hi>Time,</hi> and conquer <hi>Fate,</hi> ſhould flow from a corruptible principle. But ſince J have ſped ſo well in my firſt ſollicitations, J deſire not to ſtoppe there. This good ſucceſſe doth encourage me to redouble them, and in the name of all the <hi>Learned</hi> to begge yet more worke of the ſame vigour. Though J ſhould performe no other office in the common-wealth of <hi>Learning</hi> then this, J were not an unuſefull member; and this will be (one day) honour enough for me, when it will be ſaid, that I gave the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile for thoſe labours which you have undertaken.

                  <salute>Sir,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THe <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> which you did me the honour to ſend me, is full of an infinite number of good things; and none can deny but your friend is both learned and judicious. Nevertheleſſe I doe not think that he will find in that place whither he goeth, that approbation which he promiſeth to himſelfe: I think that (for his ſpeaking <hi>Latine</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> manner) his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is better then his expreſsion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He is not alwaies ſo <hi>regular</hi> as I would deſire; and his words doe ſometimes <hi>doe</hi> wrong to his thoughts. True it is, that in theſe times we are very <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>delicate</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:3675:139"/>
in the purity of expreſsions. We can brooke no ſtile that is licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous be it never ſo litle; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not after the <hi>garbe</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> is accounted <hi>barbarous.</hi> This is not, that I am of the opinion of <hi>Monſieur de</hi> — that ſaid that the good man <hi>Iudgement</hi> could never paſſe beyond the <hi>Garond</hi>; and that <hi>He</hi> was put into ſuch a fright at <hi>Blaye,</hi> that he durſt not adventure any farther. When he ſpake this, he forgot (ſure) that <hi>Monſieur de Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac, Monſieur de Montagne,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinall d' Oſſat</hi> were <hi>Gaſcons</hi>; and their ſolid judgements which are admired to this day over all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> doe ſufficiently refute that <hi>poore</hi> jeſt which paſſeth among ſome for excellent. It is certain that <hi>Reaſon</hi> is common to all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and conſequently is of <hi>that,</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:3675:139"/>
where they ſay <hi>Adieu-ſias,</hi> as well as when they ſay <hi>Dieu vous conduiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.</hi> It is confin'd to no place, and we may finde ſubtlety among the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> and ſtupidity among the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi>; but indeed, for the <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> it is not all alike: without queſtion in ſome places, they ſpeak better then elſewhere, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a <hi>Courtier</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did taſt ſome thing of <hi>Padua</hi> in the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> it is not impoſsible to obſerve in the writings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations of your men ſome <hi>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> of their <hi>Province.</hi> Ever and anon, you ſhall obſerve them to let ſlip <hi>vouſiſt</hi> for <hi>vouluſt, fauſiſt</hi> for <hi>faluſt, couſin mien, &amp; ie ſuis esté a Thoulouze,</hi> which marre all good ſpeech: and their <hi>allarent, donuarent armarent,</hi> have runne over their

banks, &amp; come as farre as our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The late <hi>Monſieur de Mal herbe</hi> hath told me ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he did what poſsibly he could for to correct the dialect of <hi>Monſieur de</hi> — &amp; purge it of <hi>Gaſconiſme,</hi> but could never bring it about: ſo difficult is it, to wipe off our <hi>naturall</hi> ſtaines, and utterly to weare out the <hi>badge</hi> of our Countrey. Nevertheleſſe for all this, neither the <hi>Patavinity</hi> of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Livius,</hi> nor the <hi>Gaſconiſme</hi> of ſome of our times, doe hinder them from being reputed <hi>Eloquent</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for one petty fault, either of <hi>uſe</hi> or of <hi>Grammer,</hi> I condemne not thoſe works which in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, are excellent. To ſatisfy your deſire, I have ſent by <hi>Monſieur de</hi> — the <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Monſieur Heinſius,</hi> one whereof preceded my <hi>Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:3675:140"/>
the other followed his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Now that I have furniſhed you with theſe two <hi>Letters,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine you a while; be pleaſed not to take it amiſſe that I take leave of you, and all the world for two years. I am forbid to write any thing for ſo long a time, and this is an oath that J have taken by the order of my Confeſſor; and upon good and waighty conſiderations. I hope God will give me the grace to obſerve it:
<q>Nec mihi ſcribendi veniet ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dira cupido;</q>
And <hi>you</hi> will not (J am ſure) tempt me to ſinne, and provoke me to break that ſilence which J have ſworne to. But though you ſhould ſolicite me a thouſand times, and aſſault me every day in two or three languages, I am reſolved to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3675:141"/>
be <hi>inexorable,</hi> and not to be moved with that happy abundance of your words. Jf you terme me <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civill,</hi> and expoſtulate with me in the words of your <hi>Poet,</hi>
