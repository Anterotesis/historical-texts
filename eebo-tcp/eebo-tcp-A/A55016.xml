            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Nations Excellencies in <hi>Dramatick Poetry</hi> have been so extraordinary, and our Performance both in <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi> have discover'd such strange <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s, that we have some reason to believe, that we have not only surpass'd our Neighbours the Moderns, but likewise have excell'd our Masters the Ancients. But the want of Knowledge of the Ancients has been one great Reason for our setting our selves so very much above 'em; for tho' we have many Beauties which they wanted, yet it must be own'd, that they have more which we have not, except it may be some very few of our Pieces. But then their Excellencies are far less known to us than ours; for the Common People are unacquainted with their Languages, and the more Learned sort, for want of due Observance and Penitration, have been ignorant enough of their <hi>essential</hi> Beauties; they, for the most part, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves with considering the <hi>superficial</hi> ones, such as the <hi>Stile, Language, Expression,</hi> and the like, without taking much notice of the Contrivance and Management, of the <hi>Plots, Characters,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98426:143"/>
But a considerable Discovery of these Excellencies has been made by means of a late Version of <hi>Terence,</hi> especially by the help of the <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Remarks:</hi> And this has made me hope, that two or three Plays of <hi>Plautus</hi>'s cou'd not be very unacceptable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; and since the principal Fault of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks</hi> in that Version was their being too short, I have made these somewhat longer and clearer, hoping they will prove the principal means of recommending this Book to the World, even tho' the Translation had been brought to the utmost Perfection it was capable of: a Thing which I dare never pretend to. I made Choice of the same three which Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> had done before me; those being, in many respects, fitter for my purpose. But before I come to Particulars in those Things, I shall give some Character and Account of my Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plautus,</hi> if consider'd as a <hi>Dramatick Poet,</hi> may justly enough be stil'd the Prince of the <hi>Latin Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> for tho' most of 'em are lost, and consequently little capable of being judg'd of, yet, from all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we have good reason to presume that they never came up to <hi>Plautus;</hi> so that there is no one to stand in competition with him but <hi>Terence:</hi> But if <hi>Comedy</hi> consists more in <hi>Action</hi> than <hi>Discourse,</hi> then <hi>Terence</hi> himself must be oblig'd to give place to our Author; and as <hi>Terence</hi> ought to be esteem'd as a Man who spoke admirably, <hi>Plautus</hi> is to be admir'd as a <hi>Comick-Poet.</hi> The principal Differences of these two Poets have been touch'd upon in the Preface to the English <hi>Terence;</hi> and from thence it will appear, that <hi>Plautus</hi> had the vaster <hi>Genius,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:98426:143"/>
               <hi>Terence</hi> the more exquisite Iudgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Persons they copied, as the later was call'd the <hi>Half Menander,</hi> so the former may be stil'd the <hi>Half Aristophanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Terence</hi>'s Stile was generally more refin'd and pure, and withal more elaborate than this Poet's; yet undoubtedly, <hi>Plautus</hi> was a most absolute Master of his Tongue, and in many Places there appear such a Sharpness and Liveliness of Expression, nay and such a Neatness and Politeness too, that is scarce to be found in <hi>Terence;</hi> and this, perhaps, may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd <hi>Varro</hi> to say, <hi>That if the Muses were to speak Latin, they wou'd certainly make use of his very Stile;</hi> and <hi>Tanaquill Faber</hi> to call <hi>Plautus, The very Fountain of pure Latin.</hi> As to <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Raillery, Terence</hi> might by no means be compared to him; then he is not always so happy, but often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates to a Meanness that <hi>Terence</hi> wou'd never have been guilty of; and tho' his <hi>Jests</hi> and <hi>Repartees</hi> were sometimes admirable, and often far above <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>'s, yet they were many times as much below him, and by their Trifling and Quibbling, appear to have been calculated for the Mob. This, probably, made <hi>Rapin</hi> observe, <hi>That he says the best Things in the World, and yet very often he says the most wretched.</hi> A little before he says, Plautus <hi>is inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in his Designs, happy in his Imaginations, fruitful in his Invention; yet, that there are some insipid Jests that escape from him in the Taste of</hi> Horace; <hi>and his good Sayings that make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laugh, make sometimes the honester s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rt to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ty him.</hi> The most remarkable Thing in his Stile,
<pb facs="tcp:98426:144"/>
is the natural and unaffected <hi>Easiness</hi> of it, I mean in opposition to <hi>Stiffness,</hi> which with the true <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> and <hi>Propriety</hi> of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Discourse,</hi> seems almost its distinguishing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and sets him above any other <hi>Roman</hi> Author in that respect. 'Tis true, <hi>Terence</hi> has all these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and perhaps is more exact in <hi>Propriety of Terms,</hi> and in his Choice of <hi>Words,</hi> yet his extream Closeness and great Elaborateness, I presume, has made it somewhat less <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Familiar,</hi> or at least it wou'd be so if any other Man of less Iudgment had managed it. So that what I mean is, that <hi>Plautus</hi>'s Stile ought rather to be imitated for <hi>Common Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> than <hi>Terence</hi>'s. <hi>Plautus</hi> had the Misfortune of living in a worser Age than <hi>Terence,</hi> therefore there must be a larger Allowance for his <hi>Obsolete Words,</hi> his <hi>Puns,</hi> and <hi>Quibbles,</hi> as well as those Words that were peculiar to the Theatre and his Subjects, which if once transplanted, wou'd never thrive elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Next, may be consider'd our Authors <hi>Characters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and in that point indeed, <hi>Terence</hi> triumphs without a Rival, as was observ'd in the <hi>Preface</hi> to that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and for a just and close Observance of <hi>Nature,</hi> perhaps no Man living ever excell'd him. It ought to be observ'd, that <hi>Plautus</hi> was somewhat poor, and made it his principal Aim to please and tickle the Common People; and since they were almost always delighted with something new, strange, and unusual, the better to humour them, he was not only frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extravagant in his <hi>Expressions,</hi> but likewise in his <hi>Characters</hi> too, and drew Men often more Vicious,
<pb facs="tcp:98426:144"/>
more Covetous, more Foolish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than generally they were; and this to set the People a gazing and wondering. With these sort of <hi>Characters</hi> many of our modern <hi>Comedies</hi> abound, which makes 'em too much degenerate into <hi>Farce,</hi> which seldom fail of pleasing the Mob. But our Author had not many of these; for a great part of 'em were very true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and such as may stand the Test of the severest Iudges. His two most remarkable <hi>Characters,</hi> are his <hi>Miser,</hi> and his <hi>Bragadocio;</hi> and that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may the more clearly understand the nature of these <hi>Characters,</hi> their Resemblance to some of ours, and their Unlikeness to those of <hi>Terence,</hi> I shall give a Translation of some part of 'em. First then, take the First Act of his Third Comedy call'd <hi>Aulularia,</hi> which begins with the Old Covetous Fellow and his Maid.</p>

I shall not criticise upon the
<pb facs="tcp:98426:149"/>
Particulars, but leave the Reader to judge their Differences; but only I may observe, that when</hi> Characters <hi>are carry'd too high, as many of ours are, they may probably make an Audience laugh very heartily, but can give 'em but small Pleasure; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others will give 'em great Delight, tho' less Laughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am afraid I have dwelt too long upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, therefore I pass on to our Author's</hi> Plots. <hi>In that respect, he had not often that</hi> Art <hi>and</hi> Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>that</hi> Terence <hi>had, nor in all his Plays was so</hi> regular <hi>as he; tho' in several he was, particularly in those I have chosen. But then his Scenes were commonly less languishing, his</hi> Incidents <hi>more surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and his</hi> Surprizes <hi>more admirable; undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had more of the</hi> Vis comica, <hi>which I may tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate</hi> Liveliness of Intreague, <hi>than</hi> Terence. <hi>His</hi> Subjects <hi>were all more</hi> Simple <hi>than the other's, but I am apt to believe, that will be reckon'd but a very small Commendation in our Nation, who are but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lovers of such thin Dyet, as they call it. His</hi> Narrations <hi>are more lively and sharp than those of</hi> Terence'<hi>s, and, I think, every whit as natural and as well brought in: I'm sure in some of 'em he can never be out-done as to his way of bringing of 'em in. As for the General Rules of the Stage, I refer the Reader to the Preface to</hi> Terence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Author's principal Fault was, his mixing the</hi> Representation <hi>with the</hi> Theatral Action <hi>in many places, where he often makes his Actors speak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and directly to the Spectators; a Fault that</hi> Terence <hi>was not wholly free from. This our
<pb facs="tcp:98426:150"/>
modern Plays, I think, are never guilty of; only in our</hi> Monologues <hi>and</hi> Asides, <hi>our Actors have got a custom of looking so full upon the Spectators, that it seems but one degree better. But our Author is not guilty of this in these three Plays, except in</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitryon, <hi>and that by way of</hi> Prologue, <hi>nor of any other Faults but what, I believe, I have shewn in my</hi> Remarks. <hi>And these that I have here chosen, are no ways inferior to</hi> Terence'<hi>s in matters of</hi> Plot <hi>and</hi> Intreague, <hi>but in some respects superior, tho' not so elaborately wrought up, or always with that Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so that these may undoubtedly prove excellent Models for our Poets Imitation, provided they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Differences of Tastes, Humours, Ages, and Persons, and keep to those principal Beauties they already possess, some of which are undoubtedly above the Ancients. Only</hi> Terence <hi>will teach 'em one thing that</hi> Plautus <hi>does not, to wit, the great Cunning of working in</hi> Under-Plots, <hi>and still preserving the</hi> Unity of Action; <hi>for</hi> Plautus <hi>has none of them. As for the Necessity of Rules, the Objections against 'em, and the wonderful Perfection our Plays might arrive to by a more close Observance of 'em, I must once more refer my Reader to the Preface to</hi> Terence. <hi>It was principally upon the Poets Account, and for all such as are desirous of understanding and judging the Excellencies of Dramatick Poetry, that I translated these Plays. If it be objected, that the Poets, Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and Lovers, as well as Iudges of Dramatick Poetry, do most of 'em understand the Original; I must deny the Truth of it, tho' several of 'em do: But if they did, these will be much more proper for their
<pb facs="tcp:98426:150"/>
Design, especially by means of the</hi> Notes <hi>and</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks; <hi>and the Reasons I urg'd for the translation of</hi> Terence, <hi>bear a greater force in this Author, for here is a greater Obscurity, by reason of corrupted Copies, wrong Points, false Divisions of whole</hi> Acts <hi>as well as</hi> Scenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>besides a greater number of knotty and obscure Passages, than in</hi> Terence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tho' this was my principal, it was not my only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of translating this Author, for I had all the way an Eye to School boys, and Learners of the</hi> Latin <hi>Tongue: Therefore, upon that account, I have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept perfectly close to his Sence, but almost always to his Words too; a thing not only extream difficult in an Author so frequently verbose, but oftentimes dangerous too: And for an Instance, I need not go any further than the very first Sentence of the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue <hi>to</hi> Amphitryon, <hi>which if I had made shorter, I cou'd have made better. I can't forbear mentioning a Passage in the third Act of the same Play, which just now comes to my remembrance:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which I have translated, perhaps, too closely thus;</hi> I'm sure, had ye either Wit, or Discretion, or weren't the greatest Fool in Nature, you'd ne'er hold Discourse, either in Mirth or Earnest, with the Woman you believe and declare a Strumpet. <hi>I'm confident many other Translators wou'd not have been
<pb facs="tcp:98426:151"/>
so scrupulously nice, but have made shorter work of it. But I have not only been so scrupulous in this Case, but I have likewise imitated all his Faults and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, whenever I cou'd do it without extream Injury to the Translation; I speak of his</hi> Puns, Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Rhimes, Gingles, <hi>and his several ways of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon words; which indeed were the Faults of his Age, as it was of ours in</hi> Shakespear'<hi>s and</hi> Johnson'<hi>s days, and of which</hi> Terence, <hi>as correct as he is, is not perfectly clear. Our Author's playing upon words are of that various nature, and so frequent too, I need not go far for a single Instance, which shall be in the fore part of the Prologue to</hi> Amphitryon:

               <hi>Which I have translated thus;</hi> I desire nothing but what's reasonable, and feasible; for 'tis a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable God requires Reason from a reasonable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but to require Roguery from reasonable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is base; and to expect Reason from Rascals, is nonsence; since such People neither know Reason nor observe it. <hi>Our Author's Wit did many times consist in his playing upon Words; a great pity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for a person who was so well able to writ after a more substantial way, of which we have many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Instances. Besides his Quibbling, partly from his Carelesness and Necessities, he hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a vein of</hi> Trifling, <hi>which was but very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
<pb facs="tcp:98426:151"/>
and on those places the Reader must make some allowance for the translation, and not expect more than the Matter will well bear. As for our Author's</hi> Jests <hi>and</hi> Repartees, <hi>for what we know of 'em, I took a particular care in preserving their Force; and for the most part, I presume, I have done it in a great measure, sometimes by a lucky hit, or a peculiar happiness of our Tongue, other times by a little Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty taken, and when all have fail'd, the</hi> Remarks <hi>have generally supply'd the Defect, a way I was forc'd to content my self withal in many places; the worse they were, they were frequently more difficult to preserve, therefore I thought it as well to slur over some few of the meaner sort. Several of his</hi> Jests <hi>and bits of</hi> Satyr <hi>are undoubtedly lost to us, not only in respect of our Language, but also our Knowledge, and this sometimes makes his</hi> Sence <hi>a little obscure. And as the</hi> Sence <hi>of an Author ought to be his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator's chiefest Care, so it has been mine; and tho' I cannot affirm, that I have kept to it in every passage, yet I believe I have often done it where a common Reader will think I have not; and I think it no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to my self to say I have hit it on many places where the Common Interpreters have missed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After all, I dare not pretend to say, that this Translation equals the Original, for there is such a peculiar Air in this Author as well as</hi> Terence, <hi>that our Tongue seems uncapable of, or at least it does so to me. Yet still if 'twere always read with the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, it wou'd make far more for me than otherwise. In short, the Reader ought to look upon this as a Translation of an Author who had several Faults, and
<pb facs="tcp:98426:152"/>
such places, as the</hi> English <hi>must of necessity appear mean, being little b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tter in the Original; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise as an Author of Antiquity, some of whose Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Manners will appear a little unco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>th and unsightly, in spight of all a Translator's Care. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to be as like my Author as I cou'd, especially in that which I reckon his distinguishing Character, to wit, the natural and unaffected easiness of his</hi> Stile, <hi>and as this seems the most capable of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so I believe I have been more successful in this Particular than in any other: and that is the main Reason I have had so many Abbreviations, to make it appear still more like common Discourse, and the usual way of speaking. Perhaps I may be thought to have been too bold in that point, because I have had some that are not usual in Prose; therefore I don't set this way as a Copy for any one to follow me in, nor shall I use it myself in any other Piece. I have all the way divided the</hi> Acts <hi>and</hi> Scenes <hi>according to the true Rules of the Stage, which are extreamly false in all the Editions of this Author, especially the</hi> Scenes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To make this Translation the most useful that I cou'd, I have made</hi> Remarks <hi>upon each Play, and those are of two sorts, tho' equally intermix'd: The first, to shew the Author's chief Excellencies as to his Contrivance and Management of his</hi> Plots <hi>and</hi> Incidents; <hi>the second, to discover several Beauties of</hi> Stile <hi>and</hi> Wit, <hi>principally such as are not very clear, or cannot well be preserv'd in our Tongue; and those are likewise to vindicate my Translation. Several of these I must own my self oblig'd to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:98426:152"/>
Dacier <hi>for, or at least the hint, tho' some of 'em I cou'd not have miss'd of in the prosecution of those Designs I aim'd at. I have borrow'd little or nothing from any other, for her's are far the best</hi> Notes <hi>I ever met with, tho' many of 'em were done more to shew her Parts and Reading than for any real use, a thing which I shall never aim at. I have been forc'd in most of 'em to be extream nice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in penetrating into the bottom of the Author, for I find it far more difficult to discover a Beauty than a Fault. I might have enlarg'd upon 'em, and have made several more, with good grounds, but I thought it dangerous to say all that cou'd be said; but instead of that I was forc'd, much against my will, to dash out several of those upon</hi> Amphitryon <hi>upon the account of the Printer, but the rest are more full and compleat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If business wou'd have permitted me, I shou'd have ventur'd upon three more of our Author's Plays; and upon that Account, I have taken somewhat less time than was necessary for the translating such an extraordinary difficult Author; for this requires more than double the time of a</hi> Historian <hi>or the like, which was as much as I cou'd allow my self. I made choice of these three Plays as well for their</hi> Modesty <hi>as</hi> Regularity, <hi>for above all things I wou'd by no means give the least Encouragement to Lewdness or Obsceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which grow too fast of themselves; and therefore I thought I cou'd not chuse better than after a Lady.</hi> Amphitryon <hi>had the Name, and never fail'd of a general Approbation;</hi> Epidicus <hi>was our Author's Favourite, and truly there is much Art in it, tho' it
<pb facs="tcp:98426:153"/>
is a little heavy; and</hi> Rudens <hi>is in several respects a better Play than any of</hi> Plautus'<hi>s or</hi> Terence'<hi>s. I'm afraid</hi> Amphitryon <hi>will bear the worse in our Tongue, upon the Account of Mr.</hi> Dryden'<hi>s, whose Improvements are very extraordinary; but consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr.</hi> Dryden'<hi>s Management is of such a different Nature, this will still be as useful and as proper for my</hi> Design, <hi>or at least to School boys and Learners. I must do that great Man the Iustice in saying, that he has not only much improved the</hi> Humour, Wit, <hi>and</hi> Design <hi>in many places, but likewise the</hi> Thoughts. <hi>I'll mention one, which just now comes into my mind.</hi> Alcmena <hi>in the Second Act complains thus:</hi> How poor and short are this Life's Pleasures, if once compar'd with the Sorrows we endure? 'Tis Man's Destiny, and Heaven's Pleasure, to mix our Joys with bitter Potions; and for some few Hours of Satisfaction, we meet with Ages of Ills and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. <hi>Mr.</hi> Dryden, <hi>by the help of Blank Verse, and a little more room, has better'd it extreamly.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Ye niggard Gods! you make our Lives too long:</l>
                  <l>You fill 'em with Diseases, Wants, and Woes,</l>
                  <l>And only dash 'em with a little Love;</l>
                  <l>Sprinkled by Fits, and with a sparing Hand.</l>
                  <l>Count all our Joys, from Childhood ev'n to Age,</l>
                  <l>They wou'd but make a Day of ev'ry Year:</l>
               </q>
               <hi>And to carry it on further yet, and to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more fine and clear, he says,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Take back your Sev'nty Years, (the stint of Life)</l>
                  <l>Or else be kind, and cram the Quintessence</l>
                  <l>Of Sev'nty Years into sweet Sev'nty Days:</l>
                  <l>For all the rest is flat, insipid Being.</l>
               </q>
               <pb facs="tcp:98426:153"/>
               <hi>I mention this the rather, because it may serve for one Instance of what Improvements our Modern Poets have made on the Ancients, when they built upon their Foundations. For we find that many of the fine things of the Ancients are like Seeds, that, when planted on</hi> English <hi>Ground by a Skilful Poet's Hand, thrive, and produce excellent Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I'm afraid this</hi> Preface <hi>has been too long and tedious for this small Piece; but the Press stays, and the hast I'm in will not permit me to make it shorter, or so much as review it; yet before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I must inform the Reader, that I had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of another's doing their Plays before me; from whose Translation I had very considerable Helps, especially in the</hi> Jests <hi>and</hi> Quibbles.</p>

                        </gap>'t is, this</hi> Jove, <hi>whose Messenger I am, is as fearful a Fellow as some o'you; and no wonder if he be so, since his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were both Mortals. Now I, his own Son, am a little infected wi' my Fathers Cowardice; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I'm come in a very civil way t' offer ye Peace. I desire nothing but what's reasonable and feasible, for 'tis a reasonable God requires Reason from a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable People; but to require Roguery from reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble People, is base; and t' expect Reason from Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals, is Nonsense; since such People neither know Reason, nor observe it.—Pray,</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>listen to what Im to tell ye. Your Wishes certainly ought to go along with ours; for, my Father and I were always Favourers o' you, and your Republick. How often, in other Tragedies, have I seen the Gods,</hi> Neptune, Vertue, Victory, Mars, <hi>and</hi> Bellona, <hi>bragging o' those Favours t' ye, which my Father, the King of Heaven, has been the prime Founder of? But 'tisn't my Fathers way, to hit grateful People i' the Teeth with old Kindnesses, but thinks all his Favours deservedly bestowed.</hi>

                     <hi>Now,</hi> Gallants, <hi>I shall first propose my Demands, then tell ye th' Argument o' this</hi> Tragedy.—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>[He looks steadily on the Spectators] <hi>Why that Frown now?—Is't because I call it a</hi> Tragedy? <hi>Why I'm a God; I'll transform it, if ye please, out o'</hi> Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>into</hi> Comedy, <hi>and ne'er alter a Verse. Are ye willing or not? But what a blockheadly Question
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98426:156"/>
was that for a Deity to ask, as tho' he cou'd be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant o' your Pleasures? I know your Minds to a Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and I'll make it a Hodge podge, a</hi> Tragi-Comedy; <hi>for there's no Reason t'ha't all</hi> Comedy, <hi>when Kings and Gods are Actors in't. But how shall we do, now a Slave has the principal Part? Why, as I told ye before, 't shall be a</hi> Tragi-Comedy. <hi>Now,</hi> Gentlemen, Jupiter <hi>intreats ye by me, t' or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guards t' inspect</hi> Pit, Box, <hi>and</hi> Gallery, <hi>and if they find any suborn'd to clap an</hi> Actor, <hi>to take his Cloak for a Pawn. But to those</hi> Actors, <hi>who shall make Parties to gain the Prize, either by Cunning, Letters, Messengers, or Themselves, or corrupt th'</hi> Edils <hi>to break their Oaths;</hi> Jove <hi>orders a Punishment equal to ones buying o' Votes i' the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for himself or others. He says, 'tis Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits make Conquerors, not Ambition and Treachery; and why shou'dn't the</hi> Players <hi>Laws be as strict as the Magistrates? Merit's the best Mark for Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not Favours; but he who does well, can want none, while he meets with impartial Iudges. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewise commands me to have</hi> Inspectors <hi>over th'</hi> Actors, <hi>that if any one has his Emissaries to Clap, or by his malicious Bungling hinders anothers Applause, he shall have his fine Cloths stripp'd o'er his Ears, and soundly lash'd, I wou'dn't ha' ye won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now at</hi> Jove'<hi>s troubling his Head about the</hi> Players; <hi>nay don't, good now! for he is to make one himself i' this</hi> Comedy.—[He pauses.] <hi>Why make ye such a Wonderment? As tho' ye never heard of</hi> Jove'<hi>s turning</hi> Player? <hi>A Year ago, when the</hi> Players <hi>invok'd him in a pitiful</hi> Farce, <hi>he came to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98426:157"/>
their Assistance; and certainly he will in a</hi> Tragedy. <hi>I tell y' agen, that</hi> Jupiter <hi>himself is to play his Part, and my Godship with him: Therefore, pray listen well to th' Argument o' this</hi> Comedy.</p>

He's now General o' the</hi> Theban <hi>Army against the</hi> Telebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; <hi>but before he went to the Campaign, he got his Wife wi' Child. (I'm sure y'all know my Fathers Good Nature, his large Allowance upo' these Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how much he makes of a Sweet Bit.) It seems, his Mouth watering at</hi> Alcmena, <hi>unknown to her Husband, he borrows her upon Interest, fairly enjoys her, and gets her wi' Child too.

                        <p>Well, I see things fall out otherwise than either I, or any other Citizen hop'd for; that is, t'have us come home alive again, and Conquerors.

                           <q>That if they'd free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any Constraint, deliver up their unjust Spoils, with th' Authors o' such outrageous Actions, and make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for what they had dispos'd of; he'd immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire home with all his Troops, send th' Argives to their own Country, and leave all things in a peaceable and quiet Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture: But if they were so obstinate as to refuse these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Proposals, their Town must expect th' utmost Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties o' Fire and Sword.</q> At the Delivery o' this Message, <hi>according to my Lord's Orders, these haughty Men, proud o'their own Strength and Courage, very roughly treated our Envoys, telling 'em,</hi> 
                           <q>They knew how to defend what they had got, by their drawn Swords; and therefore we had best speedily draw off our Troops from their Dominions.</q> Upo' the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt <hi>o' this rude Answer,</hi> Madam, <hi>my Lord advanc'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 'em with his whole Army. The</hi> Teleboans <hi>did the like with their Troops from the Town, accouter'd with the finest Equipage i' the World. After th' Approaches of these two numerous Armies, each Man and Officer in his proper Post, they drew up their Troops in Battalia, we after our own Way, and the Enemy after theirs. Next,</hi> Madam, <hi>the two Generals advanc'd to the Fronts of each Army, and there parley'd; agreeing to this Article,</hi> 
                           <q>That the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd shou'd deliver up their Cities, Lands, Gods, and Selves, to the Mercy o' the Conquerors.</q> Upon this, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the shrill Trumpets sound, the spacious Valleys eccho, the Soldiers shout on all sides, the Generals send their Prayers

Still not a Man turn'd his Back, or stir'd a foot out o' the Place he fought in; they chusing Death sooner than quitting their Posts, and fell where they stood, keeping their Ranks after Death. My Lord finding such Obstinacy, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Cavalry o' the Right Wing to Wheel about and Charge; these he pour'd in upon 'em with horrible Outcries, mangling and treading under foot these Impious Men, with prodigious Slaughter.—</p>

I now expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience it, and my self's a plain Witness of this: How short was this last Pleasure! I had the Privilege of one Nights Company with my Lord; and then, snatch'd away before the Morning. Methinks I'm the most desolate of Widows i'th' Absence o' the Man I love 'bove all the World; and his Departure carries more of my Soul away, than his Arrival brought with it: However this joys my Heart, to see him Victorious o'er his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Foes, and laden with Honours; 'tis that I live upon. He's gone; but since he returns with deserved Glory, I'll patiently bear his Absence, with all the Firmness and Courage of a Woman; and shall think my Troubles well rewarded, in a Husband crown'd with the Name of Conqueror. For Valour's of all Rewards the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; preferable to all Things else; the sole Defender and Protector of our Liberties, Safeties, Lives, Estates, Parents, Countries, and Children.

I sooth him in his Wenching, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him, pimp for him, counsel him, and rejoyce with him; and whene're he receives a Pleasure, it proves ten times as much to me.

                  <p>THE <hi>Subject</hi> of this Play is the most <hi>single</hi> that can possibly be, it being only the Birth of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and likewise the most noble of all the Comedies of the Ancients; not only for the bringing forth of such a Hero, but also for its At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance by no less than two Gods, and with Thunders and Lightnings. This <hi>Subject,</hi> tho' great, is naturally very barren, especially if compared with many others; but this makes the Poet's Art appear still greater, in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Incidents</hi> sufficient for a whole Play, when he had so little matter to work upon: and in the natural Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of <hi>those,</hi> he is admirable.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Prologue</hi> is spoken by <hi>Mercury,</hi> not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was the most proper Person to say and relate such Things as the Poet had most occasion for; but likewise, because it wou'd not have been so <hi>probable</hi> for another Person to have been abroad at that time of Night.</p>

Pag. 3. lin. 17. &amp;c. <hi>By</hi> Jove'<hi>s Orders I came,</hi> Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'<hi>s my Title, sent hither by my Father to beg your Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.] Mercury,</hi> being in Disguise, and not in a Machine, as soon as he cou'd take breath after his long-winded Sentence, he tells the Spectators who he is. For tho, from that Sentence, they might pretty well guess at him, (more perhaps from his <hi>Offices</hi> than his <hi>Oratory)</hi> yet the Poet takes care to make every thing perfectly <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>intelligible,</hi> to the Spectators; that, above all things, they might never be at a Loss as to the <hi>Plot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pag. 5. l. 3. <hi>And I'll make it a Hodge-podge, a Tragi-Comedy.] Faciam ut commixta sit Tragico-comaedia.</hi> This is the only Play among the Ancients, that was call'd <hi>Tragi Comedy;</hi> and this but in jest neither. But <hi>Plautus</hi> meant no such thing as we do by our Word <hi>Tragi-Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> as appears by the four following Verses: For always among the Ancients, the Representation of Kings and Great Mens Actions, made a <hi>Tragedy,</hi> and those of Common Persons, <hi>Comedy,</hi> whether the <hi>Catastrophe</hi>'s were prosperous or not, in either. If I had translated it, a <hi>Tragical-Comedy,</hi> perhaps it might have been nigher the Author's Design, and as agreeable to the Comical Humour of him who spoke it.</p>
                     <p>Ibid. l. 8. &amp;c. <hi>T' order the Guards t' inspect Pit, Box, and Gallery, and if they find any suborn'd to clap an Actor, to take his Cloak for a Pawn.] Ut conquisitores singuli in subsellia eant per totam caveam, spectatoribus, si cui fautores delegatos viderint, uti iis in caveâ pignus capiantur togae.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were so great Encouragers of Plays, that they constantly order'd a Reward for him who play'd his Part best, which was paid him by the <hi>Edils,</hi> who were sworn to do Justice; and this often caus'd great Contests and Parties among 'em. I translated, <hi>Conqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitores, Guards; Subsellia,</hi> and <hi>totam caveam, Pit, Box, and Gallery;</hi> and <hi>Togae, Cloak,</hi> because they are the same in effect. I always take the like Liberty in such Cases, and that without any Design of changing the Scene to <hi>London.</hi>

                  <head>REMARKS UPON EPIDICUS.</head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Play, Plautus</hi> was always very fond of, and reckons it his best; but as for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deserts of it, I shall determine nothing. The <hi>Subject</hi> of it, is the Discovery of <hi>Thelestis,</hi> and all the Lines of the Play tend to that Centre, tho there is no manner of appearance of it till the Fifth Act, which makes the Poet's Art the more fine and excellent. Tho the <hi>Subject</hi> is not perfectly <hi>single,</hi> for <hi>Stratippocles</hi> loses a Mistress as he finds a Sister, yet there is perfectly an <hi>Unity of Action,</hi> and, like the rest of his Plays, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Under-Plots.</hi> This Play is very short, yet there is great Variety in the <hi>Plot</hi> and <hi>Incidents,</hi> and an excellent Management through the whole: So close it is, tho perfectly clear, that it requires some Attention to comprehend all exactly, at the first Reading. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, it is very remarkable, That <hi>Plautus</hi> has truly drawn the People of his Age, as the Distrust of Old Men, the Eagerness of Young, the Vanity of Soldiers, the Impudence of Courtizans, and the Treachery of Slaves.</p>

                     <hi>YE must know, I dwell i' the Celestial Palaces above, a Subject o' that mighty God who shakes all Nations, Seas, and Earth. I'm a bright and shining Constellation, as ye see me,</hi> Arcturus <hi>by Title, one who ne'r fail'd to keep regular Hours, both here and in Heaven. In the Night-time, I twinkle i' the Sky, and among the Gods; when day comes, I converse wi' Mortals, as the rest o' the Constellations do, who ha' the same Commission from above.</hi> Jove, <hi>the Grand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of Heaven and Earth, every day disperses us through all Countries, t'inspect th' Actions, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Religion, and Fidelity o' Mortals, that the Goddess o'</hi> Riches <hi>may reward 'em as they deserve. When e'r we meet wi' Fellows who hire Knights o' the Post in Law-Sutes, and Rascals who for swear themselves in Chancery, we return their Names in writing to</hi> Jove, <hi>who each day is inform'd of all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98426:91"/>
whom the Gallows groans for. He knows each Man that's perjur'd, or bribes his Iudge to gain his Cause; upo' which, he brings it about i' th' upper Court, and sets a severer Fine upon his Head than the loss of his Cause wou'd ha' come to. The Names o' the good Men he keeps in a Book by it self. Now these Rogues fool themselves with a fancy that a lusty Present, and a Sacrifice, will make amends for all; but they lose their Labour and Cost too: For</hi> Jove <hi>accepts not the Prayers of perjur'd Villains. But the Prayers of an honest Man's heard a thousand times sooner than of one o' these Rascals. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, good Gentlemen, let m' advise ye, you who are honest indeed, and have always been good and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, ne'r to recede from your Principles, that so you may ha' the Comfort of 'em.—Now,</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen <hi>I'm ready to wait upon ye, and tell ye th' Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument o' the Play.</hi>

                     <hi>First then,</hi> Diphilus <hi>calls this City,</hi> Cyrene. <hi>Here dwells</hi> Demones <hi>in the Field, in a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Village by the Sea-side; a good honest well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing old Gentleman, forc'd to leave</hi> Athens, <hi>and take up here. 'Twas no ill Prank that drove him from his Country; but his Generosity to others, prov'd so injurious to himself, as it ruin'd his Estate at last. Sometime since, he had a little Daughter, who was kidnapp'd away, and sold to a Villanous Slave-Merchant, who brought her home to</hi> Cyrene. <hi>Now it seems, a young Gentleman o' this City, and formerly of</hi> Athens, <hi>by chance spies this Girl coming from the Musick-School, and immediately is stricken with her; goes strait to the Merchant,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98426:91"/>
bargains with him to have her for threescore and fifteen Pounds, gives him earnest, and swears him to Fidelity. Now this Son of a Whore, like the rest of his Gang, valuing neither Promise nor Oath, goes immediately to a Banker of his, a</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian <hi>of</hi> Agrigentium, <hi>an old Rascal as ill as himself, and a publick Bane to the City. This Man he wheedles with the huge Commendations o' this Girls Beauty, and others he had with him, so gets him to go over with him to</hi> Sicily: For, <hi>says he,</hi> there the People are mightily given to their Pleasures, and Women are their best Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, so you may get an Estate in a little time. <hi>Upo' which, a Ship is prepar'd underhand; the Merchant claps all his Effect on board, and flams off the young Gentleman, who bought this Girl, with a pretence he was going to perform a Vow to</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.—<hi>This Temple here, is the Place; where he has invited the Spark to Dinner. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately gets on board, and carries off Bag and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. The Gentleman upon hearing o' this News, goes strait to the Haven, and there finds the Ship got clear off from the Shore.—I, seeing the Girl thus forc'd away, resolv'd at once to save her, and ruin the Rascal. Therefore I stirr'd up the blustring Winds, and swell'd th' Oceans Waves: For</hi> Arctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus <hi>is the most turbulent Constellation i' th' Heavens; outragious when rising, but more outragious sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.—At present, both Merchant and Guest are thrown upon a Rock, which split their Ship in pieces. This Girl I told y' of, and another with her, in a fright, are leap'd into the little Boat; and are now
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98426:92"/>
driven by the Tide, from the Rock towards the Shore, and old</hi> Demones'<hi>s House, which is now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roof'd by the Wind; and this is one of his Servants that's now coming out his House. The young Spark will be here strait who bought this Girl o' this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.—</hi>

I should not think these Miseries so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, had I offended against Heaven, or my Parents: But if I've been so exact i'my Duty to both, it seems
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98426:95"/>
unbecoming, O ye Gods, nay unjust, and unreasonable, t'afflict me thus. Ah what dreadful Punishments must Villains meet with, if vertuous Persons be so hardly dealt withal? If I cou'd call to mind any o' m' own or Parents Faults, I shou'd bear it better; but 'tis my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's, I'm punish'd for; his Crimes fall heavy upo' my Head. He has lost his Ship, and all he's worth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept me, th' only remainder of his Fortune; for my Companion i'the Boat, is perish'd, and now I'm all alone. Were she but safe, her Company wou'd ha' been some relief to my Griefs. But now, what hope, help, or Counsel am I capable of? I'm forc'd to wander all alone i'these wild Desarts. On one side, craggy Cliffs; on th' other, the Ocean's foaming Surges; and not a living Soul to meet with. My Cloaths are my Riches; and I know neither where to find Sustinence, or a House to hide my Head in. What desire can I have to live then? I'm a Stranger to this Place; ne'r was here before this Time.—Ah wou'd some good Body wou'd but direct m'into some Road, or Foot-Path.—Shall I take this way, or that way? I am n't able to resolve; and I can't perceive a foot of Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Land hereabouts. A Chilness, a Faintness, and the great Fright, ha' seiz'd on all my Joints. Alas, my dear Father and Mother! you know nothing o' these sad Afflictions.

How ready she is too, to heat the Water to wash us withal!—Now I'll go ask for some, that I might n't make her stay.— <stage>[She knocks at <hi>Demones</hi>'s Door]</stage> So ho! who's at home here?—Any Body here?—None to come out? <stage>[Knocks again.</stage>

But the Man who carries himself warily, carefully and cunningly, may long enjoy his well-gotten Goods.

                  <head>REMARKS UPON RUDENS.</head>
                  <p>THis Comedy is call'd <hi>Rudens,</hi> or the <hi>Cable,</hi> but with so little Reason, that Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> chang'd the Name in her Version, and call'd it <hi>L'Heureux Naufrage,</hi> the <hi>Happy Shipwrack,</hi> which indeed is the more proper Name of the two. The <hi>Subject</hi> of this, as well as the last Play, is not so noble as that of <hi>Amphitryon,</hi> it being chiefly the Discovery of <hi>Palestra,</hi> yet the variety of <hi>Incidents</hi> affords more Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion than <hi>Amphitryon,</hi> and the Decorations of the Stage, is finer than either that or <hi>Epidicus;</hi> or indeed, than any of his, or <hi>Terence</hi>'s Plays. The <hi>Catastrophe</hi> ends more to the satisfaction of the Spectators than <hi>Epidicus,</hi> for here is not only the Discovery, but the Marriage of <hi>Palestra.</hi> The Poet's Management is the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this Play, for bringing to pass so many several <hi>Incidents</hi> in such a private, and almost unfrequented Place, without offending the least against Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>

                     <head>The PROLOGUE.</head>
                     <p>THE <hi>Prologue</hi> is spoken by a God, because, only such a one can be supposed to know all what is there related; and by <hi>Arcturus</hi> in particular, because he was most generally believed to raise Storms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests in the Sea, therefore the more proper for this <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> The Fore-part of this <hi>Prologue,</hi> exactly shews the Opinions, Morality, and Doctrin of the Pagans in these Times.</p>
                     <p>Pag. 152. l. 19. Diphilus <hi>calls this City, Cyrene.]</hi> This was <hi>Diphilus</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Comedian, from whence <hi>Plautus</hi> borrowed the Subject of this and some other of his Comedies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibid.</hi> l. 20. <hi>Here dwells</hi> Demones, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> This is the beginning of a <hi>Narration</hi> of all what pass'd before the opening of the Stage, a thing very inartificial in a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> because it is spoken immediatly and directly to the Audience. This was <hi>Plautus</hi>'s usual way in the rest of his <hi>Prologues,</hi> tho' not in so ill a manner as in that of <hi>Amphitryon,</hi> where he foretels the <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> which of all things ought to be conceal'd. The principal Fault of this, is the letting the Spectators know that <hi>Palestra</hi> is <hi>Demones</hi>'s Daughter, which takes away much of the Pleasure of the Surprize; and seems but one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree beneath that of the Discovery of the <hi>Catastrophe.</hi>

                     <p>Pag. 153. l. <hi>penult.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Girl I told y' of, and another with her, in a Fright, are leap'd into the little Boat; and are now driven by the Tide, from the Rock towards the Shore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>]</hi> This is the latter end of the <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> and here the Stage opens; and the Poet (as in the two foregoing Plays) has contriv'd it as nigh to the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> as it is possible; but the several <hi>Incidents,</hi> he has laid, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd before-hand, still put it off, and furnishes mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sufficient for five Acts. This is one of the principal Secrets of a <hi>Dramatick Poem.</hi>
