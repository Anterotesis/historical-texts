            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. Containing the nature and vse of this Treatise.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He purpose and drift of this Treatise is to effect three things:</p>
            <p>First to extract <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> out of all <hi>Theologie</hi> contained in the Scriptures such truths,<note n="3" place="margin">
                  <hi>Things intended in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</hi>
               </note> as are of necessitie to be beleeued vnto saluation; the knowledge whereof is required of all: In the defence whereof we should be ready to suffer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest things, euen death it selfe; and which wee should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the very <hi>Characters</hi> of true Religion, the distinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21382:13"/>
whereof we should lay vp, as great riches.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, to gather out of the Scriptures such euident proofes of each of those truths, as might make a full assurance and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of heart in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular beleefe of them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, to poynt out the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall vses wee should make of these fundamentall truthes, and for what excellent purpose they may serue vs all the daies of our life.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The benefit of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this course.</hi>
               </note>Singularly great would the profit of this <hi>proiect</hi> be, if there were a heart in man to vse a little diligence in matters of so great moment. Is it not a meruailous benefit in this contending world for a man to know distinctly, what truthes be infallible; and to haue the truthes, that are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to be beleeued,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21382:13"/>
separated from such, as a man may bee ignorant of, and yet bee saued?</p>
            <p>And for the second thing, it is certaine, the most <hi>Christians</hi> knowe their groundes but by heare-say, and the common iudgement of others: whereas here they may bee informed of them so, as to knowe them by proofes of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which with a little labour they may commit to memory, as seed-plots of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
            <p>And for the third, what is the reason, that Common-place Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie is so out of vse in popular teaching? or that <hi>Catechismes</hi> are looked vpon so dully, and learned or taught with so little profit? but that the vse of such doctrine hath not been distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed: so as men thinke of <hi>Principles,</hi> as of certaine inferior
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21382:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
truthes, because they see other points in textuall course hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with directions for the vse of them. Whereas it is certaine, that no doctrines in Religion haue more abundant vse in the life of man, nor more vrged with varietie of vses in the Scriptures, then the heads of <hi>Catechisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this course.</hi>
               </note>And for the warrant of the proiect, it is euident, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did make a separation of truthes, and did extract the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall truthes out of the maine body of doctrine, and those they deliuered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as the common treasure of all the Saints: and those both for the honour and vse of them they described by diuers titles.</p>
            <p>They were called <hi>the principles of the praises of God,</hi> Heb. 5.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The principles of the doctrine of Christ,</hi> Heb. 6.1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:21382:14"/>
               <hi>The doctrines of foundation</hi> in the same place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The patterne of wholesome words,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The forme of the knowledge of the truth,</hi> Rom. 2.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The forme of doctrine, into which they were deliuered,</hi> Rom. 6. All which titles shew the singular vse of them.</p>
            <p>Now if any aske mee,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </note> how I will know a <hi>Principle?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answere by these markes.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answere.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>First, it is such a truth to bee beleeued,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Principles may bee knowne three waies.</hi>
               </note> as is contained in the <hi>expresse words</hi> of Scripture: so as I take a Principle to bee a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine plainely expressed in the Word: and so differ from Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, that are deduced from the Scriptures onely by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or are there but in darke and obscure words.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>Principles</hi> are <hi>first
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21382:15"/>
truths,</hi> that is such, as haue been from the beginning, and haue been beleeued in all ages of the Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they are such truthes, as being stubbornely and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied, the whole building falles downe, and men hold not the foundation. Besides, any man may be guided herein, that will make vse of the iudgement of the Churches in their Creedes and Confessions, and <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes</hi>; though it be true, that if men narrowly obserue the most <hi>Catechismes,</hi> they either haue not all Principles in, or else they haue more then <hi>Principles,</hi> such truths, as are strong meate, and so prooue hard sayings to the weake. Neither am I so transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any ouerweaning of my selfe in this proiect, but that with all readines I shall subiect my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21382:15"/>
herein to the correction of the godly learned: if my labor may prouoke others more suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to perfect this worke with such exactnes, as is further requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, I shall reioyce in it, and thinke I haue attained a happy end.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but that this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour may be of great vse for yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Diuines to point out a way, how they may <hi>Catechise</hi> with more profit by making the vses of euery Principle, as they teach the grounds to the people: yea, it is one part of the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> daies best imployment in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to treate in this, or the like manner; and so to let the people bee truly informed concerning the <hi>Characteristicall</hi> truthes in their <hi>Religion,</hi> with vse of them in their conuersation.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it will be some content
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21382:16"/>
vnto ingenious mindes, to see the <hi>Principles</hi> cast into some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the helpe of memorie and quickening of delight, and the more easie learning of them.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That they are the very word of God, or they flow from God by diuine inspiration.</p>

of themselues alone, to guide vs in all things needfull to saluation, without adding ought to them, or diminishing ought from them.</p>
            <p>For the first, that they are by diuine inspiration, is infallibly euident from the testimony of the Scriptures themselues, such as these. 2. Tim. 3.16. before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
            <p>2. Pet. 1.20.21. <hi>So that ye first know this, that no prophecie of the Scriptures is of any priuate interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For the prophecie came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moued by the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for our more abundant satisfaction,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs are the very word of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies externall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</hi>
               </note> there are other testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that prooue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to bee the very word of God, and these both <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internall.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:21382:18"/>The <hi>externall testimonies</hi> are such as these:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The diuine reuelations, with which they were graced from heauen. For God was visibly present with <hi>Moses</hi> the writer of the Law, and God testified his presence also by the cloud and smoke about the Arke, in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and Temple: Fier from heauen deuoured the sacrifices, and God gaue answere by the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The conuersion of the soules <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of men by the power of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the comfort the godly finde in them in all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

            <p>The <hi>internall testimony</hi> is the witnesse of Gods <hi>spirit,</hi> who in the hearts of the godly doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch so much, and this is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony proper to the houshold of God.</p>
            <p>Thus of the first <hi>principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second <hi>Principle</hi> is, that the <hi>scriptures</hi> are perfect, which these places shew:</p>
            <p>2. Tim. 3.17. <hi>That the man of God may bee absolute, being made perfect vnto all good workes.</hi>

Lord is perfect, conuerting the soule: the testimony of the Lord is sure, and giueth wisdome vnto the simple.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Iohn 5.39. <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for in them you thinke to haue eternall life, and they are they, which testifie of me.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Since they are of God, and so perfect, wee should rest vpon the directions, and comforts we find in them, and establish our hearts in all things wee learne out of them; Rom. 15.4. <hi>For whatsoeuer things are written afore time, are written for our learning, that wee through patience, and comfort of the scriptures, might haue hope.</hi> They are a sure word; we may rest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, 2.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We should care to reade, and heare these <hi>Scriptures</hi> with al due

preparation and attention, and high estimation, receiuing them as the word of God, and not of man: 1. Thes. 2.13. labouring to bring cleane hearts, and a meeke and teachable spirit to them, as being able to saue our soules: Iames 1.21.22. with a resolution to doe whatsoeuer God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in them.</p>
            <p>We should loue them aboue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> all treasures, accounting them more deare, then thousands of gold and siluer, and reckoning the sentences learned out of Scriptures, as the fairest orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can decke vs: Deut. 11.18.19.

            <p>We should therefore make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> them the rule of all our actions, and come continually to them to see, <hi>whether our workes bee wrought in God,</hi> and shewing the power of the word in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration

of the apparant life of it, in commanding all our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions, that men may see the light of the word in the light of our good workes.</p>
            <p>Phil. 2.15. <hi>That wee may bee blamelesse and pure, and the sonnes of God, without rebuke in the midst of a naughty and crooked nation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom you shine as lights in the world.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 119.105. <hi>Thy word is a lanterne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my path.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea we should daily try and search the secrets of our hearts by it, as that which only can doe it. Heb. 4.12. <hi>For the word of God is liuely, and mighty in operation, and sharper then any two edged

sword, and entreth through euen vnto the diuiding asunder of the soule and the spirit, and of the ioynts and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee should therefore in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> questions and controuersies let the Scriptures iudge, and <hi>thinke of no man, aboue what is written,</hi> Gal. 1.7. 1. Cor. 4.6. Esay 8.20.</p>

               <hi>God</hi> made man at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the first after his owne image: Gen. 1.26. <hi>Furthermore God said, Let vs make man in our owne image according to our likenesse, and let them rule ouer the fish of the sea, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. 11.7. <hi>For a man ought not to couer his head, for as much as he is the image of God, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this image of God chiefly consisted in knowledge, holinesse, and righteousnesse, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. 7.29; <hi>Onely loe, this haue I found, that God hath made man righteous: but they haue sought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inuentions.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Note, that I say, chiefly (as that which is a principle): for else man was created after the image of God:</p>

            </p>
            <p>The power of his freedome was such, as he could doe all things conuenient to his estate; whether,</p>

            <p>Both of making his body. He did not say, let it bee; but as it were, framed all with his owne hands; the man of the dust, the woman of the rib:</p>
            <p>And of inspiring his soule, he breathed the breath of liues into him,</p>

the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also of the dust of the ground, and breathed in his face breath of life, and the man was a liuing soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He begat his soule as it were a diuine sparke or particle of God; therefore called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of spirits, Heb. 12.9. Zach. 12 1. Acts 17.28.</p>
            <p>And in both he saith, <hi>let vs make</hi>; calling all the Trinitie to the care and workmanship.</p>
            <p>But especially that hee should as it were, be made like vnto God himselfe; and therefore let vs sing, as Psal. 8.3, <hi>What is man that thou thus mindest him, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>

            <p>The liberty they tooke to adde or detract fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods word: they added the word <hi>touch,</hi> and they detracted, when they said, <hi>lest ye die</hi>: and these three sinnes are, and euer will be, causes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacie</hi>; if they bee not preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, let vs here bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, while wee liue to keepe out of the company of such as fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the truth, as the diuell did: for all <hi>Apostates</hi> are like the diuell; they will not be quiet, till they make others fall away with them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we should hence for euer be warned to looke to our selues, and make conscience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21382:57"/>
of lesser <hi>sinnes</hi>: we see heere what the eating of an apple did, which the most men would faine thinke was but a small matter; and the rather, because mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous sinnes may be committed about a smal offence in it selfe. Thinke of the man that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red stickes on the Sabbath day, and of the case of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must get on our armour,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and make all the prouision wee can against the <hi>Diuell.</hi> Wee see here how he thirsts after the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of man; and if hee preuailed so ouer <hi>Adam,</hi> how much more easily may he preuaile ouer vs? and if hee could deceiue by the meanes of a serpent there; how much more now, when he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to vs by men like our selues? yea then we saw a proofe of it, For how quickly was <hi>Adam</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed,

when the diuell spake to him in the mouth of <hi>Eue</hi> his wife.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In particular, foure sorts must be warned: <list>
                  <item>1. First, women should heere bee much humbled, and for euer be mistrustfull of their <hi>Counsels,</hi> and carriage: for <hi>Satan</hi> knowes how to make vse of them still.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, men must take heed of the whisperings, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing aduice of women.</item>
                  <item>3. Thirdly, the weake must carefully looke to themselues, that <hi>Satan</hi> imploy not them as instruments of tentations; and they should learne not to bee so violent in things they are not fully grounded in.</item>
                  <item>4. The strong must take heed lest they fall: If <hi>Adam</hi> fell in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi> they are in more danger now in the world; neither may
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21382:59"/>
they trust in their owne gifts, but learne to place all their trust in God.</item>
                  <item>5. As any are more godly, so they must know they shall bee more assaulted.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Thus for instruction.</p>
            <p>This doctrine of the fall hath matter in it of extreame humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, in that eternall shame lies vpon our nature by this vile offence, both in respect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of our losse, and the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full displeasure of God.</p>
            <p>Lastly, it may comfort the godly to thinke of their estate by <hi>Christ,</hi> hauing receiued the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a better condition, then euer they could haue had in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>; and the rather, because they are now confirmed as the <hi>Angels</hi> of heauen, that they can neuer fall from the happinesse they haue in <hi>Christ.</hi>

               <hi>The Lord looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men, to see if there were any that would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and seeke God.</hi>

            <p>First for information, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in 9. things. For hereby we may know:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there can be no iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by our workes, Rom. 9.20. <hi>Therefore by the workes of the law shall no flesh hee iustified in his sight; for by the law commeth the knowledge of sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 130.3. <hi>If thou (O Lord) straitly markest iniquities, (O Lord) who shall stand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For euery mouth must bee stopped, and all the world bee guilty before God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the cause of all Gods dis-regard of vs, and the miseries that befall vs, is in our selues.</p>
            <p>How can we murmure at our crosses, if wee looke vpon our sinnes? There is mercy in the greatest <hi>Iudgement</hi>: for it is his
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21382:65"/>
mercy wee are not consumed, Lam. 3.22. <hi>It is the Lords mercy that we are not consumed, because his compassions faile not, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Adams</hi> one sinne deserued it, what doe all these in vs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it will neuer goe well with the wicked, though God forbeare for a long time, Eccles. 8.11.12. <hi>Because sentence against an euill worke is not executed spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: therefore the heart of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men is fully set to doe euill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But it shall not be well to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, neither shall hee prolong his dayes; he shall be like a shadow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he feareth not before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That no man hath cause to brag of his good nature, there are so many springs of sin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file a man, are from within, in himselfe, it is not any outward

deformitie, ill cloathes, naturall foulenesse, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That a little repentance will not serue the turne.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That there is difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the wicked, and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in sinning.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Concerning Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the death of <hi>Infants:</hi> we kill young snakes and adders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will sting, as well as the old, because they haue stung.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Say not, God is the cause of our ruine: nor is it thy chance, or ill lucke, or onely the diuell, that brought thee into this or that mischiefe: it is thine owne ill nature.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for humiliation:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
            </p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, to such wicked men as liue in open sinnes, yet repent not. Why doth their hearts ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them away? Iob 15.12.14.</p>
            <p>Haue the workers of iniquitie no knowledge? are they guiltie of so many reasons, and fallen into the hands of a righteous <hi>Iudge,</hi> and yet secure?

                  </item>
                  <item>6. They abound in inward sinnes, by which God is vexed, as Genes. 6.5. <hi>When the Lord saw that the wickednesse of man was great in the earth, and all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the thoughts of his heart were onely euill continually:</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can set vp<gap reason="illegible: crossed out" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="3">3.

Psalm. 14.7. <hi>Oh giue salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto Israel out of Zion, when the Lord turneth the captiuity of his people, then Iacob shall reioyce, and Israel shall be glad.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The last vse is for consolation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, to all men for the <hi>Lord</hi> vseth this, as an argument of pitie and mercy, Genes. 8.21. <hi>And the Lord smelled a sauour of rest, and the Lord said in his heart, I will hence forth curse the ground no more for mans cause: for the imaginations of mans heart is euill euen from his youth, neither will I smite any more all things liuing, as I haue done.</hi> Isaiah 48.8.9. <hi>I knew that thou wouldest grieuously trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse; therefore haue I called thee a transgressor from thy wombe: yet for my name sake will I deferre, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The meanes of foundation is twofold.</p>

            <p>Concerning <hi>Election,</hi> there are these euident <hi>Principles:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, that there was a choice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and <hi>Election</hi> made by God, Eph. 1.4. <hi>As he hath chosen vs in him, before the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that this choice was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> before the foundation of the world, Ephes. 1.4. as immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before, Rom. 9.11. <hi>For ere the children were borne, and when they had done neither good nor euill, that the purpose of God might remaine according to the Election, not by workes, but by him that called, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That onely some men are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> chosen, not all men. If all were taken, how could there be <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:21382:82"/>
&amp;c, Matth. 20.16. <hi>Many are called, but few chosen</hi> Mat. 22.14.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That the cause of our <hi>Election</hi> is the onely free grace of God, not our workes, Ephes. 1.5. <hi>Who hath predestinated vs, to be adopted through Iesus Christ vnto himselfe, according to the good pleasure of his will, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 9.15.18. <hi>For he saith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Moses; I wil haue mercy on him, to whom I will shew mercy: and will haue compassion on him, on whom I will haue compassion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therfore he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will, he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> That Gods <hi>Election</hi> is vnchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, all the <hi>Elect</hi> shall bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, Rom. 8.30. <hi>Moreouer, whom he predestinated, them also he called; and whom he called, them also he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; and whom he iustified, them also he glorified, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:21382:82"/>Isaiah 46.10. <hi>My Counsell shall stand, and I will doe whatsoeuer I will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>But the foundation of God remaineth sure, and h<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Matth. 25.34. <hi>Then shall the King say to them on the right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit ye the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundations of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The consideration of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of mans <hi>Election</hi> should teach vs diuers things:</p>
            <p>Euery one of vs should stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this doctrine of our Election, and labour to make it sure, seeing here lieth the foundation of our

grace: now one labor doth both, if we make our calling sure, wee make our <hi>Election</hi> sure, 2. Pet. 1. 10: and we may be sure our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is right, if we adde vertue to our faith, if we can find the gifts of grace in our hearts: for this (I fay) we must study the doctrine of the signes; of which before.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If we find assurance of our <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> we should with all thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes acknowledge Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to vs, and the riches of his free grace, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> teacheth vs, Ephes. 1.3. and 2.

vs with the fauour of his chosen, Psalm. 106.4.5. <hi>Remember me, O Lord, with the fauour of thy people, visit me with thy saluation,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>That I may see the felicitie of thy chosen, and reioyce in the ioy of thy people, and glory with thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>God hath chosen vs, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs with a holy calling; and therefore we should as a people peculiar vnto him, be zealous of all good workes, and shew forth the vertues of him that called vs, and walke before him with all desire to please him, that hath thus <hi>Elected</hi> vs; we should euer be ready to choose the Lord to bee our God, and to shew it by auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him, and by walking in his waies, as these Scriptures plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully shew.</p>

            <p>Deut. 26.16.17. <hi>This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these ordinances &amp; lawes, keepe them therefore, and doe them with all thine heart, and with all thy soule.</hi>

               <hi>Thou hast set vp the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walke in his waies, and to keepe his ordinances, and his commandements, and his lawes, and to hearken to his voice.</hi>

            <p>Ephes. 1.4. <hi>As he hath chosen vs in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, and

            </p>
            <p>Wee should giue our names to God, as they that will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and deuote themselues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> Isaiah 44.1.5. <hi>Yet now heare, O Iacob, my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and Israel, whom I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.</hi>

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21382:86"/>
God, and chuse the godly, as the persons wee would most obserue, admire, loue, defend, and liue withall, Ioh. 15.17. <hi>These things command I you, that yee loue one another.</hi> Iohn 17.26. <hi>And I haue declared vnto them thy name, and will declare it, that the loue wherewith thou hast loued me, may be in them, and I in them, &amp;c.</hi> Yea we should not haue the glorious faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> in respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to despise poore <hi>Christians,</hi> and onely respect great men: for God hath chosen the weake things of this world to confound the mighty, and the poore hee hath chosen to be made heires of the Kingdome, and rich in faith, Iames 2.5. 1. Cor. 1.27. Yea, we should be content, as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle</hi> saith, to suffer all things for the <hi>Elects</hi> sake, seeing they are so deare to God, 2. Tim. 2.10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:21382:87"/>We may know our <hi>Election</hi> by two sorts of signes: First, the one respects God: Secondly, the other respects our selues. God declares his eternall choise by diuers markes of it, and man proues himself to be <hi>Elect</hi> of God by diuers tokens of it.</p>
            <p>God shewes whom hee hath chosen from euerlasting three manner of waies:</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Election</hi> in time, when God separates a man from the world vnto himselfe and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: It is a manifest signe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection:</hi> it shewes an eternall choise, when God singles a man out from the multitude of carnal and carelesse men, and inspires him with an vnchangeable reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to deuote himselfe to God: it is an euident declaration of Gods predestination to glorie; God separates a man from the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21382:87"/>
world, when he makes him a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of wicked and vnprofitable society; and takes away from him the taste in earthly things, so as the loue of the world is not in him, and sanctifies him to his owne vse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the entertainement God giues them in his house, and especially by the efficacy of the word, and principally by the life of the promises: for God makes his word a word of power, and the holy Ghost falles vpon their hearts, and they at sometimes feele a maruelous assurance in hearing, and so much comfort, that they can receiue the word, though it be with much afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reioyce greatly in it; and the word transformes them also to a constant desire of practice, &amp; imitation of the godlines of the Saints, 1. Thes. 1.4.5.6. <hi>Knowing,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21382:88"/>
beloued brethren, that ye are Elect of God:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For our Gospell was not vnto you in word only, but also in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ye became followers of vs, and of the Lord, and receiued the word in much affliction, with ioy of the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 65.4. <hi>Blessed is he whom thou chusest, and causest to come to thee, he shall dwell in thy courts, and we shal be satisfied with the pleasures of thine house euen thy holy temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 9.8.11. <hi>That is, they which are the children of the flesh, are not the children of God: but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of promise are counted for the seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By the sanctification of their afflictions, euen by the many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of Gods loue in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as when God comforts
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21382:88"/>
their hearts in the midst of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, when they come to him making their mone; and when he turnes the crosse to a blessing to them, making them more humble by it, exercising their gifts, purging out their sinne, &amp;c. and at the length giuing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deliuerances, causing all to worke together for the best, so as they themselues being <hi>Iudges,</hi> they can say it was good for me, that I was afflicted, Rom. 8.28.29. <hi>Also we know, that all things worke together for the best to them that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpose, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 119. in many places.</p>
            <p>Now as God manifests his owne choie by these and such like signes; so the godly make sure their owne <hi>election</hi> by diuers markes of it, as generally by the sanctification of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21382:89"/>
beliefe of the truth, 2. Thes. 2.13. <hi>But we ought to giue thanks alway to God for you brethren, beloued of the Lord, because that God hath from the beginning chosen you to saluation through sanctification of the Spirit, and the faith of truth,</hi> so in particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the vertues of <hi>Christ,</hi> which more or lesse in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shine in them, such as are <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, piety, knowledge, temperance, and contempt of the world patience in aduersitie,</hi> and other excellent sauing graces in them, 2. Pet. 1.5.6.7.10. 1. Pet. 2.9. By their fruits you may know them, Ioh. 15.16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, by the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of godlinesse, that are in them aboue al others, Ephes. 1.5. 1. Ioh. 3.14. They approue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be <hi>elect</hi> by loue; that is, by their great affections to God, to the word of God, and his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21382:89"/>
and by their brotherly kindnesse to the godly, and this loue is the more euident marke, when it lasts euen in affliction, when no distresses makes vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of our affection to God, or good things, or good men, Rom. 8.28.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By their Priesthood: Gods elect are <hi>a kingdome of Priests,</hi> they offer God daily sacrifice, they haue the spirit of prayer, &amp; they daily mortifie (the beast) their sinnes vpon the Altar of <hi>Christ</hi> crucified. So then by their praying and their mortification, Gods <hi>elect</hi> may bee euidently knowne, 1. Pet. 2.9.10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, they are vsually knowne by the opposition of the world: If they were of the world, the world would spare, and loue his owne: but because they are chosen out of the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21382:90"/>
the world hates them, and pursues them with reproches, and indignations of all sorts, Ioh. 15.18.19. <hi>If the world hate you, you know that it hated mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would loue his owne: but because ye are not of the world, but I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. Lastly, this doctrine of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> should fill the hearts of all the godly with vnspeakable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing: <hi>Euerlasting ioy should be vpon their heads, and sorrow and mourning should fly away</hi>: and the rather, if they consider the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous priuiledges of their <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and the wonderfull happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vnto which they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen of God.

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto of the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Christ</hi>: There are foure <hi>principles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the humane nature of <hi>Christ</hi>: the one concernes the matter, the other three concerne the manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first, that the Sonne of God was incarnate, did assume the true nature of man, and was a very man amongst vs, Ioh. 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21382:96"/>
the word was with God, and that word was God.</hi> 14. <hi>And the word was made flesh and dwelt among vs, and we saw the glory thereof as the glory of the only begotten Sonne of the Father, full of grace and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hebr. 2.14. <hi>For as much then as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he also himselfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise tooke part with them.</hi> 16. <hi>For hee in no sort tooke the Angels, but hee tooke the seed of Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That hee was not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as other men, but by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, Luk. 1.35. <hi>And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell answered and said vnto her, the holy Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the most high shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uershadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall bee borne of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mat. 1.20. <hi>Feare not to take Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for thy wife; for that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in her is of the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:21382:97"/>3. That hee was borne of a Virgin, Esa. 7.14. <hi>Therefore the Lord himselfe will giue you a signe: behold the Virgin shall conceiue and beare a Sonne, and she shall call his name Emmanuel..</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matth. 1.18. <hi>Now the birth of Iesus Christ was thus: when as his mother Mary was betrothed to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph; before they came together she was found with child of the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Genes. 3.15. <hi>I will also put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy seed and her seed, hee shall breake thine head, and thou shalt bruise his heele.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That his humane nature did subsist in the diuine nature, and so both made but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Colos. 2.9. <hi>For in him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the fulnesse of the God-head bodily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Luk. 1.35. <hi>And the Angel an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:21382:97"/>
and said vnto her: The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the most high shal ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadow thee: therefore also that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing which shall be borne of thee, shall bee called the Sonne of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vses may bee raised seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from each of the <hi>principles,</hi> and so: First, the doctrine of the incarnation of <hi>Christ</hi> may serue,</p>
            <p n="1">1. For information, and that both of the loue of God, and of his wisedome, which both shine in this worke: His loue, in that he sent vs a Sauiour to take our nature: and his wisedome, in that he sent vs his Sonne.</p>
            <p>But what need was there that <hi>Christ</hi> should bee incarnate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </note> and take mans nature rather then any other?</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answere.</hi>
               </note> that satisfaction might be made to God in the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21382:98"/>
that had offended.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because without effusion of blood, there could bee no remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Heb. 9.22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because a <hi>Mediator</hi> should be meet to deale betweene both parties: therefore he is God for the businesse with his Father, and man for the businesse with men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That so he might haue the right of the kinsman to redeeme vs, and so of adoption, Ier. 32.8. Ruth 3.13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To assure our resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Heb. 2.14. <hi>That he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy through death him, that had the power of death, which is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Question.</hi>
               </note>But why was the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in <hi>Trinitie</hi> incarnate?</p>

                  <hi>Answere.</hi>
               </note>It was most conueniently, and comely it should be so?</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:21382:98"/>1. By the Son was man made at the beginning, and therefore fitly by him was he redeemed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He most fitly repaires the image of God in vs, who was himselfe the image of his father.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He that was the Sonne of God most conueniently makes vs the Sonnes of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for instruction, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so it should teach vs:</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, to acknowledge both natures in <hi>Christ,</hi> and know, it is of necessitie to saluation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his glory in both.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It should worke vpon vs the impressions of humility. This is a matchlesse example of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he, that was equall to the father, should make himselfe so low, as to take vpon him the forme of a seruant, &amp;c. as it is vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, Phil. 2.6.7.</p>
            <p>It were intolerable shame for
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:21382:99"/>
vs to mind our owne things, or to stand vpon our glory, and greatnesse. Oh, how should this make vs easily deny our selues, if we could throughly thinke vpon it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, it should stirre vs vp wonderfully to a desire to come vnto <hi>Christ,</hi> and to be made one with him, and to be like him. Hee drew neere to vs, when hee tooke our nature; and shall not we draw neere to him in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his nature, and shew forth his vertues? He descended from heauen to vs, and shall not we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to heauen to him?</p>
            <p n="4">4. This may serue for great humiliation to al such, as receiue not the Sonne of God: hath hee taken our nature, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, and saw we his glory, as the glory of the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne of God: and are wee
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21382:99"/>
yet ignorant of him? doe we yet neglect to come vnto him?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, the incarnation of <hi>Christ,</hi> is the very fountaine of all our comfort. It is the sunneshine of religion, we should reioyce in it aboue all things. There should be no godly man, but his heart should leape within him vpon the thoughts of this glorious grace of God. The <hi>Angels</hi> of heauen sang in the aire, when they brought this tidings; and can wee sit desolate in heart, to whom a Sauiour is borne, and for whom he was incarnate? Luk. 2.10.</p>
            <p>Christs incarnation is the most cleare looking glasse to shew forth the wisdome, mercy, truth, and iustice of God. This was a worke farre aboue the creation of man; this doctrine is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the very respect of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21382:100"/>
honour done to the nature of man, in that God hath ioyned man so neerely to himselfe, and it imports a wonderfull loue, that <hi>Christ</hi> doth now vnchangeably beare to man, being himselfe of the same nature: but especially it should swallow vp all earthly discontentments to consider, that God hath giuen him to vs, and <hi>Christ</hi> is all this for our sakes, Esay 9.6. <hi>For vnto vs a childe is borne, and vnto vs a sonne is giuen: &amp;c.</hi> How should <hi>Christ</hi> bee vnto vs onely in stead of all things? The very peace we haue by him should enflame vs, peace aboue vs with God and the <hi>Angels</hi>: peace within vs with our owne consciences; peace about vs with all creatures, Luke 2.14. and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it should establish vs in the assurance of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that yet remaines of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21382:100"/>
our full redemption, we need not doubt of his intercession: our suites must all needes speed well, there sits one at the right hand of God, that is our owne flesh and bloud, and we need not feare the last iudgement. It cannot but be well with vs, if our owne brother be our <hi>iudge:</hi> we should not be affraid in the meane time in the euill day. He will succour vs, he hath had experience of the frailtie of our nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath a feeling of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and will helpe vs in all time of our need, Heb. 2.18. <hi>For in that he suffred, and was tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 4.15. <hi>For we haue not an high Priest, which cannot be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the feeling of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but was in all things tempted in like sort, yet without sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:21382:101"/>Yea, the very glory of <hi>Christ</hi> in heauen is by this meanes ours. <hi>Christ</hi> is my portion, my flesh, and my blood, where my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on raigneth, there beleeue I, that I raigne; where my flesh is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, there I thinke my selfe in glory; where my blood ruleth, there thinke I my selfe exalted.</p>
            <p>And all this is the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, if we consider, that God had not respect of persons in this, which may appeare by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of the incarnation. It was reueiled to shepheards, and to the Wise men; the one poore, the other rich; the one learned, the other vnlearned; the one <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the other <hi>Iewes</hi>; the one neere, the other farre off. This light appeared to <hi>Anna</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as well as to <hi>Simeon</hi> that iust man. And besides note the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wisedome of God in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21382:101"/>
manner of reuealing <hi>Christ: viz.</hi> to euery one according to his owne estate. For to <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> as more spirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the natiuitie was reuealed by the instinct of the Spirit. To the <hi>Shepheards</hi> as ruder men, by the voice and speech of <hi>Angels.</hi> To the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> that searched Scripture, by an Oracle of the Scripture.

            <p>The doctrine of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the holy Ghost may serue:</p>
            <p>First, for information, and that in diuers things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, concerning the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his birth, heere is a new birth giuen to the world, neuer such a one before: he that is the onely Sonne in heauen, is by this meanes the onely man on earth to be admired. When God was to be made visible on earth, and to come to dwell amongst men, a heauenly temple is prouided
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:21382:102"/>
for him; the holy Ghost builds him a temple in the wombe of a <hi>Virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the freedome of <hi>Christ</hi> from Originall <hi>sinne,</hi> we might aske,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note> How could <hi>Christ</hi> be free from <hi>sinne,</hi> seeing he came of <hi>Adam,</hi> whose nature was infected in all his posteritie.</p>
            <p>Now this is answered in this principle:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> for <hi>Christ</hi> came <hi>of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but not <hi>by Adam,</hi> but by the holy Ghost: The holy Ghost miraculously formed <hi>Christs</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the substance of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> stopping the course of <hi>originall sinne,</hi> and sanctifying it: <hi>sinne</hi> comes into the world by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation only.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning the sufficiency of the sacrifice of <hi>Christ:</hi> It must needes bee an admirable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that is thus fitted from the wombe.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:21382:103"/>4. Concerning the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Papists</hi> about the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Marie:</hi> for they attribute the purity of <hi>Christs</hi> nature to the holinesse of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> that shee was without sinne; whereas it is euident, it is to be attributed to the holy Ghost.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Concerning the possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for <hi>Christ</hi> to be borne of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: It is as easie for God to frame vnto <hi>Christ</hi> a body in the wombe of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> as to make mans body at the first of the myer of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, for <hi>Instruction,</hi> and so this <hi>conception</hi> by the holy Ghost should teach vs:</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, to be wise to sobriety in this mysterie of the incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Christ</hi>: a purer sense and a cleaner hearing is called-for here: the ouershadowing of the virgin shewes, that we must bring
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21382:103"/>
faith to beleeue the mysterie without further inquiring.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To desire feruently the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of our natures, that wee as his members might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto him as our head, and so we are, if <hi>Christ</hi> be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in our hearts by the holy Ghost, as hee was conceiued in the womb of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> Gal. 4.7</p>
            <p>For consolation, and so his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> conception is comfortable, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in two things:
<list>
                  <item>1. First, the holinesse of his conception will iustifie vs from the vnholinesse of our concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and quit vs from the guilt and filth of originall <hi>sinne.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Secondly, it may comfort vs in the expectation of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holinesse. Hee that was so carefull to haue his naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fitted so exquisitely, will not neglect his mysticall body the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21382:104"/>
                     <hi>Church,</hi> but will loue it, and wash it, till it bee without spot and wrinkle, and the rather because it is bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, Ephes. 5.25.26.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And thus of the vse of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hirdly, in that our Sauiour was borne of a Virgin it may serue</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For <hi>Information,</hi> and so</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous wisdome of God in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our saluation: By a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came <hi>sinne</hi> and death into the world: and loe here the seed of the woman breakes the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:21382:104"/>
head. The <hi>diuell</hi> got to be the god of the world by begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a woman. Now see how the <hi>Lord</hi> hath deuised to destroy his dominion by one made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: they were both <hi>Virgins,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fianced to husbands, but not yet knowne of man.</p>
            <p>But might some one say,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi>
               </note> This is beyond beliefe, that a <hi>Virgin</hi> should bring forth, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a virgin, hauing neuer knowne man, this seemeth to be incredible.</p>
            <p>If it had been a thing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Solution.</hi>
               </note> which had no resemblance in nature: yet it had been nothing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the power of the God of nature: but yet there is instance of things borne in nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out generation. The Bees haue young, and yet know not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. The <hi>Easterne</hi> bird the <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi> is borne, and new borne suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:21382:105"/>
and yet without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and shal we hold it beyond beliefe for God to doe this great work vpon him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was to restore the world. <hi>Christ</hi> is like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flower, which hath the heauen for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the earth for mother.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi>
               </note>But how can it become the greatnesse of the Sonne of God, to abase himselfe to lie in the wombe of the <hi>Virgin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Solution.</hi>
               </note>The <hi>Sunne</hi> in the firmament receiues not infection from any place, nor can any thing cast into the fier steine it; much lesse can the Sonne of God be polluted by being borne of a Virgin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, this may furnish vs with an argument against Transubstantiation. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs to beleeue, that <hi>Christ</hi> was made of a woman, Gal. 4.4. but not a word is there, that hee should bee made of a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21382:105"/>
piece of bread.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hath God created <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this new thing in the world, that a woman should compasse a man? why then doe we go about? why loose we our labour? Why settle we not our hearts directly vpon this <hi>Iesus,</hi> who is assigned vs thus wonderfully of God to bee our way, our light, and our life? This very doctrin was vsed long since to rebuke mens extreme distractions, and losse of time, and labour in the way to the Kingdome of heauen, Ier. 31.21.</p>
            <p>Yea, this doctrine ought to be vnto vs Gods signe, that he will deliuer vs certainely, and fulfil al his promises; and it extremely threatens the vnbeliefe of man, as the <hi>Prophet Isaiah</hi> vrgeth it in the daies of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> Isaiah 7.14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this should kindle in vs a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t desire to haue God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:21382:106"/>
reueale his sonne in vs, and to haue <hi>Christ</hi> borne in our hearts: we thinke the Virgin blessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue women, that <hi>Christ</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in her wombe; why cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely it is a great wonder, and wee were blessed amongst men and women, if the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> bee conceiued in our hearts, and we keepe our selues chast <hi>virgins</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>There hath been foure waies of making man:
<list>
                  <item>1. The one was to make man without either man or woman; so was <hi>Adam</hi> made.</item>
                  <item>2. The second was to make man without a woman, so was <hi>Eue</hi> made.</item>
                  <item>3. The third was to make man by both man and woman, and so we their posteritie are made.</item>
                  <item>4. The fourth way, was to make man without man by the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:21382:106"/>
woman only, and so was <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> made.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now if wee admire the first, second, and fourth of these; why should wee not also admire the creating of a man, without wombe, euen in the heart of a man: Is it not a great wonder, that the Sonne of God should be formed in our breast; and yet such is the worke of God in the new birth of a <hi>Christian: Christ</hi> is formed in them, Galath. 4.9. <hi>My little children, of whom I trauell in birth againe, vntill Christ be formed in you.</hi>

Tim. 2.5. <hi>For there is one God, and one medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator betweene God and man, which is the man Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Act. 4.12. <hi>Neither is there sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:21382:110"/>
in any other: for amongst men there is giuen none other name vnder heauen whereby we must bee saued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Luk. 2.11. <hi>That is, that vnto you is borne this day in the City of Dauid a Sauiour, which is Christ the Lord.</hi> Because there is none more mercifull, Heb. 2.17. Nor more able, Heb. 7.25.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> That the cause of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his mediation is not merit in man, but grace in God and <hi>Christ,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs, and called vs with an holy calling, not according to our workes, but according to his owne purpose and grace, which was giuen to vs through Christ Iesus before the world was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tit. 3.4.5. <hi>But when the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnesse and loue of God our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour toward man appeared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not by the workes of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:21382:110"/>
which we had done, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his mercy he saued vs by the washing of the new birth, and the renewing of the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 2.8. <hi>For by grace are ye saued through faith, and that not of your selues; it is the gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this mediation was from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the beginning of the world, and shall be to the end, Hebr. 13.8. <hi>Iesus Christ yesterday, and to day, the same also is for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 1.20. <hi>Which was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the foundation of the world, but was declared in the last times for your sakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 13.8. <hi>Therefore all that dwell vpon the earth, shall worship him, whose names are not written in the booke of life of the Lambe, which was slaine from the beginning of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in the knowledge, destina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and acceptation of God,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21382:111"/>
the two natures were accounted as vnited, and with him the things done and to be done, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and to come, are all one.</p>
            <p>For explication of this <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> if we aske when the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was giuen, it must be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red three waies:
<list>
                  <item>1. If we respect Gods decree, he was giuen before all eternity, Ephes. 1.4. <hi>As he hath chosen vs in him before the foundation of the world.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. If wee respect the vertue and efficacie of his mediation, he was giuen when need was from the beginning of the world, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. 13.8. <hi>Which was slaine from the beginning of the world.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. If we respect his manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the flesh, he was giuen in the fulnesse of time: 1600. yeeres agoe, Galath. 4.4. <hi>But when the fulnesse of time was come, God sent
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:21382:111"/>
forth his Sonne made of a woman, and made vnder the law.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. Tim. 2.6. <hi>Who gaue himselfe a ransome for all men, to be a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in due time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That without the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Christ</hi> no flesh can bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, Act. 4.12. <hi>Neither is there saluation in any other: for among men there is giuen none other name vnder heauen, whereby we must bee saued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 143.2. <hi>And enter not into iudgement with thy seruant, for in thy sight shall none that liueth be iustified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iam. 3.2. <hi>For in many things we sinne all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That by the mediator a new agreement or contract was made with God, Ierem. 31.33. <hi>But this shall be the couenant that I will make with the house of Israel: after those dayes saith the Lord, I
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21382:112"/>
will put my law in the inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall bee my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 8.13. <hi>In that he saith a new Testament, he hath abrogated the old; now that which is disanulled, and waxed old, is ready to vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 3.23.24. <hi>For there is no difference, for all haue sinned, and are depriued of the glory of God, and are iustified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Galath. 3.21.22. <hi>Is the Law then against the promise of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law giuen, which could haue giuen life, surely righteousnes should haue been by the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the promise by the faith of Iesus Christ should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:21382:112"/>
to them that beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the explication of this principle we must vnderstand:</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, that the Scriptures make mention of three coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, that God hath made.</p>
            <p>The one generall, and terrene with all creatures about their preseruation from the vniuersall deluge: of this, Genes. 9. &amp;c. but of this couenant wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe here.</p>
            <p>The second was the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, called the couenant of workes, this was made with all mankinde in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and stands still in force, since the fall, as men are in the <hi>estate</hi> of nature, the condition whereof on mans part is in the morall law.</p>
            <p>The third was the agreement made with man by meanes of the <hi>mediator,</hi> this was called from
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21382:113"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:21382:114"/>
the fall to the dayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the promise, as being contriued in those words of promise, Gen. 3.15. <hi>I will also put enmity betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy seed and her seed: He shall break thine head, and thou shalt bruise his heele, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> it was called the couenant, Genes. 17. &amp;c. From <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and so still the Testament; and as it stands in difference from the couenant of workes, it may bee called for all this time, the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that in this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with God by the <hi>mediator,</hi> the <hi>mediator</hi> did vndertake for two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To pay all our debts, and satisfie Gods <hi>Iustice,</hi> by a price of infinite value, Esa. 53.5.6. <hi>But hee was wounded for our transgressions,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21382:114"/>
he was broken for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes we are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All we like sheep haue gone astray, we haue turned euery one to his owne way, and the Lord hath laid vpon him the iniquity of vs all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iob 33.24. <hi>Then will he haue mercy vpon him, and will say deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him, that he goe not downe into the pit: For I haue receiued a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Tim. 2.6. <hi>Who gaue himselfe a ransome for all men to be a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in due time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To purchase and merit for vs Gods fauour and kingdome by a most absolute and perfect obedience, Eph. 1.6. <hi>To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherewith he hath made vs accepted in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly wee must vnderstand
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:21382:115"/>
wherein these new couenants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and wherein they disagree.</p>
            <p>These couenants agree in these two things: First, that they both were tendered to vs by God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they both require a full and perfect righteousnesse, as the condition of eternall life.</p>
            <p>They differ:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the manner of knowing of them. For the law or couenant of works is knowne in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by nature, Rom. 2.15. <hi>Which shew the effect of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witnesse, and their thoughts accusing one another, or excusing</hi>: But the Gospell or couenant of grace is not knowne at all by nature: It is a mystery, Colos. 1. 26. <hi>Which is the mystery hid, since the world began, and from all ages, but now is made manifest to his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:21382:115"/>1. Cor. 2.7. <hi>But wee speake the wisdome of God in a mystery, euen the hid wisedome which God had determined before the world, vnto our glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Tim. 1.10. <hi>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the ministers of both: <hi>Moses</hi> was the minister of the law, but <hi>Christ</hi> of the Gospell, Ioh. 1. 17. <hi>For the law was giuen by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but grace and truth came by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In the means of attaining to the end common to both: the law is a law of workes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires doing, or else will not giue wages: but the Gospell is a law of faith, requiring beleeuing in him, that iustifieth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, Rom. 3.21. <hi>But now is the righteousnesse of God made manifest without the law, hauing witnesse of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:21382:116"/>
the Law, and of the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 4.5. <hi>But to him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not, but beleeueth in him that iustifieth the vngodly, his faith is counted for righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 10.5. <hi>For Moses thus describeth the righteousnesse which is of the law: that the man which doth these things shall liue thereby, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, the law requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousnesse in our owne persons, but the Gospell offers the righteousnesse of another to be receiued by faith, Rom. 8.3.4. <hi>For that that was impossible to the law, in as much as it was weake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the flesh, God sending his owne Sonne in the similitude of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flesh, and for sinne condemned sinne in the flesh; that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the law might be fulfilled in vs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 5.19. <hi>For as by one mans
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21382:116"/>
disobedience many were made sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; so by the obedience of one shall many also be made righteous:</hi> Rom. 10.4. <hi>For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousnesse, vnto euery one that beleeueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law requires our debts euery farthing, the Gospell pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth the acquittance of the principall, by reason of the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the suretie. The Law giues heauen, as wages for work done; the Gospell giues heauen <hi>gratis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In effects or efficacy; the Law requiers good workes, but giues no power to do them, Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 29.4. <hi>Yet the Lord hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you an heart to perceiue, and eies to see, and eares to heare vnto this day</hi>: but the Gospell giues the Spirit of God, which worketh what he requireth, Ier. 31.33. <hi>But this shall be the couenant that I will
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:21382:117"/>
make with the house of Israel: After those daies, saith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will bee their God, and they shall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ezech. 36.27. <hi>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, and yee shall keepe my iudgements, and do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 3.9. <hi>For if the ministrie of condemnation was glorious, much more doth the ministration of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse exceeds in glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law shewes the disease, and the Gospell cures it, Rom. 7. 6. <hi>But now we are deliuered from the Law being dead vnto it, wherein we were holden, that we should serue in newnesse of spirit, and not in the oldnesse of the letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from the body of this death? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:21382:117"/>The knowledge of sinne is by the Law, but that which heales vs, is the tidings of remission in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. In the persons, to whom they belong: the Law is for the vnrighteous, 1. Tim. 1.9. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that the Law is not giuen vnto a righteous man, but vnto the lawlesse and disobedient, to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and to the sinners, to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, and to the prophane, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Gospell belongs to the poore and penitent, Luke 4. 18. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is vpon mee, because hee hath anointed mee, that I should preach the Gospell to the poore; he hath sent me, that I should heale the broken heart, that I should preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blind, that I should set at liberty them, that are bruised, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, for consolation vnto all the godly, and this comfort in their <hi>Mediatour,</hi> and the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant in him may be the more distinctly formed in vs, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider:

            <p n="1">1. The abrogation of the old couenant, Heb. 8.13. <hi>In that hee saith a new Testament, he hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated the old: now that which is disanulled, and waxed old, is ready to vanish away.</hi> So as now we are not vnder the Law, but vnder

Grace, Rom. 6.14. <hi>For sinne shall not haue dominion ouer you: for ye are not vnder the Law, but vnder grace, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Communion of Saints from all parts of the world: men of all Nations comming in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this new agreement, Isaiah 49.6.11. <hi>And he said, it is a small thing, that thou shouldest be my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, to raise vp the Tribes of Iacob, and to restore the desolations of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: I will also giue thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou maist bee my saluation vnto the ends of the world.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Reconciliation with God, and the pardon of all sins, 2. Cor. 5.19. <hi>For God was in Christ, and

                  <item>4. That God hath sworne to keepe this couenant, Heb. 6.18. and 7.19.20.21.22. Isai. 42.6.7.</item>
                  <item>5. That it is confirmed by the death of the restator, Heb. 9.16. Matth. 26.27.</item>

                  <item>8. That we haue sacraments to confirme it, and seale to it: and if wee can bee perswaded, that the Flood shall come no more, when we see the Rainbow; how much more should the glorious sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new Couenant, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vs in the assurance of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenesse
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:21382:122"/>
of Gods good will towards vs?</item>
                  <item>9. That the couenant is kept, not only in the word, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be blotted, but also wee haue the keeping of it in our owne hearts, Rom. 10.4.5.</item>
                  <item>10. That God is now long since knowne to the Church by the name of Iehouah, which notes both his constancy and al suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, Exod. 6.3.</item>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This is comfortable if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the persons, that may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the priuiledges of this new Couenant. God stands not vpon desert, Esay 55.1. the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and the Eunuches may be as well accepted here, as the sonnes and daughters, if their hearts bee sincere with God, Esay 56.4.6. the abiect Gentiles are not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Esay 49.7.</p>

            <p>And as this is comfortable at all times, so there is comfort to be gathered out of it in speciall distresses, as
<list>
                  <item>1. In the case of <hi>sinne.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In the case of affliction.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, in the case of sin after calling, it is a memorable place, 1. Iohn 2.1. <hi>My babes these things write I vnto you, that ye sinne not: and if any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the second: in the case of affliction, there are many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that haue recourse to this doctrine for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. If the godly bee grieued and oppressed, and come vnto God, and humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, the <hi>Lord</hi> wil remember
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:21382:123"/>
this couenant, and heare them: as Exod. 2.2.4.5. and Exod. 6. 4.5.6. Leuit. 26.41.42. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The godly know in all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom they haue trusted, and ought to beleeue, that hee will keepe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which by couenant is committed to him, 2. Tim. 1. 12. Christ hath commission from God by vertue of this couenant to say to the prisoners, go forth, and to them that are in darknes, shew your selues, Esa. 49.9.10. For a small moment God may forsake, but with great mercy will hee gather vs: In a little wrath he may hide his face, but in euerlasting kindnesse will hee haue mercy on vs: For this is as the waters of <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp;c. The mountaines may depart; but his kindnesse, and the couenant of his peace shall not depart, nor be remoued, saith the Lord, that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21382:123"/>
hath mercy on vs, Esa. 54. from the 7. to 11.</p>
            <p>For the third, in the case of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> death, it is a knowne instance of <hi>Iob,</hi> how he comforted himselfe in his Redeemer, in the middest of all his wonderfull distresses, that seemed to threaten his death (as it were) euery moment, Iob 19.25. <hi>For I know that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liueth, and he shall stand the last on the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus of the vses for consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The instructions follow, and may be cast into two sorts.</p>
            <p>For this doctrine of the new couenant in the <hi>mediator</hi> may teach vs; 1. both what to auoid; 2. and what to doe.</p>
            <p>The consideration of these principles should teach vs to shun two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The conceit of merit of our owne workes, and all boasting
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:21382:124"/>
of any worthinesse in our selues. For this were to make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of none effect, and the grace of this new couenant void: it were to stand to the old coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Rom. 4.14. <hi>For if they which are of the law be heires, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 3.27. <hi>Where is then thy reioycing? it is excluded: by what law? of workes: nay, but by the law of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 10.4. <hi>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousnesse vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that beleeueth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The forgetfulnesse of God; whatsoeuer befall vs, we should not forget God, nor deale wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly in his couenant, Psal. 44.17. <hi>All this is come vpon vs, yet doe we not forget thee, neither deale wee falsly concerning thy couenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The duties we should do, may
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:21382:124"/>
be referred to two sorts: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. they are such as fit vs for this new couenant; 2. or such as we should doe to walke worthy of it.</p>
            <p>If we would haue any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by the <hi>mediator,</hi> and this new agreement with God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We must turne from our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> transgressions, else wee haue no redeemer, Esa. 59.20. <hi>And the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer shall come vnto Sion, and vnto them that turne from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Iacob, saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must bee new creatures, al things in vs must now be new, our old things must bee passed, and giuen ouer, 2. Cor. 5.17.18.19. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Going and weeping we should goe, and aske for the way, Ierem. 50.4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee must come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Christ</hi> being wearie, and laden,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:21382:125"/>
and receiue him, and lay hold vpon him by faith. This new agreement is chiefly published for the obedience of faith, Rom. 16.26. Rom. 3.25.</p>
            <p>That wee may walke worthy of this couenant, we must looke to diuers things.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, we should inflame our hearts to the loue of the <hi>Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> &amp; be ready to acknowledge his wonderfull loue to vs, that dedicated this Testament with his blood, Heb. 9.16. Esa. 59.16. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God should bee our portion for euer, Psalm. 73.26. <hi>My flesh faileth, and my heart also: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for euer.</hi> What now should bee our hope? our hope should euen be in God, Psal. 39.7. <hi>And now Lord what waite I for, my hope is euen in thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:21382:125"/>We should for all other things of this life confesse our selues to bee strangers, and pilgrims, and imbrace onely these new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of a better happinesse, Heb. 11.13.</p>
            <p>We should neuer be ashamed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the testimony of the <hi>Lord,</hi> nor of this doctrine of the <hi>mediator,</hi> for all the <hi>Papists</hi> in the world; but partake willingly of all the afflictions may befall vs for this glad tidings in the Gospell, 2. Tim. 1.8. to the 13. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory in our singular riches, which is <hi>Christ</hi> in vs, Colos. 1.27.</p>
            <p>We should striue to liue like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> such as are now againe confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of God, and as may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the singular prerogatiues of our new estate. This is briefly comprehended in those few words, Walke before God and be vpright, Genes. 17.1. Esa. 59.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:21382:126"/>
17.18.19.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Wee should bee in a speciall manner carefull, that the salt of the couenant of God bee not lacking, Leuit. 2.13. This is the salt of discretion, and of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods confederats should bee a wise and humble people, Mark. 9.50.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> If euer wee fall into distresse, we must runne to God, and vrge him with his couenant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate his displeasure, Ier. 14. 21. <hi>Doe not abhorre vs for thy names sake, cast not downe the throne of thy glory. Remember and breake not thy couenant with vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Wee should for euer cleaue vnto God with full purpose of heart in a perpetuall couenant neuer to be forgotten, Ier. 50.5.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> We should learne of God how to carry our selues in all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and couenants with men.
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:21382:126"/>
We should be easie to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and keepe our promises, though made with disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Ministers also may learne from these <hi>principles,</hi> how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the word. The Law is to be preached to the vnrighteous, and this new couenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in <hi>Christ</hi> to the penitent and humbled soule, 1. Tim. 1.9. Luk. 4.18.</p>
            <p>The last vse may be for terrour vnto all wicked men that liue in the Church, and securely sinne on without regard of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, or seeking the benefits of this new couenant. Who can expresse their misery, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues aggrauation from their neglect of this grace offered. these are children of the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, Galath. 4.24.

Yea if the Lord proceed to take his staffe, euen beauty, &amp; cut it asunder, and dissolue euen his publike couenant he hath made with the nations; oh how then beyond all hope of cure would bee their miserable condition! or if he doe not doe that, yet if he remoue their candlesticke, by taking the meanes from them, how will these people (whole congregations, that forget God) be turned into hell, and all the multitudes of them!</p>

            <p>The <hi>principles</hi> concerning the <hi>Propheticall office</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> are.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in <hi>Christ</hi> are all the treasures of wisdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:21382:129"/>
Colos. 2.3. <hi>In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is <hi>Christ</hi> onely, that reueales the truth out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of his Father, Mat. 11.27. <hi>All things are giuen vnto mee of my Father, and no man knoweth the Sonne but the Father: neither knoweth any man the Father but the Sonne, and he to whom the Son will reueale him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ioh. 1.18. <hi>No man hath seene God at any time, the onely begotten Sonne which is in the bosome of the Father, he hath reuealed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ioh. 6.68. <hi>Then Simon Peter answered him, Master, to whom shall we goe, thou hast the words of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Christ</hi> hath himselfe taught doctrine amongst men, Hebr. 1.2. <hi>In these last dayes he hath spoken vnto vs by his Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:21382:130"/>Esa. 61.1. <hi>The spirit of the Lord God is vpon me, therefore hath the Lord annointed me; hee hath sent me to preach good tidings vnto the poor, to bind vp the broken-hearted, to preach liberty to the captiues, and to them that are bound, the opening of the prison, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That he hath reuealed the whole <hi>counsell</hi> of God, Ioh. 15.15. <hi>For all things that I haue heard of my Father, haue I made knowne vnto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ioh. 17.8. <hi>For I haue giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the words which thou gauest me, and they haue receiued them, and haue knowne surely that I came out from thee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Deut. 18.18. <hi>I will raise them vp a Prophet from among their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren like vnto thee; and will put my words into his mouth, and hee shall speake vnto them al that I shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:21382:130"/>5. That the Ministery in the <hi>Church</hi> is by authoritie from <hi>Christ,</hi> Matth. 23.34. <hi>Wherefore behold, I send vnto you Prophets, and Wisemen, and Scribes.</hi> Ephes. 4.11. <hi>He therefore gaue some to bee Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Euangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 5.20. <hi>Now then are wee Embassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech yee through vs, wee pray you in Christs stead, that yee bee reconciled to God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That the whole efficacy of doctrine either recorded in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or thence taught vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, depends vpon <hi>Christ,</hi> 2. Pet. 1.20.21. <hi>So that ye first know his, that no prophesie in the Scripture is of any priuat motion:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the prophesie came not in old time by the wit of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moued
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:21382:131"/>
by the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. 3.6. <hi>I haue planted, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos watred, but God gaue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. That the <hi>Prophesie</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> belongs generally vnto all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Isaiah 49.6. <hi>And he said, it is a small thing, that thou shouldst be my seruant to raise vp the tribes of Iacob, &amp; to restore the desolations of Israel. I will also giue thee for a light of the Gentiles, that thou maiest be my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vnto the ende of the world</hi>; though especially <hi>Christ</hi> was sent vnto the lost sheep of <hi>Israel,</hi> Mat. 15.24. <hi>But he answered, and said, I am not sent but vnto the lost sheepe of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Zach. 9.10. <hi>He shall speake peace vnto the heathen, and his dominion shall bee from sea vnto sea, and from the riuer vnto the end of the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These principles may serue:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:21382:131"/>For information, and that in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> diuers things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, we may hereby vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the reason, why <hi>Christ</hi> is called the messenger, the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Couenant, the Word, Wisdome; the Minister of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; Pastor, Doctor, Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>; the <hi>Apostle</hi> of our profession, &amp;c. namely, because of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetship,</hi> and Ministery in reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Gods will to the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We may here take notice of the dignity of the Ministry; we al serue vnder <hi>Christ,</hi> and haue our <hi>commissions</hi> signed, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him. <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe was a Minister of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> Rom. 15.8. And anointed to preach the Gospell, Isai. 61.1.</p>
            <p>And he worketh mighty things by the seruice of men, and that the calling might bee the more honourable, he would not write
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:21382:132"/>
               <hi>Scripture</hi> himselfe, nor continue his preaching, but left both to his seruants (so the head did dictate and the members did write it). Wherefore let men esteeme vs, as the dispensers of the secrets of <hi>Christ,</hi> 1. Cor. 4.1.2. And be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by vs, 2. Cor. 5.20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, we must here know, that we must depend vpon <hi>Christ</hi> onely for doctrine needful to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. There is but <hi>one Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi>: away with traditions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations of mens owne hearts; if an <hi>Angell</hi> from heauen would teach vs otherwise, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed, Gal. 1.8. Iam. 4.12. Will any man teach God? Iob 21.22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may here see the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible estate of such, as will be still ignorant and liue in their sinnes, hauing the Scriptures, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the name, and by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of <hi>Christ.</hi> Iohn 1.10. Ioh.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:21382:132"/>
3.19. Christ in these crieth, but men regard not, Prou. 1.20. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wee must take heed that we mistake not, and that in two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. First, about the difference of <hi>Christ,</hi> and all others in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</item>
               <item>2. About the continuance of this <hi>propheticall office: Christ</hi> teaching in his owne person did excell all other, so as wee might truly say, who teacheth like him? Iob. 36.22.
<list>
                     <item>1. For first he taught with more authoritie, Matth. 7.29. <hi>For hee taught them, as one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. He teacheth by his spirit not by sound of words onely, or by inke and paper.</item>
                     <item>3. He graueth his words not in stone, but in the fleshly
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:21382:133"/>
tables of mens hearts, 2. Cor. 3.3. &amp;c. And for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>prophecy,</hi> wee must know, that it lasts but for this life: for in the other world <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie</hi> shall cease, 1. Cor. 13.8. <hi>Loue doth neuer fall away, though that prophesyings be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, or the tongues cease, or knowledge vanisheth away.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </item>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For <hi>instruction,</hi> and so these <hi>principles</hi> may teach,</p>
            <p>First, all in <hi>Generall,</hi> and so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers duties:
<list>
                  <item>1. First, with all carefulnes therefore to heare the voice of <hi>Christ,</hi> Mat. 17.5. <hi>Behold, there came a voice out of the cloud, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased: heare him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p n="1">2. In all wants to run vnto <hi>Christ,</hi> and pray that he would teach vs, Psal. 25.5. <hi>Leade mee
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21382:133"/>
forth in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In thee doe I trust all the day, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Psalm. 143.10. <hi>Teach me to doe thy will, for thou art my God, let thy good Spirit leade mee into the land of righteousnesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. But then, if wee would euer profit by <hi>Christs</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we must be poore in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, broken in hart, &amp; mourne for our sinnes, Isaiah 60.1. &amp;c. Malach. 3. from the 1. to the 7. And make conscience to leaue all <hi>sinne,</hi> and bee renewed throughout, Eph. 4.17. to 23.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p n="4">4. To loue the house of God, where the Son of God exerciseth his prophecying, Psalm. 84.4.10. <hi>Blessed are they that dwell in thine house, they will euer praise thee:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For a day in thy courts is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:21382:134"/>
then a thousand other where; I had rather be a doore-keeper in the house of my God, then to dwell in the Tabernacles of wickednes,</hi> Mat. 12.42. We should long for it, and call vpon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Isaiah 2.3.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. To cleaue to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, reproofes, doctrines, and exhortations of <hi>Christ</hi> in the execution of his office, Ioh. 6.68. And to receiue the truth with al ful assurance, Heb. 3.6. 2. Pet. 1.19.</item>
                  <item>6. Not to be too busie one against another in doubtfull, or indifferent things, Iam. 4.11.12. <hi>There is one Law-giuer, which is able to saue and destroy; who art thou that iudgest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man?</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, hence Ministers may learne diuers things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not to affect the praise of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21382:134"/>
men for the greatnesse of their gifts, or glory of their work. They must not be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> seeing one is their Doctor, euen <hi>Christ,</hi> and they haue nothing, but what they haue receiued from him, Matth. 23.8. But rather learne of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> Iohn 3.30.31. who said, <hi>He must increase, but I must decrease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When they discharge their duties; not to be affraid of men, or to bee ouermuch carefull in their trouble, what to speake or doe. They should settle this in their hearts: for <hi>Christ</hi> will giue them a mouth and wisdom, which all their aduersaries shall not be able to gainsay, or resist; one haire of their head shall not perish, and therefore in patience they should possesse their soules, Luke 21.14. to the 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To be diligent in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21382:135"/>
of their office, seeing they must make vp their accounts to <hi>Christ,</hi> whose <hi>Embassadours</hi> they are, and they should speak as the words of <hi>Christ,</hi> and not their owne words, Rom. 12.6.7.8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, here is singular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation to al the godly from the <hi>propheticall office of Christ,</hi> and that if we consider three things:
<list>
                  <item>1. What <hi>Christ</hi> will teach vs.</item>
                  <item>2. How he will teach vs.</item>
                  <item>3. Whom he will teach.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, it may bee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort that God hath giuen vs his Sonne to bee our <hi>Prophet</hi>: for thereby we may bee assured, that he will be our <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor</hi> in all estates, Isaiah 9.6. Hee will teach vs to profit, Isaiah 33.22. And when wee are deie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and broken in heart, and mourne for our corruptions, hee doth acknowledge it to be a part
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:21382:135"/>
of his office to apply the Gospell to vs, and to proclaime the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable yeere of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to poure vpon vs the oile of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for the Spirit of heauines.</p>
            <p>For the second: <hi>Christs</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is wonderfull comfortable: for the Scripture shewes, that he will teach vs</p>
            <p n="1">1. Freely: he will giue vs our teaching, hee stands not vpon hire, Iohn 17.8. <hi>For I haue giuen vnto them the words, which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Powerfully and effectually, so as if our harts were dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs, yet he will reuiue them; the dead shall heare his voice, Iohn 5.25.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Familiarly, and with great delight, as a mother would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct her childe at home in a chamber, Canticles 8.2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fully: keeping from vs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:21382:136"/>
that may bee needfull for vs, hee will teach vs all things, Iohn 15.15. <hi>Hence forth call I you not seruants: for the seruant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, what his Master doth, but I haue called you friends: for all things that I haue heard of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, haue I made knowne vnto you?</hi> Col. 2.3. <hi>In who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are hid al the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of wisdom, and knowledge, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Gloriously, and with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous shining light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; that may rauish our harts, and much affect vs, 2. Cor. 4.6. <hi>For God, that commanded the light to shine out of darkenesse, is he which hath shined in our hearts, to giue the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ.</hi> 2. Cor. 3.18. <hi>But we all behold as in a mirrour, the glory of the Lord with open face, and are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the spirit of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:21382:136"/>6. Confidently: Hee will so teach vs the truth, as hee will bee ready to iustifie it, as a neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling faithfull, and true witnesse, Reuel. 3.14. <hi>And vnto the Angell of the Church of the Laodiceans write, These things saith Amen the faithfull, and true witnesse, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the creatures of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Isaiah 55.4. <hi>Behold, I gaue him for a Witnesse to the people, for a Prince, and a Master vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Inwardly, as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly: to this end hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs the anointing, euen his spirit in our hearts to teach vs all things, 1. Iohn 2.27. <hi>But the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which ye receiued of him dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing teacheth you of all things, and it is true, and is not lying, and as it taught you, ye shall abide in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:21382:137"/>8. Compassionately with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular tendernesse, fitting himself to euery ones nature and ability, Iohn 10.11. <hi>I am the good shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard; the good shepheard giueth his life for his sheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ezech. 34.23. <hi>And I will set vp a shepheard ouer them, and hee shall feede them, euen my seruant Dauid, he shall feede them, and hee shall bee their shepheard, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Isaiah 40.11. <hi>He shall feede his flocke like a shepheard, he shall gather the lambes with his arme, and carry them in his bosome, and shall guide them with young, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For the third: It is exceeding comfortable, that he will teach al that come vnto him, euen al that are giuen to him of God, all the godly, of what <hi>sex, condition,</hi> or <hi>nation</hi> soeuer; <hi>They shal be al taught of God, from the least to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test: A b c daries,</hi> as well as they

of higher formes, Isaiah 54.13. <hi>And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and much peace shall be to thy children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ier. 31.34. <hi>And they shall teach no more euerie man his neighbour, and euery man his brother, saying, know the Lord: for they shall all know me from the least of them vnto the greatest of them, saith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore let vs obserue these things, and acknowledge this goodnesse, and receiue his testimony: for thereby we seale, that God is true, Iohn 3.33. <hi>Hee that hath receiued his testimony, hath sealed, that God is true, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Priestly office of <hi>Christ</hi> follows, which is that part of his function, whereby he maketh satisfaction vnto God for men.</p>
            <p>This office in the execution of it hath in it three things; or there be three things <hi>Christ</hi> must doe, as the <hi>Priest</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He must obey the Law of God perfectly.</item>
                  <item>2. Hee must make expiation for our sinnes by sacrificing to God.</item>
                  <item>3. He must make intercession for vs.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, of the <hi>principles</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his obedience; there are
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:21382:138"/>
foure things wee are bound to beleeue concerning the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Christ:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. First, that he was without <hi>sin</hi> in his nature, Ioh. 8.46. <hi>Which of you can rebuke me of sinne?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 5.21. <hi>For he hath made him to be sinne for vs, which knew no sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 1.19. <hi>But with the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of Christ, as of a Lambe vndefiled and without spot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 2.22.23. <hi>Who did no sin, neither was there guile found in his mouth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 4.15. <hi>For we haue not an high Priest which cannot be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the feeling of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but was in all things tempted in like sort, yet without sinne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, that he fulfilled the whole law of God perfectly in all his actions: Hence called the holy one, and the holy <hi>Child
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:21382:139"/>
Iesus,</hi> Act. 2.27. <hi>Because thou wilt not leaue my soule in hell, neither wilt suffer thine holy one to see cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi> Act. 13.35.</p>
            <p>Act. 3.14. <hi>But ye denied the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, and the iust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Act. 4.27. <hi>For doubtlesse against thine holy Sonne Iesus, whom thou hast annointed, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">30. <hi>So that thou stretch forth thine hand, that healing, and signes, and wonders may bee done by the name of thine holy Sonne Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Ioh. 2.20. <hi>But yee haue an oyntment from him that is holy, and ye haue knowne all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that hee fulfilled the law, not onely for himselfe, but for vs, &amp; for our sakes, Rom. 8.3.4. <hi>For (that that was impossible to the law, in as much as it was weak because of the flesh) God sending his owne Sonne in the similitude of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flesh, and for sinne condemned
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:21382:139"/>
sinne in the flesh, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 10.4. <hi>For Christ is the end of the law, for righteousnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery one that beleeueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 5.18. <hi>Likewise then, as by the offence of one, the fault came on all men to condemnation, so by the iustifying of one, the benefit aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded toward all men to the iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this righteousnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of his is an euerlasting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, that is, such a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as serues for the <hi>Elect</hi> of all ages, and such a righteousnesse as cannot be lost, Dan. 9.24. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty weekes are determined vpon thy people, and vpon thine holy City to finish the wickednesse, and to seale vp the sinnes, and to reconcile the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21382:140"/>
iniquity, and to bring in euerlasting righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vses may be,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For <hi>consolation:</hi> for hereby all the faithfull may be assured, that though they bee very vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in themselues, yet they are made the righteousnesse of God in him, Ierem. 23.6. <hi>In his dayes Iuda shall be saued, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is the name whereby they shall call him, The Lord our righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 5.21. <hi>For he hath made him to be sinne for vs, which knew no sinne, that we should be made the righteousnesse of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee is the end of the law to euery one that beleeueth: wee haue as certaine <hi>iustification</hi> to life by his obedience, as euer we were subiect to death by <hi>Adams</hi>
disobedience, Rom. 5.19. <hi>For as by one mans disobedience many were
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:21382:140"/>
made sinners; so by the obedience of one shall many also be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if his righteousnesse bee ours, how rich are we? and how ought our hearts to bee establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in his well doing? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly for <hi>instruction:</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so it should worke in vs two things:
<list>
                  <item>1. First, an establishment of faith in our reconciliation, and a willing yeelding of our selues to acknowledge this free gift of God in his Sonne, 2. Cor. 5.21. Rom. 10.4.</item>
                  <item>2. Secondly an imitation of his maruellous holinesse: a stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to expresse his vertues, that we may be holy as he is holy; for he communicates the benefit of his obedience onely to such as liue iustly, and walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit,</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:21382:141"/>Rom. 8.4. <hi>That the righteousnes of the law might bee fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 2.9. <hi>But yee are a chosen generation, a royall priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should shew forth the vertues of him, that hath called you out of darknes into his maruellous light, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matth. 11.29. <hi>Take my yoke on you, and learne of mee, that I am meeke, and lowly in heart, and yee shall finde rest vnto your soules, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 5.17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Christ, let him be a new creature, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, for humiliation to all stubborne-hearted wicked men, that deny this holy one, partly by their vnbeleefe, when they regard not his words, whom they can conuince of no sinne, Ioh. 8.46. <hi>Which of you can
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:21382:141"/>
rebuke me of sinne? and if I say the truth, why doe you not beleeue me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And partly by wicked life, keeping out all conformity with <hi>Christ</hi>; as also by chusing rather to liue in wicked company, then to cleaue to <hi>Christ:</hi> Is not this to denie the holy one, and to chuse a murtherer to bee giuen them? Act. 3.14. What commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betweene <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial?</hi> betweene his righteousnesse, and such vnrighteousnesse?</p>
            <p>Thus much of his obedience to the law.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. Of the expiation of sinne.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>principles</hi> that concerne the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>sin</hi> follow.</p>
            <p>This expiation was made by the passion of <hi>Christ,</hi> concerning which wee must belieue these things of necessity:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Passion of <hi>Christ</hi> was by the decree &amp; euerlasting fore-appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, Act. 2.23. <hi>Him, I say, haue ye taken by the hands of the wicked, being deliuered by the determinate counsel and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the sufferings of <hi>Christ</hi> were for our sinnes, and for our sakes, so as he bare all our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 1. Pet. 2.24. <hi>Who his owne self bare our sinnes in his body on the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21382:142"/>
tree, that wee being deliuered from sinne, should liue in righteousnesse, by whose stripes ye were healed, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Isaiah 53.5. <hi>But he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our transgressions, he was broken for our iniquities; the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement of our peace was vpon him, and with his stripes we are healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>For the transgression of my people was he plagued, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Therefore will I giue him a portion with the great, and hee shall diuide the spoile with the strong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee hath poured out his soule vnto death: and hee was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ounted with the transgressors, and hee bare the sinne of many, and prayed for the trespassers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 4.25. <hi>Who was deliuered to death for our sinnes, and is risen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for our iustification.</hi> 1. Cor. 5.7. <hi>For Christ our Passouer is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That by his passion he did
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:21382:143"/>
pacifie God, and make expiation for all our sinnes, Mat. 17.5. <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased, beare him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 5.2. <hi>And walke in loue, euen as Christ hath loued vs, and hath giuen himselfe for vs to bee an offering, and a sacrifice of a sweet smelling sauour vnto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Ioh. 2.1. <hi>My babes, these things write I vnto you, that ye sinne not: and if any man sinne, we haue an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the iust, and he is the reconciliation for our sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That in his owne person he fulfilled and finished all suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, needefull for our saluation: he did it once for all, 1. Pet. 3.18. <hi>For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the iust for the vniust, that he might bring vs to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 9.28. <hi>So Christ was once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take away the sins of many,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:21382:143"/>
and vnto them that looke for him shal be appeare the second time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne vnto saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 10.11.12. <hi>And euery Priest appeareth daily ministring, and oft times offereth one manner of offering, which can neuer take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes, sitteth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at the right hand of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That the passion of <hi>Christ</hi> is a sufficient price for the sinnes of the whole world, Ioh. 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the sinnes of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That <hi>Christ</hi> suffered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame things for vs, euen the most grieuous things could bee imagined: as</p>
            <p n="1">1. A maruellous priuation of his owne glory, abasing himselfe, that was in the form of God, to liue amongst men,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:21382:144"/>
without shewing that fulnesse of Maiesty and glory which was in his nature, Ioh. 17.5. <hi>And now glorifie me, thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with thine owne selfe, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Most base entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, such as extreame pouerty in his birth and life, Luk. 2.12. <hi>And this shall bee a signe to you, yee shall finde the child swadled and laid in a cratch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matth. 8.20. <hi>But Iesus said vnto him, the foxes haue holes, and the birds of the heauens haue nests, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to rest his head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Exile, and flying before his enemies, Matth. 2.14. <hi>So hee arose, and tooke the babe and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Iesus auoided with his disciples to the sea, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ioh. 11.54. <hi>Iesus therefore walked no more openly amongst the Iewes, but went thence, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ioh. 8.59. <hi>Then tooke they vp stones to cast at him, but Iesus hid himselfe and went out of the Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Slanders and extreame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, called a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> a glutton, a seducer, a traitor; despised, mocked, buffeted, railed on, beaten, betrayed, and sold by his owne seruant, and that for a base price, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of his owne disciples, denied, and renounced by oath, falsly accused, whipped,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21382:145"/>
spit vpon, taken and bound as a malefactor, &amp;c. as the story of the <hi>Euangelists</hi> shew, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Imputation of the sins of all the <hi>elect</hi> vnto him; so as the guilt of them was laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and hee sustained their person. This is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull abasement, hee was made sinne for vs, that knew no sinne in himselfe, 2. Cor. 5.21.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fearfull agonies in his very soule, arising</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, from seuerall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts and tentations, Hebr. 2.18. Heb. 4.15. But especially set vpon with all their furie inuisibly when he was on the Crosse, Colos. 2.15. <hi>And hath spoyled the principalities and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and hath made a shew of them openly, &amp; hath triumphed ouer them in the same Crosse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:21382:145"/>2. Secondly, from the pouring out of the vials of Gods wrath for sinne, which befell him chiefly in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when hee swet blood for very anguish; &amp; on the Crosse when hee cried, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
            <p n="5">5. A most miserable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of death: to die as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned too both by <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> to die such a cursed death, as the death of the Crosse, which was both by God and man designed out, as the most ignominious kind of death; and to bee put to death in the middest of such <hi>malefactors,</hi> being reckoned amongst sinners, Esa. 53.12. <hi>Therefore will I giue him a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the great, and hee shall
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21382:146"/>
diuide the spoyle with the strong; because hee hath poured out his soule vnto death, and hee was counted with the transgressors, and hee bare the sinne of many, and prayed for the trespassers.</hi> And to suffer the nailing of his body, yea and the effusion of his most precious blood.</p>
            <p>These are exquisite things.</p>

            <p n="3">3. To sinne no more, but for euer to bee afraid of crucifying the Sonne of God againe, Rom. 6.6. Heb. 10.24. &amp;c. But rather to liue to him that died for vs, and to deuote both soules and bodies vnto his seruice, 2.

            <p n="4">4. To loue him with our vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most affections, and with all the sincerity of our hearts, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

them accursed, that loue not the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> 1. Cor. 16.22. Eph. 6.23. 1. Pet. 1.9. Shall the Father loue <hi>Christ</hi> for his willingnesse to die for his sheepe, and shall not we? Ioh. 10.17.18. <hi>Therefore doth my Father loue me, because I lay downe my life, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To come willingly at the time of the assemblies of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my vnder his colours in holy beauty. When we see the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Christ</hi> crucified, displai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we should run with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, professing our homage, and willingnesse to liue and die in his seruice; <hi>the youth of his wombe,</hi> that is, such as are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of his loines in the Gospell, should for multitude flock to the house of God, as thicke <hi>as the dew</hi> that falles from heauen <hi>in the morning</hi>; so thicke, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Christians</hi> should now
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:21382:148"/>
be like a very mist of dew, Psalm. 110.2.3.4.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Not to be the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of men; that is, to bee bound to no mans example, will, lusts, humours, likings, but to be free vnto the seruice of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> onely, who hath paid for vs so deare a price, 1. Cor. 7.23. <hi>Yee are bought with a price: be not the seruants of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. To suffer any thing for his sake, that hath suffered so great things for vs: so as we could bee willing to forsake father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brother and sister, house and land, and all for his sake, and for the Gospell.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To celebrate the memorie of his death and passion with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, honour, and hearty affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: this is that we should do in the receiuing of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which doth crucifie <hi>Christ</hi> before our eies, and shew vs how he was
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21382:148"/>
taken, broken, giuen, &amp; slaine for our sakes, shall we not do this in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of him? shall we not eate the sweete flesh of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate lambe, with the sower hearbes of contrition, and griefe for our sinnes and vnworthines? shall wee not at this feast put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all leauen out of our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings? God forbid, wee should dare to eat of this bread, or drink of this cup vnworthily, and so make our selues guilty of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of <hi>Christ</hi>: rather let vs all examine our selues, and so let vs eate in remembrance of him, iudging our selues, that we be not condemned of the Lord. Thus of the first sort of duties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the meditation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Christs passion</hi> should direct vs, and stirre vs vp to the care of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things in our carriage one towards another, and these du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:21382:149"/>
are either <hi>Generall</hi> to all, or speciall to some.</p>
            <p>There are foure generall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wee should learne from the passion of <hi>Christ:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The first is harmelesnesse: seeing <hi>Christ</hi> our Passeouer is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for vs, wee should keepe the feast with vnleauened bread of sinceritie and truth, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all leauen out of our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; euen all leauen of malice and naughtinesse, all vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons one against another, 1. Cor. 5.7.8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second is humilitie: the same minde should be in vs, that was in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equall with God, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for our sakes to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of no reputation, taking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the forme of a seruant; we should in lowlinesse of mind each esteeme others better then
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:21382:149"/>
themselues, doing nothing through strife or vaine-glory, looking not on our owne things, but euery one also on the things of others, making our selues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to them of the lower sort, being of one accord, of one minde. If we would learne any thing of <hi>Christ,</hi> we must learne lowlinesse, and meekenesse of him, Phil. 2. from the 2. to the 9. Matth. 11.29.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third is loue, and that in the feruency and constancy of it, refusing no paines, nor dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to shew our affection to the brethren: wee should walke in loue, as <hi>Christ</hi> loued vs, and gaue himselfe a sacrifice of sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sauour to God for vs, Ephes. 5.1.2. Yea, our liues should not be deare to vs to declare our loue to the brethren: but as <hi>Christ</hi> laid down his life for vs, so ought
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:21382:150"/>
we to lay downe our liues for the brethren, 1. Iohn 3.16. <hi>Hereby haue we perceiued loue, that he laid downe his life for vs: therefore we ought also to lay downe our liues for the brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth is pitie, and that in speciall to such as suffer in soule: If there bee any bowels in vs, the remembrance of the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Christ</hi> in the garden, and on the crosse, should make vs with more tendernesse of heart pity them, that for the griefe and feare of their hearts cry out, that <hi>God</hi> their <hi>God</hi> hath forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. If <hi>Christ</hi> needed an <hi>Angel</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, what need haue these of comfort? The maruelous feare &amp; distresse <hi>Christ</hi> was in, sheweth that these kinds of sufferings of <hi>spirit,</hi> bee the most grieuous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses.</p>
            <p>Thus in generall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:21382:150"/>In the fifth to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> this maruelous loue of <hi>Christ</hi> to the Church shewed in his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is vsed as a motiue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade husbands to loue their wiues, and in all deerenesse of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to cherish them, and prouide for them; denying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that they may profit and content them, as <hi>Christ</hi> did, when he gaue himselfe not only to the Church, but also for the Church, Ephes. 5.25. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus of the duties also to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the meditation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> these <hi>principles</hi> about the <hi>passion</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> should excite vs to the practice and care of diuers du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that concerne our selues, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, we should here learne to ioy and glory in the crosse of <hi>Christ</hi> aboue all things. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the loue of <hi>Christ</hi>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:21382:151"/>
herein, and our wonderfull deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from the vnspeakable dangers we were in, by reason of our sinnes, should breed in vs a maruelous inward and hearty exulting in this expiation of sins by the passion of <hi>Christ.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul; God forbid I should reioyce in any thing, but the crosse of Christ,</hi> Gal. 6.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We should (while we liue) haue more care of our pretious soules; the price paied to ransom them, should teach vs their worthes, and to know that they are things, must bee looked to with more care then ordinarie. There was more giuen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme a soule, then needed to be giuen to buy the whole world, yea, many worlds. We are wont to be exceeding carefull to keepe such things, as cost deere with all circumspection; neuer any thing
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:21382:151"/>
cost more then the soule; and therefore nothing must be so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as the soule, which is committed to thee to preserue, till the day of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, these extreme things, <hi>Christ</hi> hath suffered for vs, to shew his loue to vs, should make vs for euer trust him, and rely onely vpon him, as the life of our liues, and the breath of our nostrils, so as we should alwaies resolue with the <hi>Apostle Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.20. that the life we now liue in the flesh, we will liue by the faith of the Sonne of God, who shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his loue to vs, by giuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for vs, Phil. 1.21. <hi>For Christ is to me both in life, and in death ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. These terrible agonies and sufferings of <hi>Christ</hi> should make vs liue in feare, and spend the time of our soiourning here in a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:21382:152"/>
singular feare to offend God any more by our sinnes; yea, seeing we were to bee washed in blood, before we could be cleane, wee should bee desirous to get such puritie, as that if it were possible, wee might not haue a spot, or wrinkle of <hi>sinne</hi> about vs, 1. Pet. 1.17.18.19. <hi>Passe the time of your dwelling here in feare:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowing that yee were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with corruptible things, as siluer and gold, from your vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation receiued by the traditions of the Fathers: but with the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood of Christ, as of a lambe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and without spot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 5.26. <hi>That he might san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it, and clense it by the washing of water through the word.</hi> 27. <hi>That he might make it to himselfe a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church, not hauing spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy, and without blame, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:21382:152"/>5. We may here learne an excellent way, how to mortifie sinne, and destroy the power of any corruption. Look how God did with sinne, so should we: but God vsed crucifying, as the best medicine to kill the force and guilt of it, and so should wee. Hence it is, that the terme of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying is giuen vnto the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>sinne:</hi> Gal. 5.24. <hi>For they that are Christs, haue crucified the flesh with the affections, and the lusts, &amp;c.</hi> We are therefore coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled to crucifie the flesh accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now that we may crucifie our sinnes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. We must haue them to the crosse of <hi>Christ,</hi> force them before the tree, on which he suffered; it is such a sight as <hi>sinne</hi> cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide. It will begin to die within a man vpon the sight of <hi>Christ</hi> on
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:21382:153"/>
the crosse: for the crosse of <hi>Christ</hi> accuseth sin, shames sinne, and by a secret vertue feedes vpon the very heart of <hi>sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee must vse <hi>sinne,</hi> as <hi>Christ was vsed,</hi> when hee was made sin for vs; wee must lift it vp, and make it naked by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of it to God; wee must pierce the hands, and feete, and heart of it by godly sorrow, and application of threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and by spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vpon it.</p>
            <p>The hands, I say, in respect of <hi>operation,</hi> that it may worke no more. The feet in respect of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, that it may raigne no longer; and the heart in respect of affection, that it may be loued no longer: wee haue an inward seate for concupiscence to lodge in. And thus as we should vpon all occasions, so especially in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:21382:153"/>
preparation to the Sabbath, and when we are to keep a Passeouer to the <hi>Lord.</hi> That was the time chosen to crucifie <hi>Christ</hi> in, and certainely it is a wonderfull fit time for vs to execute this worke of mortification vpon our sins.</p>
            <p>Lastly, this doctrine of the passion of <hi>Christ</hi> should wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully arme vs with <hi>patience</hi> in all afflictions. The <hi>Captaine</hi> of our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was consecrate through afflictions, Heb. 2.10. <hi>For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, s<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eing that he brought many children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory, that he should consecrate the Prince of their saluation through af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</hi> Though he were the son, yet he learned obedience by the things he suffered, Heb. 5.8. For as much as <hi>Christ</hi> hath suffered for vs in the flesh, wee should arme our selues with the same minde,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:21382:154"/>
1. Pet. 4.1. For wee are hereunto called, and <hi>Christ</hi> suffered for vs, leauing vs an example, that wee should follow his steps in doing well, and taking it patiently, when we suffer euill, 1. Pet. 2.19.20.21. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Afflictions are the markes of Christ, and we should glory in it alwaies to beare about in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the dying of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> 2. Cor. 4.10. Gal. 6.17. And God hath predestinated vs, that wee should bee conformed to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Sonne in sufferings, Rom. 8.29. And therefore if we will raigne with <hi>Christ,</hi> wee must suffer with him, 2. Tim. 2.12. Let vs therefore bee fully perswaded to take vp our crosse also daily, and follow him, Luke 9.23. Let vs therefore also go forth to him without the <hi>campe</hi> bearing his reproch, Heb. 13.13. And with
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:21382:154"/>
patience run the race that is set before vs; looking to him, that being the author, and finisher of our faith, endured such contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of sinners against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; endured the crosse, despised the shame, and resisted euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood, Heb. 12.1.2.3.4. Wee should neuer therfore be weary, or faint, hauing such a paterne before vs, and knowing the end God gaue to him, and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to vs, and accomplished in the experience of others of his seruants; but euen learne to obey God in this commandement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout afflictions, as well as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Thus of the vses for <hi>Instruction:</hi> the vses for <hi>Information</hi> follow.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the <hi>passion</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> may enforme vs in diuers things, as</p>
            <p>First, concerning true felicitie
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:21382:155"/>
in the negatiue consideration of it: for in as much as <hi>Christ</hi> had so little to doe with the world, and spent his daies so without the profits and pleasures of this life, it shewes, that his kingdome was not of this world, and that the best treasures lie not in these things; and besides, that one may bee truly blessed, and yet be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely destituted of these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts of life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, concerning the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerousnes of the doctrine of the <hi>Papists</hi>: for these principles shew vs, that we must for euer separate from them, if they persist in their heresies: for they teach vs, that <hi>Christ</hi> did not once for al fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God, but that the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice must be renewed daily in the Masse, contrary to the expresse words of the text, Heb. 9.26.28. <hi>For then must he<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> haue often suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:21382:155"/>
since the foundation of the world: but now in the end of the world hath he appeared once to put away sinne by the sacrifice of himselfe</hi>:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So Christ was once offered to take away the sinnes of many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 10.11.12. <hi>And euery Priest appeareth daily ministring, and oft times offereth one manner of offering, which can neuer take away sinnes:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes, sitteth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at the right hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And besides, they teach, that men may make satisfaction to God for their sins by their owne workes, and by the workes of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, concerning the most wofull condition of wicked men that liue in their sinnes, they may fully see, how they shall speede with God by this that befell
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:21382:156"/>
               <hi>Christ.</hi> If God spared not his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Sonne, that was but a suretie for sinne, will he spare them that are principals? would not God find out such a mercy to <hi>Christ,</hi> as to free him from such extremities; and do they trust to a mercy in God neuer reuealed in the word, neuer shewed to <hi>Christ?</hi> was not <hi>Christ</hi> able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such wofull tortures to beare the wrath of God; and doe they thinke to be able to endure those riuers of brimstone, and fier in <hi>Hell?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Concerning a singular and new way of obedience in <hi>Christ</hi>: if wee will needes haue workes of <hi>supererogation,</hi> let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them onely in <hi>Christ</hi>: for the doctrine of his <hi>passion</hi> tels vs of an obedience to a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, that was not in the Morall law; and that was his
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21382:156"/>
speciall submission to that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular will of his Father, in being that one that should die for the people. To expiate for other mens sinnes, is a speciall kind of righteousnesse, not mentioned in the Law.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Concerning the offence of the Crosse, though both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> stumbled at this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine at the first; yet we see there is no reason why wee should bee troubled at the abasements of <hi>Christ,</hi> but rather to reioyce, and wonder at the dreadfull expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made to God for vs in them. For thus it behoued him to suffer, as all the <hi>Prophets</hi> from <hi>Moses</hi> haue witnessed, 1. Cor. 1.23. Luk. 24.45.46.</p>
            <p>Thus of the vse for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>consolations</hi> follow.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the <hi>passion</hi> of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21382:157"/>
               <hi>Christ</hi> is exceeding comfortable, and that both in generall and particular <hi>consolations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is generally comfortable:</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, in respect of the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of our hearts, in the assurance that <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was the true <hi>Messias</hi> promised to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fathers. Which may appeare, if we consider but the history of his <hi>passion,</hi> in as much as in him were fulfilled al these signes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the seuerall ages of the old Church. The old prophesies were all accomplished in him. The scepter was now departed from <hi>Iuda,</hi> foretold, Genes. 49.10. They diuided his garments, and cast lots vpon his vesture, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Psalm. 22.8. They pierced his hands and feet. Psal. 22.16. The chiefe builders refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, according to Psal. 118.22. In his arraignment hee was
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:21382:157"/>
silent, &amp; opened not his mouth, according to Esa. 53.7. Hee was reckoned amongst the wicked in his death, according to Esa. 53.12. They gaue him gall and vineger to drinke, according to Psalm. 69.21. He accomplished the meaning of the sacrifices in shedding his blood, and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the <hi>campe</hi> Heb. 9.14. Heb. 13.11.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, if we consider the effects of his passion: for from hence flowes to vs, and euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. First the purchase both of our soules and bodies, 1. Cor. 6.20. <hi>For ye are bought for a price: therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your spirit: for they are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 7.4. <hi>So ye my brethren are dead also to the law by the body of Christ, that ye should bee vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen vnto him, that is raised vp
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21382:158"/>
from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit vnto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ratification of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall couenant, Heb. 9.16. <hi>For where a testament is, there must bee the death of him that made the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The reconciling of vs to God, Rom. 5.10. <hi>For if when wee were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, much more being reconciled, we shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by his life,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 3.18. <hi>For Christ also hath once suffered for sinnes: the iust for the vniust, that hee might bring vs to God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The abolishing of <hi>sinne,</hi> both in respect of the remission of the guilt, 1. Ioh. 1.7. <hi>The blood of Iesus Christ his Sonne cleanseth vs from all sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matth. 26.28. <hi>For this is my blood of the new testament, that is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:21382:158"/>
shead for many for the remission of sinnes.</hi> And sanctification against the power of it, Rom. 6.6. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that our old man is crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, that the body of sinne might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serue sinne, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The swallowing vp of death, 1. Cor. 15.54. <hi>So when this corruptible hath put on incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this mortall hath put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: then shall be brought to passe the saying that is written: Death is swallowed vp into victory.</hi> Vanquishing him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had power of death, freeing vs that were in bondage to the feare, and that of death, Hebr. 2.14.15. <hi>For as much then as the children are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of flesh and blood, he also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe likewise tooke part with them, that he might destroy through death him that had the power of death, that is, the diuell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:21382:159"/>
               <hi>And that hee might deliuer all them, which for feare of death were all their life time subiect to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Tim. 1.10. <hi>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus Christ, who hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished death, and hath brought life and immortality vnto light through the Gospell, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Liberty to enter into the most holy place of heauen, by a new and liuing way, Hebr. 9.12. <hi>Neither by the blood of goats and calues, but by his owne blood entred he in once vnto the holy place, and obtained eternal redemption for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hebr. 10.19. <hi>Seeing therefore, brethren, that by the blood of Iesus we may be bold to enter into the holy place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, if we consider the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>priesthood,</hi> of which he was in offering this sacrifice. He was
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:21382:159"/>
a Priest after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck,</hi> and not after <hi>Aaron,</hi> Psalm. 110.4. <hi>The Lord sware and will not repent, thou art a Priest for euer after the order of Melchisedeck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 7. all the chapter.</p>
            <p>Of all the Priests that were types of <hi>Christ, Melchisedeck</hi> was the most liuely and noblest type, and did most fully shadow out both the person and office of <hi>Christ:</hi> For by <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> three most comfortable things in <hi>Christ</hi> were shadowed out:</p>
            <p>The first was his dignity: hee was so a Priest, as he was a King also, able to feed and nourish the most mighty on earth, as the King of <hi>Salem</hi> did <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second was the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Priesthood, noted in two admirable benefits flowing from his obedience and passion, <hi>viz. Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:21382:160"/>
Righteousnesse, for hee is the Lord our righteousnesse: Peace, in that hee fully pacified Gods anger for our sinnes, as our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, and so he was indeed that King of <hi>Zedech,</hi> that is, of righteousnesse: and of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is, of peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third was the eternity of his Priesthood; hee is a Priest for euer, he dieth not, as did the sonnes of <hi>Leui,</hi> nor doth the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of his Priesthood euer cease. The holy Ghost of purpose concealeth the mention of the birth and death of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> that so hee might bee the fuller type of <hi>Christ,</hi> who had no father as man, nor mother as God; and of his dayes there is no end; which last thing is the speciall consolation, for which I allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this type. There is no time wherein we can want the benefit
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:21382:160"/>
of <hi>Christs</hi> sacrifice, if we haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to God, and the throne of his grace; and the rather because God hath sworne and will not repent, Psalm. 110.4.</p>
            <p>Thus in generall.</p>
            <p>In particular, there are many excellent comforts may bee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the passion of <hi>Christ,</hi> for</p>
            <p>First, hence wee may gather a matchlesse testimony, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, of the infinite loue of God to man, in that hee spared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him to the death for vs, Ioh. 3.16. <hi>For God so loued the world, that hee hath giuen his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoeuer beleeueth in him should not perish but haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Ioh. 4.9. <hi>In this appeared the loue of God toward vs, because God sent his only begotten Sonne into the world, that wee might liue through
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:21382:161"/>
him, &amp;c.</hi> Which may likewise assure vs, that there is nothing can be good for vs, but hee will certainly giue it vs also, Rom. 8.32. <hi>Who spared not his owne Sonne, but gaue him for vs all to death, how shall hee not with him giue vs all things also?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, shall wee euer doubt our freedome from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that know from hence what a price was paid for discharge of our debts by such a surety? How can we be so vildly infected with vnbeleefe? as to feare arresting, or imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or vndoing, when all is in <hi>Christ</hi> so fully and exquisitely satisfied to the very vttermost farthing. How could the surety haue euer escaped such <hi>iustice</hi> in God? such malice in men, and <hi>diuels,</hi> the sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants and iaylors? if he had not most abundantly payed all
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:21382:161"/>
could bee demanded.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, what an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may this bee to beleeue what <hi>Christ</hi> saith to vs? was not he a faithfull witnesse, &amp; teacher, that sealed his doctrine with his blood? great therefore is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Gospell, that truth which is according to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and to bee receiued with all full assurance without wauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or feare, Reuel. 1.5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, shall not his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample comfort vs in all trials, especially when we suffer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamest things can befall vs in this life? what are those to the sufferings of <hi>Christ?</hi> and with what compassion will he receiue vs in affliction, that was so affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted himselfe? Esa. 63.1—9. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in particular, it may ease in paines, and in death it selfe, to remember the dolours of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:21382:162"/>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> especially considering that from thence flowes a vertue to helpe vs in all our pangs and distresses, in life and death.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, there are many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular comforts may bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the manner of his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and diuers particularities in them: as</p>
            <p n="1">1. He suffered in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> &amp; so both fulfilled the types of the old Testament: for there was <hi>Isaac</hi> offered vp, and there the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were slaine, and also sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified vnto vs, that he had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for vs the vision of eternall peace, which the name <hi>Ierusalem</hi> importeth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, he suffered the first part of his chiefe passion in a garden, to comfort vs in the abolishing of the first <hi>sin,</hi> which was committed in a garden, and imputed to <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:21382:162"/>3. Thirdly, he was betrayed, taken, bound, and forsaken, and all for vs: hee was betrayed, to expiate our treason in <hi>Adam:</hi> he was taken, to restore vs cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues: hee was bound, that wee might be loosed: he was forsaken of all, euen of his owne best dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to let vs know, that hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone did performe the worke of satisfaction and redemption for vs, Esa. 63.3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, he was araigned &amp; condemned both by <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the <hi>consisiory</hi> of the Priests, and at the <hi>tribunall</hi> of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> therby to notifie both to Iews and Gentiles, that he was giuen to sacrifice for sins of both, &amp; to signifie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was the true <hi>Messias,</hi> or <hi>Shiloh,</hi> because now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scepter was departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Iuda</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen. 49.10</p>
            <p n="5">5. His silence to the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations shewes: 1. that he was
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:21382:163"/>
a greater person then hee that iudged him: 2. Secondly, that he fulfilled the Scriptures, that said he opened not his mouth, Esa. 53.7. 3. That hee suffered for our euill words, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it assures vs, that he suffered them as our surety, in that he did endure the imputation of such monstrous crimes, and yet held his peace.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He was whipped, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thornes; he was whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, to deliuer vs from both spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, corporall, and eternall scourges that was due vnto vs.</p>
            <p>The crowne of thornes may signifie:
<list>
                  <item>1. That hee expiated our ambition in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That he might merit for vs an eternall crowne.</item>
                  <item>3. That he would gather a kingly people out of the most
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:21382:163"/>
thorny and hurtfull nations, which as a crowne should compasse God about in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and honouring him.</item>
                  <item>4. That he had borne our thorny cares, and therfore we should cast all our care vpon him.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. He was clothed with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple garment, and a reed in his hand, which both signified, that he was a King, though they did it in scorne. His purple garment shewes, that hee was that great Warrior, which was forespoken of, when they said, Who is this that comes from <hi>Edom</hi> with red garments? &amp;c. Isaiah, 63.1. to 7. The reed was two waies comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: for first it shewed, that this was hee, that should breake the Serpents head: for a reed is the most mortall thing to a Serpent, as the learned record, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:21382:164"/>
they were vsed to kill them; and besides by a reed, as by a pen he did blot out the hand-writing in the debt-booke, that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He suffered in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a place of dead mens bones, in which the most notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders did suffer their punishment, that so hee might raise vp the Banner of <hi>Iustification,</hi> euen in the very place of contamination, and damnation.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Hee was vnclothed, and made naked to satisfie for the sin of our first parents, who were spoiled of the garment of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and to deliuer vs from sin and mortality, of which the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of skinne giuen to our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, were a monument; and perhaps to shew, how we should enter into heauen, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> did into <hi>paradise</hi> naked in body,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:21382:164"/>
but clothed in soule with <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> and <hi>immortality:</hi> but chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expiate for our shamefull wickednesse before God.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Hee was hanged vpon a tree, that so as death by the tree entred into the world, so on a tree it should be destroied, and life brought backe againe. And besides herein <hi>Christ</hi> answered the type in <hi>Isaacks</hi> offering vp, and the brasen Serpent lifted vp on high, Ioh. 3.14. and that <hi>Christ</hi> lifted vp in the aire, might ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Prince</hi> of the aire, and all his spirituall wickednesses, Coloss. 2.15. And that he might beare the curse of the Law, being in that kind of death made a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall curse for vs, Gal. 3.13.14.</p>
            <p n="11">11. He dranke gall and vini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wherein he both fulfilled the Scriptures, Psal. 69.21. <hi>For they gaue me gall in my meate, and in my
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:21382:165"/>
thirst they gaue me vineger to drink, &amp;c.</hi> And as the second <hi>Adam</hi> bare the punishment of the first <hi>Adams</hi> offence in tasting the iuice of the forbidden fruit.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The nailing of his hands and feete, assures vs of the cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the hand-writing of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that was against vs; both of the dissolution of all ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall agreements, and of the full cancelling of the bond morall for so much, as concernes the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that lay vpon vs, Coloss. 2. 14, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto of the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinnes.</p>
            <p>The third part of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> followes, and that is the intercession of <hi>Christ:</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which there are foure <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Christ</hi> at the right hand of God maketh intercession for vs, Rom. 8.34. <hi>Who shall condemne? It is Christ, which is dead, yea, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is risen againe, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at the right hand of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth request also for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able also perfectly to saue them, that come vnto God by him, seeing he euer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to make intercession for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:21382:166"/>2. That we haue no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessour in heauen but <hi>Christ,</hi> 1. Tim. 2.5.6. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator betweene God and man, which is the Man Christ Iesus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who gaue himselfe a ransome for all men to bee a testimony in due time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Isaiah 59.16. <hi>And when he saw, that there was no man, he wondred, that there was no intercessour; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his arme did saue it, and his righteousnesse it selfe did sustaine it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That the intercession of <hi>Christ</hi> is perpetuall, hee so doth it once, as hee will neuer faile to doe it in all ages, Heb. 7.25.28. <hi>For the Law maketh men high priests which haue infirmitie: but the word of the oth, that was since the law, maketh the sonne, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated for euermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:21382:166"/>4. That he makes intercession onely for the <hi>Elect,</hi> Iohn 17.9. <hi>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast giuen me: for they are thine &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the explication of these principles, three things must be opened.</p>
            <p>The first is the acceptation of the word <hi>intercession:</hi> for it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth</p>
            <p>Sometimes the prayers which the godly make in the name of <hi>Christ</hi> the intercessor, to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Gods iudgements from their brethren in this world, and so it is taken, 1. Tim. 2.1. <hi>I exhort therefore, that first of all supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prayers, intercessions, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thanks be made for all men, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the complaints, that men make or pretend to make against the faults of others:
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:21382:167"/>
Thus <hi>Elias</hi> made intercession a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Israel,</hi> Rom. 11.2. And the <hi>Iewes</hi> made intercession against <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 25.24. But vsually it signifieth that part of the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Christ,</hi> in which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares before God to preuent or pacifie his displeasure towards the <hi>Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The second is, how many waies <hi>Christ</hi> makes intercession for vs, and so there are seuen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct things in the intercession of <hi>Christ:</hi> for</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, he presents himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God with his merits ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring his sacrifice for our satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Heb. 9.24. <hi>For Christ is not entred into the holy places that are made with hands, which are simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the true sanctuary: but is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into very heauen, to appeare now in the sight of God for vs.</hi> And so pacifying God toward vs, Ier. 30.31.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:21382:167"/>2. Hee praied, and still doth pray for vs: all his prayers on earth were a part of his interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and he still prayeth for vs in heauen, Rom. 8.34. <hi>Who is also at the right hand of God, and maketh request also for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able also perfectly to saue them, that come vnto God by him, seeing hee euer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to make intercession for them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He offers vp our prayers and praises to God, Reuel. 8.3.4. <hi>That he should offer with the prayers of all Saints vpon the golden altar, which is before the throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the smoke of the odours with the prayers of the Saints went vp before God out of the Angels hand.</hi> And so all our good works, Col. 1.22. <hi>In the body of his flesh through death, to make you holy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and without fault in his sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:21382:168"/>4. He vndertakes for vs before God, and giues his word for vs, that we being mindfull of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation through him, shall es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew <hi>sinne</hi> by his grace, and not prouoke God any more, as wee haue done. This sponsion is a necessary part of the office of an intercessor, Iohn 17.6. <hi>I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared thy name vnto the men, which thou gauest mee out of the world, thine they were, and thou gauest them mee, and they haue kept thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="25">25. <hi>O righteous Father, the world hath also not knowne thee, but I haue knowne thee, and these haue knowne that thou hast sent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="26">26. <hi>And I haue declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them thy name, and will declare it, that the loue wherewith thou hast loued me, may be in them, and I in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. He pleades our cause as an

aduocate, and remoues and non-suites all accusations, which men or <hi>Diuels</hi> may make against vs to God, Rom. 8.34. as before, 1. Ioh. 2.1. <hi>My babes, these things write I vnto you, that ye sinne not: and if any man sinne, we haue an Aduocate with the Father: Iesus Christ the iust, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. He poureth out vpon vs the spirit of intercession, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vs after an vnutterable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to make our moanes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests to God, Rom. 8.26. <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the spirit also helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: for we know not what to pray as we ought: but the Spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sighes, which cannot be expressed, &amp;c.</hi> So in the 15: <hi>For ye haue not receiued the spirit of bondage to feare againe: but ye haue receiued the spirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option, whereby wee cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:21382:169"/>Gal. 4.6.7. <hi>And because yee are sonnes, God hath sent forth the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Sonne into your hearts, which crieth Abba Father, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Hee sprinkleth his blood vpon vs, by application of his merits to vs, which cries and makes intercession for vs, Heb. 12.24. <hi>And to Iesus the Mediatour of the new Testament, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things, then that of Abel, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, in which nature he maketh intercession? &amp; I answer, in both. For howsoeuer, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>Diuine</hi> nature of <hi>Christ, Christ</hi> is then equall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the same in <hi>essence,</hi> and so it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not fitly be said, that <hi>Christ</hi> requesteth any thing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet if we respect the person of <hi>Christ</hi> in his diuine nature, as it is personally vnited to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humane in the dispensatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of grace, as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:21382:169"/>
he hath vndertaken for vs: so it is no more inconuenient to pray for vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the forme of a seruant for vs; and the office of a <hi>Mediatour,</hi> vnto which belongs this worke of praying.</p>
            <p>The vse of all may be, first, for confutation of the <hi>Papists,</hi> who do most sacrilegiously dishonor the intercession of <hi>Christ,</hi> by substitu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting secondary intercessors. The office is bestowed onely on the Kings son, and they most iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously would imploy the kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: we know no Master of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, but <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; nor doth it help the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they say, they haue <hi>mediators</hi> of intcrcession, but not of rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, but only <hi>Christ:</hi> for when they acknowledge and beg not only the prayers, but the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits too of the Saints to purge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their sinnes, and supply their
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:21382:170"/>
wants, they make them <hi>mediators</hi> of redemption also.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for instruction, and so it should teach vs:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To imitate this part of the Priesthood of <hi>Christ,</hi> both by praying to God for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and for all sorts of men, though they bee our enemies, 1. Tim. 2.1. and also by making peace, and keeping it, as much as is possible amongst men. Blessed are the peace-makers: for this makes them like the Sonne of God, Matth. 5 7. and seeing the Saints shall iudge the world, they should put in to end the quarrels amongst the brethren, if it may be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, to liue so, as <hi>Christ</hi> may haue credit by vs, in giuing his word for vs. Hath <hi>Christ</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for vs to God, and shall not we bee carefull to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:21382:170"/>
of our power to be such, as he hath promised for vs, we shall be, Iohn 17.10.18.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To pray and giue thankes much, and so to doe all the good we can, seeing it shall all be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to God by <hi>Christ,</hi> Colos. 1. 22. Reuel. 8.3.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To establish our selues in the full assurance of faith, seeing all our imperfections are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>Christs</hi> intercession, and we may approch to God by this new and liuing way, and be sure of heauen also, euen to come within the vaile, when we die, Heb. 10.19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for consolation: for wee may and ought to bee much refreshed, if we consider, that by the intercession of <hi>Christ</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The fauour of God is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished vpon vs, and God is kept quiet from being prouoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

vs; God and we are now through him all one, Ioh. 17.21.</p>

            <p n="3">3. The diuell is restrained, he cannot hurt vs, either by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or accusing; our faith shall be kept, that it faile not, Zach. 3. 3. Rom. 8.34. Luke 22.32.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our sinnes which we daily commit, are forgiuen vs, he being an earnest aduocate to pleade for vs, 1. Iohn 2.1.2.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We shall be protected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the hatred of the world, Iohn 17.14.15.16. <hi>I haue giuen them thy word, and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou keepe them from euill, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Our prayers and suites shall

bee all presented and obtained, Reuel. 8.4.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We shall be kept from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and preserued vnto the end, vntill wee be perfected from all <hi>sinnes</hi> and wants, Ioh. 17.11. <hi>And now am I no more in the world, these are in the world, and I come to thee: holy Father keepe them in thy name, euen them whom thou hast giuen me, that they may be one as we are.</hi>

That man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of administration, which hee now vseth in gathering and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing his Church shall then cease, there shall be then no need of it.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the explication, that wee may more distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of this office of <hi>Christ,</hi> as King, we must consider of foure things in it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The victory ouer the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that opposed his title.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:21382:178"/>2 His kingly glory, with which he was qualified, and prepared for gouernment.</item>
               <item>3. His taking of possession of the kingdome.</item>
               <item>4. His administration, after he had possession.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the first, <hi>Christ</hi> fought for his kingdome, and most victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ouercame the <hi>Diuell, sinne, death</hi> and <hi>hell,</hi> and rescued his subiects from their thraldome, 1. Cor. 15.54.55. Colos. 2.15. Heb. 2.14. And this victory hee accomplished, and proclaimed in his resurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p>For the second: the Regall glory of <hi>Christ</hi> consisted in two things: the first was the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his humane nature. And the second was his triumph ouer his enemies.</p>
            <p>The glorificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his humane
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:21382:178"/>
nature contained, 1. the deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the infirmities accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying our nature, which hee vndertooke for our sakes; so as now hee ceased to hunger, or thirst, or bee weary, or feele any paine, or griefe, nor could he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any more, or die.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The perfecting of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of celestiall gifts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments could possibly befall a created nature, both in body and mind. His very body was glorified, surpassing the <hi>Sunne</hi> in the firmament, for splendor and brightnesse.</p>
            <p>Now for the triumph of <hi>Christ,</hi> he acted it two waies:
<list>
                  <item>1. In those frequent manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations after his resurrection for the 40. dayes hee was pleased to abide on earth.</item>
                  <item>2. In that most glorious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:21382:179"/>
riding in the chariot of triumph vp into heauen, leading with him captiuity captiue.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing is, his taking possession of his kingdome, and this he did, when he sat downe at the right hand of the Maiesty of God, and was exalted aboue all that is named, and had power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all things giuen him of his Father.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing is, his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the kingdome, of which hee is now possest; and this hath in it foure things:
<list>
                  <item>1. The calling and gathering together both of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> belonging to the <hi>election</hi> of God, Rom. 8.30. Ephes. 4.11. 12. Esa. 11.11.12.</item>
                  <item>2. The prescribing of lawes, as the onely law-giuer of the Church, and this he doth when hee propoundeth vnto his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:21382:179"/>
the rules both of beleeuing, and liuing by the word and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the same, adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the work of the Spirit, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his lawes vpon their hearts, Iam. 4.12. Ier. 31.33. 2. Cor. 3. 17.18.</item>
                  <item>3. The donation of gifts, ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling men to the Kingdome of God, Ephes. 4.8. Philip. 1.29.</item>
                  <item>4. The execution of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and so he doth iustice,</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Amongst his owne subiects, and so he doth them <hi>Iustice,</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In iustifying them from their sins, in acquitting them and pronouncing them absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from all the sentences of Gods iustice giuen out against them.</item>
                  <item>2. By distributing rewards among them, both in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and temporall things.</item>
                  <item>3. By keeping them in their
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:21382:180"/>
bonds, and preseruing them in the feare of God, and a iust course of life.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Against his enemies, whom he either restraines, or subdues: hee restraines them, by setting them their bounds, which they may not passe; by infatuating their counsels, and by being a wall of brasse about his owne. He subdues them either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting them, and so making them come in, and doe him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or else by confounding them, which he begins partly by outward iudgements, partly by induration, as deliuering them vp to a reprobate sense, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing it in their miserable ends, casting them into vtter darkenesse.</p>
            <p>This administration of his kingdome he executes, partly in this life, and partly in the world
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:21382:180"/>
to come: the one is his kingdom of grace, the other of glory; what is but begun here, is fully made compleate in that other world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vses</hi> of the <hi>Regall</hi> office of <hi>Christ</hi> follow,</p>
            <p>And those are partly for <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> partly for <hi>Consolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, for <hi>Instruction,</hi> and wee should learne,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ascribe all glory, and dominion to him for euer, wee should so admire the greatnesse and maiesty of our King, as our hearts should bee most affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately moued to his continuall praises: Let the people praise thee, <hi>O God,</hi> yea, let all the people praise thee; O sing praises to our God, sing praises, sing praises with vnderstanding, Psal. 47.6.7. Reuel. 1.5.</p>
            <p>Reuel. 5.12.13.14. <hi>Saying with a loud voice, Worthie is the Lambe,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:21382:181"/>
that was killed to receiue power, and riches, and wisdome, and strength, and honour, and glory, and praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And all the creatures, which are in heauen, and on the earth, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth, and in the sea, and all that are in them heard I saying; Praise, and honour, and glory, and power be vnto him, that sitteth vpon the throne, and vnto the Lambe for euermore, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this end wee should learne</p>
            <p n="2">2. To pray, that God would giue vs the spirit of wisdome and reuelation, that the eies of our vnderstanding may bee enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to discerne the working of his mighty power, which hee wrought in <hi>Christ</hi>; when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his owne right hand in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly places farre aboue all <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> and euery
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:21382:181"/>
name that is named, not onely in this world, but also in that which is to come; &amp; hath put all things vnder his feete, and made him head ouer all things belonging to the <hi>Church,</hi> Ephes. 1.17. to the end.</p>
            <p>And with all we should stirre vp our selues</p>
            <p n="3">3. To pray daily, that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may come, that the people that yet are in darkenesse, may be conuerted; and that his glory may shine more and more in those, that haue submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to his Scepter: and to this end, that the ordinances of his kingdome, especially the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell may run with power, and mightily conquer and enlarge the bounds of his kingdome; and that all opposite kingdomes may be subuerted, as is that of <hi>Anti-Christ,</hi> especially
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:21382:182"/>
that his kingdome of glory may be hastened vpon vs.</p>
            <p>And for our owne parts wee should euery one be ready,</p>
            <p n="4">4. To send our Lamb to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the earth, Isai. 16.1. to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our homage, and offer our seruice, &amp; testifie our aleageance with all humilitie, and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse vnto this King of Kings, the Lord our mighty Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and throughout the course of our liues.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To bow at the name of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and to feare him, that is a great King aboue all gods, and hath a name aboue all names: to confesse his soueraigntie, and submit to his gouernment, and to tremble before him, and to thinke of him with all reuerence, Phil. 2.9.10 11. Psalm. 2.10.11.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And to come willingly at all the times of the publike as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:21382:182"/>
of his armies in holy beauty, we should all flock to the colours of the King, and neuer giue ouer the care of assembling our selues in the courts of our God; but with al gladnesse go vp to the house of the Lord, the courts of the King, the place of his holy presence, where he sits in his throne amongst vs, Ps. 110.3.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To seeke to <hi>Christ</hi> in al our necessities, seeing hee is so exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that now he is able to help vs in all times of need according to the riches of his glory.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To be tender, and zealous for the glory and honor of <hi>Christ</hi>: shall not our hearts rise at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour of our King?</p>
            <p n="9">9. To obserue whatsoeuer he commands, in nothing refusing him, that speaketh from heauen, Mat. 28.20. <hi>Teaching them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue all things, whatsoeuer I haue
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:21382:183"/>
commanded you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 12.25. <hi>See that ye despise not him, that speaketh; for if they escaped not, which refused him, that spake on earth: much more shall we not escape, if wee turne away from him, that speaketh from heauen, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. To seeke those things that are aboue, where he sitteth at the right hand of God, and to haue our conuersation in heauen, since as subiects of his kingdome wee are freemen of the new <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Philip. 3.20. <hi>But our conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in heauen, from whence also we looke for the Sauiour, euen the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Col. 3.1. <hi>If ye then be risen with Christ, seeke those things which are aboue, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:21382:183"/>11. To dwell securely, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging wee haue secure protection in his seruice, and not to be afraid of any feare, Ier. 23. 5.6. <hi>Behold, the daies come, saith the Lord, that I will raise vnto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid a righteous branch, and a King shall raigne and prosper, and shall execute iudgement and iustice in the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his daies Iuda shall be saued, and Israel shall dwell safely, and this is the name whereby they shall call him; The Lord our righteousnes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. To carry our selues, as the seruants of the King. His subiects should differ in their manners from all other nations; and his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts should order themselues so, as may become his <hi>honour.</hi> And thus wee should alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist to our power the kingdom of darkenesse, and set our selues to ouercome the world, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:21382:184"/>
to denie our selues in the affection to the profits, and pleasures, &amp;c. of the world: and liue out of the feare of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the world, knowing it is honor enough to be such a Kings seruants; and out of feare euen of death it selfe, as knowing our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance by the victory, which our Sauiour had ouer death; and the assurance that he will come againe, and make our vile bodies like to his glorious body.</p>
            <p>And as this may teach men in general, so there be diuers things to bee vrged from hence vpon particular persons: as</p>
            <p>First, Kings, <hi>Iudges,</hi> and Rulers of the people should take notice of this, and do their homage, and bring their presents to this King of al Kings, Psalm. 68.29. and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are but his <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> they should bee learned in the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:21382:184"/>
Lawes of his kingdome, and get wisdome to carry themselues so, as may become those that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his person, not daring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the gouernment of <hi>Christ,</hi> or to set themselues to oppresse his subiects, Psalm. 2.10.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Ministers should especially stirre vp themselues to mind this great worke of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men from the world, to the kingdome of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, priuat <hi>Christians</hi> must take heed of iudging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for all <hi>iudgement</hi> is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Sonne, and hee is the onely supreme <hi>Iudge</hi> and Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; and therefore the <hi>Apostle Iames</hi> inferres, wee ought not to iudge our brethren.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, such as haue parted with their friends by death, must not sorrow for them that are gone, as men without hope, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:21382:185"/>
the kingdom of God is come vpon them, and they are with the <hi>Lord,</hi> and their dead bodies shall <hi>Christ</hi> bring with him in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, therefore they should not shame the gouernment of <hi>Christ</hi> by the ignorance heereof, but comfort themselues with these things, 1. Thes. 4.13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this may serue for wonderful <hi>consolation</hi> to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that two waies,
<list>
                  <item>1. The children of <hi>Zion</hi> may reioyce in their King, Psal. 149. 2. <hi>Let Israel reioyce in him, that made him, and let the children of Zion reioyce in their King.</hi> If they consider their wonderfull happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in being subiect to such a King, as

            <p>Secondly, that she is one, Eph. 4.4. <hi>There is one body, and one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, euen as ye are called in one hope of your saluation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cant. 6.8. <hi>But my Doue is alone, and my vndefiled, shee is the onely daughter of her mother, and shee is deare to her that bare her, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gal. 3.28. <hi>There is neither Iew, nor Grecian, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal: for ye are all one in Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Church is one, as in many other respects; so because
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:21382:189"/>
all the godly are mistically vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one body, Rom. 12.5. <hi>So we being many are one body in Christ, and euery one one anothers members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 4.15.16. <hi>But let vs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the truth in loue, and in all things grow vp into him which is the head, that is, Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By whom all the body being cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and knit together by euery ioynt for the furniture thereof (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the effectual power which is in the measure of euery part) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth encrease of the body into the edifying of it selfe in loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that shee is knit vnto <hi>Christ</hi> her head by an indissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnion, Colos. 1.18. <hi>And hee is the head of the body of the Church, hee is the beginning, and the first horne of the dead, that in all things he might haue the preeminence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colos. 2.19. <hi>And holdeth not the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:21382:189"/>
head, whereof all the body furnished and knit together by ioynts and hands, encreaseth with the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. 12.27. <hi>Now ye are the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, and members for your part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 1.22.23. <hi>And hath made all things subiect vnder his feet, and hath appointed him ouer all things to be the head to the Church,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which is his body, euen the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of him that filleth all in all things.</hi> So as she is truly bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, Ephes. 5.30. <hi>For wee are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One with <hi>Christ,</hi> not in nature as the Trinity is one; nor in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as the two natures in <hi>Christ,</hi> but in spirit, Ioh. 4.13. <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in vs, because he hath giuen vs of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:21382:190"/>
his spirit.</hi> For the spirit of the Sonne dwelleth in vs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that shee is holy, Ephes. 5.27. <hi>That he might make it vnto himselfe a glorious Church, not hauing spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without blame, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 2.9. <hi>But ye are a chosen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, a royall priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye should shew forth the vertues of him that hath called you out of darknesse into his maruellous light, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dan. 7.18. <hi>And they shall take the kingdome of the Saints of the most high, and possesse the kingdome for euer, euen for euer and euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so she is holy,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By separation from the world, in that the godly are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to holy vses: they are holy by calling.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By inchoation of true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:21382:190"/>
in nature, and practice, Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by the workes of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse which wee had done, but according to his mercy he saued vs by the washing of the new birth, and the renuing of the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By imputation of <hi>Christs</hi> holinesse being washed in his blood, Heb. 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are sanctified, euen by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the body of Iesus Christ once made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. By consummation of all holinesse in the other world.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, she is <hi>Catholick:</hi> this is one of the Articles of the Creed: the Church is <hi>Catholick</hi> in three respects:
<list>
                  <item>1. In respect of time, all the godly being members of this one body, though they liue in all the seuerall ages since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world.</item>
                  <item>2. In respect of place, because
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:21382:191"/>
all the iust both in heauen and earth are all of this one body, Ephes. 1.10. <hi>That in the dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fulnesse of the times hee might gather together in one all things, both which are in heauen, and which are in earth, euen in Christ.</hi> And so from all parts of the world is the Church gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all the particular Churches in the world are but members of this Church vniuersall.</item>
                  <item>3. In respect of persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is gathered especially since <hi>Christ,</hi> out of all nations, there being no difference put in respect of mens outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reuel. 5.9.10. <hi>And they sung a new song saying, Thou art worthy to take the booke, and to open the seales thereof, because thou wast kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and hast redeemed vs to God by thy blood, out of euery kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:21382:191"/>
               <hi>And hast made vs vnto our God Kings and Priests, and wee shall raigne on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Galath. 3.28. <hi>There is neither Iew nor Grecian, there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female: for yee are all one in Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, that shee is militant, that is, she is in this life exposed to crosses, and afflictions, and tentations, and oppositions, 2. Timoth. 4.7.8. <hi>I haue sought a good fight, and haue finished my course: I haue kept the faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For henceforth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse, which the Lord the righteous Iudge shall giue me at the day, and not to mee onely, but vnto all them also which loue his appearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Luk. 9.24. <hi>For whosoeuer will saue his life shall lose it; and whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shall lose his life for my sake, the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:21382:192"/>
same shall saue it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Act. 14.22. <hi>Confirming the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples hearts, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, affirming, that wee must through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 1.9. <hi>I Iohn euen your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdome and patience of Iesus Christ, was in the isle called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the witnessing of Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 12.11. <hi>But they ouercame him by the blood of the Lambe, and by the word of their testimony, and they loued not their liues vnto the death, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 6.12. <hi>For we wrastle not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst flesh &amp; blood, but against prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipalities, against powers, &amp; against the worldly gouernours, the princes of the darknesse of this world, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Lord would haue his Church so exposed to cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:21382:192"/>
both for his owne sake, and for hers, and for his enemies sake: 1. For his owne sake, that he might shew his hatred of <hi>sin,</hi> euen in his owne, and the glory also of his power and mercy in their deliuerance, as well as his <hi>iustice</hi> in their afflictions. 2. For their sakes, that being in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare humbled and tamed for their sinnes, they might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with the world, 1. Cor. 11. 31.32. and may be herein like to <hi>Christ,</hi> Rom. 8.27. 3. For their enemies sake, that they may know, that they shall neuer bee spared, if God spare not his owne children, 1. Pet. 4.17. <hi>For the time is come that iudgement must begin at the house of God: if it first begin at vs, what shall the end be of them, which obey not the Gospell of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seuenthly, that she is inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Matth. 16.18. <hi>And I say also
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:21382:193"/>
vnto thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not ouercome it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 8.37. <hi>Neuerthelesse in all these things we are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers, through him that loued vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">38. <hi>For I am perswaded, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="39">39. <hi>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate vs from the loue of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 5.10. <hi>And the God of all grace, which hath called vs vnto his eternall glory by Christ Iesus, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that yee haue suffered a little, make you perfect, confirme, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and stablish you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vses of these <hi>principles</hi> may be either
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:21382:193"/>
for
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Instruction.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Consolation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. For instruction, and so the sound consideration heereof may serue:</p>
            <p>First, to stirre vs vp to pray, that God would open our eyes to see the glory of his power and grace in the calling of his Church out of the world; and the most happy supremacie of <hi>Christ</hi> ouer the <hi>Church,</hi> and our owne felicity, if we be members of the <hi>Church,</hi> Ephes. 1.17. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to inflame in vs the care to make our calling and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> sure, that so we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly assured that we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the true Church. If any aske for some plaine signe, by which briefly the heart of man may establish it selfe in this point: I answere, that to be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:21382:194"/>
that we are true members of the Church, and body of <hi>Christ,</hi> we must carefully try our selues by such signes as these. For they are members of the Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That are called out of the world by the voice of the crier, and separated by the power of the word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That relie vpon <hi>Christs</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits for righteousnesse and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That cleaue vnto such as feare God with vnchangeable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as the onely people of the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That are reformed from their old euill conuersation, to the constant endeauours of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if we finde our selues to be of the <hi>Church,</hi> wee should striue for exceeding thankfulnes to God, that hath called vs out
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:21382:194"/>
of darknesse to this maruellous light, and saued vs from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, 1. Pet. 2.9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we should labour by holinesse of life to exceed all the <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> of the world, that men might see by our piety, that God hath done more for vs then for any such as they: our workes should speake for vs, that we are of the true Church; and not by our sinful liues dishonour God, as our Father, or the Church as our mother, Ephes. 1. 4. Ephes. 2.8. <hi>Christ</hi> comes into his garden, to see how his plants grow, Cant. 6.10. <hi>I went downe to the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valley, to see if the vine bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and if the pomegranets flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, wee should know no man after the flesh, nor reckon of
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:21382:195"/>
men by their meanes in the world, but by their relation to <hi>Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.16. <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea though wee haue knowne Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, wee should therefore auoid the society of the wicked, and not forsake the fellowship of the godly, 2. Cor. 6.15. <hi>What concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath the beleeuer with the infidell, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 5.7. <hi>Be not therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>And haue no fellowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darknesse, but euen reproue them rather.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thes. 3.14. <hi>If any man obey not our saying, note him by a letter, and haue no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="tcp:21382:195"/>Heb. 10.25. <hi>Not forsaking the fellowship that wee haue among our selues, as the manner of some is: but let vs exhort one another, and that so much more, because ye see the day draweth neere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seuenthly, wee should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carrie our selues one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, as fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in the same family, and fellow-citizens in the same City, with all meeknesse, patience, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and loue, Ephes. 4.2.3. <hi>With all humblenesse of mind, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, with long suffering, support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another through loue, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring to keepe the vnity of the spirit in the bond of peace, &amp;c.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly imploying our gifts for the good of the Church, Rom. 12.6.7.8.</p>
            <p>Eightly, seeing wee are in a continuall warfare, wee should stand vpon our guard, quitting
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:21382:196"/>
vs like men, and bee strong, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on all the armour of God, Ephes. 6.10.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, wee should for euer learne to thinke and speake reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of the Church of God, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is the house of God, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Christ,</hi> the ground and pillar of the truth, &amp; that Gods people are Gods hidden ones, Ephes. 3.15. 1. Tim. 3.15. Psalm. 83.3. And in particular, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Magistrates, that are deputed to the gouernment of the <hi>Church</hi> vnder <hi>Christ,</hi> shuld be carefull to doe their duties with all care. Ministers are charged in these Scriptures, Ioh. 21.15.16. 1. Pet. 5.2. 1. Cor. 12.28. 1. Tim. 3.15. as before.</p>
            <p>And Magistrates must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that God hath giuen them to bee nursing fathers to the Church, Esa. 60.10.11. 2. Chro.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:21382:196"/>
34.33. and 35.3. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And here is matter of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>consolation</hi> for all the true members of the true Church, if they consider:</p>
            <p>First, the loue of <hi>Christ</hi> toward them. Hee affecting them, as a Spouse or Wife, 2. Corint. 11.2. Reuel. 19.7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the fellowship they haue with <hi>Christ,</hi> 1. Cor. 1.9. <hi>God is faithfull, by whom ye are called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fellowship of his Sonne Iesus Christ our Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the care of <hi>Christ</hi> for their <hi>sanctification,</hi> Eph. 5.25.26. <hi>Christ loued the Church, and gaue himselfe for it, that he might sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it, and clense it by the washing of water through the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, the roiall furniture, with the which from <hi>Christ</hi> they are clad, being not destitute of any heauenly gifts, 1. Cor. 1.7. <hi>So
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:21382:197"/>
yee are not destitute of any gift, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 1.3. <hi>Blessed be God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which hath blessed vs with all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blessing in heauenly things in Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Col. 2.19. <hi>All the body furnished and knit together by ioynts &amp; bands, increaseth with the increasing of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, their safetie in al their warfarings, and their conquest and deliuerance out of all their troubles, and their assurance of full happinesse in the end.</p>
            <p>Rom. 8.37. <hi>Neuerthelesse in all these things wee are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, through him that loued vs:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 38. <hi>For I am perswaded that neither life nor death, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 39. <hi>Shall be able to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:21382:197"/>
vs from the loue of God, which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Col. 1.18. <hi>And he is the Head of the body of the Church: he is the beginning, and the first borne of the dead, that in all things hee might haue the preeminence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 5.10. <hi>The God of all grace, which hath called vs vnto his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory by Christ Iesus, after that ye haue suffered a little, will make you perfect, confirme, strengthen and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all this should comfort the more;</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we remember what wee were, and are in our selues. The <hi>Church</hi> is black, Cantic. 1.4. And the daughter of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Psal. 45. and <hi>Christ</hi> found her out first in her blood, Ezech. 16.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we consider, that there is no accepting of persons: but the <hi>Eunuches</hi> and the strangers may
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:21382:198"/>
be admitted into the Church, as well as the children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Isaiah 56.3. <hi>Let not the son of the stranger which is ioyned to the Lord, speake, and say, the Lord hath surely separate me from his people, neither let the Eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree, &amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of grace, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of grace in this life are two.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Iustification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Iustification,</hi> there are these <hi>principles:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, that al men haue sinned, and the whole world is guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:21382:198"/>
God naturally, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, Rom. 3.19.23. <hi>Now wee know, that whatsoeuer the Law saith, it saith to them, which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; that euery mouth may be stopped, and all the world be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For there is no difference: for all haue sinned, and are depriued of the glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gal. 3.22. <hi>But the Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the promise by the faith of Iesus Christ should bee giuen to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that by mens owne workes no flesh can be iustified, Rom. 3.20. <hi>Therefore by the workes of the Law shall no flesh be iustified in his sight: for by the Law commeth the knowledge of sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Titus 3.5. <hi>Not by the workes of righteousnesse which wee had done, but according to his mercy hee saued
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:21382:199"/>
vs by the washing of the new birth, and the renewing of the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gal. 3.11. <hi>And that no man is iustified by the Law in the sight of God, it is euident: for the iust shall liue by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Phil. 3.9. <hi>And might be found in him, that is, not hauing mine own righteousnesse, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, euen the righteousnesse, which is of God through faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iustified, I say, before God: for by workes wee may bee iustified before men, of which <hi>iustification</hi> the <hi>Apostle Iames</hi> speakes in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which maketh vs iust, is in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> being made ours by <hi>imputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 5.21. <hi>For he hath made him to bee sinne for vs, which knew no sinne, that we should be made the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:21382:199"/>
righteousnesse of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.30. <hi>But ye are of him in Christ Iesus, who of God is made vnto vs wisedome, and righteousnes, and sanctification, and redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 5.18.19. <hi>Likewise then as by the offence of one, the fault came on all men to condemnation: so by the iustifying of one, the benefit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded toward all men to the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners: so by the obedience of one, shall many also bee made righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Phil. 3.9. <hi>And might be found in him, that is, not hauing mine owne righteousnesse, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, euen the righteousnes which is of God through faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ier. 23.6. <hi>In his daies Iuda shall be saued, and Israel shall dwell safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and this is the name, whereby
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:21382:200"/>
they shall call him, The Lord our righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 4.7. <hi>Blessed are they, whose iniquities are forgiuen, and whose sinnes are couered, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That this righteousnesse is made ours onely by faith, and so we are iustified onely by faith, as it apprehends, and laies hold vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and relies on the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Christ,</hi> Rom. 3.28. <hi>Therfore we conclude, that a man is iustified by faith, without the workes of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gal. 2.16. <hi>Know that a man is not iustified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Iesus Christ, euen we, I say, haue beleeued in Iesus Christ, that we might be iustified by the faith of Christ, and not by the workes of the Law; because that by the works of the Law no flesh shall be iustified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 1.26.17. <hi>For I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:21382:200"/>
of the Gospell of Christ: for it is the power of God vnto saluation to euery one that beleeueth; to the Iew first, and also to the Grecian:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For by it the righteousnesse of God is reuealed from faith to faith, as it is written: The iust shall liue by faith,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 11.6. <hi>But without faith it is vnpossible to please God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That this faith is the gift of God, Ioh. 6.29. <hi>Iesus answered and said vnto them; This is the worke of God, that yee beleeue in him, whom he hath sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 12.3. <hi>For I say through the grace that is giuen vnto me, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that is among you, that no man presume to vnderstand aboue that which is meet to vnderstand: but that he vnderstand according to sobrietie, as God hath delt to euerie man the measure of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Phil. 1.29. <hi>For vnto you it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for Christ, that not onely yee
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:21382:201"/>
should beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephesians, 2.8. <hi>For by grace are yee saued through faith, and that not of your selues: it is the gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hebrewes, 12.2. <hi>Looking vnto Iesus, the author and finisher of our faith, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, that all men haue not faith, Isaiah, 53.1. <hi>Who will belieue our report? and to whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thess. 3.2. <hi>For all men haue not faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore this faith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the faith of Gods <hi>Elect,</hi> Titus 1.1. <hi>Paul a seruant of God, and an Apostle of Iesus Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the faith of Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seuenthly, that there is but one kind of faith, by which all the <hi>elect</hi> of God are iustified, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:21382:201"/>
4.5. <hi>There is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, that being iustified by faith, wee haue peace with God, and forgiuenesse of all our sins, Rom. 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to bee a reconciliation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousnesse by the forgiuenesse of sinnes, that are passed through the patience of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 5.1. <hi>Then being iustified by faith, we haue peace toward God through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The consideration of these <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
should worke in vs:</p>
            <p>First, a speciall care of diuers duties; as</p>
            <p n="1">1. The detestation of that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that teacheth men to rest vpon the merits of their owne works, contrary to these expresse Scriptures, Rom. 3.20. <hi>Therefore by the works of the Law shall no flesh
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:21382:202"/>
be iustified in his sight: for by the Law commeth the knowledge of sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gal. 3.10. <hi>For as many as are of the workes of the Law, are vnder the curse: for it is written, Cursed is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the Law to doe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 2.8.9. <hi>For by grace are ye saued through faith, and that not of your selues, it is the gift of God:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not of workes, least any man should boast himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Titus 3.5. <hi>Not by the works of righteousnesse which we had done, but according to his mercy he saued vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which we should carrie in our minds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of the loue of <hi>Christ</hi> in vs, and the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the riches of Gods grace, Rom. 5.6.7.8. <hi>For Christ, when we were yet of no strength, at his time
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:21382:202"/>
died for the vngodly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doubtlesse one will scarce die for a righteous man: but yet for a good man it may be, that one dare die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But God setteth out his loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, seeing that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. An especiall care aboue al things to beleeue, accounting all things but dung, in comparison of the knowledge of <hi>Christ</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Without this faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please God, Heb. 11.6. Wee should neuer rest, till wee could say, it is the <hi>Lord</hi> our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, Ier. 23.6. We are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, if we haue not such a faith as will <hi>iustifie</hi> vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Tell vs distinctly, what wee must doe about beleeuing, which being done, wee may bee sure we are iustified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solut.</hi> First, thou must beleeue, that <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:21382:203"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:21382:204"/>
               <hi>Messias,</hi> and the very Son of God, Matth. 16.16.</p>
            <p>1. Iohn 4.15. <hi>Whosoeuer confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that Iesus is the Sonne of God, in him dwelleth God, and he is in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, thou must rest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>passion</hi> and obedience of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as the onely sufficient meanes of thy happinesse, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the promises, that declare thy liberty so to doe, Rom. 4.23. 24. Rom. 5.17.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, thou must in thy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers present <hi>Christ</hi> to God, and make it knowne as a couenant of thy heart, that thou doest relie vpon him onely; and so giue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God against the feare of the Law, sinne, death, and hell.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, thou must resolue to rest in this course, and neuer to depart from thy confidence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: thus the iust must liue by their faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="tcp:21382:204"/>Thus of the third vse.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we should bee stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to shew forth daily the vse, and power, and truth of our <hi>iustification</hi> by the effects of it; which we should striue to stirre vp in vs, as namely wee should shew, that we are iustified:</p>
            <p n="1">1. By confirming our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in peace and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By going boldly to God, and the throne of his grace; as knowing in how much grace we stand with God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By comforting our selues in the hope of glory, as knowing that we are heires of the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By glorying in tribulation, being neuer ashamed of our faith and hope, Rom. 5.1.2.3.4.5. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The doctrine of our free iustification should teach vs to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:21382:205"/>
carie our selues with all compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and meekenes toward other men, that yet liue in their sins: for we were such as they once, till the grace of God appeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any desert of ours.</p>
            <p>Titus 3.1.2.3.4.5. &amp;c. <hi>Put them in remembrance, that they be subiect to the principalities, and powers, and that they bee obedient and readie to euery good worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they speake euill of no man; that they be no fighters, but soft, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all meekenesse vnto all men:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For we our selues were in times past vnwise, disobedient, deceiued, seruing the lusts, and diuers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, liuing in maliciousnesse, and enuie, hatefull, and hating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. We should bee carefull of good workes, to free the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine of liberty from the aspersions of euill men, and to
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:21382:205"/>
shew our thankfulnesse to God, and the truth of our faith, Rom. 3.31. <hi>Doe we then make the law of none effect through faith? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid; yea we establish the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iam. 2. the latter part of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>Tit. 3.7.8. <hi>That we being iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his grace, should bee made heires according to the hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is a true saying, and these things I will thou shouldest affirme, that they which haue beleeued in God, might be carefull to shew forth good workes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. This should make vs for euer to iudge of mens worth by their faith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.5.</note> and to say, Oh, he, or she is blessed, that beleeued; and to account highly of poore <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> that are rich in faith.</p>
            <p n="8">8. For euer while we liue, we should glory not in our selues,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:21382:206"/>
but in the <hi>Lord,</hi> acknowledging whatsoeuer we are, we are by the grace of God, 1. Cor. 1.31. <hi>That according as it is written, He that reioyceth, let him reioyce in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 3.27. <hi>Where is then the rei<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ycing? It is excluded: by what law? of workes: Nay, but by the law of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondl<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, this doctrine should worke in vs much <hi>consolation,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen life from the dead: <hi>Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is called <hi>iustification</hi> of life, Rom. 5.18. It should quicken vs aboue many other doctrines, and the rather if we consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in <hi>Christ</hi> there is a daily <hi>propitiation</hi> for all our sins, Rom. 3.25. 1. Ioh. 2.2. Hee will see our filthy garments taken off vs, and clothe vs with change of raiment, Zach. 3.3.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the very blessing of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:21382:206"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> comes vpon vs; we are heires of the world as well as hee, Galath. 3.9. <hi>They which bee of faith, are blessed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Abraham.</hi> Rom. 4.11.12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That though this be clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with a condition of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; yet wee are not excepted, but may lawfully rest vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Christ</hi>; yea wee are commanded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, 1. Ioh. 3.23. <hi>This is then his commandement, that wee beleeue in the name of his Sonne Iesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> Yea God doth beseech vs to be reconciled, 2. Cor. 5.20. <hi>Now then are wee Embassadours for Christ, as though God did beseech you through vs, wee pray you in Christs stead, that ye be reconciled to God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That this beleeuing in <hi>Christ,</hi> makes vs accounted as righteous as euer <hi>Adam</hi> was, or we could haue been, if wee had
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:21382:207"/>
kept the morall law, and God is as well pleased with vs: our faith is accounted for righteousnesse, and in stead of it, Rom. 4.5. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him that iustifieth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his faith is counted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That we may from hence gather also assurance of raigning with God in another world, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> shewes, Rom. 5.9. 10.11. <hi>Much more then being now iustified by his blood, we shall bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from wrath through him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For if when we were enemies, wee were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne; much more being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, wee shall bee saued by his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>For if by the offence of one death raigned through one; much more shall they which receiue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of grace, and of the gift
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:21382:207"/>
of righteousnes, raign in life through one, that is, Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 8.30. <hi>Whom he iustified, them also he glorified, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Lastly, that nothing shall separate vs from this loue of God, no accusation shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued against vs, Rom. 8.33.34. 35.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this may serue for great reproofe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, for the neglect of faith in many; oh who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched thee, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not beleeue? why will yee still bee shut vp, and liue vnder the curse? Galath. 3.1. <hi>O foolish Galathians, who hath bewitched you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>As many as are vnder the workes of the law, are vnder the curse, &amp;c.</hi>

Of the most of vs, for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning still too much to our owne workes; we can hardly tell, how, in our either glorying, or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to quit our selues from the infection of pleading merit of workes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of many deare seruants of God for their slothfulnesse, and miserable neglect of the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith; resting still in their weaknesse of faith, and not stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to be fully perswaded.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto of <hi>Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Sanctification</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. Concerning <hi>Sanctification</hi> there are these <hi>principles</hi>:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That whom God iustifieth, he sanctifieth, Rom. 8.30. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer whom he predestinate, them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hee called, and whom hee called, them also he iustified, and whom he iustified, them he also glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ezech. 36.26.27. &amp;c. <hi>A new heart also will I giue you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:21382:209"/>
take away the stony heart out of your body, and I will giue you an heart of flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walke in my sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and ye shall keepe my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and doe them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That to be truly sanctified, is to die to sinne, and to rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to newnesse of life, Rom. 6.1.2.3.4. <hi>What shall we say then? shall we continue in sinne, that grace may abound? God forbid: how shall we that are dead to sinne, liue yet therein?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Know ye not, that all wee which haue bin baptized into Iesus Christ, haue been baptized into his death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are buried then with him by baptisme into his death, that like as Christ was raised vp from the dead by the glory of the Father; so we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so should walke in newnesse of life, &amp;c.</hi> Or it is to repent &amp; beleeue
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:21382:209"/>
the Gospell, Mark. 1.15. <hi>The time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of God is at hand: repent, and beleeue the Gospell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That except wee be borne againe, we cannot enter into the kingdome of God, Ioh. 3.5. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus answered, verily, verily I say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, except that a man bee borne of water and of the spirit, hee cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 12.14. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holinesse, without the which no man shall see the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Ioh. 1.7. <hi>But if we walke in the light, as he is in the light, wee haue fellowship one with another, and the blood of Iesus Christ his Sonne clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vs from all sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 5.17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Christ, let him bee a new creature: old things are passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, behold all things are become new.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:21382:210"/>Fourthly, that sanctification is Gods gift, and worke in <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; we can no more conuert our selues, then wee can beget our selues at first: wee can no more create our selues new men, then wee can create our selues men, Act. 5.31. <hi>Him hath God lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp with his right hand to bee a Prince, and a Sauiour, to giue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Israel, &amp; forgiuenes of sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Act. 11.18. <hi>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God saying: then hath God also to the Gentiles granted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance vnto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Tim. 2.25. <hi>Instructing them with meeknes, that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; prouing if God at any time will giue them repentance, that they may know the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. 1.30. <hi>But ye are of him in Christ Iesus, who of God is made vnto vs wisdome, and righteousnes,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:21382:210"/>
and sanctification and redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ezech. 37.28. <hi>Thus the heathen shall know, that I the Lord doe san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie Israel, when my sanctuary shall be amongst them for euermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by the workes of righteousnesse which wee had done, but according to his mercy he saued vs by the washing of the new birth, and the renuing of the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, that our sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vnperfect, while wee liue in this world, 1. Ioh. 1.8. <hi>If wee say that wee haue no sinne, wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our selues, and the truth is not in vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prou. 24.16. <hi>For a iust man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth seuen times and riseth againe: but the wicked fall into mischiefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Esa. 64.6. <hi>But we haue all been as an vncleane thing, and all our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes is as filthy clouts; and we do all fade like a leafe, and our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:21382:211"/>
like the wind haue taken vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vses may be for
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Information:</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Instruction:</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the first: wee may heere take notice of the wisedome of God in curing the posterity of <hi>Adam.</hi> Wee receiued a double disease from <hi>Adam:</hi> the one was guilt of eternal death: the other was corruption of nature. By <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> the first was abolished, and by <hi>Sanctification</hi> the other is healed by degrees.</p>
            <p>For the second, we may here learne many things:</p>
            <p>The first is carefully to studie our owne sanctification, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell vpon our selues a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant endeauour of sound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. To this end I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:21382:211"/>
two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Certaine <hi>motiues</hi> which we should haue continually in our minds, to stirre vs vp to the care of holines, and to get true grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Certaine rules, which may exceedingly further vs about our <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The motiues are these, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The commandement of God, 1. Thes. 4.3. <hi>This is the will of God, euen your sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 2.10. <hi>For wee are his workmanship, created in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus vnto good workes, which God hath ordained that we should walke in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The conscience of our debt, which we owe heerein, Rom. 8.12. <hi>Therefore brethren we are deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not to the flesh to liue after the flesh</hi>: being redeemed by <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tit. 2.14. <hi>Who gaue himselfe for
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:21382:212"/>
vs, that he might redeeme vs from all iniquity, and purge vs to be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people to him selfe, zealous of good workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 The consideration of our owne dignity: wee are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, the temples of the holy Ghost, Kings and Priests vnto God; Gods owne peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people and inheritance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The rich promises that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to godlinesse, 1. Tim. 4.8. <hi>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godlinesse is profitable vnto all things, which hath the promise of the life present, and of that that is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The assuring hereby of our calling, and <hi>Election,</hi> 2. Pet. 1.10. <hi>Wherefore brethren, giue rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make your calling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall neuer fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The excellency of good
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:21382:212"/>
workes: they are sacrifices sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the salt of faith, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with the fier of the holy Ghost, offered by the merit of <hi>Christ,</hi> and accepted of God, 1. Pet. 2.5. <hi>And yee be made a holy Priesthood, to offer vp spirituall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices acceptable to God by Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The silencing of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from speaking euill, 1. Pet. 2.15. <hi>For so is the will of God, that by well doing yee may put to silence the ignorance of the foolish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Because else,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The name of God will bee blasphemed, Rom. 2.24. <hi>For the name of God is blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the Gentiles, through you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Sam. 12.14. <hi>Howbeit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by this deed thou hast cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child that is borne
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:21382:213"/>
vnto thee shall surely die, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The spirit of God will be grieued, and the workes of the spirit deaded, Ephes. 4.30. <hi>And grieue not the holy spirit of God, by whom ye are sealed vnto the day of redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The iudgement of God will be prouoked, Psalm. 89.31.32.</p>
            <p>The rules we had need to bee put in minde of, that concerne <hi>Sanctification,</hi> either shew vs what to take heed of, or what to doe.</p>
            <p>That wee be not deceiued in this great worke of true grace, we must take heed,</p>
            <p>First, of wretchlesnesse and security, whereby a man liues so, as he is insensible and carelesse of reformation altogether. Awake thou that sleepest, Ephes. 5.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, of the daily baits, and methods of <hi>sinne:</hi> be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:21382:213"/>
with the pleasures of <hi>sinne,</hi> which are but for a season; but circumcise betimes the sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins of your hearts, Ier. 4.4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, of procrastination, and delaying of time in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of reformation. For thy life is vncertaine, Matth. 25.13. and euery day addes to the heap of sinne, and of wrath, Rom. 2.5. Sinne not against thy purposes of amendment, lest thou grow more hardened.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, of hypocrisie, and fained holinesse, Esa. 58.2. Iam. 4.8.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, of the perswasion of the merit of your owne works, Rom. 10.3. <hi>For they being ignorant of the righteousnesse of God, and going about to stablish their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, haue not submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the righteousnesse of God &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:21382:214"/>Sixthly, of temporary righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, Hosh. 6.4. <hi>Ephraim, what shall I doe vnto thee? O Iuda, how shall I intreat thee? for your goodnes is as a morning cloud, and as a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dew it goeth away.</hi> Or being weary of well doing, Gal. 6.9. <hi>Let vs not therefore be weary of well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for in due season we shall reape, if we faint not, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seuenthly, of the precepts of men, Mat. 15.9. <hi>In vaine they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship me, teaching for doctrine mens precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ezech. 20.18. <hi>But I said vnto their children in the wildernes, walk ye not in the ordinances of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neither obserue their manners, nor defile your selues with their idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, of looking after the example, and fashion of the world, Rom. 12.2. <hi>Frame not your selues like vnto this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, neglect of prayer for
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:21382:214"/>
the particular furtherance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and grace, Lam. 5.21. shall he not giue vs his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if we aske him, as our Sauiour sheweth in the <hi>parable</hi>?</p>
            <p>Tenthly, let the best of vs take heed of a strange deceit, and that is to rest in faire words, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue hearing. How is it, that men, that heare many precious counsels, comforts, &amp; reproofes, goe away without any refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and thinke they doe well, if they commend the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? &amp;c. Oh, how common is this disease to be awake to heare of the disease, or medicine, and fall a sleepe before it be applied? like those hearers in the Gospell, of whom it is said, <hi>They heard, they maruelled, and they went their waies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much of what we should auoide, that the worke of <hi>sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:21382:215"/>
be not hindred.</p>
            <p>On the other side there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things to be obserued by vs, as</p>
            <p>First, wee must looke to the matter to bee done, which hath two considerations in it:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in generall whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer things are <hi>true, honest, iust, pure, louely, and of good report,</hi> that haue <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> in them, that we should thinke on those things, and study how to glorifie God, and enrich our selues by well doing them, Phil. 4.8. Eph. 58. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we striue to keep our selues free from, or speedily mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie such euils as vsually staine the profession of religion after calling. Besides the mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grosse euils, which the first repentance puts away; wee must watch carefully against other
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:21382:215"/>
sinnes, such as are lying, rotten communication, deceit, anger, wrath, and all bitternesse, and cursed speaking, Col. 3.8. Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians 4.25.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee must looke to the end of all our actions, the end I say both of intention, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wee must propound the glory of God, as the maine ende of all our actions, 1. Cor. 10.31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eate or drinke, or whatsoeuer yee doe, doe all to the glory of God.</hi> Philip. 1.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee must so begin refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and good workes, as we be sure also to endeuour with all constancy to hold out to the end, Luke 1.75. <hi>All the daies of our life in holinesse and righteousnes before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 106.3. <hi>Blessed are they that keepe iudgement, and do righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:21382:216"/>
at all times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, we must looke to the manner of our reformation, that it be done with all sinceritie, and so we doe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If wee turne from all sorts of our transgressions, Ezech. 18. 30.31. <hi>Therefore I will iudge you, O House of Israel, euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his waies; returne therefore, and cause other to turne away from all your transgressions, so iniquitie shall not be your destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cast away from you all your trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, whereby ye haue transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and make you a new heart, and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O House of Israel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If wee labour for a sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that is throughout in all parts, in soule, in body, and in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is, in our outward man, and in our affections, and in our iudgements, and thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:21382:216"/>Fourthly, we must bee excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mindfull of the meanes of <hi>sanctification,</hi> and so we must espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thinke of</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Word, to subiect our selues to the power of it: for if <hi>we heare our soules shall liue,</hi> we are <hi>sanctified by the truth,</hi> and God wil haue <hi>his Law magnified,</hi> and <hi>the Word is able to build vs vp still fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> till we come to heauen, Isai. 55.4. Iohn 17.19. Isaiah 42.21. Acts 20.32.</p>

The <hi>Sabbath:</hi> for that is <hi>the signe of our sanctification.</hi> It is a signe to assure, that God will not faile vs in his blessings; and it is a signe that we are indeed a holy people, if we be carefull to keepe the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> It is the market day for our soules, and by the right keeping of the Sabbath, we shall be the better able to serue God all the weeke after, Exod. 31.13.

14. <hi>Keepe ye my Sabbaths: for it is a signe betweene me and you in your generation, that ye may know, that I the Lord doe sanctifie you.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Ye shall therefore keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, for it is holy vnto you; he that defileth it shall die the death: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whosoeuer worketh therein, the same person shall be euen cut off from among his people.</hi>

            <p>Isaiah 56.2. <hi>Blessed is the man that doth this, and the sonne of man which laieth hold on it: he that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the Sabbath, and polluteth it not, and keepeth his hand from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any euill, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, these principles may terrifie all men that are vnsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that haue not true grace, that liue in their sinnes: Woe vnto worlds of men because of sinne! for thereby they may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:21382:217"/>
that there is no cure done to their natures, that they are not at all iustified before God, that they haue no part with <hi>Christ,</hi> and that all they doe is still impure, Mat. 7.18. Tit. 1.15. Yea, and that the wages of their sinnes will be death, and that in the <hi>state</hi> they are in, they cannot bee saued, Rom. 6.23. Iohn 3.5. and in the meane time, what know they how soone the whirle-wind of the <hi>Lord</hi> may fall vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? Ier. 23.19. <hi>Behold, the tempest of the Lord goeth forth in his wrath and a violent whirle-wind shall fall downe vpon the head of the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for all the things they haue done in the flesh, they must come to iudgement; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because they haue not taken warning, Acts 17.31. <hi>Because hee hath appointed a day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the which he will iudge the world in righteousnesse
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:21382:218"/>
by that man, whom he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But some one may say, what tell ye vs of these terrible things? we haue no reason to thinke of our selues, that we are vnsanctified, how can we, or you tell, who are not sanctified?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> It is easie to tell in the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue,</hi> who are not sanctified, you may know it of wicked men:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because they are a sleepe, and dead in sinne, and haue not not any true feeling of the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of their many sinnes, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes. 2.1. <hi>And you hath he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that were dead in trespasses and sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because sinne raignes in them, it hath an vnlimited power in them, Rom. 6.12. <hi>Let not sinne reigne therefore in your mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:21382:218"/>3. Because they sinne by coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they hire themselues; their purpose is with their whole harts to commit and continue in sin, they obey as seruants, Rom. 6.16. <hi>Know ye not, that to whomsoeuer yee giue your selues, as seruants to obey, his seruants ye are to whom ye obey, whether it be of sinne vnto death, or of obedience vnto righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Because they are silent from prayer, and confession of <hi>sinne,</hi> Psalm. 32.23.5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Because they haue no sauor of the things of the spirit, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together sauour fleshly things, Rom. 8.5. <hi>For they that are after the flesh, sauour the things of the flesh: but they that are after the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the things of the spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Because they neuer had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>marriage affections</hi> to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. 7.5.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Lastly, a wicked man finds
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:21382:219"/>
in himselfe not onely an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, but an impossibilitie to be subiect to the Law of God. Hee resolues, that he cannot possibly yeeld to the directions of the word, nor will not: whereas a godly mind loues the Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to obey, endeuours it, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects himselfe to it, though hee faile many waies.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, the godly may bee comforted in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of this worke of the spirit of grace, that is in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which killes sinne in them, and hath made them aliue from the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But some weake <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> might say, There is much comfort in this doctrine of the healing of their natures, saue that the imperfection of their <hi>sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is a continuall discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:21382:219"/>
               <hi>Solut.</hi> Christians may and ought to comfort themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the imperfection of their <hi>sanctification</hi> many waies, and so if they looke</p>
            <p n="1">1. Vpon the Spirit of God in their hearts, and so two things may relieue them; first the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Spirit, which will helpe their infirmities, Rom. 8. 26. And then if they consider the very fountaine of all good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and euery good gift to be the same spirit of God, they must needes conclude, it is some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine thing which is wrought in them, in as much as it flowes from the holy Ghost; howsoeuer it be imperfect through the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Vpon <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; and so if they behold,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>intercession,</hi> and that likewise hath a double com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:21382:220"/>
in it: for first <hi>Christ</hi> made intercession for vs, when hee praied for our <hi>sanctification,</hi> it should much comfort vs to remember, that our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was one of the things <hi>Christ</hi> praied for, Iohn, 17.19. Secondly, <hi>Christ</hi> in his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in heauen, couers all the imperfections of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is their <hi>aduocate</hi> before the Father, 1. Iohn, 2.2. Rom. 8.34.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His death and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, from whence flowes a vertue continually, which is of singular power, to make our sinnes still die in vs, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vs to newnes of life. Rom. 6.4. For this cause did <hi>Christ</hi> sanctifie himselfe, that hee might sanctifie his members by the influence come from him, as from their head, Iohn, 17.17.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:21382:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>3. Vpon the hope of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holinesse: for the time will come, when they shall be without spot, or wrincle, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes. 5.27. The merit of their perfect holinesse is found in the price paied by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Heb. 10.14. It should much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace them, that one day there shall be a perpetuall end of all sinne and infirmities.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If in the meane time they looke vpon the good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, assuring them by his promises,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they are vnder Grace, and not vnder the Law, Rom. 6.14.</p>

            <p>The fourth estate of man is the estate of glory; and in this we are to consider the three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it:
<list>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:21382:222"/>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the the body.</item>
                  <item>2. The last Iudgement.</item>
                  <item>3. The glory of <hi>Heauen.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>principles</hi> concerning the resurrection are these:</p>
            <p>First, that the bodies of dead men shall rise out of the dust of the earth, and their owne soules shall enter into them againe, Iob 19.23.26. <hi>For I am sure that my Redeemer liueth, and hee shall stand the last on the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And though after my skin wormes destroy this body, yet shall I see God in my flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Esa. 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men shall liue; euen with my body shall they rise: Awake and sing ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of hearbes, and the earth shall cast out the dead, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ioh. 5.28. <hi>Maruell not at this, for the houre shall come, in the which
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:21382:222"/>
all that are in the graues, shall heare his voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. 15.16. <hi>For if the dead be not raised, then is Christ not rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp;c.</hi> in the whole <hi>chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bodies of all men shall be raised, Ioh. 5.28. as before. Small and great; the earth, sea, fier, beasts, fowles, aire, &amp;c. shall deliuer vp their dead, Reuel. 20.12.13. <hi>And I saw the dead, both great and small, stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; and the bookes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and another book was opened, which is the booke of life, and the dead were iudged of those things which were written in the bookes, according to their workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the sea gaue vp her dead which were in her, and death and hell deliuered vp the dead which were in them, and they were iudged euery man according to their works.</hi> Iust and vniust shall rise, Act.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:21382:223"/>
24.15. <hi>And haue hope toward God, that the resurrection of the dead, which they themselues looke for also, shall bee both of iust, and vniust.</hi> Though the vniust shall not rise in the same manner, nor by the same power, that is, by the vertue of <hi>Christs</hi> resurrection, Dan. 12.2. <hi>And many of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to euerlasting life, and some to shame and perpetuall contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> It may bee obiected, that <hi>Daniel</hi> saith many shall rise, not all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Hee may speake so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee shall not all die; but those that are aliue at <hi>Christs</hi> comming, shall bee changed in stead of death and resurrection, 1. Thes. 4.15. <hi>For this say we vnto you by the word of the Lord, that we which liue, and are remaining in the comming of the Lord, shall not
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:21382:223"/>
preuent them which sleepe, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Cor. 15.53.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that the same bodies, which men carry about with them in this world shall rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, Iob 19.26.27. <hi>And though after my skin wormes destroy this body, yet shall I see God in my flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whom I my selfe shall see, and mine eyes shall behold, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for me, though my raines are consumed within me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 34.20. <hi>He keepeth all his bones, not one of them is broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This very corruptible must put on incorruption, 1. Cor. 15. 53. <hi>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortall must put on immortality, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reasons are, 1. because e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man shall receiue in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what hee hath done, either good or euill, 2. Cor. 5.10. <hi>For wee must all appeare before the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:21382:224"/>
iudgement seat of Christ, that euery man may receiue the things which are done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether good or euill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Because else it were absurd that any other body should bee crowned, but that which suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: or punished, but that which sinned.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that this resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall bee at the ende of the world, euen the last day of the world, Ioh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him: and I will raise him vp at the last day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore we must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betweene particular resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and the generall or <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall.</hi> Particular resurrections haue been past in some cases mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously, as at the time of <hi>Christs</hi> death: but the <hi>principle</hi>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:21382:224"/>
speakes of the vniuersall resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>The vses may be for

                  <item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, for information, and so we should striue to informe our selues in three things:
<list>
                  <item>1. The certainty of it, that it shall surely be.</item>
                  <item>2. The manner of it, since it must needs be.</item>
                  <item>3. The glory of the life in <hi>Christ,</hi> that can effect this.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, we may find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies to affect our harts with a full assurance that our dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies shall rise againe: many things tend hereunto, some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, some infallible, some shew it that it may bee, others that it shall be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:21382:225"/>That it is not impossible, other workes in nature shew: as first, the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> a bird in <hi>Arabia,</hi> of which it is written, that waxing old, with the stickes of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincense and Cassia, with which shee filled her nest, shee makes a fier, and being put in the fier, and burned to ashes, by and by after the dew of heauen lights vpon her, she comes forth aliue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we know that many lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle birds, which for the winter-time lie out of the way in deepe marshes, or such like places; yet in spring time come out aliue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Thirdly, we see that trees, and plants in winter loose all their ornaments, and being dead to see to, yet reuiue againe. Fourthly, thus doth the seed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so which the husband-man throwes into the ground, 1. Cor. 15.36. <hi>O foole, that which thou
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:21382:225"/>
sowest is not quickened except it die.</hi> Fifthly and lastly, night and day, sleepe and waking, shewes vs thus much: the day dies into the night, and yet reuiues to the world with all his glory.</p>
            <p>Yea in man himselfe there is grounds of singular probability: For,</p>
            <p>First his deliuerances, from dangers and distresses, are (as it were) lesser resurrections, and the terme is giuen to it. The houses in which the <hi>Iewes</hi> were captiues, were as so many graues; and their returne, as a rising from the dead, Ezech. 37.12. 2. Cor. 1.10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he hath had an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the first resurrection in his soule already, and how can he doubt the rising of his body? Rom. 6. Ioh. 5.25.28. Reu. 20.6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, diuers particular men
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:21382:226"/>
haue appeared raised from the dead; as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Ioh. 13.43. the Saints that appeared out of the graues after <hi>Christs</hi> death, Mat. 27.52.53.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God shewed this in a <hi>vision</hi> to <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> when he saw a field full of dry bones, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing at Gods commandement flesh, and nerues, and life, Ezech. 37.</p>
            <p>But wee haue more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities, we haue certaine <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for it, as</p>
            <p>First, the word of God assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, 1. Thes. 4.15. as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before, to whom all things are possible, Luk. 1.37. <hi>For with God shall nothing bee vnpossible,</hi> Luk. 18.27. <hi>The things which are vnpossible with men, are possible with God.</hi> Rom. 4.21.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Sonne of God vndertaking to effect it, Iohn 6.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:21382:226"/>
39. <hi>And this is the Fathers will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath giuen me, I should loose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but should raise it vp againe at the last day, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the resurrection of <hi>Christ</hi> to assure it, who rose as our surety, 1. Thes. 4.14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Sacrament of <hi>Baptizme</hi> sealeth both the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of soule and body.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and lastly, the <hi>Apostle</hi> proues at large the necessity of the resurrection, by many <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> shewing in effect, that all religion is ouerturned, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection bee not beleeued, 1. Cor. 15.12.</p>
            <p>Thus that it shall be: How it shall be, followes.</p>
            <p>The manner of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be thus:</p>
            <p>First, when the last day of the world is come, <hi>Christ</hi> on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:21382:227"/>
in the same visible forme he went to heauen, will come in the clouds with his <hi>Angels,</hi> and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of the soules of his Saints, Iude 14. 1. Thes. 4.15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the trumpet of God shall then sound, the voice of the <hi>Arch-angell</hi> shall then bee heard: <hi>Christ</hi> shall command,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What these things meane is vnknowne.</hi>
               </note> exhort, and call vpon the dead to rise and come away to iudgement, 1. Thes. 4.16.17. so as the very dead shall heare this shout and voice of <hi>Christ,</hi> Ioh. 5.29. Matth. 24.31.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, immediately the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Christ</hi> will bring the soules of all the godly, and they shall enter into their bodies; and then they that haue slept in the dust of the earth, shall bee raised to life.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the bodies of the wicked shall then bee raised also
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:21382:227"/>
by the power of God, by a way vnknowne.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, men, that shal then be aliue, shal haue a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in stead of death, and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 1. Cor. 15. 1. Thes. 4.15. 16.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, the <hi>Angels</hi> shall then gather the <hi>Elect,</hi> and chase in the reprobates from the foure winds of heauen, and present them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Christ,</hi> Matth. 24.31. Thus of the manner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this may informe vs concerning the glorious life of the Sonne of God, who doth not onely liue himselfe; but giues life to millions of men by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Ioh. 5.21. and raised dead bodies so miraculously.</p>
            <p>Thus of the vses for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>From the doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection wee should learne
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:21382:228"/>
diuers things.</p>
            <p>First, it should teach vs not to mourne immoderatly for the dead, since when <hi>Christ</hi> comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he will bring them with him; and the earth and seas shall make a true account of their dead in the day of <hi>Christ,</hi> 1. Thes. 4.13.14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it should teach vs to haue the very body in honor, and not to transgresse against it, seeing it is redeemed by <hi>Christ,</hi> and shall be raised to immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity at the last day.</p>
            <p>Now men sin against the body:</p>
            <p n="1">1. When (according to the traditions of men, and through wil-worship) they withhold from the body due sustenance, Col. 2.23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When men pollute their bodies, that should be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to immortality, with fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse;
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:21382:228"/>
such as is whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, drunkennesse, sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and such like abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 1. Cor. 6.13.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the bodies of the Saints are not carefully and with meet honour buried, or their burying places vnciuilly dis-regarded.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the consideration of this great worke of the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mens bodies, should teach vs to trust God in lesser matters, and beleeue his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, though there bee neuer so great vnlikelihood of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment, in respect of outward meanes and appearance. Rom. 4.17.18.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we should especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be careful to get the assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that our bodies shall haue a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious resurrection, Act. 24.15. And that we may be so assured:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:21382:229"/>1. Wee must pray God to giue vs his holy spirit, as the pledge of it. For then if the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Christ</hi> be in vs, the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that raised <hi>Christ,</hi> will raise vp our naturall bodies at the last day, Rom. 8.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee must bee sure of the first resurrection, that the body be dead in respect of sinne, and the soule raised vp to a liuely care of newnesse of life:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rise first in soule.</hi>
               </note> they that haue their part in the first resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, shall neuer taste of the second death, Rom. 6. Reuel. 20.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In particular, we must bee sure to get faith in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the resurrection, and the life, and in whom whosoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, he shal not die for euer, Ioh. 11.25.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, we should resolue to liue, like such as beleeue a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:21382:229"/>
               <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and to this end</p>
            <p n="1">1. We should be stedfast, and vnmoueable in all conditions of life, 1. Cor. 15.58.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee should liue, as men deuoted wholy to the seruice of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whose we are both in life and death, Rom. 14.7.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We should striue to abound in the worke of the Lord, 1. Cor. 15.58. rousing vp our selues to the care of well doing, 1. Cor. 15. 34. studying to keepe a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of offence toward God and man, Acts 24.16.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our minds should run on that time, and our conuersation should bee in heauen, Philip. 3.20.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the vses for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection hath singular comfort in it, and <hi>Christians</hi> are charged
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:21382:230"/>
to comfort themselues, and one another with these things, 1. Thes. 4.18. And <hi>Dauid</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and was glad at heart for this reason, Psalm. 16.9. For that is the time of the refreshing of all <hi>Christians,</hi> Acts 3.19. And so the godly haue been wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themselues against diuers maladies, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. Against the paines and tortures of the body; so did <hi>Iob,</hi> Iob, 19.25.26.27. <hi>For I am sure, that my Redeemer liueth, and he shal stand the last on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And though after my skin, wormes destroy this body; yet shall I see God in my flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whom I my selfe shall see, and mine eies shal behold, and none other for me, though my reines are consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med within me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so did the godly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, Heb. 11.35. <hi>The women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:21382:230"/>
their dead raised to life; other also were racked, and would not bee deliuered, that they might receiue a better resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Against the troubles and generall miseries of this life, and so Gods people are comforted, Dan. 12.1.2. <hi>And at that time shall Michael stand vp, the great Prince which standeth for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as was neuer since there began to be a nation vnto the same time; and at that time thy people shall be deliuered, euerie one that shall bee found written in the booke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And many of them that sleepe in the dust of the earth, shall awake, some to euerlasting life, and some to shame and perpetuall contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Isaiah 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men shall liue; euen with my body shall they rise: Awake, and sing ye that
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:21382:231"/>
dwell in dust; for thy dew is, as the dew of hearbs, and the earth shal cast out the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Against death it selfe, and so the Apostle triumphs, 1. Cor. 15.55.56.57. <hi>O Death where is thy sting! O graue, where is thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The sting of death is sinne: and the strength of sinne is the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thankes be vnto God, which hath giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Now if any aske, What in the doctrine of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should comfort vs in those cases?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solut.</hi> I answere: The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the maruelous glory of our bodies, in which they should rise, should fill vs with sweet refreshings, Phil. 3.21. <hi>Who shall change our vile bodie, that it may be fashioned like vnto his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:21382:231"/>
bodie, according to the working, wherby he is able to subdue al things vnto himselfe.</hi> For sixe things shal befall our bodies at that day:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Immortalitie:</hi> so as they can neuer die againe, 1. Cor. 15.42.43.44.53.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Incorruptiblenesse:</hi> they shall neuer be inclined to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, or any corruption.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Spiritualnesse:</hi> our bodies shall bee raised spirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; they shall be like spirits, as it were, and that in diuers respects:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because they shall be possessed fully by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, so as they shall be both gouerned by the Spirit, and be subiect to the Spirit wholly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because they shal liue as the <hi>Angels</hi> in heauen do, without meate or raiment,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:21382:232"/>
or any other bodily helpes or sustenance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because they shall be for nimblenesse, as it were <hi>spirits</hi>; they shall bee able with incredible swiftnesse, to passe into all the parts of the world, earth, or aire, &amp;c. for they shall meete <hi>Christ in the aire,</hi> 1. Thessal. 4.17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Power:</hi> for of bodies full of weakenesse, and subiect to many calamities and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and paines, they shall bee raised in power; that is, strong, able, and <hi>impassible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Perfection:</hi> for they shall be freed from deformitie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsomnesse, maimes, lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c. and become most faire and comely; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, nor old age hindring them, but shall appeare in full
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:21382:232"/>
age and beautie.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Shining and splendor, as the <hi>Sunne</hi> or Starres in the Firmament: the bodie being clothed with a celestiall glory and diuine light, 1. Cor. 15.40. Dan. 12.3. <hi>And they that bee wise, shall shine as the brightnesse of the Firmament; and they that turne many to righteousnesse, shal shine as the Starres for euer and euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matth. 13 43. <hi>Then shall the iust men shine as the Sun in the Kingdome of their Father: Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we may comfort our selues by the meditation of these distinct glories in our bodies then, so it may adde vnto our comfort, and the establishment of it, if we consider three things more; to wit, first, the certaintie
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:21382:233"/>
of all this, that it shall come. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the shortnesse of the time thither. Thirdly, the condition of the body till then.</p>
            <p>For the first, wee should not doubt of it, because we are borne againe to this hope, wee are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the resurrection now, and so called, Luke 20.36. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, <hi>Christ</hi> hath a charge to loose nothing; no, not of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints, Ioh. 6.39. <hi>And this is the Fathers will, which hath sent me, that of all which he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee, I should loose nothing, but should raise it vp againe at the last day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he came to this end, to dissolue the workes of the diuell, which is sinne, and death by sin, 1. Iohn. 3.8. <hi>Christ</hi> also is the first fruit of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, 1. Cor. 15.20. And further we haue felt of the power of <hi>Christ</hi> in raising our soules al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie:
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:21382:233"/>
he that by his word made all things, can by the same voice bring backe our bodies againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> That the bodies resolued to dust and ashes, should rise, is against co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sense and reason.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solut.</hi> It is aboue reason, but not against it. Can men of ashes make glasse, and cannot God of dust make againe the body?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But the bodies dead are often mingled with the bodies of beasts or other creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The Goldsmith by his art can seuer mettals, and extract one mettall out of another, and cannot God distinguish these dusts, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Flesh and blood cannot come into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. 1. Cor. 15.50.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> By flesh and blood is not meant the body simply, but as it is clothed with sin and infirmity,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:21382:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which shall be done away in the resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> The condition of man and beast is one, Eccles. 3.19. <hi>For the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beasts are euen as one condition vnto them: As the one dieth, so dieth the other: for they haue all one breath, and there is no excellencie of man aboue the beast; for all is vanitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> First, they are like in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not in the estate after death. Secondly, it may be said, those words are the <hi>obiection</hi> of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi> not the opinion of <hi>Salomon.</hi>

               </gap> second, it may adde to our comfort, that the <hi>Lord</hi> is at hand, Phil. 4.5. and that it is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle season thither to, Reuel. 6.11.</p>

               <hi>A fierie streame issued, and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministred vnto him, and ten thousand thousands stood before him: the Iudgement was set, and the bookes opened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that <hi>Christ</hi> shall be the <hi>Iudge,</hi> and that in the humane nature, Act. 10.42. <hi>And hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to preach vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to testifie that it is he, that is ordained of God a Iudge of quicke and dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Acts 17.13. <hi>Because he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day, in the which hee will iudge the world in righteousnesse by that man, whom he hath appointed,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:21382:236"/>
whereof he hath giuen an assurance to al men, in that he raised him from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Tim. 4.1. <hi>I charge thee therfore before God, and before the Lord Iesus Christ, which shall iudge the quicke and dead at his appearing, and in his Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iohn 5.22. <hi>For the Father iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man, but hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> shall iudge the twelue Tribes, Matth. 19.28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The <hi>Apostles</hi> iudge the twelue Tribes by their faith and doctrine, the example whereof shall take away all excuse from the <hi>Israelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They shall be as <hi>Iustices</hi> of Peace on the Bench, and consent to <hi>Christs iudgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> The Saints shall iudge the world, 1. Cor. 6.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> As assessors with <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:21382:237"/>
bearing witnesse to it, approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, and assenting to it, as the <hi>Apostles</hi> before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As they are members of <hi>Christ the Iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As their example shall bee alleaged to condemne the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But the Father and holy Ghost iudge too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The Father doth iudge by the Sonne, as by his representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Wisdome, Iohn 5.22. <hi>For the Father iudgeth no man, but hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dan. 7.13.14. <hi>As I beheld in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions by night, behold, one like the Sonne of Man came in the clouds of heauen, and approched vnto the Ancient of daies, and they brought him before him;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>And he gaue him dominion, and honour, and a Kingdome, that

all people, nations, &amp;c.</hi> Or thus: the authority of iudging is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the three persons, but the execution onely proper to the Sonne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, all men shall be iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that day: <hi>iust</hi> and vniust; quicke and dead; small &amp; great, Iude 15. <hi>To giue iudgement against all men, and to rebuke all the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 14.9. <hi>For Christ therefore died, and rose againe, and reuiued, that he might bee Lord both of the dead, and the quicke, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 5.10. <hi>For we must all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the iudgement seate of Iesus Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ro. 14.10. <hi>We shall all appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t seat of Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 9.8. <hi>For hee shall iudge the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> All men are beleeuers, or vnbeleeuers; now the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:21382:238"/>
shall not come vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as appeares, Ioh. 5.24. <hi>Verily verily I say vnto you, he that heareth my word, and beleeueth in him that sent me, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but hath passed from death vnto life.</hi> And the vnbeleeuer is condemned already, Ioh. 3.18. <hi>He that beleeueth not is condemned already.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solution.</hi> The beleeuer shall not come into the iudgement of condemnation, and the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is condemned already in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and substance: 1. In the <hi>counsell</hi> of God: 2. In the word of God: 3. In his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but yet the manifestation and finishing of this iudgement remaines vnto the last day.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, all the secret things of mens natures, or workes shall be brought to light, Luk. 8.17.
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:21382:238"/>
               <hi>For nothing is secret, that shall not be euident: neither any thing hid, that shall not be knowne, and come to light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. 4.5. <hi>Therefore iudge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time, vntill the Lord come, who will lighten things that are hid in darknesse, and make the counsels of the heart manifest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 2.16. <hi>At that day God shall iudge the secrets of men by Iesus Christ.</hi> And therefore called a day of reuelation or declaration, Rom. 2.5.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it shall bee at the last day, but the precise day and houre is not knowne to any men or Angels; the proofe for the like <hi>principle</hi> concerning the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, serues for this place, Mat. 24.36.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, the iudgement shall be most iust and righteous, and all shall confesse it, Rom. 14.10.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:21382:239"/>
               <hi>But why dost thou iudge thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? or why dost thou despise thy brother? for we shall all appeare bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgement seat of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Tim. 4.8. <hi>For henceforth is laid vp for me the crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, which the Lord the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudge shall giue me at that day: and not to me onely, but vnto all them also which loue his appearing, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 2.5. <hi>But thou, after thine hardnesse, &amp; hart that canot repent, heapest vnto thy selfe wrath against the day of wrath, and of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the iust iudgement of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 9.8. <hi>For he shall iudge the world with righteousnesse, and shall iudge the people with equitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seuenthly, the iudgement shall bee according to mens workes, 2. Cor. 5.10. <hi>Euery man shall receiue the things which are done in his body, according to that he
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:21382:239"/>
hath done, whether it be good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 2.6. <hi>Who will reward eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man according to his workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Wee are iustified by faith alone without workes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solution.</hi> 1. Workes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after in the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the signes of faith, and vnbeleefe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 2. We are iustified by faith onely, but shall bee iudged by faith and workes both together. For that, iudgement doth not serue to make men iust, that are vniust, but only to manifest them to be so indeed, which were so in this life being truly iustified.</p>
            <p>The consideration whereof should serue for diuers vses, and first for instruction, and so it should teach vs,</p>
            <p>First in <hi>generall,</hi> speedily to repent vs of our sinnes, and it
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:21382:240"/>
should stirre vs to all possible care of holy life, and to the loue of all well doing, by which our reckoning might then bee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, Act. 17.31.</p>
            <p>2. Pet. 3.11. <hi>Seeing therfore that all these things must bee dissolued, what manner persons ought ye to be in holy conuersation and godlinesse?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>Wherfore beloued, seeing you look for such things, be diligent, that yee may bee found of him in peace, without spot and blamelesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Philip. 1.10. <hi>That ye may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne things that differ one from another, that yee may bee pure and without offence, vntill the day of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tit. 2.12.13. <hi>And teacheth vs that wee should denie vngodlinesse and worldly lusts and that we should liue s<gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>berly, and <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighteously, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this present world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Looking for the blessed hope and
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:21382:240"/>
appearing of the glory of the mighty God, and of our Sauiour Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in particular it should teach vs,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not to doate vpon earthly things, seeing they must all bee consumed in that day in the fier.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To bee patient vnder all wrongs, seeing wee are assured there shal be vengeance rendred at that day, 2. Thes. 1.5.6.7. Iam. 5.6.7. Phil. 4.5.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to take heed of rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in iudging other men: and men offend in censuring;</p>
            <p n="1">1. When they inflict censures, and meddle ouer busily, or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with them that bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, 1. Cor. 5.12. <hi>For what haue I to do, to iudge them which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When men speake euill of that which is good, and call
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:21382:241"/>
good euill, Esa. 5.20. <hi>Woe vnto them that speake good of euill, and euill of good; which put darknes for light, and light for darknes; that put bitter for sweet, &amp; sweet for sowre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men iudge of things doubtfull, as the hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things of the heart, &amp; the secret things of darknes, 1. Cor. 4.5. <hi>Therefore iudge nothing before the time, vntill the Lord come, who wil lighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things that are hid in darknes, and make the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sels of the hart manifest.</hi> And censure things in the worst sense.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When men vncharitably censure others about things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, Rom. 14.3.4. <hi>Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not, iudge him that eateth, for God hath receiued him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Who art thou that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest another mans seruant? he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or falleth to his owne master:
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:21382:241"/>
yea he shall be established; for God is able to make him stand, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Let vs not therefore iudge one another any more, but vse your iudgement rather in this, that no man put an occasion to fall, or a stumbling blocke before his brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. When men commit, what they condemne, Rom. 2.1.2. <hi>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoeuer thou art that iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est? for in that thou iudgest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou condemnest thy selfe; for thou that iudgest, dost the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But we know, that the iudgement of God is according to truth, against them which commit such things.</hi> Or being guilty of greater faults, condemne others for lesser, Mat. 7.1.2.3. <hi>Iudge not, that ye bee not iudged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, and perceiuest
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:21382:242"/>
not the beame, that is in thine owne eye, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. When men make a fault worse then it is.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it should strike a feare into our hearts concerning God, and his dreadfull <hi>Maiesty,</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi>; and make vs afraid to offend him, and seeke by all meanes to glorifie him, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer become of vs and the world, Reuel. 14.7. <hi>Saying with a loud voice; feare God, and giue glory to him; for the houre of his iudgement is come; and worship him that made heauen and earth, and the sea, and the fountaine of waters, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, wee should bee sober, in not enquiring into things not reuealed, and looke to the maine businesse: as for the precise time, or place of the <hi>iudgement,</hi> or from whence the fier shall come that shall burne all, or what kind
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:21382:242"/>
kind of throne it shal be, or what the signe of the Sonne of man shall be, or such like; we beleeue that they shall be, but ought not to enquire when, where, or how they shall be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, chiefly this doctrine of the last iudgement should compell in all of vs a care so to liue, that we may be sure to haue comfort in that day: and that we shall be sure to finde;</p>
            <p n="1">1. If wee beleeue in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Ioh. 5.24. <hi>Verily verily I say vnto you, hee that heareth my word, and beleeueth in him that sent me, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but hath passed from death vnto life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If we be sure to iudge our selues here, God will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs with the world, 1. Cor. 11.31. <hi>For if wee would iudge our
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:21382:243"/>
selues, we should not be iudged, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If continually we consult with the word of God, to see that our deeds bee wrought in God, Ioh. 3.19.20.21. <hi>Hee that doth truth, commeth to the light, that his deeds might be made manifest, that they are wrought according to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If we watch and pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, they that pray much on earth, shall stand before <hi>Christ</hi> with comfort at that day, Luke 21.36. <hi>Watch therefore and pray continually, that ye may be counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to passe, and that ye may stand before the Sonne of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If wee be mercifull and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and bountifull to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their distresses, Matth. 25. 31 &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If wee be sheepe; sheepe I say: 1. For <hi>tractablenesse,</hi> so as we know, heare, and be ruled by
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:21382:243"/>
the voice of <hi>Christ.</hi> 2. For <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciablenesse:</hi> a sheepe will not bee alone, nor sort with swine. 3. For <hi>profitablenesse</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we be not idle, nor vnfruitfull, Mat. 25. Ioh. 10.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If wee can get the seale of the spirit, as our earnest of our finall redemption at that day; the witnesse of the spirit in this life will make all sure against that day, Ephes. 1.14. <hi>The spirit of promise is the earnest of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, vntill the redemption of the possession purchased vnto the praise of his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 8.15. <hi>For ye haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the spirit of bondage to feare againe, but ye haue receiued the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. If wee hold fast what wee haue, and loose not what wee haue wrought, Reuel. 3.11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I come shortly; hold that which
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:21382:244"/>
thou hast, that no man take thy crowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Ioh. 8. <hi>Looke to your selues, that wee loose not the things which wee haue done, but that we may receiue a full reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. If wee often receiue the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper with due preparation: for therin</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ</hi> doth familiarly conuerse with vs, and is giuen to our nourishment to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The outward elements are vnfained pledges of the remission of all our sinnes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We therein remember the death of <hi>Christ</hi> for vs, and how hee was iudged for our sakes, and thereby haue our hearts setled against the feare of any seuerity from him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the right preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Sacrament, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:21382:244"/>
for the last iudgement too; one worke serues to both purposes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Sacraments</hi> are Gods broad seales, to assure vs that we shall speed wel at that day.</p>
            <p>Thus of the vses for instruction.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this doctrine of the last iudgement hath singular <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> in it to all impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which may be considered either more generally, or more particularly.</p>
            <p>First, in generall, it is terrible for them to heare, and know, that God hath set them a day, and hath giuen them finall warning to repent; or else vndoubtedly he will iudge them with all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity, Act. 17.31. <hi>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will iudge the world in righteousnesse, by that man whom hee hath appointed, whereof he hath giuen an assurance
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:21382:245"/>
vnto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iude 15. <hi>To giue iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all men, and to rebuke all the vngodlily among them of all their wicked deeds, which they haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly committed, and of all their cruell speaking, which wicked sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners haue spoken against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 2.5. <hi>But thou after thine hardnesse, and heart that cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, heapest vnto thy selfe wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the iust iudgement of God.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the doctrine of the last iudgement should be exceeding comfortable to al the godly, and that in many respects:</p>
            <p>First, if they shall consider who shall be their Iudge, euen he that is their brother, husband, aduocate, head, and redeemer: hee that was iudged for their sakes; and therefore they neede to feare no hard sentence from him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if they consider the present assurance of hope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="479" facs="tcp:21382:256"/>For first, hath not <hi>Christ</hi> giuen them many promises, that it shal goe well with them at that day?</p>

            <p n="3">3. Haue they not receiued the earnest of the spirit, and the seale of the Sacraments? 2. Cor. 1.21.22. 2. Cor. 5.5.</p>

            <p n="5">5. They haue been iudged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, the afflictions of this life will be accounted sufficient vnto them, 1. Pet. 4.17.</p>

               <hi>Christ,</hi> Philip. 1.5.6. 1. Cor. 1.8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if they consider the benefits they shall attaine vnto at that day: for <hi>Christ</hi> will bee made maruellous in all them that beleeue, 2. Thes. 1.10. They shall haue honour, and praise; their innocency shall be cleared, and their miseries and sinnes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And when <hi>Christ</hi> shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, then shall we also appeare with him in glory, Colos. 3.4.</p>

            <p>There are foure <hi>principles</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the glory of heauen.</p>
            <p>The first concernes the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it: It is vnspeakable, and in respect of vs heere on earth,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:21382:258"/>
               <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> 1. Cor. 2.9. as in the beginning.</p>
            <p>1. Ioh. 3.2. <hi>Dearly beloued, now are we the sonnes of God, but yet it doth not appeare what we shall bee, and we know, that when we shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, we shall be like him; for wee shall see him as he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Colos. 3.3.4. <hi>For yee are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When Christ which is our life shall appeare, then shall wee also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with him in glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 12.4. <hi>How that hee was taken vp into Paradise, and heard words which cannot bee spoken, which are not possible for man to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 2.17. <hi>Let him that hath an eare heare, what the spirit saith vnto the Churches: to him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercommeth will I giue to eate of the manna that is hid, and will giue
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:21382:259"/>
him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth sauing he that receiueth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psal. 16.11. <hi>Thou wilt shew me the path of life, in thy presence is the fulnesse of ioy, and at thy right hand there are pleasures for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 31.19. <hi>How great is thy goodnesse, which thou hast laid vp for them that feare thee, and done to them that trust in thee, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the sonnes of men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second concernes the continuance of it, and so it is eternall; and therefore is this life called eternall life, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, Matthew 25. vers. 46. <hi>And these shall goe into euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paine, and the righteous into life eternall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Timoth. 1.10. <hi>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, who
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:21382:259"/>
hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality vnto light, through the Gospell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 1.4. <hi>To an inheritance immortall, and vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserued in heauen for you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 5.1. <hi>For wee know, that if our earthly house of this taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle be destroyed, we haue a building giuen of God, that is, an house not made with hands, but eternall in the heauens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third concernes the cause of it: Heauen is the gift of God, and proceeds onely from his free grace, and not for any merit in vs, Luk. 12.32. <hi>Feare not little flocke, for it is your Fathers pleasure to giue you a kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Titus 3.4. <hi>But when the bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and loue of God our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our toward man appeared; not for our righteousnesse, but according
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:21382:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to his mercy he saued vs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ioh. 3.16. <hi>For God so loued the world, that he hath giuen his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth in him should not perish, but haue euerlasting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 6.23. <hi>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, through Iesus Christ our Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Pet. 1. all the <hi>chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth concernes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that shall enioy it: the <hi>elect</hi> of God onely obtaine this glory, 1. Cor. 15.50. &amp;c. <hi>This say I bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that flesh and blood cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdome of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 21.27. <hi>And there shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it none vncleane thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatsoeuer worketh abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or lies, but they which are written in the Lambes booke of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:21382:260"/>1. Cor. 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the vnrighteous shall not inherit the kingdome of God? be not deceiued: Neither fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor buggeres, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 2.7. <hi>That is to them which by continuance in well doing, seeke glory, and honour, and immortality, eternall life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>But to euery man that doth good, shall be glory, and honour, and peace, to the Iew first, and also to the Grecian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The vses follow, and are either for <hi>instruction,</hi> or for <hi>consolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, for instruction: and then the doctrine of the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen should worke diuers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions vpon our hearts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We should with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse importune God, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vs to behold by the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alnesse of contemplation, the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:21382:261"/>
greatnesse of that felicity, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for vs in heauen: wee are naturally extreamly vnable for the contemplation of it, wee should beseech God by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to force open our eyes, and make vs able to stand and gaze with admiration at the glory to come, Ephes. 1.18.19. Rom. 5.2.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our hearts should be fiered with an ardency of desire, and endeauour to praise the glorious and free grace of God, which hath without our deserts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vs vnto such glory; wee can neuer walke worthy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, till wee be fitted to a daily and affectionate praise of Gods loue to vs therin: All ages should stand and wonder at such rich grace and tender kindnesse of God in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Ephes. 1.6. Ephes. 2.7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:21382:261"/>Thirdly, it should raise vp in vs a wonderfull estimation of the godly, who are therfore the onely excellent Ones, because as <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of God they are borne heires to so great a Kingdome: No meanesse of their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition should abate of our reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them, that are so rich in faith, and heires of such glorie, &amp;c. Psalm. 6.3. Iames 2.5.</p>
            <p>And seeing we must liue with them for euer, we should choose them, as the most happie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of our liues here, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, as <hi>Christ</hi> receiued vs to glorie, Rom. 15.7. 1. Ioh. 4.7.17, &amp;c. And liue in all peace with them, Ephes. 4.23. And for this reason husbands should make much of their godly wiues, as heires with them of the same grace of God, 1. Peter 3.8. And Masters should vse with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:21382:262"/>
their religious seruants, knowing that of the <hi>Lord,</hi> their verie seruants shall receiue the reward of inheritance, Colos. 3.23.24.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it should exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raise the price of godlines, and make vs with all heartie affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deuote our selues to weldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, seeing there is such an vnua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable gaine ariseth vnto such, as with patience and painefulnesse continew in doing good: wee should be abundant in the worke of the <hi>Lord</hi>; if for no reason, yet because of the great reward in heauen, 1. Cor. 15.58. Rom. 2.7.10.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it should make vs to take off our affections from the World, with disdaine and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at our selues for being so foolish, as to settle our hearts on things below. And since neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:21382:262"/>
enioynes vs to vse the world, this religious hope should make vs vse it, as if wee vsed it not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing all sobrietie and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and contempt of those transitory things, and setting our hearts there, where those match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse treasures are. What profit is it to win all this World, if our soules bee shut out of Heauen? and what losse can it be, if wee loose this World, and find our right vnto the World to come? This doctrine should make vs feelingly know, and professe our selues to bee strangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims here; &amp; to desire to be no other, then such, as long to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from hence, that we may bee present with the <hi>Lord</hi> in this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
            <p>1. Cor. 7.31. Col. 3.1.2. 1. Pet. 1.13. Matth. 6.19.20. Matth 16.25.26. Heb. 11.13. 2. Cor. 5.6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="492" facs="tcp:21382:263"/>Sixthly, we should be especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally carefull to be all that, that is required vnto eternall life.</p>
            <p>And so in generall we must be sure, wee bee borne againe, else <hi>Christ</hi> is peremptory, wee cannot enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen, Ioh. 3.5. Heauen is an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and therefore we must first be sonnes. That glory must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into our hearts by the beames of it, so as we be changed from glorie to glorie, 2. Corint. 3.18. Wee must enter into the first degree of eternall life, and that is in this life, we must beare the image of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in particular, we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly looke to these things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. We must be carefull to be prouided of the meanes to teach vs the way to heauen; we must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the meat, that endureth to eternall life, Iohn 6.27. As
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:21382:263"/>
knowing, that the preaching of the Gospell is the power of God to saluation, Rom. 1.16. Rom. 10.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We must seriously studie the mysteries of this Kingdome, and keep our selues close to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable things, which may edifie vs, Matth. 13.11. Titus 3.8.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We must purge our selues as he is pure, we must seriously, and soundly imploy our selues in the duties of mortification of our corruptions, 1. Iohn 3.3. <hi>And euerie man tha<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hath this hope in him, purgeth himselfe, as he is pure, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We must be sure, that the tempter deceiue vs not in our faith: for that is our euidence for those things, which are not seene, and that makes them (as it were) present, Heb. 11.1. <hi>Now faith is the ground of things which are hoped
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:21382:264"/>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Thes. 3.5. <hi>Euen for this cause, when I could no longer forbeare, I sent him that I might know of your faith; lest the tempter had tempted you in any sort, and that our labour had been in vaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Pet. 1.7. <hi>That the triall of your faith, being much more precious then gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fier, might be found vnto your praise, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 13.5. <hi>Proue your selues, whether you are in the faith: exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your selues, know yee not your owne selues, how that Iesus Christ is in you, except you be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For by faith <hi>Christ</hi> liues in vs, Gal. 2.20.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We must be sure, wee bee not ashamed of <hi>Christ</hi> in this

World, and that we doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him here on earth, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, Matth. 10.32. <hi>Whosoeuer therefore shall confesse mee before men, him will I confesse also before my Father, which is in heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 33. <hi>But whosoeuer shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny me before men, him will I also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie before my Father, which is in heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Wee must get the earnest of this inheritance, which is the spirit of promise: for that will stablish vs, Ephes. 1.14. 2. Cor. 1.22.23.</p>
            <p>For when God giues glorie in heauen, then the spirit of glorie rests vpon men in this life, 1. Pet. 4.14.</p>
            <p>And the spirit is our earnest, either by anointing vs with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace, (for they assure vs as infallibly of this kingdom, as the oile poured on the Kings, did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:21382:265"/>
them of their Kingdome) or by refreshing, and satisfying our hearts, in hearing the promises, or receiuing the Sacraments, or answering our prayers:</p>
            <p>But in all this we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber these things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To do this worke first: first, seeke the Kingdom of God, Mat. 6.33. deferre not the time to the last gaspe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To doe it <hi>constantly:</hi> Let him that is righteous be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous still, Reuel. 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Praying in the holy Ghost, and keeping our selues in the loue of God, Iude, 20.21.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To doe it violently: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen shoul suffer violence, Matth. 11.12.</p>

Christ,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Ephes. 2.8.9.</p>
            <p>For heauen is an inheritance, and therefore comes by fauour, not by purchase; and besides, we are adopted children too, and not naturall.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hauing finished al things, to stand fast, and hope perfectly for the grace of God to bee brought vnto vs at the reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> 1. Pet. 1.13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, these <hi>principles</hi> may serue for singular consolation, and so</p>
            <p n="1">1. Against the instabilitie of this present life, while wee looke vpon our abiding Citie in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Thus the <hi>Patriarches</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted themselues, Heb. 11.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Against the griefe for the death of our friends, why doe we sorrow for them, that are so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Against the many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:21382:266"/>
of this life, the feare and care of which should bee swallowed with the hope of eternall life, as these places shew, Rom. 8.18. <hi>For I count, that the afflictions of this present time, are not worthie of the glorie which shall be shewed vnto vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Cor. 4.17.18. <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, causeth vnto vs a farre most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and an eternall waight of glory, while wee looke not on the things which are seene, but on the things which are not seene: for the things which are seene are temporall; but the things which are not seene, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Against the feare of death: for these <hi>principles</hi> teach vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that the dead are blessed, Reuelat. 14.13. <hi>Then I heard a voice from heauen saying vnto me; Write, Blessed are the dead, which hereafter die in the Lord: euen so
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:21382:266" rendition="simple:additions"/>
saith the Spirit: for they rest from their labours, and their workes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</hi> And that this death will be quickly swallowed vp of victorious life, 1. Cor. 15.16.17. <hi>The sting of death is sinne, and the strength of sinne is the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thanks be to God, which hath giuen vs victorie through our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These comforts will bee the more abundant, if wee consider, either, first, the <hi>particulars</hi> of this glory; secondly, or the <hi>properties</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>For the first, our glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen may be thus shadowed out;</p>
            <p>It consists of perfection of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and happinesse.</p>
            <p>Our holinesse shall then bee perfect, we shall be without spot or wrinkle, Ephes. 5.27. Gods people shall then bee all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Isaiah 60.21. <hi>Thy people also
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:21382:267"/>
shall be all righteous.</hi> And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection shall be both of <hi>Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In nature we shall be perfectly holy, which may bee considered in respect of the holinesse.</p>
            <p>First, of our soules; secondly, of our bodies; thirdly, of our soule and bodie together.</p>
            <p>First, in our soules there shall bee</p>
            <p n="1">1. Exquisite knowledge; wee shal then know as we are known, when that which is in part is done away: we shall no more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand as children, but shall haue our minds enlightned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the knowledge of <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> in this world: for God himselfe shall be our euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting light, 1. Cor. 13.10.11.12. <hi>But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be abolished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:21382:267"/>
               <hi>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I vnderstood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man, I put away childishnes, or childish things</hi>:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For now we see through a glasse darkely, but then shall we see face to face; now I know in part, but then shall I know, euen as I am knowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Isaiah 60.19. <hi>Thou shalt haue no more Sunne to shine by day, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall the brightnes of the Moone shine vnto thee: for the Lord shall be thine euerlasting light, and thy God thy glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Freedome of will, when all the impediments of desire and endeuours shall bee taken off, which now as fetters hinder vs in communion with God, and as cords, hale vs after vanitie: where it shall bee also as easie to doe good, as to desire it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Vnspeakeable charitie; our
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:21382:268"/>
hearts being fild with al those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that are now any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the word of God, either toward God or man, 1. Cor. 13.8 <hi>Loue doth neuer fall away, though that prophesying be abolished, or the tongues cease, or knowledge vanish away.</hi> What is now the life of our liues more, then to loue and to be beloued? This earthly loue is but a sparke in comparison.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in our bodies, there shall be a perfect conformitie of all the members for the seruice of God and the soule, they shall bee no more weapons of vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, as they haue been, Rom. 6.13. Rom. 6.19.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in both body and soule, there shall be,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The perfect <hi>Vision</hi> of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable beauties of God, which of it selfe is more worth then the possession of the whole world,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:21382:268"/>
and this <hi>Vision</hi> of God shall not onely be mentall by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which 2. Cor. 12.2. but also <hi>corporal</hi>; for so <hi>Iob</hi> auoucheth Cap. 19.25. <hi>For I am sure my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liueth, and he shall stand the last on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 26. <hi>And though after my skin wormes destroy this bodie: yet shall I see God in my flesh,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 27. <hi>Whom I my selfe shall see, and my eies behold, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for mee, though my reines are consumed within me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall then see him perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the creatures, and haue him perfectly in our selues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Trinitie in the glorie of it after a way now vnutterable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The perfection of the <hi>image of God</hi> in both: we shall then be, as hee is, partaking perfectly of the diuine nature, 1. Iohn 3.2. 2. Pet. 1.4. which is signified by
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:21382:269"/>
those pure white garments, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, Reuel. 3.4.5. &amp; 6.11. &amp; 7.13. &amp; 19.8.</p>
            <p>Thus shall we be perfect in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The perfection of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or obedience shall then bee obtained, wee shall then serue God, &amp; loue our brethren with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all defect. We shall praise God with the <hi>Angels</hi> to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for that shall be the maine outward seruice of God: for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer shal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cease, Reuel. 4.10.11.</p>
            <p>Thus of the perfection of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>The perfection of happines shal haue in it diuers things.</p>
            <p>The first part of our felicity is <hi>acknowledgement</hi> in the kingdom of heauen; which is a worke of <hi>Christ,</hi> declaring vs in particular to bee elected of God, and his children, and friends. And this
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:21382:269"/>
is more comfortable, because we shall thus bee proclaimed the heires apparant of heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and all his holy <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> Matth. 10.32. <hi>Whosoeuer therefore shall confesse mee before men, him will I confesse also before my father which is in heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Glorious liberty</hi> reserued for the sonnes of God vnto that day, of which, Rom. 8.21.</p>
            <p>And this liberty may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered two waies, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. From what we shall bee free.</item>
                  <item>2. To what we shall bee free.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, we shall then be free:</p>
            <p>First, from the torments and miseries of the damned in hell, wee shall haue an eternall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from that most fearfull place, which is promised vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in this life, Rom. 8.1.
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:21382:270"/>
               <hi>Now then there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, which walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 20.14. <hi>And death and Hell were cast into the lake of fier: this is the second death, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, from the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God; he will neuer be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with vs any more, there shall be no more curse, or <hi>Anathema,</hi> Reuel. 22.3. <hi>And there shall bee no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lambe shall be in it, and his seruants shall serue him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, from <hi>sinne,</hi> and the power to sinne: our holinesse shal be better then <hi>Adams</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi>; he might sinne, but wee shall be confirmed, as the <hi>Angels</hi> of heauen: so as we shall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee free from <hi>sinne,</hi> but from the possibility to sinne, Ephes. 5.26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:21382:270"/>Fourthly, from all aduerfary power; we shall neuer more bee molested by diuels, nor by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, either spirituall, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. There shall be a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all triumph without warre; all our enemies shall bee cast into the lake of fier, Reuel. 21.8. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. 20.14. Reuel. 22.3. As wee shall not loose a friend; so wee shall not feare an enemy.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, from all infirmitie in our natures; as from ignorance, and all disabilities, from sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, discouragement, hardnesse of heart, feare, and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Reuel. 21.4. <hi>And God shall wipe away all teares from their eyes, and there shall bee no more death, neither sorrow, neither crying, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall there bee any more paine; for the first things are passed.</hi> And so also from all such graces, as suppose either imperfection
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:21382:271"/>
in vs: such as <hi>faith, hope,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> or misery in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without vs, as <hi>griefe, anger, feare, hatred,</hi> and the like, 1. Cor. 13.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, from all inferiority, and subiection, and seruitude, none shall bee vnder the iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others: all <hi>Oeconomicall, Politicall,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall then cease. Wee shall sit downe with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in the kingdome of heauen, Matth. 8.11.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, from all labour and affliction of life. Their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours shall cease, and afflictions shall bee cast into the sea, they shall enioy an eternall <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the true <hi>Canaan,</hi> Reuel. 14.13. <hi>Then I heard a voice from heauen, saying vnto me; Write, blessed are the dead, which hereafter die in the Lord, euen so saith the spirit, for
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:21382:271"/>
they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 4.9. <hi>There remaineth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a rest to the people of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thes. 1.7. <hi>And to you which are troubled, rest with vs, when the Lord Iesus shall shew himselfe from heauen with his mighty Angels, &amp;c.</hi> And by labors, I vnderstand also all the paines or difficulties we are at, euen about the seruice of God: for God shall bee all in all.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, from all shame and blushing: There shall be nothing but honour and praise to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: whereas in this world the inward shame of some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence imputed, or committed, make life it selfe many times a burthen, and there is little ease to the minde, but in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the day of <hi>Christ,</hi> when it shall be remoued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:21382:272"/>Ninthly, from all enuie: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie is said to be bitter, 1. Cor. 3.3. But when charity shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then shall that property of not enuying bee made perfect too, 1. Cor. 13.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, from all interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both in holinesse and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which in this life is grieuous, and ariseth many times from good things, and good persons as well as euill.</p>
            <p>Eleuenthly, from all the means of a naturall life, and from the inconueniences too: there shall be no need of meat, drinke, sleep, marriage, raiment, <hi>physicke,</hi> nor the light of the <hi>Sunne:</hi> For there shall be no hunger, thirst, heate, cold, darknesse, or the like grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances, but wee shall liue as the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>heauen,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And so in a word we shall bee free from the first things, Reuel.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:21382:272"/>
2.4.</p>
            <p>Thus much of what wee shall be free from.</p>
            <p>Now followes, what wee shall be free to.</p>
            <p>First, we shall bee free of <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> the <hi>most holy place,</hi> Heb. 10.19. <hi>Seeing therefore brethren, that by the blood of Iesus we may be bold to enter into the holy place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paradise:</hi> Luk. 23.43. <hi>Then Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus said vnto him, verily I say vnto thee, to day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our fathers house</hi>: Iohn 14.2. <hi>In my Fathers house are many dwelling places: if it were not so, I would haue told you, I goe to prepare a place for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The new Ierusalem:</hi> Reuel. 21.2. <hi>And I saw the holy City, new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, come downe from God out of heauen, prepared as a Bride trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for her husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:21382:273"/>
               <hi>The heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heauens,</hi> which for lightnes, largenes, purenes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulnes, and all praises of a place almost infinitely excels all this visible world. Nor shall the godly be restrained only to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but they shall be free of the <hi>new earth,</hi> wherein dwels righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, 2. Pet. 3.13. <hi>But wee looke for a new heauen, and a new earth, according to his promise, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we shall be free to the enioying of the happy socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the glorious Saints and <hi>Angels</hi> of heauen, Hebr. 12.22.23. <hi>But ye are come vnto the mount Sion, and to the City of the liuing God, the celestiall Ierusalem, and to the company of innumerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to the congregation of the first borne, which are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:21382:273"/>
and to God the iudge of all, and to the spirits of iust and perfect men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, to the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and the Lambe; we shall alwaies dwell in the Kings presence, Reuel. 21.3. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of heauen, saying, behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himselfe shall be their God with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 21.23. <hi>And the City hath no need of the sunne, neither of the moone to shine in it: for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God did light it, and the Lamb is the light of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 22.3.4. <hi>And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of God, and of the Lambe shall be in it, and his seruants shall serue him.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>And they shall see his face, and his name shall be in their fore-heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:21382:274"/>Fourthly, to all the treasures of heauen; which are vnexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, shadowed out by some comparisons; as by being free to eate of the tree of life, Reuel. 22.2. <hi>In the middest of the streete of it, and of either side of the riuer was the tree of life, which bare twelue manner of fruits, and gaue fruit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery moneth, &amp; the leaues of the tree serued to heale the nations with, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As also by being free to drink of the water of life freely, Reuel. 21.6. <hi>And hee said vnto me, It is done, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, and I will giue to him that is athirst of the well of the waters of life freely:</hi> euen out of a riuer, that is pure as <hi>Chrystall,</hi> Reuel. 22.1. <hi>And hee shewed me a pure riuer of water of life, cleare as Chrystall, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lambe:</hi> And such like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="515" facs="tcp:21382:274"/>Thus of <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third part of our felicity in heauen is maiesty: al the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall be there seated as <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in thrones of <hi>Maiesty,</hi> and prince-like splendor, being crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with crowns of glory; which glory shall be so great, that the Kings of the earth are supposed to bring all their glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to it, and yet all too little to shadow out this exceeding glory of all the Saints, Reuel. 3.21. <hi>To him that ouercommeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, euen as I ouercome, and sit with my father in his throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Tim. 4.8. <hi>For henceforth is laid vp for me the crowne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, which the Lord the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudge shall giue me at that day: and not to mee onely, but vnto all them also that loue his appearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reuel. 21.24. <hi>And the people
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:21382:275"/>
which are saued, shall walke in the light of it, and the Kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour vnto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which as it imports a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of splendor in euery Saint, so it doth not dissolue the degrees or orders of glory, euery man shall bee aduanced in his owne lot, Dan. 12.13. <hi>But goe thou thy way, till the end be; for thou shalt rest and stand vp in thy lot at the end of the dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. 15.40. <hi>There are also heauenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heauenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Patriarches, Prophets, Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, Martyrs,</hi> shall not want their eminency in heauen.</p>
            <p>The fourth is dominion, and rule ouer all creatures; that which we lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> shall be perfectly restored in heauen, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:21382:275"/>
the last iudgement, Reuel. 2.26. <hi>For hee that ouercommeth and keepeth my words vnto the end, to him will I giue power ouer nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth is possession of all the pleasures, which are at Gods right hand, vnutterable ioyes, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of pleasures. This is that, which in a sparing language is called the time of refreshing, Act. 3.19. <hi>Amend your liues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and turne, that your sinnes may be put away, when the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalm. 16.11. <hi>Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is the fulnesse of ioy; and at thy right hand there are pleasures for euermore.</hi> For if the ioy of the godly in this life be called, 1. Pet. 1.17. <hi>A ioy vnspeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if the Lord giue them drink
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:21382:276"/>
out of the riuer of thy pleasures in this world,</hi> as Psal. 36.8.9. How much more shall it exceed all language in heauen! called the masters ioy.</p>
            <p>The felicities which I haue here mentioned, are for the most part common both to soule and body.</p>
            <p>Now there is a peculiar felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in heauen belonging to the bodies of men, which consists in that maruellous transfiguration of them to a condition, in respect of qualities, farre aboue what they are, or can be in this world. Our bodies in generall shall be made like the glorious body of <hi>Christ,</hi> though on earth they are but vile, Philip. 3.21. <hi>Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like vnto his glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according to the working, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee is able euen to subdue all
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:21382:276"/>
things vnto himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They shall enioy eternall health, but of the glory of the body I haue entreated before, in the vse of the doctrine of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus of the parts of this glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Adiuncts</hi> of it follow.</p>
            <p>And so there bee foure things in the consideration of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to come, should much affect vs.</p>
            <p>First, that it is a <hi>glory vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> that is, it is so great, that no language on earth can describe it. For though we mention those foresaid parts of it, yet our nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hearts and mouthes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely straitned, in comparison of the full glory of man in these things, 1 Cor. 2.9. <hi>But as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, The things which eye hath not seene, neither eare hath heard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came into mans heart, are,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:21382:277"/>
which God hath prepared for them, that loue him, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that it is <hi>certaine,</hi> and we cannot be disappointed of it: else it were vncomfortable to heare of so much felicitie and holinesse, and yet not bee sure to possesse it. The certaintie of it, that God will bestow such glory, may appeare diuers waies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is an act or ordinance for it in Gods eternall <hi>Counsell,</hi> 2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>But the foundation of God remaineth sure, and hath this seale; The Lord knoweth who are his, and, Let euery one that calleth on the name of Christ depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ephes. 1.4. <hi>As he hath chosen vs in him, before the foundation of the world, that wee should bee holy, and without blame before him in loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rom. 8.30. <hi>Moreouer, whom he predestinate, them also he called;
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:21382:277"/>
and whom he called, them also he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified; and whom hee iustified, them he also glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matth. 25.34. <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit ye the Kingdome prepared for you, from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ</hi> purchased it with his blood, Ephes. 1.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Christ</hi> hath made interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, when he was on earth vnto his Father, that hee might haue his redeemed Ones to be where he is, Iohn, 17.11. <hi>And now am I no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee, holy Father, keepe them in thy name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they which thou hast giuen mee, bee with me, euen where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me: for thou louedst me before the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. God hath made vs many
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:21382:278"/>
promises, and giuen vs not onely his word, but his oth to assure it vnto vs, Heb. 6.17. <hi>So God willing more abundantly to shew vnto the heires of promise, the stablenesse of his Counsell, bound himselfe by an oath,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 18. <hi>That by two immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, wherein it is impossible that God should lie, we might haue strong consolation, which haue our refuge to hold fast the hope that is set before vs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. He hath sealed to it, not only in the Sacrament, but by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which will bee our witnesse, and is our earnest, Ephes. 1.13. <hi>Wherein also after that yee beleeued, you were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 14. <hi>Which is the earnest of our inheritance, vntill the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the possession purchased vnto the praise of his glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="523" facs="tcp:21382:278"/>6. He hath begun eternall life in vs already.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Christ is gone into heauen of purpose to prouide a place ready for vs, Ioh. 14.3. <hi>And though I goe to prepare a place for you: I will come againe, and receiue you vnto my selfe, that where I am, there may ye be also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heb. 10.19. <hi>Seeing therefore bretheren, that by the blood of Iesus we may be bold to enter into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vers. 20. <hi>By the new and liuing way, which he hath prepared for vs through the vale, which is his flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus of the certaintie of it.</p>
            <p>The third thing is the eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it, all this glory were the lesse, if it were thought, it would euer end: but it shall neuer end: for</p>
            <p n="1">1. Nothing of it shall be lost, or decay.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:21382:279"/>2. There shall bee no death there: for death and hell are cast into the lake of fier.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There shall be no old age, or withering condition in men that possesse it: it withers not, 1. Pet. 1.4. <hi>To an inheritance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and vndefiled, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, reserued in heauen for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. God being all in all, there shal be no wearinesse, no fulnesse of affections, or satietie, no loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>Diuines are wont to shadow out eternity, by the <hi>similitude</hi> of a little bird drinking vp a drop of water out of the sea; if euery ten thousand yeeres the bird should come &amp; drink vp but one drop, yet the sea might bee dry at length: but yet this lasting of the sea, is nothing in comparison to the lasting of the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="525" facs="tcp:21382:279"/>Fourthly, and vnto these may bee added the proximity of it: the day of the <hi>Lord</hi> is at hand. It were some lessening of our happines, if it were a long time to it.</p>
