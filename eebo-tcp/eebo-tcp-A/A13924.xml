            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The causes of pestilence. cap .ii.</head>
               <p>THe causes of pestylence are diuyded in
thre. For at somtymes they procede fro
beneth, and somtyme fro aboue, &amp; other
while from both. Pestilence may be caused &amp;
come from beneth, whan there is nyghe vnto
our chambre some priuey, or stynkynge sinke,
by the whiche the ayer may be corrupte and
infectyd: &amp; this pestilence is called a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
pestilence: the which maye chaunce &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
dayly. And of this procedethe a pestilent
feuer, by the which many a phisition is decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyd,
not knowynge the sayde feuer to be pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiferous.
And sumtymes such pestilence chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cethe
by the corruption of deed carreyne, the
whiche dothe fortune oftentymes in corrupte
places. This pestile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce cometh very often fro
aboue, and that through the vertue and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the celestiall bodies, by the whiche
the lyuely spirite of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is corruptyd. Of this
speaketh Auicenna in his fourth boke saying,
<pb facs="tcp:3831:4"/>
By the ayre and influence of the celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
aboue, the bodies benethe ar oftentymes
and very sone corrupted and infectyd. For
the celestiall impression doth corrupt the aire,
and by suche corruption the lyuely spirite of
man is corrupted aswell by the inferior rote
as by the superior: that is to saye, that the
pestilence is caused as welle by the inferiour
bodyes, as by the superiour impression, whan
the ayre is through deed careyn so corrupted
that it infecteth man, and ingendrethe siknes,
as feuers and impostumes. For why, the ayre
is then open, whose attraction is often vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
and corrupte, the whiche is ryght gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
for the harte, and nature is there with
diuers maners of wayes feblysshed and sore
greued.</p>
               <p>¶Apon these thynges before declared, two
questions may be asked. Fyrst why that some
do die and peryshe of the foresayde sycknesse,
and some not: and beynge in the sayde same
citie or howse, why one dothe dye, and a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dyeth not?</p>
               <p>Vnto this fyrst question I aunswere and say,
that hit maye so fortune and chaunce by two
diuers reasones. And fyrste bycause that the
action and operation of the bodis aboue, haue
more respecte to one place then to a nother.</p>
               <p>The second reason and cause commeth of the
<pb facs="tcp:3831:4"/>
patient. For seinge it is so, that euery man is
not of lyke complection, one may be disposed
to that infirmitie and sicknes, wherevnto an
other is nothynge inclined or dysposed. And
ye shall note, that all suche as be disposed to
the pestilences, are of a whotte complection,
and their conduites are wyde and large, their
poores open, and replenisshed with dyuers
humours.</p>
               <p>¶Item all suche bodyes as be moche resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyd,
as these that do often tymes companye
with women, and these that vse moche bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge,
and these whiche by great labour and
vehement angre are chased and hotte: al such
are moche more disposed to haue the pesty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
than any other.</p>
               <p>¶The seconde question is, whether such pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilente
sicknes be contagious or no.</p>
               <p>¶To this question I aunswere and say, that
suche pestylente sicknes is contagious. For
from suche infected bodies commethe infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and venemous fumes and vapours, the
whiche do infecte and corrupte the aire. And
therfore it is very necessarie to auoyde and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe
all suche as be infected with any suche
infirmite: and also in tyme of pestilence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde
greate multitude and congregation of
people. For in a greatte multytude maye be
some one infectyd, the which may infecte ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:3831:5"/>
other. And therfore the wyse and experte
phisitions, whan they vyset any suche infecte
persones, stand farre from them, turnynge &amp;
holdyng their facys toward the dore, or some
other wyndowe: and so shulde their seruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
do, and also they that kepe them.</p>
               <p>¶Ye shall also note, that yt is very good &amp;
profitable to recouer helthe, al sumtymes to
change chambers, and to open the north and
este wyndowes of the sickema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s chambre, and
to kepe the southe wyndowes therof close &amp;
shytte. For the southe wynde hathe two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of infection and putrifaction.</p>
               <p>¶The fyrst is, that it feblyssheth as well the
hole and sounde bodies, as the sycke.</p>
               <p>¶Secondely it is written in the thirde boke
of the Aphorismie, that it inflatethe and can
sethe a man to swell, and noyeth the hering,
and doth hurte the harte. For it dothe open
the pipes and conduites of man, and persethe
vnto the harte. And therfore it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniente
and mete for a hole man, in tyme of
pestilence, and whan the southe wynde dothe
blowe, to kepe hym selfe within: or elles (if
a man muste nedes go forth) that he departe
not from his house, tyll the sonne be hotte,
and of a good heyghte.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3831:5"/>FOr asmoche as we haue sene the causes
of the pestilence, it is nowe conuenient to
declare certayn remedies to withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de it.
Wherfore ye shall note after the mynde of the
supernatural phisition, spekyng by the mouth
of Iheremie, that if a man wyll be surely cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and haue a sure medecine, he muste leaue
his synnes, and confesse hym selfe with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and greate repentaunce. For in tyme of
sykenes confession and penaunce shulde be pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferred
aboue al other medecines. But to kepe
and conserue the bodye, the moste soueraynste
thynge is to auoyde and fle suche places and
persones as be infected. But yet for as moch
as there be many that can not conuenientely,
nor with their ease or profyte chaunge their
habitation, I wolde counseyll them as moche
as shalbe possible, to eschewe and fle al suche
thynges as maye ingendre or cause putrifac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to absteyne from moche bodely fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation
and companye of women.</p>
               <p>¶Also in suche daungerous season and tyme
of sicknes, we shulde auoyde the southe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
for naturally they cause moche infection
and daungerous putrifaction. And therfore
we haue tolde you before, that the south win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
of your house shuld be shut, til it were
prime, and that they shuld be ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> northward.
¶Also we haue sayde, that all maner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb facs="tcp:3831:6"/>
and stynch shuld be anoyded and fled,
as the infection of stables, pryueys, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other the infection of deed carein, and
of longe standynge waters, the infection of
olde sinkes, that cause such corruptions, that
the inhabitours of suche houses do die, theyr
neyghbours continuyng in helth &amp; prosperite.
¶In lyke wyse we shulde flee those places,
where that putrified ware is solde: for suche
putrified thynges do ingender infection and
sauers moch contrary vnto helthe. For as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatike
swete odours and sauours do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte

that they doo not perce and entre in to oure

And therfore Aui. saith in his .iiii. canon,

¶Also ye muste se and take hede, that your
house be ouer sprincled with vineger of losis,
&amp; that in somer it be strewde with vine leues.
¶Item it is very good for a man to washe
his handes in water &amp; vinegre, and than to
smell to his handes.</p>
               <p>¶Also it is helthsome to smel to suche thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

¶Also it shal be very good ons in the day to

or elles good ale, and kepe hym selfe frome
slepe that daye that his basilyke is cut.</p>
               <p>And if a manne fele hym selfe to be greuyd
with any impostume, he muste auoyde slepe,
And seke for good merye companye, or elles
walke: for by slepe the interyour and inward
heate drawethe the poyson so vnto the harte
and the other pryncypalle members of the
bodye, that hardly a man shall eyther by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,
or any other medycine restore the bodye
to his fyrste condytyon and estate agayne,
the whiche thynge shoulde not chaunce, yf
he wolde eschewe slepe. And therfore slepe
muste be differred for a whyle by walkynge
in to some plesaunte feldes or gardeynes.</p>
               <p>After suche walkynge a manne maye slepe
the space of a good houre. And to this
purpose Auicen saythe, that whanne we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to slepe, we shulde before drynke some
<pb facs="tcp:3831:9"/>
good wyne, or elles some other good drynkes
for by slepe a man gethereth yl humours, the
whiche good drynke do expell.</p>
               <p>¶Here it maye be inquired, howe one shulde
know, when he is smitten with the pestilence,
where to I aunsere and say, that who so euer
be infected, that daye he shall eate very lyttel
meate: for he is fulle of ylle humours, and
a none after he hathe eaten, he shall desyre to
slepe, and vnder a spyce of colde, he shall fele
a vehemente heate, in the fore parte of his
hedde. The whiche thynge maye be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
and holpen by meane mouinge of him
selfe, or walkynge. For the pondorosite of
the body, wyll not suffre hym to walke, or to
ryde moche at that tyme: for he shall couette
to slepe at euery howre. For the poyson that
is in his body dothe so trouble the lyuely spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shall require nothing els but slepe.
¶And by these foresayd signes a manne shal
welle perceyue whan he is infectyd with the
sycknes. And he that wyll not beleue it, may
tarye the space of halfe a day, and knowe it to
be so by experience. For he shall fele the sores
vnder his armes, or about his eres, his neck.
and shulders, or elles aboue his reynes.</p>
               <p>Therfore the moste souereynste remedy is in
tyme of pestilence, to fle and refrayne slepe.</p>
               <p>For whan the spirites of man be at reste, the
<pb facs="tcp:3831:9"/>
venym and poyson dothe extende and sprede
it selfe throughout all the bodye: of the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thynge I haue had experience and prouyd
it by my selfe. And therfore whan any man
doth fele hym selfe smytten and infectid with
the pestilence, he shulde be let bloud in greate
quantite. For the euacuation of a lyttell blud
dothe onely moue and styrre the venym. And
who so wyll not let hym selfe bludde by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
veynes, muste be let bloudde by one, and
that abundauntly. But whether he that is let
bloudde be sycke or hole, he muste nedes (for
the reasones afore rehersyd) eschewe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde slepe.
And if he haue a sore, he muste
be let bloudde vpon he selfe same side that he
hath his sore, and not vpon the contrary side,
for suche causes as here after shall folowe.
And therfore it the sore be vpon the ryghte
arme, he muste be let blud vpon the veyne in
the myddes of the selfe same arme: and lyke
wyse it muste be done, if it be vppon the lefte
arme. And if the postume be benethe towarde
the priuey membres, he muste be lette bludde
on the lefte syde, towarde his great too: But
if the sore be in the necke, he muste be let blud
in the hande vpon the selfe same syde, nyghe
vnto the thumme, and nyghe vnto the lyttell
fynger. But if the sore do appere nyghe vnto
the eares of Cephalica, then he muste be lette
<pb facs="tcp:3831:10"/>
blud vpon that syde where he dothe fele his
grefe in the vaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is betwyxt the thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me and
the next fynger, whiche is called Basilica. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
sore do appere vpon the shulders, he muste be
let blud with ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tosities, &amp; first in the veyn cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
mediane. If it appere on the backe, he must
be let blud in the veine called perdica magna.
And let al these thynges be done, yf the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
slepte not before he knewe of the sore, for
yf he fele hit after that he hathe slepte, then
he must be let bloudde cleane contrary: that is
to saye, yf the sore do appere vpon the ryghte
arme, he muste be let bloudde vppon the lefte
arme, in the veyne of the lyuer, or in the veyn
named Basilica mediana. And yf hyt appere
vppon the lefte arme, ye muste do as ye dyd
when it appered vpon the ryghte arme, and
so consequently where so euer it doth appere.</p>
               <p>¶If the patient after suche diminution of
bloudde be weyke and seble, then he maye
slepe and take his rest at after none: for vntill
it be none he must nedes be in continuall and
moderate motion. And if the sore do increce,
yet a man shulde not feare it, for the soore is
the cause of helthe. And to rype and to breake
the sore, make this medicyne that here after
folowethe.</p>
               <p>¶Bruse the leaues of Ellerne with a lytle
mustarde, and make a plaster therof, to laye
<pb facs="tcp:3831:10"/>
vpon the sore. Some Surgiens wyll put tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle
vnto it, the whiche thynge in no maner
of wyse I wolde ye shulde do: for the nature
of triacle, is to repell poyson, and therfore it
were better that the paciente shulde drinke it
to auoyde out the poyson.</p>
               <p>¶Another medicine to ripe a pestilence sore.
Take an herbe called herbaiouis, pellytory,
plantayne, and a lyttellrye, and stampe them
together, vntyll there come water from it:
after that wete it in womans mylke, &amp; drinke
thereof fastinge, &amp; before ye go to your reste:
for so it shall haue the better operation.</p>
               <p>¶Also he that hath a soore, may take hasell
