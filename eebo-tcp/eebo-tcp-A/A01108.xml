         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>They eate all their meate Raw, as fleſh, fiſh, fowle, or but lightly perboyled, with water and bloud they will eate Ice as we doe Suger.</p>
               <p>For neceſſity, they will eate graſſe like bruit beaſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out table or ſtoole, and when their hands are imbrued in blood they licke them cleane with their tongues.</p>
               <p>They yoke their Dogs for uſe, as wee doe Oxen, and when they grow old they fatten them to eate, and if they dye they doe the like.</p>
               <p>They apparell themſelves in skins of Beaſts &amp; Fowle, ſowed together with the ſinewes thereof, to defend them from cold.</p>
               <p>They make their apparell with hoods and tailes, which tailes they beſtow as favours to ratifie any friendſhip ſhowen them, the mens garments are not ſo long as the womens.</p>

it unto them, but to help themſelves to ſome reliefe; the boat went to fiſh from Friday morning untill Sunday noone, and brought but 80 ſmall fiſh for 18 hungry bellies; whereupon he waighed and came away from his wintering place into the Sea, where his bread being gone, that ſtore of cheeſe which he had muſt ſtop the gap, being but five; the Company grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,<note place="margin">Cheeſe ſhifted.</note> for they made account of nine; but thoſe five were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided by the Maſter, ſome counſelling him to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for there were ſome, who having it, would make haſte to be rid thereof, becauſe they could not gouerne it; I know (ſaith the writer) when <hi>Henry Greene</hi> gave halfe his bread which he had for 14 dayes, to one to keepe, and prayed him not to let him have any untill the next Munday, but before Wedneſday at night, he never left untill he had it againe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving eaten up his firſt weeks bread before; ſo <hi>Wilſon</hi> the boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaine, had eat in one day his 14 dayes bread, and hath laid in bed, 2 or 3 dayes for his labour.

               <p>Now when they had rowed a good way from the ſhore <hi>Pierce</hi> fainted, and could rowe no more: then was <hi>Motter</hi> dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſtand in the Boats head and wave to the Ship, which at firſt ſawe them not; and when they did, they could not tell what to make of them, but in they ſtood for them, and ſo tooke them up. <hi>Greene</hi> was throwne into the Sea, the reſt was taken into the Ship, the Salvage being yet alive, but without ſence.

               <p>The poore number that was left was to ply the Ship to and againe in the mouth of the Straits, for there was no ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and beſides, they were to goe in the Boat to kill Fowle to bring them home, which they did with great danger; for if the winde blew, there was an high Sea: and the Eddie of the tide would carry the Ship ſo neere the Rocks, as it feared the Maſter, for ſo now they call By lot.</p>

               <p>He ſaith that after they were cleare of thoſe Ilands which lie out with two points, one on the South Eaſt, and the other on the North, making a Bay to the ſight, as if there were no way through, hee continued his courſe Eaſt South Eaſt, and South Eaſt, thinking to raiſe deſolations, from thence to ſhape his courſe from <hi>Ireland,</hi> though <hi>Ivet</hi> perſwaded to goe for <hi>New-found-land,</hi> hoping there to have reliefe amongſt our Countrymen: but in Latitude 57. degrees, the winde came South Weſt, and ſo it was thought fit to ſeek for food where ſome grew: <hi>viz Ireland,</hi> and ſo the courſe was directed; In which time they were fain to frie their Fowles bones in Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle<note place="margin">Fowles Bones fryed for meate.</note> tallow, putting vinegar thereto which was ſtirred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and every man had one pound of Candles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for one weeke as a great dainty. And when <hi>Rob.

               <p>Then <hi>Robert Juet</hi> dyed, and the reſt deſpaired, and ſaid they were paſt <hi>Ireland;</hi> their laſt Fowle was in Stepetub, and the men cared not what end went firſt.

               <p>It was firſt proved to his face by <hi>Bennet Mathew,</hi> our Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter,<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, at our comming from Island, in the hearing of the company, hee did threaten to turne the Ship head home, from the action, which at that time was wiſely pacefied by the Maſter, in hope of amendment.</p>

So that untill his good will and pleaſure is, all that we doe cannot in this ought elſe prevaile.</p>
               <p>At noone the weather faire and cleare he had a good obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by which Captaine <hi>Gibbons</hi> was well aſſured; but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and ſome others diſcenting from him in the bearing of<note place="margin">Set of Tyde.</note> the land from them, were deceived in the ſet of the tyde, which in his going out laſt yeere, mightily carried him to the Northward, as now as much to the Southward; which then, nor till now, was not found by any of them all.</p>
               <p>He ſteered open of the Land N. N. E. with tyde 5. leagues, untill evening 4. and at 2. he had 307. fathom.</p>

               <p>This morning the wind came to the E. S.

               <p>Amongſt theſe Tents being 5. in number, all covered with Seales skins, were running 35. or 40.

               <p>This day 12. he was about 4. miles from the foreſaid point, faſt amongſt Ice; and he ſaith, he might well have called this <hi>Fairenes,</hi> or <hi>Faire Point;</hi> for from this day to the 30. the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſo faire, and almoſt altogether ſo calme, that in few places elſe where fairer weather could not be; and untill the 27. hee was ſo faſt incloſed amongſt the Ice, that one could not dip water by the Ship ſides.

               <p>Being faire and calme, the Sea almoſt as ſteady as on ſhore, with his Inſtruments for Variation, hee went to worke to take the time of the Moones comming to the Meridian, and had a Quadrant of 6. foote <hi>Semidiamiter</hi> ready to take <hi>Sols Almicanter,</hi> having taken the Variation of his Needle as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly as he could, which was 28. <hi>d.</hi> 10. <hi>m.</hi>

Now it remaineth for your Worſhip to know what hath beene performed this yeare; wherefore I intreat you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of my cuſtome, and pardon me if I take the plaine high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in relating the particulars without uſing any refined Phraſes, or eloquent ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>Therefore briefly thus, and as it were in the Fore-front I entred to ſhew the whole proceeding of the Voyage in a word, as namely, there is no Paſſage nor hope of Paſſage in the North of <hi>Davis</hi> Straight. Wee having coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted all, or neere all the Circumference thereof, and finde it to be no other then a great Bay, as the Voyage doth truely ſhow: therefore I cannot but much admire the worke of the Almighty, when I conſider how vaine the beſt and chiefeſt hopes of men are in things uncertaine; and to ſpeake of no other matter than the hopefull paſſage to the North Weſt. How many of the beſt ſort of men have ſet their whole endeavours to proove a paſſage that way? not onely in their Conference, but alſo in writing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Worke: Yea what great ſummes of money ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene ſpent about the Action, as your Worſhip hath coſtly experience of?

Iournals, if they had not beene confident of a paſſage this way; that if it had pleaſed GOD a paſſage had beene found, they might have eclipſed the worthy prayſe of the Adventurers, and true Diſcoverers. And for mine owne part I would hardly have beleeved the contrary, untill my eyes became witneſſes of that I deſired not to have found, ſtill taking occaſion of hope on very likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood till ſuch time as wee had coaſted almoſt all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of this great Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:5949:73"/>
would have made three Ships a ſaving Voyage; and that it is of that ſort of Whales, there is no feare, I being twice at <hi>Greeneland,</hi> tooke ſufficient notice to know them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, beſides a dead Whale wee found at Sea, having all her Finnes: or rather all the Roughs of her mouth; of which with ſmall labour wee got a hundred and ſixty the ſame evening wee found her: and if fowle weather the next day had not followed, no doubt wee had got all, or the moſt part of them: But the winde and Sea riſing, ſhee broke from us, and wee were forced to leave her. Neither are they onely to bee looked for in Whale Sound, but alſo in <hi>Smiths</hi> Sound, <hi>Wolſtenholmes</hi> Sound, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the killing of Sea-mors I can give no certainty, but onely this: that our Boate being but once a ſhoare in all the North part of this Bay, which was in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Alderman IONES his Sound; at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne our Men told us they ſawe many Mors along by the ſhoare on the Ice: but our Ship being under ſayle, and the winde comming faire, they preſently came on board without further ſearch; beſides the people inhabiting about 74. degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tould us by divers ſignes, that towards the North there were many of thoſe Beaſts having two long teeth; and ſhewed us divers pieces of the ſame.</p>
               <p>As for the Vnicorne, it being a great Fiſh, having a long horne borne growing forth of his forehead or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils (ſuch as Sir MARTIN FROBISHER in his ſecond Voyage found one) in divers places wee ſee of them: which if the horne be of any good value, no doubt but many of them maybe killed.</p>
               <p>As concerning what the ſhoare will yeeld, as Beares skins, Mors teeth, and ſuch like; I can ſay little, becauſe we came not on Land in any of thoſe places where hope was of finding them.</p>
               <p>But here ſome may object why wee ſought that Coaſt no better? To this I anſwere, that whileſt we were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, the weather was ſo exceeding fowle wee could not; for firſt wee anchored in <hi>Wolſtenholmes</hi> Sound, where preſently wedrove with two anchors on head, then we were forced to ſtand forth with a low ſayle; the next day in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:5949:74"/>
Whale Sound we loſt Anchor and Cable, and could fetch the place no more; then wee came to Anchor neere a ſmall Iland, being betweene Sir <hi>Thomas Smiths</hi> Sound, and Whales Sound: but the winde came more outward, that wee were forced to weigh againe. Nevertheleſſe, if we had beene in a good Harbor, having but our Ships Boat we durſt not ſend her farre from the Ship, having ſo few men as 17. in all, and ſome of them very weake: but the chiefe cauſe why wee ſpent too little time to ſeeke a Harbor, was our great deſire to performe the diſcovery; having the Sea open in all that part, and ſtill likelihood of a paſſage: but when we had coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the land ſo farre to the S. ward, that hope of a paſſage was none, then the yeere was too far ſpent, and many of our men very weake, and withall we having ſome beliefe that Ships the next yeare would be ſet forth about the killing of whales which might doe better then we.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing I have briefly ſet downe what hopes there is of making a profitable Voyage, it is not unfit your Worſhip ſhould know what let or hindrance may be to the ſame; the chiefeſt cauſe is, that ſome yeares it may happen by reaſon of Ice lying between 72. ½<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 76. ſo that the Ships cannot come into thoſe parts untill the middle of Iuly, ſo that want of time to ſtay in the Country may bee ſome let, yet they may well tarry untill the laſt of Auguſt: in which ſpace much buſineſſe may be done, and great ſtore of oyle made. Nevertheleſſe, if ſtore of Whales come in, as no feare to the contrary; what cannot be made in Oyle, may bee brought home in Blubber, and the Finnes may ariſe to good profit. Another hinderance will be, becauſe the bottome of the Sound will not be ſo ſoone cleare as would bee wiſhed; by meanes whereof, now and then a Whale may be loſt. The ſame cauſe ſometime hapneth in <hi>Greeneland.</hi> Yet I am perſwaded the Sounds before, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> never will be cleare before the 20. of Iuly. Wee this yeere were in Whales Iland the 4. day amongſt many Whales, and might have ſtrooke them without let of Ice.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there is little wood to bee expected either for fire, or other neceſſaries; therefore Coales and other ſuch things muſt be provided at home, they will bee much more the ready there.</p>
               <p>Thus much I thought good to certifie to your Worſhip,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:5949:74"/>
whom I hope will conceive, that much time hath not beene ſpent in vaine or the like buſineſſe, nor careleſly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and although wee have not performed what wee deſired (that is to have the paſſage) yet what wee have promiſed, as to bring certainty, and a true deſcription truth will make manifeſt, that I have not much erred.</p>
               <p>And I doe boldly ſay (without boaſting) that more good diſcovery hath not in ſhorter time (to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) beene done ſince the Account was attempted, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how much Ice we have paſſed, and the difficulty of Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo neere the Pole upon a travis.</p>
               <p>And above all the variation of the compaſſe whoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull opperation is ſuch in this Bay, encreaſing and decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo ſuddainely, and ſwift being in ſome part, as in <hi>Wolſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holmes</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, our <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> Proverbe is, <hi>Plaine dealing is a Iewell;</hi> So it is, that I was neither importuned nor intreated to this vndertaking by any eyther Noble or Gentle, but the Truth is, that I had beene itching after it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince 1606. when I ſhould have gone Mate to <hi>Iohn Knight,</hi> of whom doth follow, yet I muſt confeſſe that heere my ambition ſoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a pitch higher then my abilitie, as now time hath made me to know, yet his Diſcretion and Experience taught him to diſcerne of what could bee in my youth, but I preſuming vpon ſome parts I had, as the vſe of the Globes and other Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke Inſtruments, (having beene Sea bred from my Boyes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and had beene in the <hi>Mediterranian, Spaine, France, Holland, Norway, Denmarke,</hi> and the <hi>Balticke</hi> Sea,) thought my ſelfe to bee fit for the beſt imployment, deſired to be pluckt before I was ripe; but hee durſt not depend vpon me in that place for the Voyage, ſo as I did not proceed with him; yet I was ſtill kept in Marine imployments along the Coaſt and Croſsing the Sea, whereby I gained Experience, and alſo at the Returnes home of all Ships from thence, I enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Maſters Mates and others that were that way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:5949:85"/>
whereby I gathered by Report and Diſcourſe and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts, how farre they had proceeded, what they had done, and what was to doe: To better which, I often repaired to Mr. <hi>IOHN TAPPE,</hi> whoſe acquaintance was much amongst theſe men, he alſo acquainting me with Mr. <hi>THO. STERNE</hi> Globe-maker, (whom I have found to have engroſſed all thoſe former Voyages by Relation, Manuſcripts; and Maps;) from whom I gathered much, and muſt needs ſay, hee is a very well deſerving Practitioner: So that I thought my ſelfe to be now ready for the ſame attempt, when occaſion ſhould preſent it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Which fell out by former acquaintance I had with that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mathematician Mr. <hi>HENRY BRIGGES,</hi> who moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me thereto and I willingly conſented, ſo as things could be brought to paſſe, the which to ſtrengthen himſelfe, hee acquainted that Hon: Knight Sir <hi>IOHN BROOKE,</hi> whom both to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doe their King ſervice, &amp; the Publike good, perſwades with divers of their friends to come into the Adventure.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, wee exhibited a Petition to his Maieſty for the lend of a Ship for the Voyage and countenance to the Action, who Graciouſly accepted and granted both; but the time of the yeare was ſo farre ſpent before wee could make our proviſion ready, as wee were forced to deſiſt vntill the yeare following: in which proceſſe Mr. <hi>BRIGGES</hi> deceaſed, and the one halfe of the Adventure fell away.</p>
            <p>In the meane time and before the next yeare, one Captaine <hi>IAMES</hi> of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> had ſo wrought with the Marchants of the ſayd Citie for to ſet forth one Ship for the ſame deſigne, as they were willing to adventure ſo as they might ſhare with <hi>London,</hi> in equall honour and profit, whether Ship ſoever found the ſame, and this as was ſignified in a Letter from Captaine <hi>IAMES</hi> to Mr. <hi>BRIGGES,</hi> which Letter I did ſee is he ſhowed the ſame to Sir <hi>IOHN BROOKE,</hi> they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to write backe againe vnto him that the Requeſt was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:5949:85"/>
condeſcended vnto, of which and for better aſſurance, Capt. <hi>IAMES</hi> ridde from <hi>Briſtow</hi> to <hi>Oxford</hi> before the death of Mr. <hi>BRIGGES</hi> deſiring, that ſeeing we were both to goe forth in one yeare that hee might goe in the higher place, but was denyed.</p>
            <p>In this interim came home that Honourable Knight Sir <hi>THOMAS ROE</hi> from his Ambaſſage to the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who being made acquainted with the Deſigne, gave it his beſt furtherance, when his Maieſty ſending for this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages never failing friend Sir <hi>IOHN WOLSTENHOLM</hi> the elder Knight, appointing them two to expediate forward the enterprize. Commanding the Maſter and Wardens of the <hi>Trinity-Houſe</hi> to be aſſiſting hereunto; and young Sir <hi>Iohn Wolſtenholme,</hi> that now is, was appointed Treaſurer.</p>
            <p>The Ship of his Maieſties, was (of my owne chuſing, and the beſt for condition and quality, eſpecially for this voyage that the world could afford) of Burthen 80. Tonnes, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men 20. and 2. boyes, and by all our Cares was ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, Cordaged, Builded and repaired; all things being made exactly ready againſt an appointed time.</p>
            <p>My greateſt care was to have my men of Godly converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch, as their yeares of time not exceeding 35. had gained good Experience, that I might thereby be the better aſſiſted, eſpecially by ſuch as had been vpon thoſe Froſt biting voyages by which they were hardned for indurance, and could not ſo ſoone be diſmayed at the ſight of the Ice. For beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe younkers, I knew as many as could man the Boate was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and for all our dependances was vpon GOD alone, for I had neither private end, ambition, or vaine glory.</p>
            <p>And all theſe things I had contractedly done by the Maſter, Wardens and Aſſiſtants of the <hi>Trinity-Houſe.</hi> For a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant I had no vſe, but it grieved me much that I could not get one man that had bin on the ſame voyage before, by whoſe counſaile or diſcourſe I might better have ſhunned the Ice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:5949:148"/>I was Victualed compleatly for 18 Moneths, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My Carpenter was fitted from the thickeſt bolt to the pumpe-nayle or tacket.</p>
            <p>The Gunner from the Sacor to the Piſtoll.</p>
            <p>The Boatſwaine from the Cable to the Sayle-twine.</p>
            <p>The Steward and Cooke, from the Caldron to the Spoone.</p>
            <p>And for Bookes, if I wanted any. I was too blame being bountifully furniſht from the Treaſurer with money to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide me, eſpecially for thoſe of ſtudy there would be no leiſure nor was there, for I found worke enough; and if the matter it ſelfe had not been in another place when ſodaine occaſion was preſent, it had bin too late for me (like the <hi>Holland</hi> Skipper to runne to his Cheſt) to looke vpon his <hi>Waggoner</hi> booke. But thoſe things I feare, you will ſay they are needleſſe (yet give me leave to follow the faſhion) and good for nothing, but to make Courtiers and Schollers marvell at my curioſitie, and thinke ſtrange that there ſhould be ſo much adoe about making a Ship take the Sea.</p>
            <p>Things in this readineſſe, I was brought to his Maieſtie, where I received his Gracious favour with a Mappe of all my Predeceſſors Diſcoveries, his Maieſties Inſtructions, with a Letter to the Emperour of <hi>Iapon.</hi>

               <p>Yet had I had no more then would have brought home the Ship, if my men had ſtood, and if by their death, or reliefe of birds or Deere, I had ſtore remaining, yet I doubt the remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtomacks, would have beene too weake (before the long winter there had left them) to have endured ſalt meate in the Summer, ſo as the more victuall the fewer hands for labour, and there would be no ſparing as I conceived by ſhort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>All theſe and many other ſufferings endured, is but all for the next yeares Search, about which I have ſhewed, I had no reaſon to ſtay, to put ſo much to hazzard knowing what I had inquired from ſome, both of Sir <hi>Thomas Button,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> men of their ſufferings, and yet it was <hi>July,</hi> before they could get well to ſea to returne home.

               <p>Now let us compare this Tyde with ſome others neerer our owne home, with which we are the moſt familiar; as to begin at the mouth of the River <hi>Thames,</hi> towards which, two Tydes reſort.</p>
