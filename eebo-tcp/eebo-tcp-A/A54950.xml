            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' I could have wish'd that the <hi>Gentleman</hi> to whom the following Papers are directed, had prevented me in the Trouble I am now giving You; yet I cannot but lay hold on this Mournful Occasion, to acquaint the World what a <hi>Share</hi> it has in Your Lordship's Loss, and what a <hi>Concern</hi> the <hi>Muses</hi> should have shewn, who have seen it so <hi>visible</hi> in Your Lordship.</p>
            <p>A general <hi>Silence</hi> indeed shews the <hi>Consternation</hi> to be also <hi>General</hi>; our <hi>Silence</hi> among those whose very Sorrows should <hi>speak,</hi> Silence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men of a <hi>Profession</hi> who are not us'd to <hi>hold their Peace</hi> in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of <hi>Ioy</hi> or <hi>Grief,</hi> is much more a <hi>Crime</hi> than an <hi>Inadvertency</hi>; and if I am late in my Offerings to the Memory of the deceas'd Noble Lord, Your Lordship's Father, it is out of the <hi>respect</hi> I bear to it, having been in hopes some Pen or other of a more establish'd Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have acknowledg'd it self a <hi>Debtor,</hi> tho' it could never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the <hi>Debt,</hi> and have made an Attempt towards the <hi>Description</hi> of those Vertues which no <hi>Describer</hi> can do that Justice to which They deserve.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vniversity</hi> near which He liv'd, and the <hi>City</hi> in which He dy'd, had both of 'em Gentlemen, who being of Merit <hi>Themselves,</hi> were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of setting it out in <hi>Others</hi>; and if both had employ'd Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in recommending those Vertues to our <hi>Practice,</hi> which are so deserving of our <hi>Esteem,</hi> they had not laid under the Imputation of being idle, as well as ungrateful.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Remissness,</hi> My LORD, has added Wings to my <hi>Diligence</hi>; and tho' I am sensible Your Lordship's Father's Character is fall'n into ill hands, yet rather than not say <hi>something</hi> of One, who deserves to have so <hi>much</hi> said of Him, I must put in for a Petitioner to Your Lordship,
<pb facs="tcp:60539:3"/>
and beg Your Acceptance of a Present, which has nothing but the <hi>Zeal</hi> of its <hi>Donor</hi> to recommend it to Your Lordship's Hands. That the Great Man who gives <hi>Being</hi> to the following Poem, by <hi>losing</hi> His <hi>own,</hi> was <hi>Loyal</hi> to His <hi>PRINCE,</hi> and <hi>Affectionate</hi> to His <hi>COVNTRY,</hi> unwearied in His <hi>Alms,</hi> and incessant in His <hi>Prayers,</hi> deserving the Highest Honours from His <hi>KING,</hi> yet retir'd from <hi>COVRTS</hi> to commune with His <hi>GOD,</hi> are Excellencies worthy of <hi>His</hi> Muse whom the following Poem is perswading to the Recital of 'em; and there will want nothing to add to their <hi>Perfection,</hi> and <hi>crown</hi> 'em with their due Commendations, after I shall have said, He was Your Lordship's <hi>FATHER.</hi> For to give <hi>Being</hi> to a Gentleman who is exercis'd in <hi>preserving</hi> that of others, is as great as if the Noble Lord continued to <hi>preserve</hi> them <hi>Himself</hi>; and what was reckon'd as a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment</hi> in the Poet to the greatest of Emperors, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS I have no great reason to boast of the <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the following Poem, so the Reader must excuse me if I do not enter into Confessions of its <hi>Faults,</hi> and prevent a great many Gentlemen whose time will lie upon their hands, if depriv'd of the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of being <hi>employ'd</hi> in finding them out themselves. But I can justly tell them, That I have not left so much room for an Animadverter, as I did on the <hi>Epistle to Mr.</hi> Tate <hi>on the Taking of</hi> Namur; and have so far agreed with the <hi>Civil Gentleman</hi> who past his Censure on the Poems relating to that Subject, that if he continues in the same Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of being hard to be pleas'd, he has more reason to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd of it now than he had then.</p>
            <p>In short, The Management of this is agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Epistle; and I have endeavour'd to suit the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of my Subject with a Turn of Verse, which tho' it does not come up to it, is not servily creeping or affected: I have all along continued speaking to the Person it is directed to, and have been as careful of running into Excursions as possible. Several Expressions are indeed Synonimous; and tho' I might have said a great deal more of the Noble Persons whom I have had occasion to speak of, I could have wish'd I had said less, unless it was more deserving their Acceptance. And tho' I am not an Author confirm'd enough to carry my Coppies about
<pb facs="tcp:60539:4"/>
to Gentlemen's Chambers in order to pick up Amendments and Corrections, as the Practice is now of our most receiv'd Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; yet I must in Iustice to my self, and the Gentleman who has favour'd me with its Perusal, tell the World, it had been much worse had not Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> acquainted me with its Faults. Nothing indeed was so displeasing to him as what was pleasing to my self, <hi>(viz.)</hi> this own Commendations; and if it pleases the World, the Reader has no one to thank but so distinguishing a Iudgment which has occasion'd it.</p>
            <p>I might here lay hold of the Opportunity of returning the Obliging Compliments he sent me by the Person who brought the Papers to him before they were Printed; but I may chance to call <hi>His</hi> Iudgment in question by it, which I always counted infallible but in his kind Thoughts of me; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refer the Reader to the Poem in order to see whether he'll be so good-natur'd as to join his <hi>Opinion</hi> with the <hi>Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the Gentleman aforesaid has honour'd me with.</p>

            <l>The <hi>Muse</hi> attending on their Hearse should wait,</l>

            <l>And Tears unceasing, and her Sighs unfeign'd,</l>
            <l>Should tell what <hi>Earth</hi> has lost, and <hi>Heav'n</hi> has gain'd.</l>

            <l>Silent they stand, and with their <hi>Harps</hi> unstrung,</l>
            <l>Adore that <hi>Worth,</hi> which should ador'd be sung,</l>

            <l>The <hi>Laureat</hi>'s Place, without the <hi>Laureat</hi>'s Name;</l>
            <l>Whose Learned Brows, encircled by the Bays,</l>

            <head>AN ELEGY On the most celebrated Poet of the Age, John Dryden <abbr>Esq</abbr> Who Departed this Life, <hi>May</hi> the <hi>1st. 1700.</hi>
            </head>
            <l>MOnarchs of <hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Worlds,</hi> must all lay down;</l>
            <l>One Fate waits both the <hi>Laurel</hi> and the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Even <hi>DRYDEN,</hi> (what e'er Immortality</l>
            <l>The Muse may claim) the <hi>Bard,</hi> alas, must dye.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Eldest Son in Dust thus layd,</l>
            <l>What Pomp must make his Funeral Cavalcade!</l>
            <l>By the whole <hi>Muses Race</hi> that Honour'd Head,</l>
            <l>To his great Urn in solemn Sables led.</l>
            <l>WIT mourn'd by Wit! Those the chief Mourners here?</l>
            <l>No; let that sullen <hi>Tribe</hi> bring up the Rear.</l>
            <l>WIT's so ill Natur'd grown, they have not all</l>
            <l>One genuine Tear, worthy to mourn his Fall.</l>
            <l>At distance then the envying Scriblers stand,</l>
            <l>Nor let His Rites be by false Tears profan'd.</l>
            <l>Let Worth and Honour; the Ingenius <hi>Fair,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And the Learn'd <hi>Great,</hi> be the true Mourners there:</l>
            <l>They whose rich Cabinets his Works adorn;</l>
            <l>Who with his loftier Ayrs awake the Morn;</l>
            <l>Or with his softer Numbers lull their sleep;</l>
            <l>Theirs are the Eyes this <hi>Albion</hi> Loss should weep.</l>
            <l>VVhat tho' the warmth of Youth in Age retire:</l>
            <l>It chill'd no Spark of his Poetick Fire.</l>
            <l>VVit's verdant <hi>Bays,</hi> unshockt by VVinter's Blast,</l>
            <l>Like VVit's great <hi>Patron God</hi> should <hi>Youthful</hi> last.</l>
            <l>Vig'rous and warm did his last Numbers glow,</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Aetna,</hi> kept the Flame beneath the Snow.</l>
            <l>To the last Gasp thus his tun'd Raptures ran,</l>
            <l>And only finisht like the dying Swan.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:60539:12"/>What tho' his <hi>Laureat Raign</hi> once shock'd by Fate,</l>
            <l>(For <hi>Wit,</hi> like <hi>Empire,</hi> has its Turns of State)</l>
            <l>The blushing World his Muse's Throne beheld,</l>
            <l>By such poor <hi>Empty Heads</hi> supply'd, not fill'd,</l>
            <l>He kept this yet unshaken Glory still,</l>
            <l>He only lost the <hi>Feather,</hi> not the <hi>Quill.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Let <hi>Garth's</hi> and <hi>Blackmore's</hi> th'<hi>Albion</hi> World divide,</l>
            <l>Whilst warring Criticks battle on each side.</l>
            <l>Parties and Factions there in Arms appear;</l>
            <l>Uncertain Victory, all Chance of War.</l>
            <l>The popular Favour there on either side,</l>
            <l>All Ebb and Flow, the Torrent's but a Tide.</l>
            <l>Great <hi>Dryden</hi> no such giddy Scepter sway'd,</l>
            <l>All Knees his Universal Homage pay'd.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>DRYDEN</hi> so fill'd th'<hi>Apollinary</hi> Throne,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>DRYDEN Wit's Alexander</hi> raign'd <hi>Alone.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And as when that <hi>Great Head</hi> no longer shin'd,</l>
            <l>In Death his <hi>World,</hi> but not his <hi>Fame</hi> resign'd,</l>
            <l>His numerous Successors put in their Claim:</l>
            <l>So the poor <hi>Rivals</hi> to Great <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Fame,</l>
            <l>All petty Candidates their weak Pretensions raise,</l>
            <l>And only Ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on out his vast Immortal Praise.</l>

            <head>EPITAPH.</head>
            <l>Here lies in Dust, All that in Dust can lye,</l>
            <l>As much of <hi>Dryden</hi> as had pow'r to dye.</l>
            <l>Tombs we may build him. But where Ashes best</l>
            <l>Deserve a Monument, they need it least.</l>
            <l>His lasting Praise from dull Oblivion safe,</l>
            <l>Is fairer Read, than in an <hi>Epitaph.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Nor needs there Pyramid, or vaulted Dome,</l>
            <l>The Superstructure to enrich his Tomb.</l>
            <l>His Pile of Volumes does that Work alone:</l>
            <l>WIT needs no <hi>Mausoleum</hi> but its own.</l>
