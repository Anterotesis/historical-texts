            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now aboue fiue and thirty yeares passed, right worshipfull, since that young sacred, and prudent Prince, king <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt of happie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, went about the discouerie of <hi>Cathaia</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> partly of desire that the good young king had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the Christian faith, and partlie to finde out some where in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions ample vent of the cloth of England, for the mischiefs that grew about that time neerer home, aswel by contempt of our commodities, as by the arrestes of his merchantes in the Empire, Flanders, France, and Spaine: foreseeing withall how beneficiall ample vent would rise to all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees throughout his kingdome, and specially to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of the poore sort distressed by lacke of worke. And although by a voyage hereuppon taken in hande for this purpose by Sir <hi>Hugh Willobie,</hi> and <hi>Richard Chauncellour</hi> a discouerie of the bay of Saint <hi>Nicolas</hi> in Russia fell out, and a trade with the Muscouites, and after another trade for a time with the Persians by way of the Caspian sea en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, yet the discouerie of the principall intended place followed not in his time, nor yet since, vntill you tooke your happie and renowmed voyage about the worlde in hande, although sundrie attemptes, at the great charges of diuers honorable and well disposed persons, and good worshipfull merchants and others haue beene made since the death of that good king, in seeking a passage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:3380:3"/>
both by the North-east, and by the Northwest. But since it is so (as wee vnderstande) that your worshippe in your late voyage hath first of our nation in this age discouered the famous rich Ilandes of the <hi>Luzones,</hi> or <hi>Philippinas,</hi> lying neare vnto the coast of <hi>China,</hi> and haue spent some time in taking good view of the same, hauing brought home three boyes borne in <hi>Manilla,</hi> the chiefe towne of the said Ilands, besides two other young fellowes of good capacitie, borne in the mightie Iland of <hi>Iapon,</hi> (which hereafter may serue as our interpretors in our first traficke thither) and that also your selfe haue sailed along the coast of <hi>China,</hi> not farre from the Continent, and haue taken some knowledge of the present state of the same, and in your course haue found out a notable ample vent of our clothes, especially our kersies, and are in preparing againe for the former voyage, as hee that would constantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer in so good an enterprise: we are to thinke that the knowledge and first discouerie of the same, in respect of our nation, hath all this time beene by the Almightie to you onely reserued, to your immortall glorie, and to the manifest shew of his especiall fauour borne towards you, in that besides your high and rare attempt of sailing about the whole globe of the earth, in so short a time of two yeares and about two monethes, you haue shewed your selfe to haue that rare and especiall care for your countrie, by seeking out vent for our clothes, that ought vpon due consideration to moue many thousands of English sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to pray for you, and to loue and honor your name and familie for euer. For as you haue opened by your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the gate to the spoile of the great and late mightie, vniuersall, and infested enimie of this realme, &amp; of al coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that profes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And Sir, if to this your late noble attempt, it might

And to descende to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

farre greater portion then in reason would be required of any other man of his abilitie. And albeit sir, that you haue taken in your late voyage, besides the knowledge of the way to <hi>China,</hi> the intelligence of the gouernement of the countrie and of the commodities of the territories and prouinces of the same, and that at the full, according to the time of your short abode in those partes, yet neuerthelesse for that of late more ample vnderstanding hath beene in more length of time, by woonderfull great endeuour ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by certaine learned Portingals and Spaniardes of great obseruation, and not long agoe published in the Spanish tongue, I haue for the increase of the knowledge of the subiectes of Englande, and specially for the illuminating of the mindes of those, that are to take the voyage next in hande to <hi>Iapan, China,</hi> and the <hi>Philippinas,</hi> translated the same worke into english, and committed it to print, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing ouer <hi>Paulus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Venetus,</hi> and sir <hi>Iohn Mandeuill,</hi> because they wrote long agoe of those regions: which labour to say trueth, I haue vndertaken at the earnest request and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of my worshipfull friend Master <hi>Richard Hak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit</hi> late of Oxforde, a gentleman, besides his other mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde learning and languages, of singular and deepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight in all histories of discouerie and partes of Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie: who also for the zeale he beareth to the honour of his countrie and countrimen, brought the same first aboue two yeares since ouer into this court, and at this present hath in hande a most excellent and ample collection of the sundrie trauailes and nauigations of our owne nation, a matter long intended by him, and seruing to the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall and honorable purpose, which I hope will shortly come to light to the great contentation of the wiser sort. In the meane season, hauing nowe at length finished accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my poore skill and leasure this my translation, I thought best to dedicate and commende the same to your worshipfull patronage, as the man that I holde most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of the same, and most able of our nation to iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of the contentes thereof, and to correct the errors of the author whensoeuer you shall meete with them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching you to accept in good part the trauaile and good

                  <p>You shall vnderstande that this mightie kingdome is the Orientalest part of all <hi>Asia,</hi> and his next neighbour towards the <hi>Ponent</hi> is the kingdome of <hi>Quachinchina,</hi> whereas they doo obserue in whole all the customes and rites of <hi>China.</hi> The greatest part of this kingdome is watred with the great <hi>Orientall</hi> Ocean sea, beginning at the Iland <hi>Aynan,</hi> which is hard by <hi>Quachinchina,</hi> which is 19. degrées towards the North, and compassing towards the South, whereas their course is Northeast. And beyond <hi>Quachinchina</hi> towards the North, the <hi>Bragmanes</hi> do confine, which are much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and verie rich, of golde, siluer and pretious stones, but in especiall, Rubies: for there are infinit. They are proude and hawtie men, of great corage, wel made, but of browne colour: they haue had (but few times) warre with them of <hi>China,</hi> in respect for that betwixt both the kingdomes there are great and mightie mountaines and rockes that doth disturbe them. And harde vnto this nation ioyneth the <hi>Patanes</hi> and <hi>Mogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> which is a great kingdome, and warlike people, whose head is the <hi>Gran Samarzan</hi>: They are the true <hi>Scythas</hi> or <hi>Massagetas,</hi> of whom it is affirmed that they were neuer ouercome by any other nation: they are a people well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and white: by reason they dwel in a cold countrie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the West and the South is the <hi>Trapobana,</hi> or <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> a kingdome very rich of gold, pretious stones &amp; pearles: and more towards the South, are the two <hi>Iauas,</hi> the great and the lesse, and the kingdome of the <hi>Lechios</hi>: and in equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, are the <hi>Iapones</hi>: yet notwithstanding those that are more indifferent to this kingdome are the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> which are on the selfe firme land or continent, and are alonely deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a wal, as shalbe declared in the 9 chapter of this booke. These <hi>Tartarians</hi> haue had many times wars with them of <hi>China</hi>: but at one time (as you shall perceiue) they got the whole kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> and did possesse the same for the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3380:6"/>
space of 93. yeares, till such time as they of <hi>China</hi> did rebell and forced them out againe. At this day they say that they are friends one with another, and that is, for that they bee all Gentiles, and do vse all one manner of ceremonies and rites. They doo differ in their clenes &amp; lawes, in the which the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> doth excéede them very much. The <hi>Tartarians</hi> are very yealow &amp; not so white: and they go naked from the girdlested vpwards, and they eate raw flesh, and do annoint themselues with the blood of raw flesh, for to make them more harder and currish, by reason whereof they doo so stinke, that if the aire doth come from that part where they be: you shall smel them afar off by the strong sauor. They haue for certainty, the truth of the immortalitie of the soule (although it be with error) for they say that the soule doth enter into other bodies, and that soule that liued well in the first bodie, doth better it from poore to rich, or from age to youth: and if it liued euill, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie in worse. The sons of the <hi>Tartarians</hi> do very much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue and kéepe the commandement in obeying their parents, for that they doo wholly accomplish the same without failing any iot of their will, vnder paine to be seuerly and publikelie punished. They confesse one God, whom they worship, &amp; haue him in their houses carued or painted, and euery day they doe offer vnto it incense, or some other swéet smelles: they do call him the high God, &amp; do craue of him vnderstanding &amp; health. They haue also another God, which they say is son vnto the other: they do call him <hi>Natigay</hi>: this is their God of tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall things. They haue him likewise in their houses, and euery time they go to eate, they doo annoint his face with the fattest thing they haue to eate: that being doone they fall to eating, hauing first giuen their gods their pitance. They are a kinde of people that verie seldome doo fable a lie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their liues should lie thereon, and are verie obedient vnto their king: but in speciall in their warres, in the which euerie one doth that he is appointed to doo: they are led by the sound of a drome or trumpet, with the which their captaines do gouerne them with great ease, by reason that they are trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp in the same from their youth. And many other things are amongst them, in the which they do resemble them of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:3380:7"/>
(who) if they did receiue the faith of our Lord Iesu Christ, it is to be beléeued that the <hi>Tartarians</hi> would do the same, for that they are taken for men very ducible, and do imitate verie much them of <hi>China.</hi>

                  <p>Those which are borne in the citie of <hi>Canton</hi> and in al that cost are browne people, like vnto them in the citie of <hi>Fez</hi> or Barberie, for that all the whole countrie is in the said paralel that Barberie is in.

And although there is declared here of such as shall suffice in this worke, yet is there left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a great number more: of whose properties, as well of herbes and beasts, which of their particulars may be made a great volume, and I doo beléeue that in time there will be one set forth.</p>
                  <p>The great trauell and continual laboure of the inhabitants
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3380:8"/>
of this countrie, is a great helpe vnto the goodnes and fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof, and is so much that they do neither spare nor leaue mountaines nor vallies, neither riuers, but they do sow and plant all such things as they perceiue that the place wil yéeld, according vnto the goodnesse thereof: as orchards with fruite, great fields of wheat, barlie, rice, flaxe and hempe, with many other things: all which traueile vnto them is verie easie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring with what great libertie they do inioy their goods, and the great &amp; infinit number of people that there is, as well for handie craftes as for to till and cultiuate the grounde. In all this mightie countrie they doo not suffer vacabunds nor idle people, but all such (ouer and aboue that they are grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie punished) they are holden for infamous: neither doo they consent nor permit any of them that are naturally borne there, to go out of their countries into other strange countries, neither haue they any wars at this present: which was the thing that in times past did consume much of their people. The king dooth content himselfe onely with his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (as one that is helde the wisest in all the world.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all this they are naturally inclined to eate and drinke wel and to make much of themselues, in apparell, &amp; to haue their houses well furnished with houshold stuffe: and to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting hereof, they doo put themselues in great labor &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and are great dealers and trafickers: al which with the fertilitie of the countrie aboue said, is the occasion that iustlie it may haue the name to be the most fertilest in all the whole world.</p>

Their houses commonly be verie gallant, and after the manner of Rome, and generallie at the doores and gates of them are planted trées in gallant order: the which maketh a gallant shadow and séemeth well in the stréets.

and is brought into Portugall, and carried into the <hi>Peru,</hi> and <hi>Noua Espania,</hi> and into other parts of the world: which is a sufficient proofe for that which is said. And the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> do agrée to this to be true. The finest sort of this is neuer carried out of the countrie, for that it is spent in the seruice of the king, and his gouernours, &amp; is so fine and cléere, that it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be of fine and perfite cristall: that which is made in the prouince of <hi>Saxii</hi> is the best and finest.<note place="margin">All occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bee in streetes by themselues.</note> Artificers and mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call officers doo dwell in stréets appointed, whereas none doo dwell amongst them, but such as be of the same occupation or arte: in such sort that if you doo come at the beginning of the stréet, looke what craft or art they are there, it is to be vnderstood that all that streete are of that occupation.

                  <p>It is verified that when this glorious apostle did passe into the Indies, hee trauelled through this kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> where as it appeareth he did preach the holy gospel and myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie aforesaid, of the holy trinitie: whose picture in the manner aforesaid doth indure vnto this day, although those people, by the great and long blindnesse which they are in with their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and idolatrie, doo not perfectly knowe what that figure with thrée heads doth represent or signifie. The better for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that which is said, or at least to vnderstande that it is so, is that it is found in the writings of the Armenians, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them are in reputation and of great authoritie: &amp; there it saith that this glorious apostle did passe through this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>China,</hi> when he went into the Indies, where he was martyred, &amp; that he did preach there the holy gospell, although it did profite verie little, for that the people were out of order, and occupied in their warres: and therefore this Apostle did passe into the Indies, and left some of the countrie (although but a few) baptised and instructed, that when it should please God, they might haue occasion to perseuer in that which was taught them.</p>
                  <p>They haue also amongst them (as it is said) certaine pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures after the fashion and with the ensignes of the twelue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, which is a helpe to the verifying of that aforesaide: although if you doo aske of the people who they are, they doo answere that they were men, and great philosophers that did liue vertuouslie, and therfore they are made angels in heauen. They doo also vse amongst them the picture of a woman verie faire with a man childe in her armes, whereof they say shée was deliuered and yet remained a virgine, and was daughter vnto a mightie king: they doo reuerence her verie much, and do make prayer vnto her: more then this, they cannot say of this mysterie, but that she liued a holy life and neuer sinned.</p>
                  <p>Frier <hi>Gaspar de la Cruz</hi> a Portugall of the order of saint Dominicke, was in the citie of <hi>Canton,</hi> where he did write many things of this kingdome, and with great attention, whom I do follow in many things in the proces of this hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3380:18"/>
and he saith, that he being vpon a small Iland that was in the middest of a mightie riuer, there was a house in manner of a monastery of religious people of that country, and being in it, he saw certaine curious things of great antiquitie: amongst them he saw a chappel like vnto an oratorie or place of prayer, verie well made, and curiouslie dressed: it had certaine staires to mount into it, and compassed about with gilte grates, and was made fast: and looking vpon the altar, the which was couered with a cloth verie rich: hee sawe in the midedst of the same an image of a woman of a meruailous perfection, with a childe hauing his armes about hir necke, and there was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before her a lampe: he being amased at this sight, he did demande the signification: but there was none that could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare more thereof then that which is saide before.

And in their language they cal them <hi>Pausaos,</hi> which be such as we do call holy men.</p>
                  <p>They likewise doo sacrifice vnto the diuell, not as though they were ignorant that he is euill, or condemned, but that he shoulde doo them no harme, neither on their bodies nor goods. They haue manie strange gods, of so great a number, that alonely for to name them, is requisite a large hystorie, and not to be briefe as is pretended in this booke: And therefore I will make mention but of their principals, whom (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those which I haue named) they haue in great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:3380:19"/>The first of these they doo call <hi>Sichia,</hi> who came from the kingdome of <hi>Tranthlyco</hi> which is towards the west: this was the first inuenter of such religious people, as they haue in their countrie both men and women, and generally doth liue without marrying in perpetuall closenesse. And all such as doo immitate this profession do weare no haire, which number is great, as hereafter you shall vnderstand: and they greatly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue that order left vnto them.</p>
                  <p>The next is called <hi>Quanina,</hi> and was daughter vnto the king <hi>Tzonton,</hi> who had thrée daughters, two of them were married, and the third which was <hi>Quanina,</hi> hee woulde also haue married, but she would neuer consent thereunto: saying, that she had made a vow to heauen to liue chast, whereat the king her father was verie wroth, and put her into a place like vnto a monasterie, whereas she was made to carrie wood and water, and to worke and make cleane an orcharde that was there. The <hi>Chinos</hi> do tell many tales of this maide, for to be laughed at: saying, that the apes came from the mountaines for to helpe her, and how that saints did bring her water: and the birds of the aire with their bylles did make cleane her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, and that the great beastes came out of the mountaines and brought her woode. Her father perceiuing that, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that she did it by witchcraft, or by some art of the diuell, (as it might well bee) commanded to set fire on that house whereas she was: then she séeing that for her cause that house was set on fire, she would haue destroyed her selfe with a siluer pinne, which she had to trim vp her haire, but vpon a sodaine at that instant there fel a great shower of raine and did put out the fire, and shee departed from thence and hid her selfe in the mountaines, whereas she liued in great penance and led a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life. And her father in recompence of the great sinne and euill he committed against her, was turned to a lepar, and full of wormes, in such sort that there was no phisition that could cure him: by reason whereof hee was constrained to repaire vnto his daughter to séeke cure, (which being aduised of the same by reuelation of a deuine spirit) then her father being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified thereof, did craue pardon at her handes, and did repent him verie much of that which he had done, and did worshippe vnto her, the which she séeing, resisted her father therein, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3380:19"/>
put a saint before him, that he should worship it and not her, and therewith shee straight waies returned vnto the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, whereas she died in great religion. This they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest them for a great saint, and doe pray vnto her to get pardon for their sinnes of the heauen, for that they do beleeue that she is there.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, they haue another saint which they call <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and was borne in a towne called <hi>Cuchi,</hi> in the prouince of <hi>Ochiam.</hi> This they saye was daughter vnto a principall man of that Towne, and would neuer marrie, but left her owne naturall soyle and went vnto a little Iland, which is right ouer against <hi>Ingoa,</hi> whereas she liued a verie straight life, and shewed manie false miracles· The occasion why they haue her in reputation of a saint, is. There was a certaine Captaine of the king of <hi>China,</hi> whose name was <hi>Compo</hi>: he was sent vnto a kingdome not farre from thence to make warre against the king, It so chaunced that he with his nauie came to an anker at <hi>Buym,</hi> and being readie to departe, hee would haue wayed his ankers, but by no meanes he could not mooue them: being greatly amazed thereat, and looking foorth he sawe this <hi>Neoma</hi> sitting on them. Then the Captaine came vnto her and told her with great humilitie that hee was going to warres by commandement of the king. And that if so be she were holie, that she would giue him counsell what were best for him to do, to whom she answered and sayd, that if he would haue the victorie ouer them that hee went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, that he should carrie her with him. He did performe that which she said and carried her with him vnto that kingdome, whose inhabitantes were great Magicians, and threw oyle into the sea, and made it séeme that their shippes were all on fire. This <hi>Neoma</hi> did worke by the same art, and did vndoe that which the other did practise or imagine, in such sort, that their magicke did profitte them nothing, neither could they doe anie harme vnto them of <hi>China.</hi> The which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by them of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kingdome, they did yeeld themselues to be subiectes and vassales vnto the king of <hi>China.</hi> The Captaine beléeued this to be a myracle, yet notwithstanding he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure her (as one of good discretion) for that thinges might fall out to the contrarie, and the better to certifie his opinion,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3380:20"/>
whereby hee might the better giue relation thereof vnto the king,<note place="margin">A false myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</note> he said. Ladie turne me this rodde the which I haue in my hand drie, to become gréene and florishing, and if you can so do, I will worship you for a saint. Then she at that instant did not onely make it gréene, but also to haue an odoriferous smell. The which rod hee put vpon the poope of his ship for a remembrance, and for that he had a verie prosperous and good viage, he did attribute it vnto her. So that vnto this day, they haue her in reputation of a saint, and carrie her picture vpon the poope of their ships, and such as be traueilers to the sea doo offer vnto her sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>These aforesaide they doo estéeme for their principall saints, yet besides all these they haue an infinite number of carued idols, which they doo place vpon alters in their tempels: the quantitie of them is such (that in my presence it was affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by frier <hi>Geronimo Martin,</hi> he that entred into <hi>China,</hi> and is a man of great credite woorthy to giue credite vnto, that amongst many other things, he was in one of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the cittie of <hi>Vcheo,</hi> where as hee did count one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twelue idols: and besides this they haue manie in the high wayes and stréetes, and vppon their principall gates of the citie, the which they haue in small veneration, as you shall perceiue in this chapter following: whereby it is plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be séene, in what subiection they are vnto errours and Idolatrie, such as doo lacke the trueth of true Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

whereas they were sacrificing vnto their Idols, being moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with great zeale to the honour of God, did throw certaine of them downe to the grounde. When these Idolaters did sée his boldnesse which séemed vnto them to be without reason: they laide hands on him with an infernall furie, with determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for to kill him: then he did request of them that before they did execute it, that they would heare what he would say: the which his petition séemed vnto the principals that were there to bee iust, and commanded all the people to withdrawe themselues, and to heare what he woulde say. Then he with the spirit that God did put in him, said, that they should aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise themselues, for that God our Lorde and creator of heauen and earth, had giuen vnto them so good vnderstandings, and did equall them vnto the politikest nations in all the world: that they should not imploy it vnto euil, neither subiect themselues to worship vnto stones and blocks of wood which haue no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of reason, more then is giuen them by the workmen that did make them, and it were more reason the idols should reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence &amp; worship men, because they haue their similitude &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: with these words and other such like in effect, they were all quieted, and did not only approoue his saying to be true, but did giue him great thankes, excusing themselues: saying, that vntill that time there was none that euer did giue them to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand so much, neither how they did euill in doing their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and in token of gratefulnes (leauing their idols on the ground, and some broken all to pieces) they did beare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany vnto his lodging. Hereby you may vnderstand with what facilitie, by the helpe of almightie God, they may be reduced vnto our catholike faith: opening (by the light of the gospel) the doore which the diuell hath kept shut by false delusions so long time, although the king with all his gouernors and ministers hath great care that in all that kingdome there be none to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce nouelties, neither to admit strangers or any new doctrin without license of the said king, &amp; of his roial counsel vpon pain of death, the which is executed with great rigor.

                  <p>THe people of this countrie do not alonely vse superstitions, but they are also great Augurisers or tellers of fortunes, and do beléeue in auguries, as a thing most certaine and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, but in especiall by certaine lots which they do vse at all times,<note place="margin">They cast lottes.</note> when they beginne any iorney, or for to doe any thing of importaunce, as to marie a sonne, a daughter, or lend anie money, or buy any lands, or deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> merchandise, or any other thing whose end is incertaine or doubtfull. In all these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they do vse lottes, the which they do make of two sticks, flat on the one side, and round on the other, and being tyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with a small thréede, throwe them before their Idols. But before they do throwe them, they do vse great ceremonies in talke, and vse amorous and gentle wordes, desiring them to giue them good fortune. For by them they doe vnderstand the successe to be good or euill in their iourney, or any other thing that they do take in hande. Likewise they do promise them, if they do giue them good fortune, to offer vnto them, victuales, frontalles, or some other thing of price. This being done they throwe downe their lots, and if it so fall out that the flat side be vpper, or one flat side and the other round, they haue it for an euill signe or token. Then they returne vnto their Idols, and say vnto them manie iniurious words, calling them dogs, infamous, villaines, and other names like in effect. After they haue vttered vnto them all iniuries at their pleasure, then they beginne againe to fawne vpon them, and intreat them with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3380:21"/>
milde and swéet words, crauing pardon of that which is past, and promising to giue them more gifts then before they did, if their lot do fal out wel. Then in the like manner as before, they do procéed, and throw the lots before the idols: but if it fal not out according vnto their expectation, then they returne againe with vituperous and vile words: but if to their desire, then with great praises and promises. But when that in matters of great importance, it is long before their lots do fall well: then they take them and throwe them to the grounde and treade vppon them, or else throwe them into the sea, or into the fire,<note place="margin">They throw their gods vnder their feete.</note> whereas they let them burne a while: and sometimes they doo whippe them vntill such time as the lottes doo fall as they woulde haue them, which is the rounde side vpwards, and is a token of good successe vnto that, for which they do cast their lottes. Then if the lottes doo fall out vnto their content, they doo make vnto them great feastes with musicke and songes of great praise, and doo offer vnto them géese, duckes, and boyled rise. But if the thing whereon they doo cast their lottes bée of importance, then they doo offer vnto them a hogges heade boyled, dressed with hearbes and flowers, the which is estéemed aboue all other thinges, and therewith a great pot with wine. Of all that they doo offer, they doo cut off their billes, and the clawes of the fowles, and the hogges snowte, and do throw vpon it graines of rise,<note place="margin">A hogs head for a sacrifice.</note> and sprinkling it it with wine, they set it in dishes vpon the altar, and there they do eate and drinke making great feast and chéere before their idols.</p>
                  <p>Another kinde of lots they doo vse,<note place="margin">Another kind of lots.</note> in putting a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of little stickes into a pot, and vpon euerie one of them is written a letter: and after that they haue tumbled and tossed them together in the pot: they cause a child to put in his hand and take out one, and when they haue séene the letter, they séeke in a booke which they haue for that purpose: the leafe that beginneth with that letter, and looke what they doo finde written therein, they doo interpret of it conformable vnto the thing that they cast their lots for.</p>
                  <p>Generally in all this country when they finde themselues in any trouble,<note place="margin">Inuocation to the diuell.</note> they do inuocate and call vpon the diuell with whom they do ordinarily talke (euen as we do cal vpon God in

our néede) of him they doo demande what way and order they might take to cléere themselues thereof, as they did in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of frier <hi>Pedro de Alfaro,</hi> of the order of saint Francis, in the yeare of our Lorde 1580. at such time as he came from <hi>China,</hi> as may bee séene in his relation. The order that they haue in inuocating or calling on the diuell, is as followeth. They cause a man to lie vpon the ground, his face downwards then another beginneth to reade vpon a booke singing, and part of them that are present do answere vnto him: the rest do make a sound with little bels, and tabers: then within a little while after, the man that lieth on the ground, beginneth to make vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages and iestures: which is a certaine token that the diuell is entred within him: then do they aske of him what they doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know: then he that is possessed doth answere, yet for the most part they bee lies that hee dooth speake:<note place="margin">The diuell telleth lies.</note> although hee doo kéepe it close, yet doth hée giue diuers reasons vnto that which hee dooth answere, for that alwayes they doo answere either by worde or by letters, which is the remedie they haue, when that the diuell will not answere by worde. And when that hée doth answere by letters, then do they spread a redde mantle or couerlet vpon the ground, and throw thereon a certaine quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of rice dispersed equally in euery place vpon the couerlet: then do they cause a man that cannot write to stand there with a sticke in his hand, then those that are present do begin to sing and to make a sounde as at the first inuocation: and within a little while the diuell doth enter into him that hath the sticke, and causeth him to write vpon the rice, then do they translate the letters that are there formed with the sticke, and being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned altogether, they finde answere of that they do demaunde: although for the most part it falleth out as aforesaide, as vnto people that do communicate with the father of all lying, and so do their answeares fall out false and full of leasings. If that at any time he do tell them the trueth, it is not for that he dooth it by nature or with his will: but to induce them vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of a truth to perseuer in their errors, and they do giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite vnto a thousand lies: in this sort doo they inuocate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, and it is so ordinarie a thing throughout al the kingdome, that there is nothing more vsed nor knowne.</p>

                  <p>ALthough the <hi>Chinos</hi> be generally verie ingenious, and of a cléere vnderstanding, yet in their owne respect, they say that all other nations in the worlde be blinde, except the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards whom they haue knowne but of late time: they haue amongst them both naturall and morall philosophie, the which is read publikely amongst them, and also astrologie.</p>
                  <p>But nowe touching the beginning of the worlde, and the creation of man: they haue many errors, wherof some of them shalbe declared in this chapter, taken out of their owne books, and specially out of one that is intituled the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>They say that at the beginning, the heauen, the earth, &amp; the water were a masse or lumpe ioyned in one. And that there is one resident in heauen, whom they call by name <hi>Tayn,</hi> hee by his great science did separate heauen and earth, the one from the other, so that the heauen remained hie in the state that it is, and the earth following his naturall inclination, as graue and heauie, did remaine whereas it is. They say that this <hi>Tayn</hi> did create a man of nothing, who they call <hi>Pauzon,</hi>

This <hi>Tanhom</hi> was a man of great science, in so ample sort, that hée did giue name vnto all created things, and did know by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signement and doctrine of <hi>Tayn,</hi> the vertue of them all, and to apply them to heale all manner of diseases and sicknesses: this <hi>Tanhom</hi> and his brethren, but especially the eldest, who was called <hi>Teyencom,</hi> he had twelue: his first begotten, called <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hucom</hi> had nine, so had al the rest very many. They do beléeue that the linage and generation of these did indure for more then ninty thousand yéeres. And in the end &amp; conclusion of them, did end all humaine nature: for that it was the will of <hi>Tayn,</hi> who did first create the man &amp; woman of nothing, for to be reuenged on certaine iniuries that they did vnto him, and for euery one that he had shewed vnto them, they did almost knowe so much
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3380:23"/>
as himselfe, and would not acknowledge any superioritie, as they did promise him, at such time as hée did giue vnto him the secreat of all his science. At that time did the heauen fall downe, then did <hi>Tayn</hi> raise it vp againe, and created another man vpon the earth named <hi>Lotzitzam,</hi> hee had two hornes, out of the which proceeded a verie swéete sauour: the which swéet smell did bring forth both men and women.

They say and doo affirme it of a truth,<note place="margin">The soule is immortall.</note> that the soule had his first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the heauen, and shall neuer haue ende: for that the heauen hath giuen it an eternall essence. And for the time that it is within the body that God hath ordeined, if it do liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to such lawes as they haue without doing euill, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit vnto his neighbor: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shalbe caried vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wheras it shal liue eternally with great ioy, &amp; shalbe made an angel: &amp;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3380:24"/>
to the contrarie, if it liue ill, shall go with the diuels into darke dungeons and prisons, whereas they shall suffer with them torments which neuer shall haue end. They doo confesse, that there is a place whither such soules as shalbe made angels doo go to make themselues cleane of al such euil as did cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, being in the bodie: and for that it should be spéedelier doone, the good déeds which are done by their parents &amp; friends doo helpe them verie much. So that it is very much vsed throughout al the kingdome to make orations, &amp; praiers for the dead, for the which they haue a day appointed in the moneth of August. They do not make their offrings in their temples, but in their houses: the which they doo in this manner following. The day appointed, all such as do beare them companie vntill their sacrifices are concluded for the dead: which are such as we do cal here religious men, euery one hath his companion and walketh the stréets, and dooth report the daies &amp; houses where they will be, for that it cannot be doone altogether. So when they come vnto the house whereas they must doo their offices: they enter in, &amp; do prepare that euery one do make oration and sacrifice according to their fashion for the dead of that house: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that by their helpe they shalbe made cleane from their euils, which is an impediment that they cannot be angels nor inioy the benefite which is ordained for them in heauen. One of these that is like vnto a priest, dooth bring with him a taber, &amp; other two little bords, &amp; another a little bell. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do make an altar,<note place="margin">Strange ob sequies.</note> wheron they do set such idols as the dead had for their saints liuing: then do they perfume them with franke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and storax, and other swéet smels: then do they put 5. or 6 tables ful of victuals for the dead &amp; for the saints: then straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at the sound of the taber, little bords &amp; bels (which is a thing more apt for to dance by, as by report of them that haue heard it) they begin to sing certaine songs which they haue for that purpose, then doe the nouices goe vp vnto the altar, and do offer in written paper those Orations which they did sing to the sound of those instruments, This being done, they sit down and begin anew to sing as before.<note place="margin">They make their sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the night.</note> In the end of their prayers and songs, he who doth this office, doth sing a prayer, and in the end thereof (with a litle borde that he hath in his hand for the purpose) he striketh a blow vpon the table, then the other

do answere in the same tune, declining their heades, &amp; doe take certaine painted papers, and guilt papers, and doe burne them before the altar. In this sort they are all the night, which is the time that ordinarily they do make their sacrifices: the which being done, the priests &amp; those that be in the house, do eat the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals that was set vpon the tables, wherein they doo spend the residue of the night till it be day. They say that in doing this they do purifie and make cleane the soules that they may goe &amp; become angels.<note place="margin">Great super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</note> The commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people do beléeue of truth that the soule that liueth not well, before they go into hell (which shall not be before the end of the world, according as they do thinke in their error) in recompence of their euill life, the heauens doo put them into the bodies of buffes and other beasts: and those which liue well, into the bodies of kings &amp; lords, whereas they are very much made of &amp; well serued. These and a thousande toies in like sort, making that the soule dooth mooue out of one into another, as certaine old philosophers did affirme it to bee, who were as blind and as far from the truth as they.</p>

This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is for euer till he doo die, except they doo finde in him such faults that he doth deserue to be depriued: yet they do not elect their prouincials as we do vse, but it is doone by the king &amp; his counsell, alwayes choosing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

All their conuents hath great rentes in general: part giuen them by the king, and part of charitie, giuen them in those cities or townes whereas they haue their houses, the which are many and verie huge.

This being done, they do put him into a coffin or chest made of verie swéete wood, (in that countrie you haue verie much) they do make it very close, to auoid the euil smel.

                  <p>THe people of this kingdome haue a particular care to giue state vnto their children in time, before that they be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or drowned in vices or lasciuious liuing. The which care is the occasion, that in this countrie being so great, there is lesse vice vsed than in any other smaller countries: whose o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer much care doth cause them many times to procure to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie their children being verie yoong: yea and to make consort before they bee borne with signes &amp; tokens, making their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and bandes for the performance of the same in publike or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In all this kingdome, yea and in the Ilands <hi>Philippinas,</hi> it is a customable vse, that the husband doth giue dowrie vnto the wife with whom he doth marrie, and at such time as they doe ioyne in matrimonie, the father of the bride doth make a great feast in his owne house, and doth inuite to the same, the father and mother, kinsfolkes and friends of his sonne in lawe. And the next day following, the father of the bridegrome, or his next parent, doth the like vnto the kinsfolkes of the bride. These bankets being finished, the husbande doth giue vnto his wife her dowrie in the presence of them all, and she doth giue it vnto her father or mother (if she haue them) for the paines they tooke in the bringing her vp. Whereby it is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, that in this kingdome, and in those that doe confine on it,<note place="margin">They that haue most daughters are most richest.</note> those that haue most daughters are most richest, so that with the dowries their daughters do giue them, they may well su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine themselues in their necessitie, and when they die, they doo giue it that daughter that did giue it them, that it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for their children, or otherwise vse it at their willes. A man may marrie with so manie wiues as he can sustaine, so it be not with his sister or brothers daughter,<note place="margin">They may marrie with many wiues.</note> and if any doo marrie in these two degrées, they are punished very rigorously.

When the father doth die, the eldest sonne by his first wife doth inherite the most part of all his goods, and the rest is reparted in equall partes amongest the other children, both of his first wife and of all the other wiues. For lacke of a sonne by his first wife, the first borne of the other wiues doth inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite the most part: so that fewe times or neuer there is none that dieth without heyres, eyther by his first wife, or by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

Yet if such be spied or knowen they are righteously punished. They say in the prouinces that be néere vnto <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and in the selfe same <hi>Tartaria</hi> they doo vse a custome and manner of marriage very strange, that is: the vizroyes or gouernors doo limit and appoint a time when that all men and women shall méete together such as will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or receiue the order of religion.</p>

and women that be there, &amp; if they do find more men than wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or to the contrarie, more wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than men: then they cast lots, &amp; do leaue the number that doth so beare in register til the next yeare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be the first that shalbe married. Then sixe of those ancient men, do put the men in thrée parts, the rich they put in one part without any consideration of gentilitie or beautie, and those that are rich in a meane, in an other parte, and the poore in the thirde part. In the meane time that these sixe men be occupied in the reparting of the men, the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sixe doe repart the women in thrée parts, to say in this manner, the most fairest in one part, and them not so faire in an other, and the fowlest in an other.

This being done, they are all married in one daie, and holpen (although peraduenture not all content) the marriages being doone there is great feastes made, in such houses as the king hath ordeyned in euerye citie for the same purpose, the which are furnished with beds, and all other necessaries belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thereunto, for that the new married people may be serued of all that is néedfull for the time that the feast do indure.

dead and his funerall ended, as is accustomed: then doth the heire or successor of the kingdome apparell these thirtie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men maruelous gorgeously with many iewelles, then doth hee cause them to set in an <hi>Estrado,</hi> or rich pallet gallantly dressed and furnished in one of the thrée halles (as shall be declared in the second chapter of the third booke) with their faces couered, in such sort as they may not be séene nor knowen: and being set in this order, then doth there enter in thirtie gentlemen of the principallest of the kingdome, (those whom the king left named in his testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) the which goeth by antiquitie, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto order set by the king: and eyther of them doth take one of these Ladies by the hand, and looke howe they found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, so they doo carrie them with their faces couered till they bring them home to their houses, whereas they haue them for their wiues, and do maintaine and kéepe them all the dayes of their liues: towards the mainteyning of them the king doth leaue in his testament great reueneues, and the successor in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth accomplish and performe the same with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care. In old time when that the kinges of <hi>China</hi> would marrie anie of his children or kinsfolkes, he did make in his pallace a great and solemne banket, to the which he did inuite all the principallest Lordes and gentlemen of his court, commaunding to bring with them their sonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who did accomplish the same, striuing who should appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell their children most richest and most gallantest. The banket being done, the young princes do go whereas are these young Ladies, euerie one placed in order according to their age, and there he doth chuse his wife according to his owne will or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and where he liketh best. Likewise the infants or kings daughters doe the like in choosing their husbands amongst the young lords and gentlemen. But at this time, this custome is left off, for that the princes and gentlemen do marry with their kinsfolkes, so that it be not in the first or seconde degrée: yet many times they do not kéepe the second.</p>

And for that the townes be great and many and so full of people, and an infinite nomber of villages, whereas it cannot be chosen but there is many borne lame, and other misfortunes, so that he is not idle but alwaies occupied in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing order to remedie the necessities of the poore without brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the lawe. This Iudge the first day that hee doth enter into his office,<note place="margin">I would the like were with vs.</note> hee commaundeth that whatsoeuer children be borne a créeple in any part of his members, or by sicknes be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken lame, or by any other misfortune, that incontinent their fathers or mothers doo giue the Iudge to vnderstande thereof that he may prouide for all things necessarie, according vnto the ordinance and will of the king and his counsell, the which is, the man child or woman child, being brought before him, and seene the default or lacke that it hath, if it be so that with the same it may exercise any occupation, they giue and limit a time vnto the parents, for to teach the child that occupation or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned by the Iudge, and it is such, as with their lamenes they may vse without any impediment, the which is accomplished without faile: but if it so be that his lamenes is such, that it is impossible to learne or exercise any occupation, this Iudge of the poore doth commaund the father to sustaine and maintaine him in his owne house all the dayes of his life, if that hee hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3380:29"/>
wherewithall: if not, or that hee is fatherlesse, then the next rich kinsman must maintaine it: if he hath none such, then doth all his parents and kinsfolkes contribute and pay their partes, or giue of such thinges as they haue in their houses. But if it hath no parentes, or they be so poore, that they cannot contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute nor supply any part therof: then doth the king maintaine them in verie ample manner of his owne costes in hospitalles, verie sumptuous, that he hath in euerie citie throughout his kingdome for the same effect and purpose: in the same hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles are likewise maintayned, all such néedie and olde men,<note place="margin">A very good order.</note> as haue spent all their youth in the wars, and are not able to maintaine themselues: so that to the one and the other is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred all that is néedefull and necessarie, and that with great diligence and care: and for the better accomplishing of the same, the Iudge doth put verie good order, and dooth appoint one of the principallest of the citie or towne, to be the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator, without whose licence. There is not one within that hospitall that can goe foorth of the limittes: for that licence is not granted vnto anie, neyther doo they demaund it, for that there they are prouided of all thinges necessarie so long as they doo liue, as well for apparell as for victualles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this, the olde folkes and poore men within the hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, doo bring vpp hennes, chickens, and hogges for their owne recreation and profit, wherein they doo delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The Iudge doth visite often times the administrator by him appointed. Likewise the Iudge is visited by an other that commeth from the court, by the appointment of the king and the counsell to the same effect: and to visite all such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitalles as bee in the prouinces limited in his commission, and if they doo finde any that hath not executed his office in right and iustice, then they doo displace them,<note place="margin">A mirror for vs to looke vpon.</note> and punishe them verie rigorouslie: by reason whereof all such officers haue great care of their charges and liue vprightly, hauing before their eyes the straight account which they must giue, and the cruell rewarde if to the contrarie. The blinde folkes in this countrie are not accounted in the number of those that of necessitie are to bee maintayned by their kinsfolkes, or by the king: for they are constrayned to worke, as to grind with a querne wheate or rice, or to blowe smythes bellowes, or

such like occupations, that they haue no néede of their sight. And if it be a blind woman, when the commeth vnto age, she doth vse the office of women of loue, of which sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This <hi>Vitey</hi> was the first king of <hi>China</hi> (as it appeareth by their histories, where as they doo make particular mention.) But amongest other thinges that they do declare of the kinges person, they do say that he was in height so much as seuen me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which is accustomed in <hi>China</hi>: and euerie measure is

And that shuld not be granted without great occasion for the same.</p>
                  <p>All of one occupation were put in stréetes by themselues, the which order is vsed vnto this day throughout al the kingdome: so that if you doo desire to knowe what occupation is in anye stréete, it is sufficient to sée the first house thereof, although it be very long: for it is verie certaine that they be all of one oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation and not mingled with any other.

the dreames and fondnesse of these Idolaters, vnto the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your discretion: for vnto the discréete is sufficient to touch of euerie thing a little. Hee had foure wiues, and by them fiue and twentie sonnes, he reygned a hundreth yeares: there was betwixt this king, and he which did build the great wall (that was spoken of in the ninth chapter of the first booke) one hundreth and sixtéene kinges, all of the lynage of this <hi>Vitey.</hi> All the which did raigne, as appeareth by their histories, two thousande two hundreth and fiftie seuen yeares. I do not here declare their names, because I would not be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, although they be particularly named in their histories: but here I will set downe them that I finde necessarie to bee spoken of for the succession vnto him that nowe reygneth. The last king of the lynage of this woorthie <hi>Vitey,</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tzintzon:</hi> this did make the mightie and great wall afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide: finding himselfe to be greatly troubled with the king of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> who did make warre vppon him in many places of his kingdome: he did ordaine the making thereof, and for the furnishing of the same, he did take the third man of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to the worke: and for that manie people did die in this tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worke, by reason they went so farre from their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in diuers climes cleane contrarie vnto that where as they were bred and borne: it grew that the king was hated and abhorred of all people, in such sort that they did conspire his death, which in effect they did accomplish and slew him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had reigned fortie yeares: and also his sonne and heyre who was called <hi>Aguizi.</hi> After the death of this <hi>Tzintzon</hi> and his sonne, they did ordaine for their king, one that was called <hi>Auchosau,</hi> a man of great valour and wisedome, hee reigned twelue yeares: a sonne of his did succéede him in the kingdom, called <hi>Futey,</hi> &amp; he reigned seuen yeares. After the death of this king, who died very young: his wife did reigne and gouerne, and was of his owne linage: she did maruelously gouerne that kingdome for the space of 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeares, and for that shee had no issue naturall of her bodie, a sonne of her husbands y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had by an other wife did succéede in the kingdome, and reigned thrée and twentie yeares: a son of his did succéede him, called <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tey,</hi> and reigned 16. yeares &amp; eight monthes: a son of his called <hi>Guntey,</hi> did reigne 54. yeares: a sonne of his did succéede him

called <hi>Guntey,</hi> and reigned thirtéene yeares: his sonne called <hi>Ochantey,</hi> did succéede him and reigned 25. yeares and thrée monthes: his son called <hi>Coantey</hi> succéeded him &amp; reigned 13. yeares &amp; two monthes. After him reigned his sonne <hi>Tzentzey,</hi> 26. yeares &amp; 4. monthes: then succéeded his son called <hi>Anthey,</hi> and reigned no more but 6. yeares, his sonne <hi>Pintatey,</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite &amp; reigned 5. yeares: this <hi>Pintatey</hi> when he died was not married, and therefore a brother of his did succéede him called <hi>Tzintzumy,</hi> &amp; reigned but 3. yeares &amp; 7. monethes: after him succéeded a younger brother called <hi>Huy hannon,</hi> &amp; reigned sixe yeares: his sonne called <hi>Cubum</hi> did succéede him &amp; reigned 32. yeares: his son <hi>Bemthey,</hi> did inherite &amp; reigned 18. yeares: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him his son <hi>Vnthey,</hi> &amp; reigned 13. yeares: <hi>O they</hi> succéede him &amp; reigned 17. yeres, his sonne called <hi>Yanthey</hi> reigned but 8. monethes, and left a sonne called <hi>Antey,</hi> who reigned 19. yeares, whose eldest sonne called <hi>Tantey,</hi> died incontinent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his father, and reigned only 3. monthes, &amp; his brother called <hi>Chytey</hi> reigned one yeare, his son called <hi>Linthey</hi> reigned 22. yeares, his sonne called <hi>Yanthey</hi> did succeede him, &amp; reigned 31. yeares. This <hi>Yanthey</hi> (the historie saieth) was a man of small wisedome which was the occasion that he was abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and hated of those of his kingdome. A Nephew of his called <hi>Laupy</hi> did rebell against him, he had two sociates for to helpe him, gentlemen of the court, they were two brethren &amp; verie valiant, the one was called <hi>Quathy,</hi> the other <hi>Tzunthey,</hi> these two did procure to make <hi>Laupy</hi> king. His vncle the king vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode thereof, and was of so litle valor &amp; discretion, that he could not, neither durst he put remedie in the same: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed commotions and common rumors amongst the people. But in especiall there was foure tyrantes ioyned in one, and all at one time, they wer called, <hi>Cincoan, Sosoc, Guansian</hi> &amp; <hi>Guan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.</hi> Against these <hi>Laupy</hi> did make warre vnder colour to helpe his vncle, but after a while, that the warre indured, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and made peace with <hi>Cincoan,</hi> and he married<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with one of his daughters, who straight wayes made warre against the other thrée tyrants with the helpe of his father in lawe. At this time this mightie kingdome was diuided in thrée partes and beganne the tyrannie as you shall vnderstande: the one and principall part fell vnto <hi>Laupy</hi> by the death of his vncle,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3380:32"/>
the other to <hi>Sosoc,</hi> &amp; the other vnto <hi>Cincoan</hi> his father in law. In this sort remained the kingdome in diuision a while, til such time as <hi>Cuythey</hi> sonne vnto <hi>Laupy</hi> did reigne in his fathers stéede. Then did there a tyrant rise vp against him called <hi>Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butey</hi> and slew him: he by his great valour did bring the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome all in one as before, after that it had bin in diuision 41. yeares, and reigned after that alone 25. yeares: his sonne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Fontey,</hi> did succéede him and reigned 17. yeares. And to make short of this linage, there was 15. kinges, and reigned 176. yeares, against the last of them who was called <hi>Quiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tey</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there did arise against him tyrannously <hi>Tzobu.</hi> Of this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was eyght kinges, who reigned 62. yeares: against the last of them called <hi>Sutey,</hi> there arose one called <hi>Cotey,</hi> of whose lynage there was fiue kings, and reigned twentie foure yeres, the last of them called <hi>Otey,</hi> was slaine by <hi>Dian</hi>

There was of them one and twentie kinges, and reigned 294. yeares: the last of them called <hi>Troncon,</hi> did marrie with one that had béene his fathers wife, called <hi>Bausa</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a verie faire woman: hee tooke her out of a monasterie where she was a Nunne, onely to marrie with her: she vsed such po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie that he was slaine, and did gouerne the kingdome after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone one and fortie yeares. The historie sayth that she was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest, and that with extremitie, and vsed the companie of the best and principallest of the realme, and not content with that, she married with one of base lynage, one fit for her purpose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she was so vicious. They say that before she did marrie, she caused to be slaine the sonnes she had by her first husbande, for that she had a desire that a nephew of hers should succéede her in the kingdome. Then those of the kingdome perceiuing her intent, and wearie of her, by reason of her ill liuing, sent out to seeke a bastard sonne of her husbandes, who was fledde away, and with a common consent, they raysed him for king.

He was called <hi>Tautzon,</hi> he caused cruell and rigorous Iustice to be done vpon his stepmother, as was reason for her euilles, and an example to all those of the kingdome, who by a presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of her ill liuing beganne to straggle: there was of his ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage seuen kinges, that reigned 130. yeares: against the last called <hi>Concham</hi> arose <hi>Dian,</hi> of this linage there were but two kinges and reigned eighteene yeares.

                     </gap>tie city, and of the great riches that is in it, which is a signe to be of a truth, for that they agree all in one. There is so much people in it, what of citizens and courtiers, that it is affirmed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vpon any vrgent occasion, there may be ioyned together two hundreth thousand men, and the halfe of them to bee horsemen. At the entring into this citie, toward the orient, is situated the mightie and sumptuous pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the king, where he remaineth ordinarily, although hee hath other two: the one in the midst of the citie, and the other at the end towards the West. This first pallace they do testifie is of such huge bignesse and so much curiositie, that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to haue foure dayes at the least to view and sée it all. First it is compassed about with seuen walles very huge: and the space that is betwixt one wall and another, doth containe ten thousand souldiers which doo watch and gard the kings house dayly: there is within this pallace thrée score and ninetéene halles of a marueilous rich and and curious making, wherein there are many women that doo serue the king in the place of pages and squires: but the principallest to be seene in this pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace is foure halles verie rich, whereas the king giueth audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto such ambassadours as come vnto him from other kingdomes, or prouinces, or vnto his owne people, when they call any court of parliament (which is very seldome) for that he is not séene by his commons out of his owne house but by great chance, and yet when they doo sée him, for the most part it is by a glasse window.<note place="margin">Foure curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous halles.</note> The first of these hals is made al of mettall very curiously wrought with manie figures: and the seconde haththe séeling and the floore wrought in the order of masons worke, all of siluer of great valure: the thirde is of fine golde wrought and inamiled verie curiously. The fourth is of so great riches, that it much excéedeth all the other thrée:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3380:34"/>
for that in it is represented the power and riches of that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie kingdome: and therfore in their language they do cal it the hall of the kings treasure, and they do affirme that it deserueth to haue that name: for that there is in it the greatest treasure that any king hath in all the world, besides many iewels of an inestimable price, and a chaire (wherein he dooth sit) of great maiesty, made of Iuory, set full of pretious stones, and carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of a great price, that in the darkest time of the night, the hall is of so great clearenesse, as though there were in it manie torches or lights: the wals are set full of stones of diuers sorts verie rich and of great vertue wrought verie curiously: and to declare it in fewe words, it is the richest and principalst thing to be séene in all the kingdome, for therein is the principallest thereof. In these foure halles are heard such ambassadours as are sent from other countries, according vnto the estate and qualitie of the king, and prouinces from whence they come: so that according as they are estéemed, so are they entertained into one of these foure hals. If that from whence they come is from a king of small power, he hath audience in the first hall: if he be of a reasonable power, in the second hal, and in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the rest. Within this mightie pallace, the king hath all that any humane vnderstanding can desire or aske (touching this life) in pleasures for to recreate his person, and for their quéene: for that neuer (or by great chance) they go foorth of the same: and it hath béene a customable vse amongst the kings of that countrie: that it is as a thing inherited by succession neuer to go forth. They say, their reason why they doo keepe themselues so close &amp; not to go abroade, is to conserue the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie estate of their estade, and also to auoide for being slaine by treason (as many times it falleth so out) for which occasion you haue had kings, that in all the time of their reigne haue not gone out of their pallace, but onely the day of their oath and crownation: and besides this their close kéeping, yet haue they tenne thousande men continually (as aforesaide) in garde of the pallace both day and night, besides others that are in the courtes, staires and halles, and other places. Within the gates and wals of this mightie pallace they haue gardines, orchards, woodes and groues, whereas is all manner of hunt, and foule and great pondes full of fish. And to conclude, they haue all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3380:34"/>
manner of pleasures and delites, that may be inuented or had in any banketting house in the fielde. In all this kingdome, there is not one that is lorde ouer any subiect or vassales (as they of Turkie) neither haue they any iurisdiction proper: but that which is his patrimonie and moueables, or that which the king doth giue them in recompence of good seruice or gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for any other particular respect: all the which dooth end with the person, and is returned againe vnto the king, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he will giue it into the sonne of him that is dead, in curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie more then by obligation or duetie: giuing to vnderstande that it is to auoyd inconueniences, and occasions of treasons, which might grow if that there were any lords that were rich, or of power, &amp; not for couetousnes or any other intent. Those whom he dooth put in authoritie, whether they are vizroyes, gouernours, or captaine generals, or whatsoeuer they be, hée giueth vnto them large wages, sufficient to sustaine them in their office, in so ample sort, that it is rather ouerplus vnto them then lacke, for that he will not that their necessitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to take presents or bribes, which thing doth blinde them, that they cannot do iustice vprightly:<note place="margin">Punished for taking bribes</note> and vnto him that doth receiue or take any such (although it be but of smal prise) he is cruelly punished.</p>

                  <p>ALthough this kingdome is great and very rich, yet there is none that doth pay so little tribute ordinarily vnto their king as they do: neither amongst Christians, Moores nor gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that we know. The extraordinary and personall seruice is very much, that in some respect wee may say that they are more slaues then frée men, for that they do not possesse one foote of land but they pay tribute: in respect whereof, as also for the great misusing of them by their gouernours, will bee a great part and occasion to inuite them to receiue the lawe of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and that with great facilitie to inioy the the libertie of the same.</p>
                  <p>The ordinarie tribute that euery one dooth pay that dooth kéepe house, is two <hi>Mases</hi> euery yeare, which is as much as two spanish rials of plate. This tribute is verie little, yet the <hi>Loytians</hi> (which is a great part of the kingdome) do pay none, neither their gouernours nor ministers, captaines nor souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: the multitude of the people is so great, and the kingdome so bigge, that alonely that which they giue for expences of the king and his court is woonderfull, with customes, dueties, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and other rents: not accounting that which is paide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to garisons and souldiers of that kingdome, neither in that which is spent in repairing of walles of particular cities, and in men of warre at sea, and camps by land: to gouernours and iustices, which doth not enter into this account.</p>

                  <p>LOoke what care and diligence this mightie king hath, that iustice should be ministred with right &amp; equitie: so likewise (yea &amp; much more) he hath touching matters that may preuent wars, which be offered, by princes adiacent vnto him, or anie other whatsoeuer. But in especiall with the <hi>Tartarians</hi> with whom they haue had continuall wars many yeare.

This military order they do vse and maintaine, in such sort that no nation knowne may be compared vnto them. Although speaking generally, (according vnto the relation of certaine spanish souldiers that were there, and did many times sée them) there be other nations that do excéed them both in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantnesse, courage, and worthinesse of mind.</p>

So that if any haue any iourney to ride verie early in the morning, he must go forth of the citie ouer night, before the gates be shut, and remaine in the suburbes: for out of the cittie it is not possible to goe vntill the gates be open, which is not till the sunne be vp ordinarily.</p>
                  <p>They do not vse any castles nor forts, but great bulwarkes and gun bankes, whereas they haue continuall watch, and doo change by quarters according as wee do vse: and the officers with a great number of souldiers do range throughout the city, and bulworkes: and commonly the captaines be naturall of those prouinces, whereas they haue their charge giuen them: in consideration that the loue they haue to their countrie, doo binde them to fight to the death for the defence thereof.

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:3380:37"/>The souldiers of this kingdome are in two sorts and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the one sort are such as bee and are naturals of the citie whereas they haue their charge, and these be called in their language <hi>Cum:</hi> in this place the sonne doth succéed the father, and for lacke of an heire, the king doth prouide one in the dead mans place. Euery one of them hath his name written vpon the post of his doore, and the place appointed whither he shal go when occasion shall serue, (enimies being against that cittie or towne.) The other sort of souldiers are strangers, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted for yeares or monethes to serue. These be they that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily make their watches, musters, and ioyne companies for the receit of the captaines: these be called in their language <hi>Pon.</hi> These goe from one place vnto another, whereas they are commanded to go. One captaine and ancient hath charge of a thousand, and a meaner captaine with his ancient a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, that doo depend vpon the other. So that for to knowe the number of people that is in a great campe, it is done with great ease, in accounting the ensignes of a thousand men, which are easily knowne. Euery chiefe or petie captaine of these, hath his house vpon the cittie wal, and his name put on it, and there he dwelleth so long as the warres indureth. These captaines euery moneth do exercise their souldiers in marching and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in order: sometime with quick spéed, and other times more slower, and to giue assalt and retyre as they are taught by the sound of the drum: this they do vse continually in the time of peace, as wel as in the time of warre: Also how to vse their weapons, which are ordinarie, hargabuses, pikes, targets, faunchers, brushebilles, holbards, dagars and armour. The horsemen do vse in the warres to carrie foure swords hanging at their saddell bowes, and doo fight with two at once, with great dexteritie and gallant to behold. These do accustome to go into the wars accompanied with many seruants, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar friends on foote, all wel armed after the gallantest manner that possible they may, These footemen be marueilous full of pollicie and ingenious in warlike or martiall affaires: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue some valor for to assalt and abide the enimie, yet doo they profite themselues of policies, deuises and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fire, &amp; of fire workes. Thus do they vse as wel by land in their wars, as by sea many homes of fire, full of olde iron,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3380:38"/>
and arrowes made with powder &amp; fire worke, with the which they do much harme and destroy their enimies. The horsemen do fight with bowes and arrowes, and lances, and with two swordes (as I haue saide before) and some with hargabuses. They cannot gouerne their horses very wel, for that they haue but one péece of iron that is crosse in their mouthes that serueth for a bridle: and for to make them stay, they pull but one raine, and with clapping their hands together and making of a noise before them.<note place="margin">Uerie ill horsemen.</note> They haue very ill saddels, so that they be al verie ill horsemen. The like prouision hath the king for the sea: hée hath great fléetes of ships, furnished with captaines and men, that doo scoure and defend the costs of the countrie with great diligence and watchings. The souldiers as well by land as by sea are paid with great liberalitie, and those that do aduantage themselues in valor, are very much estéemed, and haue great preferment and rewards. When these <hi>Chinos</hi> doo take anie prisoner in the wars, they doo not kill him, nor giue him more punishment, but to serue as a souldier in that countrie in the farthest parts from their naturall: the king paying him his wages as other souldiers are paid. These for that they may be knowne doo weare redde bonnets, but in their other apparell they do differ nothing from the <hi>Chinos.</hi> Likewise such as be condemned by iustice for criminall offences, to serue in any frontier (as is vsed much amongst them) they also weare redde caps or bonnets: and so it is declared in their sentence, that they do condemne them to the red bonnet.</p>

                  <p>ALthough in many things that haue bin séene in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is shewed and declared the sharpe and ripe witts of these men, and with what wisedome and prudence they doo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne their countries: yet wherein they doo most manifest the same (in my iudgement) is in that which shalbe declared in this chapter. They without all doubt séeme to excéede the Gréekes Carthagenians &amp; Romanes, of whom the old ancient histories haue signified to vs, &amp; also of those later times: who for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere strange countries did separate themselues so farre from their natural, that they lost their owne countries at home. But these of this kingdome being forewarned (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouerbe saith:) <hi>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum,</hi> By the hurt of another &amp;c. they haue found by experience y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to go forth of their owne kingdome to conquer others, is the spoile and losse of much people, and expences of great treasures, besides the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and care which continually they haue to sustaine that which is got, with feare to be lost againe: so that in the meane time whilest they were occupied in strange conquests, their enimies the Tartarians and other kings borderers vnto them did trouble and inuade them doing great damage and harme. And more considering that they do possesse one of the greatest &amp; best kingdomes of the world, as well for riches as for fertilty: by reason whereof, and by the great aboundance of things that the country doth yéeld: many strange nations do profite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from them, and they haue néed of none other nation, for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3380:40"/>
that they haue sufficient of all things necessarie to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of humane life.<note place="margin">They haue no neede of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> In consideration whereof they called a generall court of parliament, whether came all vizroyes and gouernours and other principall men of all the fiftéene prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and there they did communicate, to put remedy in this great inconuenience in the best manner possible. Then after they had wel considered of the same with great care &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, taking the iudgement particular of euery one, &amp; in generall by common consent they found it requisit for their quietnes &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, &amp; a thing most conuenient for the common wealth to leaue al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had got &amp; gained out of their owne kingdome: but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially such countries as were farre off. And from that day for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards not to make any wars in any place: for that from thence did procéed a knowne damage &amp; a doubtfull profite: and being altogether conformable, they did request the king that was at that present that he would cal home al such people, as he had in other kingdomes bordering there about vnder his obedience, perswading him that in so doing, he should remaine a mightie prince, more richer, more in quiet and in more securitie. Then the king perceiuing the request and petition of his kingdome &amp; subiects, and being fully satisfied that this perswasion was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to be put in execution: he straightwayes set it a worke, and commanded vpon great penalties, that al his subiects and vassals naturall that were in any strange countries, that in a time limited, they should returne home to their own country and houses: and likewise to the gouernours of the same coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that they should in his name abandon &amp; leaue the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and possession that he had of them: excepting such as would of their owne good will acknowledge vassalage, and giue him tribute, &amp; remaine friends, as vnto this day the <hi>Lechios</hi> &amp; other nations do. This law was then established and is inuiolablie kept to this day: in the which it is first commanded that none whatsoeuer vpon paine of death, shall make or begin warre in any part without his licence.<note place="margin">Straight lawes.</note> Also on the said penaltie, that no subiect of his shall nauigate by sea out of the kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the said licence. Also that whosoeuer will go from one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince to another within the said kingdome, to traficke in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and selling, shall giue suerties to returne againe in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine time limited, vpon paine to bee disnaturalled of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3380:40"/>
Likewise that no stranger whatsoeuer shal come in by sea nor by land, without his expresse licence, or of the gouernours of such ports or places whereas they shall come or ariue. And this licence must be giuen with great consideration, aduising the king therof. Al which lawes haue béene so inuiolablie kept and obserued, that it hath béene the occasion that this mightie kingdome hath not come to notice and knowledge but of late yeares. All the which that is said, séemeth to be true, for that it is cléerely found in their histories and books of nauigations of old antiquitie: whereas it is plainely séene that they did come with their shipping vnto the Indies, hauing conquered al that is from <hi>China,</hi> vnto the farthest part thereof. Of all the which they indured possessers in great quietnes, till such time as they ordeined the law of abandoning, of their owne good will, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid. So that at this day there is great memory of them in the ilands <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and on the cost of <hi>Coromande,</hi> which is the cost against the kingdome of <hi>Norsinga</hi> towards the sea of <hi>Cengala</hi>: whereas is a towne called vnto this day the soile of the <hi>Chinos,</hi> for that they did reedifie &amp; make the same. The like notice &amp; memory is there in the kingdom of <hi>Calicut,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as be many trées and fruits, that the naturals of that countrie do say, were brought thither by the <hi>Chinos,</hi> when that they were lords and gouernours of that countrie. Likewise in those dayes they were of <hi>Malaca, Siam</hi> and <hi>Chapaa,</hi> &amp; other of their borderers: Also it is to be beléeued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ilands of <hi>Iapon,</hi> for that there are many tokens of the <hi>Chinos</hi> vnto this day, &amp; the naturals of the country are much after the fashion of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> and many particular things that do giue vs to vnderstand: and some lawes that are obserued and kept in <hi>China.</hi> But now in these dayes the gouernours of the sea ports do dispence with the law, that forbiddeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> going out of the kingdome, by certain giftes which is giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by merchants, to giue them secret li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that they may go and traficke in Ilands bordering there about, as vnto the <hi>Philippinas,</hi> whither come euery yeare many ships lade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with merchandise of great riches, of the which is brought many times into Spaine. Likewise they do trauaile vnto other parts and places, wheras they vnderstand they may profite themselues. Yet they do not giue any such licence vntill they haue giuen suerties to returne within one whole yeare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:3380:41"/>The desire of gaine hath caused them to traueile to <hi>Mexico,</hi> whither came the yeare past in anno 1585. thrée merchants of <hi>China,</hi> with very curious things, &amp; neuer staied till they came into Spaine and into other kingdomes further off. Likewise the said iudge and gouernours doo giue licence vnto strangers (in the order aforesaid) for to enter into their ports to buy &amp; sel, but first vpon examination and charge, that they should haue a great care not to demand any licence but to the same intent. Then haue they their licence with a time limited, and with condition that they shall not procure to goe about their cities, neither to see the secrets thereof. And this is giuen in writing vpon a whited table, which is set vpon the fore partes of their ships, that when they come to an anker in any port it may be séene of the kéepers and guards that they sinke them not, but let them peaceably to enter and to traficke in buying and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, paying their ordinarie customes due vnto the king.</p>
                  <p>In euery port there is a scriuener or notarie, put there by the gouerners, that dooth set downe in memorie the day and houre that any shippe doth enter in, in order: that whether hée be a stranger or natural to take in his lading and dispatch, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the old custome of those ports, the which is inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably kept: which is the occasion that they do lade and dispatch in so short time, and with so great quietnesse, as though there were but one shippe, although many times you shall sée in one port two thousande ships small and great.

dignitie that a man can come vnto: for that (as aforesaid) in all this kingdome, there is neither Prince, Duke, Marquesse, Earle nor Lord, that hath any subiectes but the king only, and the prince his sonne. These counsellers, and the gouernors of these prouinces by them appointed bee such personages, that they are respected and esteemed for the time of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the same estimation, as is the other, where as they haue these titles.</p>
                  <p>For to be one of this counsell, it is not sufficient that they be expert and learned in the lawes of the countrie,<note place="margin">Councellers must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and in morall and naturall Philosophie, and commenced in the same: but they must be also expert in Astrologie and iudgements. For they say, he that must be of this supreme counsell, by whome is gouerned all these fiftéene prouinces: it is requisite that they know all this that is saide, for to prognosticate what shall succéede and happen, the better to prouide for all necessities that shall come. These twelue doo sit in counsell ordinarily in the kinges pallace, for the which there is a hall appointed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous richly trimmed: and in the same thirtéene chayres, sixe of them of golde, and sixe of siluer: both the one and the other of great price, wrought with great curiositie: yet the thirtenth is more richer, for that it is of golde and set full of precious stones of great value, &amp; that is placed in the middest of them vnder a canopie or cloth of estate, of cloth of gold: in the which is imbrodered the kinges armes, and is as it is saide, certaine serpentes wrought with golde wyer: in this chayre the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent doth sitte when the king is not in presence: but if hee be there (as séeldome he is) then doth the president sit in the first and highest of the chaires on the right hand, which be of gold: in the which, and in the other of siluer, they bee placed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto their antiquitie: in this sort, that if the president do die, then do the most auncient procéede and inherite his roome, and in his chaire doth the fift person rise on the side of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den chaires: and so from the fourth vnto the fift: and in this order all the rest arise in the chaires of siluer, passing into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chaires of golde. This may the president doo, preferring euerie one in order (if any doo die) without the consent of the king. And if any of these chaires be voyd, then doth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell choose an other by voices: the which is done by vprightnes,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3380:42"/>
and he which hath the most is preferred: but the chiefest in this preferment is merit and sufficiencie. If he that is choosen be absent in any gouernment, then doo they send for him: but if hee bee present in the citie, then doo they carrie him before the king: giuing him to vnderstand of their election, in whose power it is to accept, or to make it voyde: which neuer doth happen. Then the king himselfe on his owne handes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto their custome, doth make him sweare a solemne oth that he shall doo vpright iustice according vnto the lawes of the countrie: and that he shall likewise doo vprighly in the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of viceroyes and gouernours or any other Iustices, and not be led with affections nor passions, neyther receiue anie bribes himself, nor any other for him: with many other things in this order and effect: and aboue all thinges hee shall not bee partaker, neyther consent to anye treason at anie time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the king: but rather if that hee doo vnderstande of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie such directly or indirectly: hee shall straight wayes giue the kinge to vnderstande thereof or his counsell of all that hee dooth knowe or vnderstande, alwaye fauouring with his industrie and force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the preseruation of peace and life of the king.</p>

thinges that doo happen in all the kingdome woorthie to bee aduised of, and this is without falt: for that those which doo gouerne the prouinces haue expresse commaundement to sende notice vnto the court of all thinges that doo happen in anye of their prouinces, touching warres, the estate of the countrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the kinges rents, or any other thing: the which is accomplished with so great care, that although it bee a prouince distant fiue hundred leagues from the court: yet the post doth not misse his day appointed. And those which do first come, do tarrie till the last or furthest off doo come, and then vpon the day appointed they do all together giue their relations. Those which are farre off for to be at the court so soone &amp; at the instant as those which are nigh at hand doo send postes daily, that the one may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the other. They do run post after the vse of Italy &amp; Spain with a horne, but they were woont to haue a coller of belles, the better to be heard: so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the postmasters when they do heare the horne or bels, do straight waies bridle their horse to be in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines. Likewise, if their iourney be to passe by water (as many times it hapneth) then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boat-men do make their barks readie.</p>
                  <p>Then when the counsell hath taken relation of all the posts in effect, the president incontinent doth giue a straight account thereof vnto the king: then he or the counsell by his order (if anie such néede requireth) do put remedie for that that is néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the time. And if it be requisite to send any Iustice about the same, he is straight wayes appointed, and dispatched and sent in all haste and with great secrecie: and this Iustice doth make inquiries in such sort that it is not knowen, no not in the citie where the fault is committed.</p>
                  <p>And for that, touching this matter it shall bee spoken of more at large in chapters following, I will conclude with this: that this king will haue such dominion ouer his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and subiectes, that although it be great with so manie Prouinces, Cities and Townes, yet not one Uiceroy, Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor nor Iustice can put any man vnto death, without his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be first confirmed by the kinge and his royall counsell, except it be in the warres actually, for that there in the delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof may growe some perill: therefore they doo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the captaine generall or his lieftenant to behead or hang what so euer souldier that shall offende or doo anie ill thing,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3380:43"/>
this may they do without consentment of the king or his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, onely with the consentment of the kinges Treasorer, or of the generall of the fielde: the which bee both of them graue personages, and they must be both conformable in their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or els they cannot execute death.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Ofsuch presidents and ministers as the king doth put in euerie prouice, and the order that they haue in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenment.</head>
                  <p>YOu do vnderstand howe the two prouinces. <hi>Paguia</hi> and <hi>Tolanchia</hi> are gouerned by the supreme counsell of the king: and such ministers as they doo send to gouerne.

And although all the kinges officers and Iustices of what sort of administration they are, be generally called by the name of <hi>Loytia</hi>: yet euerie one hath a speciall and a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular name besides, according vnto his office that he doth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute: of the which and of their proper names I will giue you to vnderstand, for that it doth differ from our purpose.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> second in dignitie is the gouernour of all the prouince, and he is called <hi>Insuanto,</hi> who hath verie little lesse maiestie than the viceroy: then the <hi>Corregidor</hi> or gouernor that is resident in any citie: where as is neither viceroy nor gouernor, is called <hi>Tutuan,</hi> all of this degrée. Of any thing that is of importance of what citie so euer they be, they do giue relation thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the higher gouernor called <hi>Insuanto,</hi> and likewise this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suanto</hi> vnto the viceroy or <hi>Comon,</hi> whose charge is to giue the king to vnderstand thereof or his royall counsell, by the postes that we haue spoken of before. The third in dignitie is called <hi>Ponchasi,</hi> this is the president or counsell of the kinges reuenewes, who hath vnder him a counsell and many mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and officers, as sargents and others which do recouer the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3380:43"/>
rents in euerie prouince. This state dooth giue account of all his office vnto the <hi>Tutuan</hi>: after that he hath paide all kind of wages and charges ordinarie and extraordinarie, due to any officer of the kinges in all that prouince.</p>
                  <p>The fourth degrée or dignitie is called <hi>Totoc,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Captaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> and this is captaine generall of all souldiers as well footmen as horsemen. The fift is called <hi>Auchasi,</hi> he is president and gouernour ouer Iustices both criminall and ciuill: and doth determine with his counsell all matters in difference, whatsoeuer that doo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale vnto him from other meaner Iustices. The sixt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aytao</hi>: this is generall puruier and president of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of warre: whose office is to prouide souldiers when that it is requisite or necessitie demaundeth, and to prouide ships, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and victuals for any fléete that shall passe by sea: as that be requisite by land, and for the suppliment of garrisons in cities and coastes. To this is giuen the charge to examine such strangers that do come to any prouince, to knowe of whence they are, and wherefore they do come, and of all other thinges, that after beeing knowen, to giue the viceroy to vnderstande thereof, and of all thinges néedfull.</p>
                  <p>These sixe offices or charge are of great authoritie and they that haue the execution thereof are had in great reuerence: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of them hath in societie or counsell, tenne, which are men chosen of great experience and diligence, and they do help him in the exhibition and dispatch of matters touching that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. When they are in place of counsell, which is in the pallace of the viceroy (whereas euerie office hath his place appointed, garnished in very good order) their sociates are diuided in two partes, fiue of them do sit on the right hand of the president, and fiue on the left hand: those which do sit on the right hande are the most auncientes and haue the more preheminence, and doo differ from the other that be on the left hande in this thing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that they do weare wastes or girdels imbossed with gold, and yealow hattes: and they on the left hand haue their girdels imbossed with siluer, and weare blewe hats: the which gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, with gold and siluer, and hats yealow and blewe, there is none that is permitted to weare but onelye the counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Likewise these and the presidents do weare the kinges armes on their breastes and backes, imbrodered with golde
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3380:44"/>
without the which, they can not goe foorth to anie place where they must be séene: neyther sitte in Iustice to determine anie thing whatsoeuer. If they doo, they are not onely diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, but are seuerely punished at the time of their visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p>If the President of any of these counsels doo die, then one of the auncientest of the counsellers dooth succéede him in the office, obseruing in all thinges the order, as I haue saide in the Chapter past of the royall counsell.<note place="margin">A very good propertie of Iustices.</note> All these Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces generally haue a maruellous morall vertue, and that is, they be all very patient in hearing any complaynt, although it be declared with choller, and proude spéech. It is the first thing that is taught them in their schooles, they are verye well nourtered, and courteous in their spéeches, although it bee with them that they haue condemned by lawe. If that vppon any necessitie they must goe into any part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince to make any information of importaunce, then is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one of the counsell, and hee goeth alone, but he hath with him the authoritie of them all.</p>
                  <p>Besides these sixe Counsellers or Iudges aforesaide, there bee others of lesse dignitie (although greatly respected, as all ministers of Iustice bee in this kingdome) and they are called as followeth: <hi>Cautoc,</hi> this is the chiefe auncient-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, <hi>Pochim,</hi> the seconde treasourer: <hi>Pochinsi,</hi> he that kéepeth the seale royall: <hi>Autzatzi,</hi> he is as the maior or bailife of any citie or towne. There be also other thrée officers which are called <hi>Guytay, Tzia, Tontay,</hi> these doo kéepe court and haue audience in their houses once a wéeke: and when they do open their doores, there is shott off foure péeces of artilerie, to giue all men to vnderstande that they are in place readie to heare, and to doo Iustice. If they do finde any that is culpable or faultie, they doo straight wayes sende them with a Sargent vnto the ordinarie Iustice of the Citie, which is called <hi>Zom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pau,</hi> with a bill or note in the which is signified the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he must haue.</p>
                  <p>Euerie ordinarie Iustice hath committed to his charge, a thousand souldiers. He can not excéed his limit nor iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neyther can anie other haue to doo in his charge.<note place="margin">A very good order.</note> Euerie night they doo range their circuit, and doo cause that euerie

                  <p>Besides all these there be other particular officers, which be called <hi>Tompo</hi>: these haue the charge to sée the prouision of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualles, and to put a price on them, an other is called <hi>Tibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> he that dooth arest and punish vagabundes and idle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. <hi>Quinche</hi> is the chéefe Sargent, <hi>Chomcan,</hi> is the kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the prison: this is one that they haue in great reuerence, for that he hath a priuilege aboue all the rest: that after hee hath done his dutie vpon his knées at his first entrie, hee may tell his tale on foote, and so can not the rest doo, but knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>When that these gouernours or Iustices doo newly come into these Prouinces or Cities, ordeyned and sent by the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme counsell: they doo sende two or thrée dayes before they come themselues their letters patentes and prouisions: the which being séene and obeyed, there goeth foorth to receiue him all the <hi>Loytias</hi> and men of warre with their souldiers and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes military, and other officers making great feastes and pastimes.</p>
                  <p>Likewise the citizens at this time doo hange their stréetes with clothes of silke and other thinges very richly, and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with flowers, bearing him companie vnto his lodging with much musicke and sound of instrumentes.</p>
                  <p>Aboue all these dignities &amp; offices there is one which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quinchay,</hi> which is to be vnderstood in their language (the golden seale) this goeth not from the court, but vpon

waightie matters and of great importance touching the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all the kingdome. The order they haue in the choyse of these Iustices and officers, and of other matters touching good gouernement, shall be declared vnto you in the Chapter following.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. Here is prosecuted the manner howe they do choose their gouernors and Iustices, and howe they doo execute the same.</head>
                  <p>ALl such officers as I haue declared vnto you in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter past, the king dooth ordaine them by consent of his counsell, who doo informe themselues with a particular dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the qualitie and behauiour of the person that shall be elected. The principall matter that they doo aduertise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, is: that the viceroy, gouernour or counseller, be not a naturall of that countrey that he is prouided for: and that for to preuent the inconuenience that might happen in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of good Iustice:<note place="margin">A very good consideration</note> which many times chaunceth, eyther for the loue of his friendes and kinsfolkes, or else for the hate hee hath to his enimies. All such as are prouided in these offices, after that they do depart from the court whereas the charge is giuen them, til they come to the prouince, citie or towne, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they shall remaine in Iustice, they doo spende nothing on their owne horses, for that in all places whereas they doo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile or come, the king hath houses appointed, whereas they are receiued and lodged, and serued of all thinges necessarie, as well for horses for themselues, as horses for them that come with him: likewise of barkes and boates, if that his iourney be by water, all is of frée cost: it is all appointed what they shall haue to eate, which is conformable vnto the qualitie of his person, and the office he hath in charge. And when they do come vnto such houses as are appointed by the king to receiue and cherish them: they of the house do aske him if he will haue his pittance or ordinarie in money, or in victualles: who if he haue any kinsfolkes or friendes in that place that will inuite him, then dooth hee demaund it in money, and kéepe it to himselfe. These houses are maruelously well prouided of beds, and all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3380:45"/>
other things necessarie: for that the <hi>Ponchas,</hi> who is president of the kinges reuenewes, hath a particular care to see all these things well furnished, by a commandement from the king and the supreme counsell. When they doo come vnto the citie or towne whereas they take the charge of gouernment, after they haue giuen the intertainment vnto them with feasts &amp; pastime as is declared in the Chapter past, then do they bring him and lodge him in the kings house, and do prouide him of seruants &amp; all thinges necessarie that belongeth vnto him, and ministers néedefull for the execution of iustice, who likewise haue their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the same house, as sergeants and notaries, and other ministers of lesse authoritie. The king doth pay them all suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient wages, for that it is forbidden vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great penalties, to take bribes or any other thing of any clyent. Likewise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudges be straightly charged &amp; comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, &amp; that is one of the chiefest arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that is giuen them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the counsel, not to consent to be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any clyents in their houses, neither can they pronounce any sentence but in the place of publike audience, &amp; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of all the officers, and it must be done in such sort that all men that are in place of audience may heare it, and is doone in this sort following: The Iudge doth set himselfe in the seat of iustice, then do the porters put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues at the entring or doores of the hall: who do name with a lowde &amp; high voice the person that doth enter in to demand iustice, &amp; the effect of that he doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. Then the plaintife doth knéele downe somewhat a far off from the Iudge, and doth with a loud voice declare his griefe or demand, or else in writing. If it be in writing, then one of the scriueners or notaries doth take the petition &amp; doth read it, the which being vnderstood by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge, he doth straightwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide vpon the same that which is agréeable vnto iustice, &amp; doth firme the petition with his own firme with red inke, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth what is needful to be done. These Iudges are strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged and commanded by the kinges authoritie, that they must go fasting into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hal of audience, or iudgement hall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drinking of anywine, and they must giue no sentence with wine, and that is such a custome amongst them, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer dooth breake it is seuerely punished. By way of phisicke they do permit before they doo go to giue any sentence to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort themselues with some conserues or such like. But wine in no

maner of wise, although they bee sicke of any infirmitie, &amp; the lacke therof to be hurtfull vnto them, for they estéeme it a lesse euill to leaue of the hearing of any matter, then to giue any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence after that they haue eaten or dronke. These matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing executed in publike (which is maruelously obserued &amp; kept) it is not possible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any of the officers should take any bribes, but it must be discouered by one of them: and for that they are vsed with great rigour in their residence, euerie one is afraid of his companion, and are one to an other (in this case) great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The sergeants and notaries &amp; the other officers are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous precise in the executing of their office: if that any doo not his duetie in his office, they take him and put a little ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in his hand, &amp; he remaineth with the same, knéeling on his knées till the court of audience be ended. Then do the Iudge commaund the bedelles to giue him so many whippes as hee doth deserue for the neglecting of his office. This same is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle estéemed amongest them, for that it is a common thing vsed amongest them, when that anie of these Iudges will go abroade into the Citie (as seeldome times they doo for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of their authoritie) they are accompanied with the officers and ministers of iustice, and that in so good order, that the first two doo carrie siluer mases, after the manner as they doo in Rome carrie the mases before the Cardinalles. They doo carrie them vpon long roddes, which doth signifie that in the name of the king they are in those offices: then after them followeth other two, and they do carrie ech of them in his hand a long cane and very straight, which doth signifie the vpright iustice that ought to be done, and is doone by that Iudge that thers goeth: then followeth them other two, and they doo trayle ech of them a cane vpon the ground with long red laces, and at the endes, tassels, which doth signifie the instrumentes wherewith they do whippe the faultie or malefactors: then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth them other two with tables, like vnto white targets, in the which is written the name of the Iudge, with his title &amp; office. The rest, which be many in number, do accompanie him to do him worship and honor. Those two that we spake of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that do carrie the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, do crie out and make a noyse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people to apart themselues, and to make roome that the Iudge may passe: the which is straightwayes accomplished,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3380:46"/>
for that by experience they know that he that doth neglect the same, is incontinent punished in the stréete without remission: and the respect they haue vnto him is such, that not one of what state or degrée soeuer he be, that dare mooue himself at such time as he doth passe by, neither crosse the stréetes (except it be some superior Iudge, vnto whom the inferiours doth the like reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence). If any man do offend therein, he is then straightwaies punished. In all matters of lawe as ciuill as criminall, the Iudges do nothing but by writing, and do pronounce the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and examine witnesses in publike, before all the rest of the officers, because no subtilty nor falshood shalbe vsed in their demaundes, neither in their writings, to set downe other then the truth. Euerie witnesse is examined by himselfe, and if he do double in his declaration, then do they ioyne together, and make their demaunde from one to an other, til by their striuing they may come to a better knowledge of the truth. But when by these meanes they cannot bring it to light, then doo they giue them torment, for to make them confesse: (beléeuing that without it such persons as haue experience and knowledge will tell the truth.)</p>
                  <p>In matters of great importance, and such as doo touch graue personages, the Iudge will not trust the scriuener or notarie to write any information: but they with their owne handes will write the declaration of any witnesse, and will consider verie much of that which is declared. This great diligence is the occasion that fewe times there is any that doth complaine of any ill iustice doone, the which is a great and notable vertue: and ought to be imitated of all good Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for to auoyd many inconueniences which doo happen for the not vsing the same, the which these Gentiles haue great care to performe: who beside the prosecution of right Iustice, without respect or exception of any person, do vse certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions worthie to be suffered.</p>
                  <p>First these Iudges in al cities &amp; townes of their iurisdiction, do number the housholds, and do repart them in ten and tenne housholds, &amp; vpon the tenth house they do hang a table or signe whereon is writen the names of those ten housholders with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the which generally they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded &amp; euery one by him selfe particular, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hauing any knowledg or notice
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3380:47"/>
that any of those ten housholders haue committed any trespasse or fault against any of the rest, or against himselfe, that is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto his neighbours or to the commonaltie, to go straight way &amp; giue the iustice to vnderstand thereof, that the fault may be punished with a mendment vnto the offender, &amp; an example to al other. And vnto him that doth know any such offence and wil not declare it, is allotted the same punishment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der should haue,<note place="margin">An occasion of amitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> which is the occasion that one neighbour hath a care of an other, &amp; liueth vnder feare, least they should giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to be complained of. And againe, that their enimies may not this way take any aduantage. When that any of these ten neighbours doth remooue into an other stréete or into any other citie or towne to dwell, or will make any long iorney, hee is bound to ring a bell, or play on a coper kettle amongest all the neighbours for the space of ten dayes before he doth remooue or depart, and to aduise them all of his departure, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for that if he do owe any thing, or any thing be lent, that they may come and demaund it before their departure, because that none shall loose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is theirs. And if it so fall out that any shall depart without vsing this diligence, the Iustice doth compell the rest of his neighbours y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are written on the signe, to pay his debt, because they did not aduise the Iustice or his creditors before his departure.

The tormentes on the hands is giuen with two stickes as bigge as two fingers, and a span long, turned round, and full of hooles in all places, wherin are put cordes to pull in &amp; out: their fingers of both their hands are put into the cordes,<note place="margin">Cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</note> and little and little they do pinch them till in the end they do breake them at the iointes with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible paine vnto them that doo suffer it, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> causeth them to giue great shrikes and groanes that will mooue any man to compassion.

This (as it is said) none can do without the consent of the king.</p>
                  <p>And because they should execute their office the better in this visitation, and with Iustice and equitie, they do make them to sweare to be loyall,<note place="margin">Ceremonies in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their oth.</note> true and secret.

                  <p>EUen as the iudges and ministers are seuere and cruell in punishing, euen so they are in putting them in prisons, the which are as terrible and as cruell, with the which they doo kéepe in peace and iustice this mightie kingdome: and as there is much people, so haue they many prisons and verie great. There are in euery principal citie throughout al these prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thirtéene prisons inclosed &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed about with high wals,<note place="margin">Thirteene prisons in euery great cittie.</note> and of so great largenesse within, that besides the lodgings of the kéeper and his officers, and for a garison of souldiours that are there continually: there are fish ponds, gardeines &amp; courts, whereas the prisoners do walke and recreate themselues all the day, such as are in for small matters. Likewise there are victualling houses and shops,<note place="margin">Uictualing houses in the prisons and shops.</note> whereas is solde all manner of such things as the prisoners doo make for to sustaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: which if they did not vse, their whole substance were not sufficient for their maintenance, the time is so long that they lie there, although it be for a small matter: the occasion is for that the iudges take deliberation in their sentences: and againe their cities are great and ful of other matters. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are slowe in the execution of any sentence. So that many times it doth fall out, that men being condemned to die, doo remaine so long in prison after their condemnation, that they die with pure age, or some other sicknesse or infirmitie, or by the crueltie of the straight and asper prison. Of these thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene prisons aforesaide: alwayes foure of them are occupied with prisoners condemned vnto death, and in euerie one of them there is a captaine ouer one hundred souldiers which are reparted, and dooth kéepe watch and warde day and night: euery one of these condemned prisoners hath a bord tied about his necke that hangeth downe vnto his knées, a third of a yarde brode: it is made white with a certaine whiting, and written vpon it the occasion wherefore he was condemned to die. The kéeper of the prison hath a booke, wherein is written all the names of them that are condemned, and the occasion whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3380:50"/>
shalbe demaunded of him by the iudges or vizroies. They are shakled and manakled, and put in wards that do answere into the court, whereas the officers of the prison do make them to lie with their face downewarde vppon a floore made of bords for the same purpose, and do draw ouer them iron chaines, drawne through great iron rings that are placed betwixt prisoner and prisoner, wherewith they are so strait crushed that they cannot moue nor turne them from one side to another: also they doo lay on them a certaine couering of timber, wherein remaineth no more space of hollownesse, then their bodies doth make: thus are they vsed that are condemned to death. This prison is so painefull and grieuous, that many doo dispaire and kill themselues, because they cannot suffer it. In the day time they do take them forth and take off their manacles, that they may worke for to sustaine themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all such as haue nothing to maintaine themselues, nor any other that wil help them, them the king dooth giue a pittance of rice to sustaine them. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they do worke what they may to better the same.</p>
                  <p>There is neuer no execution done vpon such as are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die, but at the comming of the visiters or iudges of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whom they do call <hi>Chenes</hi> and <hi>Leuchis,</hi> the which do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> make their visitation in secret (as you doo vnderstande in the chapter where I spake of them) These doe visite the prisoners and demaund a note of the names of all them that are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the cause wherefore: and although that some of their sentences are confirmed by the king and his counsell, yet they will sée them againe in the presence of these iudges that did condemne them, or such as did gouerne in their absence, for to be informed of them the faults of euerie one: whereby he may sée and vnderstand whether his sentence of condemnation bee done with iustice or not. This diligence being done, they doo choose out among them fiftie condemned men, such whose faults are most odious, and commande the iayler to put all things in order for to doo execution on them: the which being done, they do examine them a new, and looke vpon the causes and faults, to see if by any meanes they can saue them. And if they do finde in any of them any iot of discharge, they do apart them from the rest, and straightwayes command three pieces of ordinance to be shot off, which is to giue warning to bring
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3380:50"/>
forth them that shalbe executed. Then againe, when they doo bring them forth, they doo a new enter in counsell, to sée if they can saue any of them: and when not, they command other three péeces of ordinance to be shot off, to cause them to be brought out into the fielde, and yet before they do breake vp their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, they doo turne and sée once againe all their faults, to sée if that by any meanes possible there might bee some remedie to saue them. If they do finde any, or any suspect of indicion, they do returne out of the field that person, and sende him againe to the prison. Some doo returne with an euill will, for that they had rather die at once, then for to suffer the straightnes and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of the prison: In the meane time while they are perusing their causes, and concluding the same, they do cause these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned prisoners to sit vpon heaps of ashes, and do giue them to eate. So when all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these diligences are concluded, and they can finde no remedy to saue any of them according vnto iustice, they doo commande thrée péeces of artilery more bee shot off, then do they execute iustice according vnto their sentence giuen them.</p>
                  <p>The deathes that they do execute is hanging, setting vppon stakes, quartering and burning: but there is none that is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but such as are traitors to the king. When the last thrée of artilerie is shot off, then the belles do ring, and a great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is in the cittie, for that this execution is done but seldome. The day of execution all their shops are shut in, and there is none that doth worke vntill sun be set, which is after that the executed men are buried, the which is done with the companie of much people. The next day after this is done, the visitors do make the second visitation, which is of the théeues (a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much abhorred amongst them: and such as they doo finde culpable, hee is whipped throughout the common stréetes with great shame, with a borde hanging about his necke (as aforesaide) whereon is written his fault: and therewith they are carried throughout the stréetes thrée or foure dayes. They do beate them on the calues of their legges, with a broade and thicke cane of foure fingers broad, and as thicke as a mans fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the which they do lay in water before, the more for to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them: they are bound with their hands behind them, and their faces downewards to the earth: two hangmen do execute

this whipping of them, the one at one legge and the other at the other, and it is done with so great crueltie, that after they haue giuen sixe blowes, they cannot stande vppon their féete: and many times it chanceth that with fiftie blowes they die. The most part of these théeues do die in the punishments, and many times there is whipped togither of théeues two hundred. So that with these and others that are punished in the prisons (is of a verie truth) that there do die euerie yeare in one of these principall cities of the prouince, more then sixe thousande per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.

Now vnto the first: You shall finde verie fewe in this kingdome but can both write and reade, yet haue they not the Alphabet of letters as we haue, but all that they doe write is by figures, and they are long in learning of it, and with great difficultie, for that almost euery word hath his character. They do signifie the heauen, which they do call <hi>Guant,</hi> by one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter alone, which is this <figure/>: the king whom they doo call <hi>Bontax</hi> by this <figure/> and by consequent the earth,<note place="margin">Sixe thosand characters in writing.</note> the sea, and the rest of the elements. They do vse more then sixe thousande characters different the one from the other: and they doo write them verie swiftly (as it

hath béene séene many times at the <hi>Philippinas,</hi> by manie <hi>Chinos</hi> that are there, and come thither daily) it is a kinde of language that is better vnderstood in writing then in speaking (as the Hebrue toongue) by reason of the certaine distinction of points that is in euery character differing the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other which in speaking cannot be distinguished so easilie. Their order of writing is cleane contrarie vnto ours, for that they doo beginne their lines from aboue downewards, but in verie good order: Likewise they begin their lines at the right hande and write towards the left, contrarie vnto vs. They kéepe the verie same order in their printing as you shall vnderstande: and as may be séene this day at Rome in the Librarie of the sacred Pallace. And likewise in that which king Philip hath caused to be erected in the monasterie of saint Laurence the royall, and also in other places: in this order as I haue saide, and of their characters to the which I referre me, it is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thing to consider how that in that kingdome they doo speake manie languages, the one differing from the other: yet generallie in writing they doo vnderstand one the other, &amp; in speaking not. The occasion is, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one figure or character vnto them all doth signifie one thing, although in the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing there is difference in the vowels.

                  <p>The king hath in euerie citie colledges or schooles at his owne cost, in the which they doo learne to write, read &amp; count, as well as to studie, naturall or morall philosophie, Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, lawes of the countrie, or any other curious science.

They doo make them Gentlemen, if they bée capable of anie charge of iustice or gouernement.

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3380:53"/>
amongst them is vnderstoode to bee made a gentleman, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs is a doctour.</p>
                  <p>The day appointed being come, they are all presented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the visitour, who taketh all their names in a scrowle, and appointeth another day for their examination. This day for honour of the feast, the visitor dooth inuite all the learned <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias</hi> that are in the citie, who ioyntly with him do make the examination with great rigour, alwayes putting forwardes and preferring those that are skilfull in the lawes of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, by which they do gouerne all other faculties whatsoeuer, and that they be therewithall good, and vertuous. And all those that they doo finde with these properties, they do write their names in an other scrowle, and doo appoint the day of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, the which is done with great ceremonies and much people, in whose presence, the visitor in the name of the king, doth giue vnto them the ensignes of degrée and dignitie to be a <hi>Loytia,</hi> that is a waste or girdle bossed with gold or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and a hat with certaine thinges on it, as shall be shewed you in the chapter following: which is a signe and token that doth make the difference from the vulgar people: without the which none can shewe himselfe in publike.</p>
                  <p>And although al be called <hi>Loytias,</hi> I meane, those that come to it by letters or learning, and others by the warres, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by a gift of the king, yet they differ the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in estimation. For that those of the royall counsell, vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes, gouernors, and visitors, are made <hi>Loytias</hi> by disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in learning. And the generall Captaines, Maiors, Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifes and Testators, are a gift of the kinges in recompence of some good seruice that they haue done. These haue no more preheminence, but onely that they haue the benefite of their priuileges, and haue the dignitie of that vocation, but these are neuer preferred to greater honours, as the other <hi>Loytias</hi> are, of these you haue in euery citie very many.</p>
                  <p>There be others likewise of great estimation, and are put in the second degrée, and are those that are made by desert in the warres, and are elect and chosen by the generals, by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the king for some act or worthie déede done in the wars by force of armes or such like, approued by witnesse of great credite: vnto whom besides the title and honour giuen vnto

them, they doo giue them great liuings, for that no valiant or worthie déede but is had in estimation, and gratified with great liberalitie,<note place="margin">Any good thing grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> which is the occasion that those which are meane souldiors, are animated to imitate those that be most principall and valiant. According vnto my promise I will here with as much breuitie as may bee, declare vnto you the order of their commencements, and how they do accompanie them after that they are made <hi>Loytias,</hi> for that it is a thing worth the hearing.</p>
                  <p>The day appointed being come, for to commence or giue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, all the <hi>Loytias</hi> with the visitor, doo enter into the royall hall, whereas they were examined, al richly apparelled,<note place="margin">The order of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement in schooles.</note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assembled, then do enter in al those that shal receiue degrées, galantly apparelled without any vpper garment, and before e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of them, go the Padrines, and after them the Gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates with garments very finely made, riding on Gennets very sumptuously couered with cloth of gold and silke, that do carie the ensignes that shalbe giuen vnto him, the which hee dooth demande of the visitor knéeling vpon his knées with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.

                  <p>This oth being taken, the visitor, who presenteth the kings person, dooth put on them the ensignes aforesaide, with the facultie belonging thereunto, and then hée and all the <hi>Loytias</hi> imbrace them presently. This doone, they depart out of the hal in verie decent order, at which instant all the belles in the citie are rong, and great store of ordinance and artilerie discharged, which continueth a good space. Then they carrie these newe <hi>Loytias</hi> throughout the citie, accompanied with a multitude of people in manner following.</p>
                  <p>There go first before them, many souldiers, marching in good order with drommes and trompets and other musicall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments verie melodious: after them are borne many Maces, then follow all the <hi>Loytias,</hi> some on horsebacke and some are carried in litter chaires, in most gallant order, after which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

And the better sort doo celebrate three or foure daies after, banquetting the newe made <hi>Loytia,</hi> and giuing him ioy of his newe preferment, euerie man seeking his good will and fauour. From this day forwards hée is of abilitie to take vppon him any office and gouernement whatsoeuer: and therefore straight wayes he goeth vnto the court, to procure the same, and carrieth with him the ensignes of his commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is apparelled so that he may be knowne, wherefore they doo him great honour in the way as hee goeth, and lodge him in such houses as the king hath appointed in euerie towne for such as they be. When he commeth to the court, hee goeth and dooth his duetie vnto the president and vnto the rest of the royall counsell, who euerie one a part, doo giue him ioy of his new dignitie, and with many words of great curtesie &amp; praise, promise him, as occasion shall serue to prouide him a place, as they by their examination doo vnderstande his abilitie, and againe as they see his discréete dealing and care in such matters as they do giue him in charge, so will they preferre him to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dignitie and honour.

                  <p>AMongst many things worthie to bée considered (which haue béene and shalbe declared in this historie, &amp; amongst manie other which of purpose I omit, because I would not be tedious vnto the reader, no one thing did cause so much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion vnto the Portugals, when that they did first traficke in <hi>Canton,</hi> neither vnto our Spaniards, who long time after went vnto the <hi>Philippinas</hi>: as to finde in this kingdome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilerie. And wee finde by good account taken out of their histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that they had the vse thereof long time before vs in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. It is said that the first beginning was in the yeare 1330. by the industrie of an Almane, yet howe he was called there is no historie that dooth make mention:<note place="margin">The first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of armor.</note> but the <hi>Chinos</hi> saie and it is euidently séene, that this Almaine dooth not deserue the name of the first inuentor, but of the discouerer, for that they were the first inuentors, and from them hath the vse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of béene transported vnto other kingdomes, where it is nowe vsed.

                  <p>Such Artilerie as the Frier <hi>Gerrada,</hi> and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did sée at their being there, they say it was of antiquitie, and very ill wrought, and was for the most part péeces to shoote stones, or murderers: but it was giuen them to vnderstande that in other prouinces of the kingdome, there be that bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie curiouslie wrought and faire: which may bée of such which the Captaine <hi>Artieda</hi> did sée: who in a letter that hee wrote vnto king Phillip, giuing him to vnderstande of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creats of this countrie, amongst which hee saide, the <hi>Chinos</hi> doo vse all armour as wee doo, and the artilerie which they haue is excellent good. I am of that opinion, for that I haue séene vessels there of huge greatnesse, and better made then ours, and more stronger.</p>
                  <p>In euerie Citie they haue certaine houses where they make their ordinance, and artilerie continuallie: they doo not plant them on Castles (for that they haue not the vse of them in all the kingdome) but vppon the gates of their cities, which hath mightie great and thicke walles, and déepe ditches, which they doo fill with water out of the next riuer at all times when néede requireth, which they account the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test strength in all the kingdome.

                  <p>THe admirable inuention, and the subtill ingenie of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is such, that for lacke of the vse thereof, should haue béene forgotten the worthinesse of manie excellent men, and of their déedes doone in the happie daies and times long past: and manie in these our daies woulde not trouble themselues so much as they doo, in learning to get honour and promotion, or in feates of warres, if that their fame should no longer continue in writing then their liues on the earth. Leauing apart the woonderfull effectes of this subtile inuention, least speaking thereof I shoulde be ouer tedious, I will heere onelie goe about to prooue that which this Chapter dooth propounde, with some ensamples, whereof manie are found in their histories, and likewise in ours. It doth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeare by the vulgar opinion, that the inuention of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting did beginne in Europe in the yeare 1458. the which was attributed vnto Toscan called Iohn <hi>Cutembergo</hi>: and it was saide of trueth, that the first mould wherewith they doo print was made in <hi>Maguncia,</hi> from whence an Almaine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Conrado</hi> did bring the same inuention into Italie: And the first booke that was printed, was that which saint Austine did write, intituled <hi>De ciuitate Dei</hi>: wherein manie au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors agrée. But the <hi>Chinos</hi> doo affirme, that the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was in their countrie, and the inuentour was a man, whome they reuerence for a saint: whereby it is euident that manie yeares after that they had the vse therof, it was brought into Almaine by the way of <hi>Ruscia</hi> and <hi>Moscouia,</hi> from whence, as it is certaine, they may come by lande, and that some merchants that came from thence into this kingdome, by the redde sea, and from <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> might bring some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3380:56"/>
from them vnto vs: and for the better credite heereof, at this day there are found amongst them many bookes printed 500. yeares before the inuention began in Almanie: of the which I haue one, and I haue séene others, as well in Spaine and in Italie as in the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Frier <hi>Herrada</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, when they came from the <hi>China</hi> vnto the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> did bring with them manie printed bookes of diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which they did buy in the Citie of <hi>Aucheo,</hi> the which were printed in diuers places of the kingdome. Yet the most part of them were printed in the prouince of <hi>Ochian,</hi> whereas is the best print: and as they did report they woulde haue brought a great number more, if that the vizroy had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed them, for they haue great libraries, and very good cheape, but hée suspected that those bookes might be a meane to giue them to vnderstande the secrets of their kingdome, the which they doo indeuour to kéepe close from strangers. The vizroy vsed a policie, and sent them word, how that he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, that they went about buying of bookes for to carry them into their countrie, and howe they shoulde not spende their many on them, for hée woulde giue them for nothing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie bookes as they woulde haue, which afterward hée did not performe, possible for the reason aforesaide, or else he did forget his promise,</p>
                  <p>At such time as this commandement came vnto them, they had bought a good number, out of the which are taken the most things that wée haue put in this small historie, for to giue a briefe notice of them, and of that kingdome till such time as by a true certificate the experience of manie shall cause more credite thereunto: for that vnto this day, by reason of the small notice wée haue, we cannot with so great authoritie make it so credible, as wee hope that time hereafter will doo.

                  <head>CHAP. XVIII. The order that these Chinos obserue in making bankets, and in celebrating their festiuall daies.</head>
                  <p>FOr that in some parts of this historie wee haue touched the bankets that the <hi>Chinos</hi> do make, it shall not bee amisse to declare here the order they vse therein, for that they are curious, and differ verie much from our order and vse in their banquetting, the which we haue perceiued as well by their fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as by many other thinges.</p>
                  <p>Amongest these <hi>Chinos,</hi> more than amongest any other people of the world, are vsed bankets and feastes, for they are rich and without care, and also without the light of heauen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they do confesse and beléeue the immortalitie of the soule, and the rewarde or punishment in an other worlde, according vnto their workes in this life (as we haue saide,) all that euer they can, they doo giue themselues vnto the contentment of the flesh, and vnto all maner pastimes, wherein they liue most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately, and in verie good order. Their custome is, although
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3380:58"/>
they haue a hundred guestes, yet euerie one must sit and eate at a table by himselfe. Their tables be verie fine, gilt and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted full of birdes and beastes, and other varieties verie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant vnto the eye. They doo not vse to put table clothes on them: but onely a forefront of damaske, or some other silke on euerie one of them, which hangeth downe to the ground, and on the foure corners they doo sette manie little baskettes curiously wrought with golde and siluer wyer, full of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and knackes of sugar, made with great curiositie, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefantes, grayhoundes, hares, and all other kinde of beastes and foules, gylt and painted: in the middest of the table they doo sette the victualles in maruelous good order, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lesh of diuerse sortes, fowle, and fishes: of the which they make diuerse manners of brothes passing well dressed, and are serued in fine earthen dishes of great curiositie and of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, (although these they vse verie seeldome, except for the viceroyes:) they haue no neede of table clothes nor napkins, for they eate so delicately, that they doo not touch the meate with their handes, but with little forkes of golde or siluer, with the which they eate so cleanly, that although it be verie small that they eate, yet will they let nothing fall: they drinke often, but a little at a time, and therefore they vse verie little cuppes.</p>
                  <p>At these bankettes and feastes, there are present alwayes women gesters, who doo play and sing, vsing manie prettie gestes to cause delight, and make mirth to the guestes: besides these they haue diuerse sortes of men with other instruments, as tomblers and players, who doo represent their Comedies verie perfectly and naturally: in these bankets they spende the greatest part of the day, by reason of so manie diuersities of meates that they serue in. They passe many times a hundreth sundrie dishes, when that the estate of the person that is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or of him that maketh the banket dooth require. As may shew the report of the Augustine Fryers in the beginning of the second part of this historie: where one doth tell of bankets that were made him by the <hi>Insuanto,</hi> a Gouernor of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> and the Uiceroy of <hi>Aucheo,</hi> and of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant deuises they had to driue away the time so long as the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket lasted. Unto euerie one of their guestes they doo set a table,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3380:58"/>
euerie table standing one along by an other, making a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the number of them according vnto the qualitie of the persons: vpon the first table (where sitteth he that is inuited) they set the victual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es readie dressed, swéete meates, or march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panes, which is the last seruice: and on the rest, although they be twentie, they set great store of diuerse kindes of meates, all rawe, as capons, duckes, teales, hennes, peeces of salt &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemas biefe, gammons of bacon, and many other thinges. All these doo remaine vppon the tables till the banket be ended, and the guestes departed: then doo the seruantes of him that made the banket, take all these rawe meates, and carrie them before their guestes till they come vnto their houses or lodges, where they doo leaue it with great ceremonies. When they do make any banket to a viceroy or to any Embassadour, it is with so great cost and sumptuousnes that they spend a great substance therein. These bankets do commonly indure twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie daies together, continuing vntill the last day as royally and as plentifully as at the first day.</p>
                  <p>They do celebrate all their festiual dayes in the night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is ordinarily their newe moones, and they doo solemnise them with much musicke, and newe inuentions. But more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly they doo celebrate the first day of the yeare, which is after their account, the first day of the moneth of March: on this day they apparell themselues verie costlye and sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouslie, both men and women, and doo adorne themselues with all their iewelles and newe toyes, and doo hang their houses and doores, with carpettes and clothes of silke and cloth of golde, and dresse them vppe trimme with Roses, and other flowers, for at that time there is great store in that Countrey: likewise they doo sette at all their doores great trées, on the which they doo hang manye lightes, and all the triumphall arckes that bee in the streetes (which bee verye manie as wee haue sayde) are decked with bowes this day: wherein they put manie lightes, and set full of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napies of cloth of gold, damaske, and manie other sundrie sorts of sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Their Priestes doo assist them in these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eastes very richly apparelled, and doo offer sacrifice vpon their altars vnto the heauen, and vnto their idolles, and they sing many songes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:3380:59"/>This day dooth all people generally sport themselues with great singing and sounding of instruments, in the which they are very cunning. Such instruments as the Augustine fryers did sée, were lutes, gytternes, vyalles, rebbukes, wayghtes, virginalles, harpes and flutes, and other instrumentes which we doo vse, although they doo differ something in the fashion of them, but yet easie to be knowen. They do tune their voyces vnto their instrumentes with great admiration: they haue all commonly very good voyces. In these feasts they do make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny representations of great pastime according vnto nature, with vestimentes that they haue for the purpose. All the dayes that these feastes do indure, their tables be full of diuerse sorts of meates, as well of fish as of flesh, and of all sortes of fruites, and excellent good wine, the which they make of the palme trée with certaine mixtures, which maketh it haue an excellent good taste. All the day they and their Priestes do eate &amp; drinke so much till they can no more. They haue it for a thing most certaine amongest them, that looke how they are in disposition that day, so shall they passe the whole yeare, eyther sorrowfull or merrie. I omit the feastes which they make at mariages, and at any good successe, though they be in great number and very sumptuous, because I would not be tedious: in all things they couet to auoyde melancholy.</p>

                     </gap>, that they haue bookes to teach them only how they should behaue themselues in making difference of persons. Of all the which, such as shall séeme expedient to giue notice of, I will declare in this chapter, vsing therein the breuitie that this historie requireth.</p>
                  <p>They estéeme it a great discourtes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, not to salute one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they sée or meete one an other, although the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance betwixt them be but small.</p>
                  <p>The salutation that the common people do vse, is when they do meete the one with the other, to shut the left hande, and to couer it with the right, ioyning therewith their breastes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with much bowing their heades downewardes, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that loue and amitie is as firme betwéene them as their handes are fast. And that their friendshippe is not alonely in the ceremonie but also in the heart: the which they giue them to vnderstande by woordes, at the same time. But amongest Courtyers and Gentlemen they vse an other manner of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, which seemeth vnto them of much more curiositie, that is: at such time as they doo meete, they make a little staye, then they cast abroad their armes, and claspe their fingers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether remayning in compasse, humbling themselues manie times and contending one with an other about their parting for to prosecute his waye, and the higher estate they are of, the more is their contention. When that anie meane person doth meete with a principall man, who for dignitie or for any other occasion dooth acknowledge superioritie, straight wayes hee dooth stay with great silence, declining his head till such time as he is past by, although the most part of them dooth it more for feare than for courtesie: for that experience hath taught them, that he that dooth it not, is straightwayes puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and whipped cruelly.</p>
                  <p>When that any of these commeth to speake with any <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> at the entring in at the hall whereas he is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hee knéeleth downe, declyning his head and looking vpon the ground: and on this sort he goeth vpon his knees till hee come into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the hall, and there he stayeth and declareth his petition by worde of mouth with an humble and méeke voyce, or else presenteth it by writing: and hauing receiued aunswere, hee dooth returne on his knées backwardes without turning his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3380:60"/>
backe to the <hi>Loytia</hi> vntill hee bee quite out of the hall. And if they which do méete or visite one an other be equall in dignity, they shew great courtesie on both sides, contending who shall surpasse in courtesie and wordes: wherein they are verie cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious. When one doth goe to visite an other, he that is visited, after the visitation done, doth bring the other vnto the stréete doore. This custome is vsed most amongest the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people being equall in degrée, or differing little. Likewise they vse one thing verie strange, and neuer heard of amongest other nations, that is: if that one doo come out of the countrie to visite an other that is in the citie or towne (although he be a nigh kinsman and long time acquainted) if that knocking at the doore or in the stréete hee doo meete with him whome he dooth come to visite (hee beeing not well apparelled) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he speake vnto him,<note place="margin">A strange kind of cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tesie.</note> yet will hee not make any aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere nor any resemblance that euer he sawe or knewe him before: but straightwayes returneth home to his house in all ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>te possible, and doth apparell him selfe with the best appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell that he hath, and then he goeth foorth and receiueth his guest and friend, dissembling as though he had not before méete nor séene him.</p>
                  <p>This Ceremonie amongest them is infalliblie kept, for that it is amongest them an auncient tradition and founded vppon their religion. They giue great intertainement vnto their guestes, and make them straightwayes a beuer or collation with manie sortes of conserues and fruites, and good wine, and an other kinde of drinke that is generally vsed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough out the whole kingdome, and is made of diuerse physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hearbes good to comfort the heart, the which they warme when they drinke thereof.</p>
                  <p>These Ceremonies they vse when that one neighbour dooth visite an other. But when that one of the Towne dooth meete with a stranger that hee dooth knowe and hath beene in the towne certaine dayes, and he not séene him: then hee of the towne dooth aske of the other if that hee hath eaten any thing, if he aunswere no: he dooth by and by without any delay, carrie him to the next victualling house, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee dooth banket him deliciously: for in euerie towne, there is good opportunitie for the same, by reason that in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3380:60"/>
the market places and stréetes, and in the suburbes there is great store of victualling houses, that doo kéepe tabling ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly, and for little cost: for there (as we haue sayde) all kinde of victualles are verie good cheape. But if the stranger dooth aunswere that he hath eaten, then dooth the Citizen or townesman, carrie him to an other kinde of vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualing houses, where are to be had all sortes of conserues and iunkettes, fruites and marchpanes, and there dooth hee make him a banket with great loue and good will. Of the women as well strangers as towneborne, or of what degrée soeuer, they haue great respect, but especially of the married women: vnto whome if any man giue an ill or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest woorde, he is accounted infamous: and likewise if he doo not offer to them courtesie, and giue them place or way when they passe the stréetes, which is seeldome séene. But when they doo passe, they behaue themselues so discreetly that they giue no occasion that anye shoulde misuse them: to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes strangers they vse verye great courtesie: but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the principallest: as you shall perceiue in the relation of the seconde part of this historie, where it shall be declared by experience.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XX. Of the great closenesse that the women of this kingdome do liue in, and with what condition they permit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon women.</head>
                  <p>THe principall intent that this king &amp; his gouernors haue, as is gathered by their lawes, is to preserue their common weale from vices: for the which he dooth set downe great penalties, &amp; executeth the same without any remission, and least any should offend they vse great vigilancie: and do iudge that the libertie and dishonestie of the women is most preiudiciall thereunto, &amp; is the occasion that their common wealth falleth to decay, being neuer so well gouerned: therefore they haue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained many preseruatiues and remedies by their lawes &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes to preuent the same, which is the only occasion (that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is so long since this kingdome first began, and againe being so great as you may vnderstande,) yet in this one point
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3380:61"/>
there is lesse inconuenience or preiudice than in any other countrey of lesse antiquitie and fewer people. So that a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest woman is knowen by name, although it be in a great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the which is seldome séene, and a rare thing. And the best way they haue to preuent this, is: that all people that haue daughters are commaunded by expresse order, that they shall bring them vp (after they haue the vse of reason) in their owne houses very close, and not be seene, but alwayes to doo some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to auoide idlenesse, for that it is the mother of all vices, whereby it may take no roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in them. This lawe dooth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende married women, and is kept in such sort, that the wiues of the viceroyes and gouernours do obserue it, yea they say that the Quéenes themselues doo obserue it: and that they are alwayes spinning golde, silke or flaxe, or doing some other exercise with their handes, esteeming all idle persons woorthie to be hated and contemned: so that the children being brought vp in this manner, seeing the good example of their mothers, is the occasion that this vertuous exercise worthie to be imitated, is conuerted vnto a dayly and perpetuall custome, in such sort, that they thinke it a perpetuall torment to commaunde them to be idle. These ordinarie and voluntarie exercises haue the women of this kingdome in such sort, that it is newes and a strange thing to meete a woman in the streetes of any citie or towne, neither at the windowes, which is a signe that they liue honest. If it so fall out that of force they must go abroad, as to the buriall of parents and kinsfolkes, or to visite any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sicke, or vpon any like occasion, then are they carried in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit tendering the conseruation of this honest crewe, and to eschewe greater euils in the common wealth, they permit common women as a necessarie thing: yet they do allowe them in such sort, that their euill example may not be hurtfull vnto the honest state of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which liue chast. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do build for them houses out of the cities and townes in the suburbes, giuing them straight commandement there to remaine in the said houses, &amp; not to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THere is in this kingdome a great number of shippes and barkes, with the which they sayle all a long their coastes, and vnto Ilandes neere hande, and into their riuers, the which doo runne cleane through the most part of all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces: and there dwelleth so much people vpon these riuers in shippes and barkes, that it séemeth to be some great Citie,

there is so many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they do esteeme that there is almost as many people that dwell vpon the water, as vpon the lande.</p>
                  <p>They make them slightly and with small cost, for they haue in all partes of this countrie great aboundance of tymber, iron, and other thinges necessarie for this vse: but in especiall a kinde of glew, wherewith they doo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They vse their shippes and barkes of many fashions, euery one hath his proper name. Such ships as they haue to saile long voiages be called, <hi>Iuncos</hi> but for the warre they make huge &amp; mightie vessels, with high castles, both on the prowe and sterne, much after the fashion of them that come out of the Easterne seas, and vnto those with which the Portingales sayle into the east <hi>India.</hi> They haue these in so great number, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a generall may ioine together in 4. dayes an armie of more than 600.

Of these two last sorts of ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels pirates &amp; rouers at the sea do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vse (for in those seas there be very many) for that they be very nimble to fly &amp; to giue assalt as occasion doth serue.

Many other sorts of barks they haue, besides the aforesaid, some with galleries &amp; windows
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3380:63"/>
painted and gylt, but chiefely those which the Uiceroyes and Gouernours doo make for their recreation. Of those sortes of shipping afore sayd, which they call <hi>Iuncos,</hi> the king hath in al his prouinces great armies, and in them souldiers with their Captaines to defend the coastes, that as well all ships of their owne Countrie, as those that doo come from other places to traficke with them, may goe and come in safetie, and not bee spoyled and robbed of the roauers that be there abouts. In the riuers there are pynases well equipped appointed for the same purpose. And the king doth out of his rentes pay all these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie souldiers, and that with great liberalitie.</p>
                  <p>The pitch wherewith they doo trimme their shippes (as we haue sayde) is founde in that kingdome in great aboundance, it is called in their language, <hi>Iapez</hi>: and is made of lyme, oyle of fish, and a paste which they call <hi>Vname</hi>: it is verie strong and suffereth no wormes, which is the occasion that one of their shippes dooth twise out last one of ours: yet dooth it hinder much their sayling. The pumpes which they haue in their shippes are much differing from ours, and are farre better: they make them of many péeces, with a whéele to draw water, which whéele is set along the shippes sides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, wherewith they do easily clense their shippes, for that one man alone going in the wheele, doth in a quarter of an houre, cleanse a great shippe, although she leake verie much.</p>
                  <p>Many men be borne and brought vp in these shippes and barkes (as is aforesayde) and neuer in all their liues haue béene on lande, and doo knowe none other occupation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to liue, but that which they doo inherite of their fathers, which is to goe in one of these shippes or barkes, carrying and recarrying of merchandise from place to place, or to ferrie people ouer the riuers. They haue in them their wiues &amp; their children, and haue like neighborhood amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the riuers, as in their cities and townes, of whom they stand in little néed for they do bring vp within their ships all things necessarie for their sustenance, as hens, duckes, pigeons, and other foules good to be eaten: and if they do lacke any thing, they haue it in victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aling houses &amp; shops which they haue amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the same riuers in great abundance: and of other superfluous thinges such as may bee founde in a citie, they are well furnished:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3380:63"/>
as of many sorts of silkes, amber and muske, and other things more curious then needefull. They haue also in their shippes, pots with little orange trées and other fruits, and gardins with flowers, and other herbes for their recreation, and in the wide shippes pooles of water, wherein they haue great store of fish aliue, and yet doo dayly fishe for more with nettes. This kingdome is the best prouided of fish of any that is knowen, by reason of the great number of these barkes, as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue many fisher men at Sea and in the riuers, that continually fish with nettes, and other engines for the same purpose: and doo carrie the same fishe (in infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) aliue into their pooles fiue hundreth leagues vp into the lande by the riuers, which they doo with great ease in shifting the water euerie day, and doo féede them with thinges fit for the nature of the fish.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe and principallest time of fishing in this countrie, is in three moneths of the yeare, which is, Februarie, March, and Aprill, at such time as are the spring tides, which do bring the fish out of the mayne sea into the riuers, and there they do spawne and leaue their young: then these fisher men, who doo liue by that facultie, doo take them, and put them into their pondes, and féede and nourish them in the ships till they come to bignesse to be solde.</p>
                  <p>Unto these fishermen repayre many barkes, from diuerse partes of the Countrie to buye their fishe, and doo bringe with them wicker baskets lyned with a certaine thicke pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that purpose, and annoynted with oyle, so that the water can not goe out: wherein they doo put their fish, and do shift them euerie day, and feede them as aforesaide. All people doo buye of this fish, although they bee verie small and leane, and doo put them in their pondes which euerie one hath in his house (as common vse in all that countrie is) whereas in a small time they waxe great, fitte to be eaten. They doo féede them with a paste made of cowes doung, buffes doung, and pigins doong.</p>
                  <p>Likewise they doo throwe of these small fishes into the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These Gouernors and Iudges doo vse much to recreate themselues vppon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and haue for the same purpose barkes made close, &amp; cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in them verie curiously wrought, with windowes and galleries likewise hanged with rich clothes, and many other thinges for their contentment and pleasure.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXII. A curious order that these Chinos haue to bring vp ducks in great abundance, and with small cost: and of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and ingenious order of fishing which they vse.</head>
                  <p>THe great number of people that is in this countrie, and not permitting any idle people to liue therein, is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that it doth stirre vp the wits of poore men (being constrained thereunto by necessitie, the inuenter of manye thinges) to séeke new inuentions to get their liuing, to relieue and supply their necessities. So that many of this kingdome, séeing the whole countrie so throughly inhabited &amp; tilled, that there is not one foote without an owner, they do take them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the riuers, (which are verie great) and there they do make their dwellinges in ships and barkes (as is aforesaide,) where they haue their whole families vnder borde to defende them from the sunne and rayne, and inclinations of the heauens. There they do vse the occupation that they do knowe, or that which they did inherite of their father, and many misteries to liue by, verie strange: whereof the most principall is to bring vp in some of their barkes so great quantitie of duckes, that they sustaine a great part of the countrey therewith, and the vse thereof is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>They haue cages made of canes so bigge as the vpper most holde of the barke, in the which may be foure thousand duckes at once. They haue in certaine places of these cages made nestes where these duckes do almost euerie day laye egges, the which they take: and if it be in the sommer they doo put them in buffes doong, or in the doong of those duckes, which is verie warme, where they leaue them so many dayes, as experience hath taught them, that they will come foorth. Then they doo take them out of the doong, and do breake them one by one and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3380:64"/>
take a little ducklin, the which they do with so great cunning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that almost none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth perish, which is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which causeth great admiration vnto some that go to sée it: although they bée but few, for that it is an auncient custome vsed of long time in that countrie. And for to haue the fruition of this benefite all the yeare, in the winter they must vse an artificiall helpe to giue a little warmenes vnto the doong for the bringing forth of their egs, they do vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ingenious as the first, &amp; that is this: they take a great number of canes tied one by another, whereon they do laye the doong, then vppon that they doo lay their egges, and do couer them verie well with the same: this being done they put vnder the canes, straw, or some other like thing, and set it on fire, but in such sort that it dooth not burne, but kéepeth a naturall heat, all the time till they thinke that they are readie to be taken out. Then doo they take and breake them, as aforesaide, so that their pultrie dooth increase in such number as though they were antes. Then doo they put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into an other cage for the same purpose, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as be old duckes brought vp for no other purpose, but to couer the little ones vnder their winges and kéepe them warme: and there they doo féede them euery day till such time as they can féede themselues, and go abroad into the fieldes to profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the companie of the olde duckes. Many times they haue in number aboue twentie thousand, yet do they maintain them with a small-cost, and it is in this order: euerie morning they do giue them a small quantitie of boyled rice, then do they open a doore of the cage, which is towardes the riuer, and doo put a bridge of canes that doth reach vnto the water: then doo they come foorth with so great haste one vpon an other, that it is a pastime to sée them. All the day after they do passe the time vpon the water, and in the fieldes of rice vpon the land, wheras they do féede: the owners of the rice doo giue vnto the owners of the duckes somewhat to let their duckes go into their fields, for that they do destroy all the grasse and other wéeds in it. And hurt nothing of the rice.</p>
                  <p>When that the euening draweth on, then they of the barke do make a sound with a taber or such like, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which being heard of his duckes, they throwe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with great spéede into the water, and swimme straight vnto their owne barke, whereas
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3380:65"/>
their bridge is readie put for them, and euerie flocke doth know his owne barke by the sounde without missing at any time, although there be many flockes together. For euerie barke doth vse a different sound the one from the other, to the which the duckes are vsed, and their eares full thereof, so that they neuer fayle their owne barke.</p>
                  <p>This manner of liuing is greatly vsed in all that countrie and verie profitable, for that it is a victuall most vsed amongst them, and is esteemed as a thing of great sustentation and of small price, by reason that at al times there is bréeding of them and of small cost.</p>
                  <p>Likewise in this Countrey they doo vse a kinde of fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is of no lesse industrie, then the bringing vppe of these duckes, and a thing to be séene. The king hath in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Citie founded vppon the riuers, houses, wherein euerie yeare is brought vp many Cormorantes, or sea Rauens, with whome they doo fishe, in those monethes that the fish dooth spawne and that is in this maner following. They take the Cormorantes out of their cages, and carrie them vnto the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer side, whereas they haue many barkes ordeyned for their fishing, and they are halfe full of water. Then they take their Cormorantes, and with a corde, they doo binde their mawes, in such sort, that no fish can fall into it: then they do cast them into the riuer to fish, the which they do with such good will and couetousnesse, that it is a woonder to sée, they throwe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into the water with great swiftnesse, and diue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they do fill their throate with fish. Then they come foorth and with the like hast they go vnto the barkes that are halfe ful of water, and the fish which they haue taken they put in that water which is put there for that purpose that the fish may not die, the which being done they returne againe vnto their fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they did before.</p>
                  <p>In this order they do indure their fishing foure houres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in such sort, that the one doth not trouble the other, and when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their boates with water are ful of fish, then do they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind them, and turne them againe into the riuer for to fish for themselues, for they haue neede thereof, for that alwayes the day before that they will fish, they kéepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie victualles, which is a litle <hi>Millio</hi> that they may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better do
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3380:65"/>
their office. So after a while that they haue filled their bellies and recreated themselues, they take them out of the water and carrie them vnto the ordinarie places, whereas they art kept, and euerie third day during the time of this fishing, they doo take them forth for the same exercise, which for them is so great pastime, that they would it should indure all the yeare.</p>
                  <p>In these thrée monethes they do take so much fish, that they do prouide the whole kingdome for all the yeare: as in the chapter past it hath béene tolde you, which is the occasion that they are as well prouided of fish, as of any other thing: so that if they please, they may eate euerie day fresh fish, although they are farre from the sea.</p>

                  <p>Those that doo enter in this kingdome with the title of an ambassador, they cannot do him any griefe, for anie delight or euill that he doth, although they can make good proofe thereof. And for that it is of a truth: you shall vnderstande the proofe by experience. There was sent vnto this king, one Barthol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew <hi>Perez</hi> a Portugall and his company, by order of the viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of the <hi>India</hi> with an ambassage from the king <hi>Don Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> of Portugall, &amp; they were accused before the vizroy of the prouince of <hi>Canton,</hi> by the ambassadors of the king of <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> that were there present, who were bounde vnto the court to treat of matters of their king: they did testifie that the ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage that the Portugal did bring was false, and they were spies sent from the vizroy of the <hi>India</hi> for to view the fortresses of the citie, that they might come afterwards and take it, as they had done in many places of the <hi>India</hi>: they perseuering still in the euill and mischieuous intent, did will the vizroy to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, and to punish them as such spies did deserue, off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Who after that he had well considered thereof, and consulted with the <hi>Loytias</hi> of the citie, and with his counsailors, they commanded that they should be apprehended, and put in straite prison, whereas their declarations were taken with great care deceit and pollicie: and by reason that in them they found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties: some for feare confessed much more then that which was demanded: and other saide that it was of truth, so that by their confessions according vnto the lawes of the countrie, they were condemned to die, and sent their iudgement vnto the roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all councell for to confirme the same, with intent and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire for to execute the same. The which being séene by the roiall councell, and considering with what title they entred into that kingdome, did not onely make voide the sentence and woulde

not confirme the same, but did send commandement vnto the vizroy to set them at libertie, and to returne fréely back againe vnto the <hi>India</hi> from whence they came, and that hee shoulde furnish them with all things necessarie in aboundance, til they were entred into the same, although in this time the ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the king of <hi>Malaca,</hi> who were in the court, did still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer in their malicious intent.</p>
                  <p>In which commandement, although it were true, all that which the foresaide ambassadors did testifie, and that they for feare of death did confesse it, yet it is sufficient that they entred into this kingdom the title of ambassador, whereby they should receiue any harme.

                  <p>But if an ambassador doo come from any common wealth of the said kingdome, they doo not giue him the intertainement abouesaid, but cleane contrarie thereunto, for that he dooth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the citie, accompanied onely with the iustice, whose charge it is to lodge him in such houses as the king hath ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the same effect: and to giue him all that is necessarie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him the summe and effect wherefore he doth come: and he doth giue relation thereof vnto the president of the councell, and the president doth giue the king to vnderstand therof: then doo they appoint the day of audience, with this condition, that when he dooth go thither, hée must go on foote, or else on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back without a bridle, with onely a halter on his horse head, in token of humility, and acknowledging to be a subiect. The day of his audience, he commeth forth obseruing the order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition aforesaid, accompanyed with the iustice. And when hée doth come into a great place, which is right against the pallace of the king, he staieth there till an officer of the king doth come

In this sort hee goeth onwards his way, making in it other fiue adorations like vnto the first, vntill such time as he do come into the first hall of the pallace which is at the staires heade, whereas the president is set with great maiestie, and doth represent the kings person: who after that hee hath hearde the effect of his ambassage, dooth sende them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without answering one word at that time: but after that hee hath giuen the king to vnderstande, hée dooth sende him answere by that iustice, who hath the charge to lodge him, and to prouide him of all things necessarie for the time that hée is in the court.</p>

                  <p>FOr to conclude this small historie, in the which I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in summe, all such things as I haue vnderstoode of this kingdome of <hi>China</hi> vnto this, I meane such as I might wel set forth, leuing a great number more, (of the which I haue particular note: some for that they are vnknowne, and others for that they will cause admyration, because they haue not béene séene.

I should passe from his mightie kingdome of <hi>Mexico</hi> to <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and to present it vnto the king of that countrie in his name: of all the which I will declare that which I doo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande and know, not excéeding the limits of fidelitie, by reason that the ambassage was not ended, nor no conclusion in effect of that which was pretended, but doo hope in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maiestie, and with the care and diligence that is put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the king of Spaine, shortlie to haue a conclusion of that they desire, for the which the letter and the rest was sent.</p>
                  <p>Béeing considered of by the Spaniards (such as were dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the Ilands <hi>Philippinas,</hi> which by another name are called the Ilands of the <hi>Ponent</hi> or West) the thinges of great valour and riches, as of golde and silkes and many other thinges which is brought from the kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> and out of their ports, and how those which brought it, did sel it for a small quantitie in respect as they did estéeme it, and being certified by the saide <hi>Chinos</hi> of many other things which were in the firme land, wherof some of them haue béene made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this historie: being mooued with the conuerting of these soules, and with the profite that might come of traficke that they might haue with the <hi>Chinos</hi>: it was concluded by the gouernour and principals of the Citie of <hi>Manila,</hi> with the iudgement of the prouinciall of the order of saint Augustine, and of many other religious men that were both graue &amp; wise, such as were the first, that in those parts did preach the Gospel, and did baptise a great number of the dwellers therein, and did many other thinges, of the which I might say much, if it were to my purpose, and that my part were not therein: so that I say it was concluded amongst them to sende vnto the Catholike king graue personages, vnto whome intire credite might be giuen, for to giue relation what they vnderstoode of that kingdome, and also of the euident necessitie (that all those Ilands that were his) had for their conseruation to holde to friendes the <hi>Chinos</hi> their borderers, whereof might growe vnto them great benefites and profites: and likewise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest him (if it were his pleasure) to sende an ambassador to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of that kingdome the better to confirme their friendship &amp; to carrie with him some things which be vsed in his countrie,

which would be maruellous well estéemed of the <hi>Chinos,</hi> &amp; be a way vnto the preaching of the gospel, and bee a beginning that a farther contraction may growe betwixt the Christians and the <hi>Chinos,</hi> of the which shall follow the aforesaid profite vnto other countries, by the great quantitie of things, as well of riches as of other curiosities that shalbe brought from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. After they had well considered with great deliberation, who should be the person that they shoulde send vpon so long a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for to request his maiestie of the aforesaid: in the ende they did agrée vppon, for to desire the prouinciall of the Augustine friers, who was called Frier <hi>Dilho de Herrera,</hi> a man of great learning and of great experience touching matters of those Ilands, for that hee was one of the first discouerers of them: they requested him for the loue of God, and the good seruice to his maiestie, and the benefite that might come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by vnto these Ilands that he would take vpon him to go with this petition, for they were fully perswaded for that he had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed so manie places of those Ilands, as also for his office and vocation, there was none that better coulde put in effect their desire, and perswade with his maiestie the great importance of that ambassage: and manie other things necessarie touching the gouernement of those Ilands. This determination was liked well of them all, and that they had chosen well in sending of the prouinciall, who incontinent departed from the Ilands in a shippe that was pepared for <hi>Noua Hispania,</hi> which was in the yeare of Christ 1573. At his inbarking, hee was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the gouernour, and all those of that citie, of whom hee was maruellouslie well beloued for his holinesse and good condition. Desiring him with all diligence to procure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, with as much breuity as was possible, vnto those ilands, whereas they so much loued him, and had néede of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                  <p>He did promise them to make all the spéede possible, and in paiment of the trauel that he did take vpon him, for the benifite &amp; profite, he requested them al that they would pray vnto God to giue a good voyage: they promised him to doo it, the which they did performe with particular care. Then did the master command to weigh ankers, and to set saile, which was in the moneth of Nouember the same yeare: and with reasonable

whether they arriued at the new Spaine, and came vnto the cittie of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and from thence they went and embarked themselues in the North seas, who with prosperous winds the xiii, day of August, the yeare following they ariued in <hi>San.

From thence the day following we departed from Syuel, from whence wee departed forthwith toward <hi>Madrid,</hi> whereas his maiestie was at that present, and we came thither the fiftéenth day of September in <hi>anno</hi> 1574. the same wéeke that they had newes of the losse of the <hi>Goleta.</hi> Wée went straightwayes to kisse the kings hands, and caried the letters which we brought from his gouernor and citie: by whom both we and the letters were receiued with his accustomed benignitie, and did heare the petition with great satisfaction, for that the desire was holy and profitable, and told vs that he would command his counsell to vnderstand in the same with a particular consideration, and with so much breuitie as the thing required: and gaue vs thankes for the great trauell and long iourney, which we tooke vpon vs in his seruice, for to giue him notice of the discouering of this great kingdome, and of other things touching the Ilands <hi>Philippinas.</hi> He straightwayes commanded that we should be prouided for of all things necessarie for our sustentation, for the time that we should there remaine: and that we should go and giue account of all things, (for the which we came thither) vnto the counsel of the <hi>Indies</hi>: who was <hi>Don Iuan de Oban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> vnto whom his maiestie did recommend the consideration to be done with great care, and to consult vpon the same. After that they had comuned with the roiall counsell of the <hi>Indies</hi> touching that which should be requisite and conuenient: which was done as it appeared in effect, for that they gaue vs facultie in a few dayes after, of all things that was requested from the said Ilands, except that which did touch the ambassage vnto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

and for certaine respects. But the aforesaid Prouinciall did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke himselfe with his fortie religious persons, and departed in the moneth of Iuly with a faire winde and merrie passage, till they came vnto newe Spaine, and from thence into the South sea, vntill they came in sight of the Ilands: whereas the wether did alter, and they were forced by the furie thereof to ariue at an Iland inhabited with Genti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He afterwards came vnto <hi>Manilla</hi> and gaue them to vnderstand how they were all slaine, and how the Gentiles did teare all the papers and commissions in péeces, and of all that happened to them.</p>
                  <p>This being knowne by the gouernor, and by the rest that dwelt in the Ilands (after that they had done the rytes, with the funerall griefes, as iustice required in such a case) they finding themselues in the same necessitie, that before they were in by reason of the losse of the aforesaid Prouinciall and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and also of the letters and prouisions sent from his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie: they forthwith in the same determination, did write new letters, in requesting that which in part the king had granted, (although they had no knowledge thereof) they did also therein write touching the ambassage that they did request for the king of <hi>China,</hi> adding therunto new occasions, wherby they should be moued to do them so much fauour as to send the ambassador afore requested: which was a thing of great importan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When that these letters came in conformitie with the others before sent, the king did ordaine for gouernor of those Ilands, a Gentleman, who was called <hi>Don Gonsalo de Mercado, y Ronquillo,</hi> a man of great valor &amp; discretion, one that had serued the king as wel in the <hi>Peru.</hi> as in <hi>Mexico,</hi> with great fidelitie: who vnderstanding the earnest request wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>with those of the Ilands did aske the ambassage, &amp; howe much it did import to haue it (as a man then elected for gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of those Ilands, &amp; a matter that touched him very much,) did put the king and his counsell in memorie of the same: and in conclusion they answered that hee should foorthwith depart with the souldiers that were prouided for those parts, for that it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient so to be doone by reason of great necessitie that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3380:70"/>
they had of them in the said Ilands: and as for the ambassage, for that there was no such great necessitie nor haste, it should be intreated of at more leasure, when that the counsell wil aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise themselues of al that shalbe conuenient touching that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp; that they would consult and confer with his maiestie, that he may as the right owner of them, command that which shuld be to the seruice of God and his benefite. So with this answere the said gouernor departed. It happened that in the moneth of August, in the yeare following, before that this gouernor was ariued at the Ilands, there came newe letters from thence, of supplications, requesting with greater instance, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at other times they had requested, sending with their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the whole relation of the entrie of Frier <hi>Martin de Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rada,</hi> prouinciall of the Augustine Friers and his companions, into the kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> and of such things as they had seene and heard of (as may be séene at large in the said declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is in the second part of this booke.) This being séene by his maiestie, he was resolued to send the ambassage which so many times they haue requested: this chanced at that time that he began to go vppon Portugall, a time of trouble, but yet a great token that it was the will of God, in whose hands (as the wise man saith) are the hearts of kings. For the appointment of one for to go on this ambassage, the king did remit it vnto his roial counsel of the <hi>Indies,</hi> whose president was <hi>Don Antonio de Padilla y meneses,</hi> who had communicated with me diuers times, touching matters of that kingdome &amp; of <hi>Mexico,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I was alwayes resident euer since I was seuentéene yeares of age, and by reason of matters that was committed vnto me, out of that country, was the occasion that I did vse to visit him the oftener: the which large conuersation and the good wil that hée did beare me, did perswade him that I could put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ambassage of his maiestie, for that his will was that some religious person should do it: and they being fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that my good will and desire was for the saluation of those soules, and in all respects willing to serue his maiestie: all the which with the knowledge that I had of that large nauigation, and the qualitie of that countrie and people, was a great helpe to the accomplishing in effect the will of his maiestie and desire of those that dwelt in <hi>Philippina.</hi>

spoyling al such as they met with marchandice &amp; other things that they carried from one Ilande to an other, and from the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land vnto the firme, &amp; comming from thence amongst them all they caused to take two ships of <hi>China</hi> which came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And there he pretended to liue in securitie without feare that before he had of the kings great fléete, for that it was so farre distant from the firme lande. So with this determination hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from those Ilandes whereas hee was retyred, and went to sea, and sayling towardes the Ilandes <hi>Philippinas</hi> they passed in sight of the Ilandes of the <hi>Illocos,</hi> which had

There was in her but 25. souldiers besides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rouers, so that with the one &amp; the other they were but a fewe in number, for that as they thought they did trauaile in places of great securitie, and without any suspition to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This being done, he did prosecute his voyage according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his determination, and passed alongest, but not in such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret but that hee was discouered by the dwellers of the towne of <hi>Fernandina,</hi> who gaue notice thereof vnto the lieutenant of the gouernor aforesaide, as a woonder to sée so many shippes together, and a thing neuer séene before at those Ilands. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it caused admiration vnto him, and made him to thinke and to imagine with great care what it might bee, hee sawe that they did beare with the citie of <hi>Manilla,</hi> and thought with himselfe, that so great a fléete as that was could not goe to the place which they bare in with, for any goodnesse towardes the dwellers therein, who were voide of all care, and a small number of people as aforesaid. Wherewith hee determined with himselfe with so great spéede as it was possible, to ioyne togither such Spaniards as were there, which were to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fiftie foure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to depart and procure (although they did put themselues in danger of inconuenience) to get the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hande of them, to aduertise them of <hi>Manilla,</hi> and to ayde and helpe them to put their artilerie in order, and all other thinges necessarie for their defence.</p>
                  <p>This determination the Captayne did put in vre verie spéedily, which was the occasion that the citie and all those that were in it, was not destroyed and slayne: yet they could not eschue all the harme, for that the ships that carried them were small, and a few rouers &amp; not verie expert, for that the sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their departure would not afforde better choice, as also they went from one place to an other procuring of victuals: all

which was the occasion that they did not come thither in such time as they desired, and as was conuenient.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Lymahon</hi> was well prouided of prouision and al other thinges necessarie, and hauing the wind fayre, he was alwaies in the fore front, and came in the sight of <hi>Manilla</hi> vppon saint Andros eue, in the yeare 1574. whereas he came to an anker that night with all his whole fléete. And he séeing that the end of his pretence consisted in expedition before that they should be séene of those of the citie, or discouered by them on the coasts. The nightes at that time being very darke, which was a great helpe vnto them: he choose foure hundred of his best souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such as hee was fully perswaded of their valour and stout cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and put them in small vessels, and charged those that went with them for Captaines, to make such expedition that they might come vnto the Citie before it was day, and the first thing that they did was to set fire on the Citie, and not to let escape one man liuing therin, promising them that at the break of the day he would bewith them to giue them aide and succour if néede did require, which they did. But for that nothing is done without the will and permission of God, it went not with <hi>Limahon</hi> and his foure hundred souldiers according as he did make reckoning: for that all that night the winde was of the shoore, and the more the night came on, the more the wind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, which was such a contradiction vnto their expectation, that they could not by night disembarke themselues, although they did procure by all meanes possible by policie and force for to do it, Which of certaintie and without all doubt, if this had not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The which aduice did little profite, for that there was none that would beléeue them: but beléeued that it was some false larum doone by the people of the countrie for to mocke them. But in conclusion the enemies were come vnto the house of the Generall of the fielde, who was called <hi>Martin de Goyti,</hi> which was the first house in all the Citie that wayes which the enemies came. And before that the Spaniardes and souldiers that were within the Towne could bee fully perswaded the rumour to be true, the enemies had set fire vpon his house, and slewe him and all that were within, that none escaped but onely the goodwife of the house, whom they left naked and verie sore wounded, beléeuing that she had béene dead: but afterwardes shee recouered and was healed of her woundes.

With this determination they put this worke in execution, and spared no person of what qualitie and degree so euer he was, but that his hande was to helpe all that was possible, the which indured two dayes &amp; two nightes, for so long the Rouer kept his shippes and came not abrode: for these woorthie souldiers vnderstoode, that remayning with their liues their labour and trauaile would soone be eased.</p>
                  <p>In which time of their continuall labour, they made a fort with pipes and bordes filled with sande and other necessaries thereto belonging, such as the time would permit them: they put in carriages, foure excellent peeces of artilerie that were in the citie. All the which being put in order, they gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the people of the citie into that little fort, which they made by the prouidence of God our Lorde, as you may beléeue, for that it was not his pleasure that so many soules as were in those Ilands baptised and sealed with the light and knowledge of his holy faith, should returne againe to be ouercome with the deuill: out of whose power hee brought them by his infinite goodnes &amp; mercie: neither would hee that the friendship should be lost that these Ilandes had with the mightie kingdome of <hi>China.</hi> By which meanes we may coniecture that the diuine power had ordained the remedie of saluation for all that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. The night before the enemie did giue assault vnto the Citie, came thether the Captayne <hi>Iohn de Salzedo</hi> lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vnto the Gouernour of the Townes of <hi>Fernandina,</hi> who as aforesayde, came with purpose to ayde and helpe the Spaniardes that were then in <hi>Manilla.</hi> Whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, without all doubt with his companions, was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall remedie, as well vnto the Citie, as vnto all those that were within it: for considering that they were but fewe, and the great paines they tooke in making the last resistance,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3380:79"/>
and the labor and trauaile they had in the ordayning of the fort for their defence with other necessaries against that which was to come, ioyning therewith the feare that was amongst them of the assalt past: surely they had néede of such a succour as this was: and surely by the opinion of all men, it was a myracle of God, doone to bring them thether. So with the comming of this Captaine with his people, they all recouered newe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, with great hope valiantly to resist their enimies: for the which incontinent they did put all thinges in good order, for that the Rouer the morning following, before the breake of the day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (which was the second day after hee gaue the first assalt) was with all his fléete right against the port, and did put a lande sixe hundreth souldiers, who at that instant did s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So hauing fired the Citie, they did assalt the fort with great crueltie, as men fleshed with the last slaughter, thinking that their resistance was but small. But it fell not out as they did beléeue, for that all those that were within were of so vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant courage, that who so euer of their enemies that were so bolde as to enter into their fort, did paye for their boldnesse with the losse of their liues. Which being séene by the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> they did retire, hauing continued in the fight almost all the day, with the losse of two hundreth men, that were slaine in the assalt, and many other hurt, and of the Spaniardes were slaine but onely two, the one was the Ancient bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, called <hi>Samho Hortiz,</hi> and the other was the Bayliefe of the Citie called <hi>Francisco de Leon.</hi> All which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by <hi>Lymahon</hi> the Rouer, who being politike and wise, and sawe that it was losse of time and men, to goe forwardes with his pretence against the valiauntnesse of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, (which was cleane contrarie vnto that which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto that day) he thought it the best way to embarke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and to set sayle, and goe vnto the porte of <hi>Cabite</hi> from whence he came. But first hee gathered togither all his dead people, and after did burie them at the Ilande aforesaid, where as he stayed two dayes for the same purpose.</p>

                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:3380:79"/>That being doone, he straightwayes departed from thence and returned the same way that he came, till they ariued in a mightie riuer, fortie leagues from the Citie of <hi>Manilla,</hi> that is called <hi>Pangasinan,</hi> the which place or soyle did like him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well, and where he thought he might be sure from them, who by the commaundement of the king went for to seeke him.</p>
                  <p>There hee determined to remayne, and to make him selfe lorde ouer all that countrie, the which hee did with little tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and built himselfe a fort one league within the ryuer, where as he remayned certayne dayes, receauing tribute of the inhabitants there abouts, as though he were their true and naturall lorde: and at times went foorth with his ships robbing and spoyling all that he met vpon the coast. And spred abroade that hee had taken to him selfe the Ilandes <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and howe that all the Spaniardes that were in them, were eyther slaine or fledde away: wherewith hee put all the Cities and Townes bordering there aboutes in great feare, and also how that he had setled himself vpon this mightie riuer <hi>Pangasinan,</hi> whereas they did receiue him for their lord, and so they did obey him, and paide him tribute.</p>

With this consideration they entred into counsell, and did determine to ioyne together all the people they could, and being in good order, to follow and séeke the Rouer, for that they vnderstood of necessitie he must abide and repayre himself in some place nigh there aboutes, for that he durst not goe vnto <hi>China</hi> for feare that he had of the kings fleete, and fearing that they should vse such policies as hee hath vsed, they might come on him vnwares, and destroy him as he had done others.

                  <p>This determination they put in vre and effect according as the time would permit: in which time they had certaine newes howe that the Rouer was in the riuer of <hi>Pagansinan,</hi> and there did pretende to remaine.

The Generall of the fielde with the people aforesaide, did depart from <hi>Manilla</hi> the thrée &amp; twentith day of March <hi>Anno</hi> 1575, and ariued at the mouth of the riuer <hi>Pagansinan</hi> vpon tenable wednesday in the morning next following without being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered of any, for that it was doone with great aduice, as a thing that did import verie much. Then straightwaies at that instant the generall did put a lande all his people and foure péeees of artilerie, leauing the mouth of the riuer shutte vp with his shipping in chayning the one to the other, in such sort that none could enter in neyther yet goe foorth to giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie aduice vnto the Rouer of his ariuall: hee commaunded some to goe and discouer the fléete of the enimie, and the place whereas hee was fortified, and charged them verie much to doo it in such secrete sort, that they were not espied: for therein consisted all their whole worke. The Captaines did as they were commanded, and found the Rouer voyde of all care or suspition to receiue there any harme, as hee found them in the Citie of <hi>Manilla</hi> when he did assault them.</p>
                  <p>This securitie that hee thought himselfe in did proceede from the newes that hee had from his friendes at the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that although they did prouide to sende against him, yet could they not so quickly haue any knowledge where hee was, neyther finde out the place of his abiding: and againe hee knewe that the Spaniards of the <hi>Philippinas</hi> remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shippes, for that they had burnt them as you haue heard,

and that they had more néede to repayre themselues of their ill intreatie the yeare past, then to séeke any reuengement of their iniuries receiued.</p>

                  <p>The Captaines séeing this, and that their people were out of order, neither could they bring them into any, for that they were also weary (although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> general of the field did succour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Then the next day following the Generall of the fielde did bring his souldiers into a square battle, and began to march towards the fort, with courage to assalt it if occasion did serue thereunto: hee did pitch his campe within two hundreth paces of the fort, and founde that the enimie did all that night fortifie himselfe verie well, and in such sort that it was perilous to assalt him, for that he had placed vpon his fort thrée péeces of artilerie, and many bases, besides others ingins of fire worke. Seing this, &amp; that his péeces of artilerie that hee brought were very small for to batter, and little store of munition for that they had spent all at the assalt which the rouer did giue them at <hi>Manilla,</hi> the Generall of the fielde, and the captaines conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongst themselues, that séeing the enimie had no ships to escape by water, neither had hee any great store of victuals for that all was burnt in the ships, it was the best and most surest way to besiege the fort, and to remaine there in quiet vntill that hunger did constraine them either to yéeld or come to some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which rather they will then to perish with hunger.</p>
                  <p>This determination was liked well of them all, although it fell out cleane contrarie vnto their expectation, for that in the space of thrée monethes that siege indured, this <hi>Limahon</hi> did so much that within the fort he made certaine small barks, and trimmed them in the best manner he coulde, wherewith in one night hee and all his people escaped, as shall bee tolde you: a thing that séemed impossible, and caused great admiration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Spaniards, and more for that his departure was such that he was not discouered, neither by them on the water nor on the lande. What happened in these thrée monethes, I doo not here declare, although some attempts were notable, for that my intent is to declare what was the occasion that those religious men and their consorts did enter into the kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> and to declare of that which they said they had séene: for the which I haue made relation of the comming of <hi>Limahon,</hi> and of all the rest which you haue heard.</p>

                  <p>IN the meane time that the siege indured at the fort, as you haue vnderstood, there went and came certaine vessels which brought victuals and other necessaries from the cittie of <hi>Manil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> which was but fortie leagues from the mouth of that riuer of <hi>Pagasinan,</hi> as hath béene tolde you.

                  <p>Then did they al imbarke themselues in a ship of the Ilands which was made readie for the same effect, and went out of the port in the company of another shippe with merchants of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> that were at <hi>Manilla,</hi> into the which <hi>Sinsay</hi> put himselfe with all their victuals, for to carry it vntill they came vnto the port of <hi>Buliano,</hi> whereas was the great shippe of <hi>Omoncon,</hi> wherin they should make their voyage: which was that which was forced to returne backe againe by reason of foule wether: they aryued at the same port the sunday following, for that the winde was somewhat contrarie, and had lost the shippe that

So it pleased God, that although it was verie calme and little winde stirring, that we made but little way, yet vpon the sunday following, which was the thirde of Iuly, we had sight of the land of <hi>China</hi>: so that we found all our voyage from the port of <hi>Buliano,</hi> from whence we departed, vnto the firme land to be one hundred and fortie leagues, &amp; twenty leagues before they came in the sight thereof, they had sounding at thrée score and tenne, and fourscore fathome, and so waxed lesse and lesse vntill they came to the lande: which is the best and surest to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken they haue to be nigh the land. In al the time of their voiage the Captain <hi>Omoncon</hi> with his companie shewed such great curtesie and friendship to our men, as though they had béene the owners of the saide ship: and at such time as they did imbarke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues he gaue his own cabin y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was in the sterne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> friers, and vnto <hi>Pedro Sarmiento</hi> and to <hi>Miguel de Loarcha,</hi> he gaue another cabin that was very good, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his company in the ship that they should respect them more then himselfe: the which was in such sort, that on a day at the beginning of their voyage, the fathers founde them making of sacrifice vnto

their Idols, and told them that all which they did was a kinde of mockage, and that they shoulde worshippe but onely one God: and willed them to doo so no more. Who onely in respect of them did leaue it off, and not vse it after in all the voyage: whereas before they did vse it euerie day manie times.<note place="margin">They leaue the worshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of one Idol to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship another.</note> Besides this, they woulde worshippe the images that the Friers did carrie with them, and knéele vpon their knées with great shew of deuotion: who nowe hauing sight of the firme lande, in so short time, and passed that small gulfe so quietly, which was wont to bee verie perilous and full of stormes: they did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it vnto the orations of the Friers, their companions and souldiers. The like curtesie was shewed vnto them by <hi>Sinsay,</hi> who was the seconde person in the shippe, and hée that did best vnderstande that Nauigation and voyage.

But as he drew nigher vnto him, hee did know him by the flagge he bare on the sterne, in the foist wherein he was himselfe with his souldiers, &amp; straightwayes caused to amaine his sailes, and tarried for him. The generall did the like, and stayed behinde, sending a boate for to bring the captaine vnto him and to declare what he was, and from whence hee came. <hi>Omoncon</hi> did forthwith imbarke himself into his boate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any resistance, but rather with feare that hee should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for that hee did flie from him.

But after a while hee commanded that they shoulde bée put vnder hatches, which was the occasion to augment the feare they conceiued when they were sent for: and the more when they saw that they were commanded to be shut vp in a cabin, with the interpreter that they brought with them.</p>
                  <p>This being done, they were in great care howe they might vnderstand the Generals pretence: and at a close doore that was before the cabin whereas they were, vppon a sudden they might sée that all those that were in the shippe did arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in great haste, and the captaine <hi>Omoncon</hi> amongst them: then they heard bases and hargubus shot, with a great noise of people, which did verie much alter them: in such sort that they looked euery moment when they should come and cut of their heads. Whilst that our people were in this agonie and great feare, <hi>Omoncon</hi> considered of them and of the charge that he had to bring them thither: therewith he sent one of his seruants to giue them to vnderstand of all that they had heard and séene, wherewith they did quiet themselues, and put away al the feare that they had conceiued with their suddain putting downe in the cabine, and the shooting off of those péeces.

In accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of this commandement the gouernor of <hi>Chincheo</hi> did prouide shipping and did sende the Captaine <hi>Omoncon</hi> with them: but yet he could not prouide them of souldiers and other necessaries till certaine dayes after that he was gone foorth: so he went till hee came and met with the Spaniards, nigh vnto <hi>Buliano</hi> (as aforesaid). About the same time the general of the bay that was there to defend the cost, did dispatch another ship for to enquire and know where the rouer was, and to bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation therof, that straightwayes they might go and assalt him with all the whole armie. This ship was the fathers of <hi>Sinsay,</hi> he that was friend vnto the <hi>Castillas,</hi> who came in companie with the Friers from the Ilands (as it is said,) and he went in the said ship for Pilot: who although hee went out of the port with great spéede, yet with greater hast hee returned againe without mastes or yardes, for that they lost them in a great storme and torment that tooke them in the gulfe, whereas they thought to haue béene lost. At the same time that the Friers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Buliano</hi> to <hi>Pagansinan,</hi> being requested to come thither by the master of the field (as aforesaid) there was in the same port a ship of <hi>China</hi> that came vnto the Ilands to traficke and being well informed of all things, as well in what extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity the Spaniards had the rouer, as also of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> going of <hi>Omon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> and how that he carried vnto the firme lande the foresaide Friers and their companions. The saide shippe departed in a morning very secretly, ten dayes before that <hi>Omoncon</hi> did make saile, &amp; came to the firme land the saide ten daies before, &amp; gaue notice thereof vnto the gouernor of all that they had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as wel by relation as by sight: and how that ther came with <hi>Omoncon</hi> &amp; the Spaniards, <hi>Sinsay,</hi> who was he that in al things touching <hi>Limahon</hi> was the dooer, &amp; that whatsoeuer shall happen good in this relation, they ought to giue the praise and thanks vnto him, and not vnto <hi>Omoncon.</hi> This he spake for the good affection he had vnto <hi>Sinsay</hi> by way of friendship, for that he was of the same profession, a merchant.</p>

Straight wayes so soone as hee heard the newes of the shippe that ariued there tenne dayes before (as aforesaide) he commaunded sixe shippes to goe foorth of the baye to the sea, with order and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to bring the ship to an anker in the sayd bay, and not to suffer him to go into any other place: and otherwise they could not, at least wayes they would bring with them <hi>Sinsay,</hi> for that they would send him post vnto the Uiceroy, for to declare vnto him all that had passed particularly.

They did not only misse of their purpose, but also many of them were hurt in the attempting to enter the ship: the saide ship did fall aborde there whereas was their captaine <hi>Omoncon,</hi> who at that instant did call our Spaniardes in his shippe, out of the generalles shippe whereas they were: which was dooone with such spéede, that it was accomplished before any of the other ships could come vnto them, although they did procure it.

The instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they commonly do vse are hoybuckes, cornets, trompets, lutes, such as be vsed in Spaine, although in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion ther is some difference.

The Captayne came with great maiestie, with his guarde of Souldiers and mase bearers before him, with great musicke of hoybuckes, trumpets and drommes, and two whiffelers, or typp staues, that made roome putting the people aside: also there came with him two executors of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice or hangmen, hauing each of them in their handes a set made of canes, which is an instrument wherewith they doo whippe and punish offenders, and is so cruell that who soeuer doth receiue sixtie strokes with the same, although he be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie stout man and strong hearted yet it will kill him, for that hee is not able to abide it.

The Iudges, Captaines, and <hi>Loytias</hi> haue ordinarily these officers before them, for to beate such as will not goe out of the way when as they doo passe the stréetes, and such as will not alight from their horse, or come out of their close chayres when they doo méete with them. When this Captayne came vnto the Pallace gate, whereas the father Fryers and their companions did receiue him, he was brought on the shoulders of eight men very richly apparelled, and he in a chayre wrought of Iuorie and golde, who stayed not till they came into the inner chamber, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he did a light from the chayre, and went straight vnder a cloth of estate, that was there ordinarily for the same purpose, and a table before him: there hee sate downe, and straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3380:92"/>
arose vp, and standing he did receiue the strange guests, who did curtesie vnto him according vnto their fashion, which is to ioyne their handes together, and to stoope with them and their heads downe to the grounde: he gratified them againe, with bowing his heade a little, and that with great grauitie. Within a little while after he spake vnto them with great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, bidding them welcome into his kingdome, being glad of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, saying that himselfe was come to sée &amp; cherish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that they should receiue no discontent, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proofe shal shew. These spéeches being finished, there was brought foorth certain péeces of blacke silke of twelue vares long a péece. And his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers did put on the Fryers shoulders each of them two, which was for either shoulder one, and was brought about their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; girt therewith: the like was done in order vnto the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish souldiers and vnto <hi>Omoncon</hi> and <hi>Sinsay</hi> and to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. But vnto <hi>Omoncon</hi> and <hi>Sinsay</hi> was giuen vnto ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them a branch or nosegay made of siluer which was set vpon their heads, which is accustomable honor that is done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such as haue done some great enterprise, or such like.</p>
                  <p>After that this ceremonie was done, they played vpon the instrumentes afore sayde which came with the Captaine. In the meane time of their musicke, there was brought foorth great store of conserues, marchpanes and thinges made of suger, and excellent good wine: and so being on foot standing, hee caused them to eate, and he himselfe from the chayre whereas he sate did giue them to drinke euerie one in order, without rising vp, which is a ceremonie and token of great fauour, and of loue.</p>
                  <p>This being done, hee arose from the chayre vnder the cloth of state, and went and sate downe in that which was brought on mens backes, and with declining of his head a little he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the hall and out of the house, and went vnto his owne house, whereas by the counsell of <hi>Omoncon</hi> and <hi>Sinsay</hi> within an houre after they shoulde goe and visite him, the which they did: hee receiued them marueilously well and with great courtesie: who maruelled at his great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and authoritie, for that <hi>Omoncon</hi> and <hi>Sinsay</hi> when they did talke with him were vpon their knees, and so did al the rest: yet that which they did see afterwardes done vnto the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suanto</hi> and viceroy, was much more.</p>

                  <p>AFter that the fathers with their companions had remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned two dayes in the port of <hi>Tansuso,</hi> whereas they were marueilously well entertayned and feasted at the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen by the <hi>Insuanto,</hi> as you haue heard, the third day they departed in the morning towardes <hi>Chincheo,</hi> whether they were commaunded to bee carried with great spéede and good intertainement.</p>
                  <p>At their going foorth of the towne they were accompanied with a great number of souldiers, both hargubushes and pikes, and before them a great noyse of trompets, drommes, and hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buckes, till such time as they came vnto the riuers side, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as was a brygandine prouided and made readie in all pointes to carrie them vp the riuer: all the stréetes alongest whereas they went, there followed them so much people that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, and all to sée them. So when they were embarked, the which was done with great speede to auoyd the presse of the people, there came vnto them the Captaine of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ortie ships, of whom wee made mention in the Chapter past, with thrée byrgandines, one wherein he was himselfe, and was maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously well trimmed: and in the other two were souldiers that did beare him companie. As soone as he came vnto them, hee straight wayes entred into the brygandine whereas the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men were with three Spaniardes, and brought with him great store of conserues, and made them a gallant banket, the which did indure so long as he was with them, which was the space of rowing of two long leagues, in which time their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3380:93"/>
was such that they thought it but a quarter of a league. From thence he departed from them and returned, but left ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges behinde him for their comfort in their iourney, and made great offers, with an outward showe, that it was a griefe vnto him to depart from out of their companie.</p>
                  <p>All alongest the ryuers whereas they went, was seated with villages verie gallant and fresh, both on the one side and on the other. Some of them did content our people ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much, who asked the names howe they were called, and the Captaynes answered them and sayde, that those were vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages that did not deserue the honour of a name, but when you doo come there whereas the king is, you shall see Cities, that it shall be a woorthie thing to knowe their names, the which townes haue thrée and foure thousande souldiers, such as in Europe are estéemed for reasonable Cities.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the two leagues, there whereas the Captaine did leaue the companie of our Spaniardes in the riuer, they came vnto a great baye, whereas was at an anker a fléete of more then a hundreth and fiftie shippes men of warre, whose Generall was this Captaine, whom we haue spoken of, that did beare the Fryers and the rest companie. At such time as the fléete did discouer them, they began to salute them, as well with great péeces of artilerie, as with hargubushes, and other kinde of pastimes, which commonly they do vse at such times: and that is doone by the commandement of their Generall.</p>
                  <p>At such time as they had made an ende of shooting and other pastimes, then did he take his leaue of them with the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie aforesaide, and went out of the brygandine whereas the Fryers were and went into his owne, which carryed him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Admirall wherein he imbarked himselfe. Our Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes after his departure did trauaile vp the riuer more than thrée leagues, hauing continually both on the one side and on the other verie many and faire townes, and full of people. In the ende of the thrée leagues they went a lande halfe a league from the Towne of <hi>Tangoa,</hi> whereas straightwayes all such things as they carried with them were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon mens backs, and carried it vnto the towne before them, whereas they were tarying their comming, for to giue them great entertayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At their going a shore, they founde prepared for the

two religious men little chayres to carrie them vppon mens backes, and for the souldiers and the rest of their companions, was ordayned horse. The fathers did refuse to be carried, and would haue gone a foote, for that the way was but short and pleasant, full of gréene trées, and againe for humilitie, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be carried in so rich chaires and vppon mens backes of so good a vocation as they séemed to be. But <hi>Omoncon</hi> and the other Captaine would not consent thereunto, saying, that it was the order giuen by the <hi>Insuanto,</hi> and that they could not by any meanes breake but performe in all points, or else to be cruelly punished for the same, I meane such captaines as had the charge for to garde &amp; beare them companie: and that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse could serue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and againe that it was conuenient so to be done, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from that time the <hi>Chinos</hi> should respect them and vnderstande that they were principall persons, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were carried vpon mens backes, as they do their <hi>Loytias.</hi> The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers obeyed their reasons, and entred into the chayres &amp; were carried with eight men a péece, &amp; the other their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions with foure men a péece, according vnto the order giuen by the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Those that carried the chaires, did it with so good a will, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was striuing who should first lay hands to them. This towne of <hi>Tangoa</hi> hath thrée thousand souldiers, and is called in their language <hi>Coan</hi>: at the entring in, it hath many gardens &amp; orchards &amp; a stréete where through they carried the Spaniards vnto their lodging, they affirmed it to be halfe a league long, &amp; all the stréete whereas they went, it was full of bordes &amp; stalles where on was laide all kinde of marchandice very curious, and things to be eaten, as fresh fish &amp; salt fish of diuers sortes, &amp; great abundance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oule, and flesh of al sorts, fruits and gréene herbs in such quantitie that it was sufficient to serue such a Citie as Siuell is. The presse of people was so much in the stréets, that although there were many typstaues, &amp; souldiers that did make way wheras they went, yet could they not passe but with great difficultie. So they were brought vnto the kings house, which was very great, marueilously wel wrought with stone &amp; brick, and many halles, pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3380:94"/>
which was great store of capons, hens, teales, ducks, géese, flesh of four or fiue sorts, fresh fish, wine, and fruits of diuers sorts, &amp; of so great quantitie that it was sufficient for two hundreth men. All the which they would haue giuen for a little coole aire, by reason that it was then very hoat wether, &amp; againe the great number of people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came thether to sée them did augment it the more. So in the euening the two spanish souldiers we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the stréets to walk abrode, &amp; left the two Fryers within their lodging, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afterwards they did giue intelligence of all things that they had séene, which did cause great admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the wall of the towne was very brode, &amp; wrought with lyme and stone, full of loope holes and watch towers. And as they passed through the stréetes there came foorth of a house a very honest man as it séemed, who was very well apparelled &amp; stayed them for that in the same house there were certaine dames princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall personages, that did sée them a farre off, and not content therewith, they did request them with great courtesie for to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the house that they might the better sée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the which they did straightwaies accomplish, and entring in, they were brought into a court, whereas was set chayres for them to sit downe, and the Ladies were there a little fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them beholding them with great honestie and grauitie. Then a little after they sent them a banket with marchpanes and sweet meats made of sugar, which they did eate without any curiositie &amp; dronke after the same. The banket being done, they made signes and tokens vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they receiued great content with their sight, and that they might depart when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their peasure was, the which they did after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had made great curtesies with thankes for their friendship receiued of both parts. So after they had taken their leaue they went to see a house of pleasure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was hard by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town wall, wrought vpon the water, with verie faire galleries &amp; open lodges for to banket in, made of masons worke, &amp; therin many tables finely painted, &amp; round about it sesterns of water wherin was store of fish, &amp; ioyning vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tables of very faire alabaster, all of one stone, and the least of them was of eight spannes long: and rounde about them were brookes of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water, that gaue a pleasaunt sounde in the meane time they were banketting, and nigh thereunto many gardynes full of all sortes of flowers. And a little from that place they
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3380:95"/>
sawe a bridge all of Masons worke, and the stones verie well wrought and of a mightie biggnesse, they measured some of them, that were twentie and two and twentie foote long, and fiue foote brode, and séemed vnto them that it was a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be layde there by mans handes. Of this bignesse, yea and bigger they did sée layde vppon manie other bridges, in the discourse of their voyage going to <hi>Chincheo</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The next day in the morning when they were vp and readie, they found in the house all thinges in a readinesse and in verie good order, for their departure, as well their little chayres, and horse, as for men to carrie their stuffe and apparell, which did not a little make them to marueile, how that euerie one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a waster vpon their shoulders, did deuide their burden in two partes, sixe roues before and sixe roues behinde, and did trauaile with the same with so great ease and swiftnes that the horse could not indure with them. They went vnto the <hi>Tico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> his house, he who sent them the present ouer night, to giue him thankes for his courtesie, and to take their leaue of him. They found him with great maiestie, but yet gaue them great &amp; good entertainment, and craued pardon at their hands, if that he did not giue them the entertainement and courtesie as they deserued. He did likewise put vpon each of them two péeces of silke, in the same order as the gouernour of <hi>Tansuso</hi> did. So when they had surrendred vnto him thankes, they tooke their leaue and departed from <hi>Chincheo</hi> whereas was the <hi>Insuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> or gouernor, by whose order was showed vnto them all the courtesie as you haue hearde.</p>

                  <p>FRom this towne of <hi>Tangoa</hi> vnto <hi>Chincheo</hi> is thirteene leagues, and so plaine way that it giueth great content to trauaile it: in all the waye they could not see one spanne of ground but was tilled and occupied. The like they doo saye is of all the grounde that is in the whole kingdome: it is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3380:95"/>
full of people, and the townes one so néere to an other, that almost you can not iudge them to bee manie townes but one, for that there was but a quarter of a league distant one towne from an other, and it was tolde vnto them that in all the Prouinces of the kingdome, it is populared in the same order. All their ground they till is watered, which is the occasion of the frutefulnesse thereof, so that they doo gather fruite all the yeare long, and our Spaniardes did sée in all places whereas they came, that they were gathering of rice, some newe sprong vp, some with eares, and some rype. They doo plough and till their ground with kine, <hi>Bufalos,</hi> and bulles, which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie tame, and although they be great, yet be their hornes but of a spanne long and turning backwards to the tayle, in such sort that they can not do any hurt or harme with them: they do go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them with a corde that is made fast to a ring that is in their nose, and in like sort do they gouerne the <hi>Bufanos.</hi> They doo féede them commonly in the fieldes of rice, for that they haue no other grasinges, and all the time that they are féeding a boy doth ride on euerie one of them to disturbe them, that they doo no harme therein. But to eate the wéedes and grasse that doo grow in the rice. In this prouince and all the rest of the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene in that kingdome, they gather much wheate, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good barley, péese, <hi>Borona, Millo, Frysoles, Lantesas, Chiches,</hi> and other kindes of graines and séedes, whereof is great abundance and good cheape.

Their waters by the hie waies are verie good and light, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wether at that time was verie hoat, especially at noone time, yet was the water of their welles and fountaynes verie coole. The same day when they had trauayled halfe way, they saw a farre off comming marching towardes them in verye good order, a squadron of souldiers, which at the first
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3380:96"/>
caused them to maruaile, and to be a fraide, till such time as they drewe nigher, it was tolde vnto them, that it was the Captayne of the garde vnto the <hi>Insuanto</hi> or Gouernour of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> who came by his order to receiue them with foure hundred souldiers verie well armed with pickes and hargubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and well apparelled. So soone as the Captaine came vnto them, he was mounted on a bay horse, but of small sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they for the most part bee in all that prouince, hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted and came vnto the fathers, and his companions (who likewise did alight from their little chayres) and did salute the one the other with great courtesie. And the Captayne tolde them, how that the Gouernour did sende him with those soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for to receiue him and to beare him companie, and howe that hee was in the Citie tarrying their comming with great desire to sée them, and commaunded that with all spéede possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they should shorten the way.</p>
                  <p>The Captaine came verie well apparelled with a chayne of golde about his necke, a man of a good audacitie and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Harde vnto his stirryp hee had a page that went with him and carried a great <hi>Tira sol,</hi>

This Captaine with his foure hundreth souldiers did continually garde them, till they came vnto the Citie of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> and neuer departed from them a iot: the which was done more for pompe, and to showe their maiestie then of necessitie: for that although the people are infinite &amp; without number,<note place="margin">The people of the countrie weare no weapons, but the souldiers.</note> yet do they weare no weapons, for that they are commanded by the lawe of the countrie to the contrarie vpon paine of death, of what state or degrée so euer he be, but onely the souldiers such as are in euerie towne for the gard thereof, and the garrisons that the king hath continually readie to come foorth when that any occasion shall serue.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVI. Our Spaniardes ariued at the Citie of Chincheo, whereas they were receiued and lodged, and what they sawe in that Citie.</head>
                  <p>VPon a Saterday being the eleuenth of Iuly came our Spaniards vnto the citie of <hi>Chincheo</hi> four houres before it was night. This citie is of the common sorte in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and may haue seuentie thousande housholdes. It is of great traficke and well prouided of all things,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chincheo</hi> hath seuentie thousand housholds.</note> for that the sea is but two leagues from it: it hath a mightie riuer run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alongest by it downe into the sea, by which is brought by water and carried downe all kinde of marchandice. There is a bridge ouer the sayde riuer, which is supposed to bee the fayrest that is in all the worlde: it hath a drawe bridge to serue in time of warres or for any other necessitie: the bridge is eight hundreth paces long, and all wrought with stones of two and twentie foote long, and fiue foote broade, a thing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee marueiled at: at the entrie thereof there were manie armed souldiers readie to fight, who when they came within hargubush shoote did salute them in verie good order. There was nigh vnto the sayde bridge in the riuer riding at an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker more than a thousande shippes of all sortes,<note place="margin">A thousand ships in one riuer.</note> and so great a number of boates and barkes that all the riuer was couered, and euerie one full of people that had entred into them for to sée the <hi>Castillas,</hi> for so they did call the Spaniardes in that countrie, for the stréetes in the suburbes nor in the Citie could not hold them, the number was so great, yet their streets are as broade as our ordinarie streetes in anye Citie in all Spaine.</p>
                  <p>This Citie is compassed with a strong wall, made of stone, and is seuen fadam hie, and foure fadam broade, and vpon the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3380:97"/>
gates many towers wherein is placed their artilerie,<note place="margin">They haue no vse of castles.</note> which is all their strength, for that they doo not vse in their kingdome strong castels as they doo in Europe. The houses of the Citie are all built after one sorte and fashion, but faire, and not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hie,<note place="margin">Earth quaks in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> by reason of the earth quakes which are ordinarily in that countrie.</p>
                  <p>All the stréetes (but especially that wherein they passed at their comming thether) haue on the one side and on the other, sheddes,<note place="margin">Rich mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice.</note> vnder the which are shoppes, full of riche marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and of great value and verie curious. They haue in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual distance the one from the other, many triumphant arches which doo set out the stréetes verie much, and is vsed in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie principall streete thorough out all the kingdome,<note place="margin">Triumphant arches.</note> in the which they haue excellent market places, whereas is to bee bought all thinges that you will desire to be eaten, as well of fish as of fleshe, fruites, herbes, comfits, conserues, and all thinges so good cheape, that it is almost bought for nothing. Their victualles are verie good and of great substance, their hogges flesh whereon they doo féede much, is so holsome and good as the mutton in Spaine. The fruites that wee did sée, some were like vnto them we haue in Spaine, and others ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the like séene by vs afore, but of an excellent taste and sauour. But in especiall one kinde of fruite which is bigger than a muske million, but of the same fashion, but of maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous excellent and precious victuall and pleasant to be eaten, a kinde of plummes that is of a gallant taste, and neuer hurteth anie bodie although they eate neuer so manie, a thing prooued by our Spaniardes many times. The stréete that they came in at, was so full of people, that if a graine of wheate had béene throwne amongest them, it would scarce haue fallen to the grounde. And although they were carried in little chayres vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens backes, and the Captaine (of whome we speake of) before them making way: yet were they a great while before they could passe the stréete, and be brought vnto a great house, which was a couent, wherein dwelt religious men of that countrie, thether they were brought and lodged, beeing verie wearie of the presse of people that did trouble them verie much with desire to take their ease.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVII. The gouernor of Chincheo doth call the Spaniards before him, and sheweth vnto them the ceremonies that they must vse to haue aundience.</head>
                  <p>THe same day that they came into the cittie (as aforesaide) was a good while before night, with more desire to take rest and ease themselues of their iourney, and of the trauell they had in the stréets, by reason of the great number of people that came to sée them, then to make any visitation that night: but the <hi>Insuanto</hi> or gouernor of the cittie did send and commanded that forthwith they shoulde go vnto his house, for that hee had great desire to sée them: the which they did more for necessitie of the time, then for any good will. They went forth from their lodging on foote, whether it was for that the gouernors house was néere hande, or else peraduenture at his commandement, which they could not well vnderstande, but did as the captaine that guarded them did commande. In the midst of the stréete, wheras was no lesse number of people then in the other, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they entred into the Citie, they met with a <hi>Loytia</hi> that came to entertaine them with great maiestie, and had carried before him manie banners, mase bearers and tipstaues, and others which carried settes or whips, which they did traile after them made fast vnto long stickes, which were the executioners, the which doo go alwayes making of way, parting the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Loytias,</hi> as you haue hearde. The maiestie and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wherewith he came was so great, that they verely did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue him to be the <hi>Insuanto</hi>: but being certified, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode that it was one of his counsailers that came from the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors home to his owne house, which was in the same stréet whereas hee met with them. This counsailor was carried in a chaire of Iuory, garnished with gold and with curtines of cloth of golde, and on them the kings armes, which are certaine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents knotted togither (as hath béene tolde you.) But when he came right against the spaniards, without any staying he made a signe with his head, and commanded that they should returne backe againe vnto his house, which was hard by: the captains did straightways obey his commandement, and returned with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3380:98"/>
them. The counsailor entred into his house, which was verie faire, he had in it a faire court, and therein a gallant fountaine and a garden. After him entred the spaniards all alone, the rest remained without in the stréet at the <hi>Loytias</hi> commandement, he entertained them with verie good wordes of semblance, and saide in conclusion that they were welcome into that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with many other wordes of curtesie: vnto the which they answered with the same curtesie, with signes and by their interpreter that they carried with them. This <hi>Loytia</hi> commaunded a banquet to bee brought foorth, and wine to drinke, hee began first both to eate and drinke. Then hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to call in the captaine, vnto whome was giuen the charge to beare them companie, and did chide with him verie sharpely and seuerely, because he did carrie them on foote (they coulde not vnderstande whether it were doone for a policie, or of a trueth, although the effectes wherewith hee did chide sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of a trueth) hee straightwayes commaunded two rich Chayres to bée brought foorth for to carrie the Fathers, and to giue vnto their companions horses: the which being done, he willed them to go and visite the gouernor, who did tary their comming: and that another time at more leasure he would sée and visite them.</p>
                  <p>They followed their way all alongst the stréete, which sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto them to be more fairer then the other wherein they entered, and of more fairer houses and triumphant arkes: and also the shoppes that were on the one side and on the other, to bee better furnished with richer thinges then the others, in so ample sort, that what therewith, as also the great number of people which they sawe, they were so amased, that they were as people from themselues, thinking it to be a dreame. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, after they had gone a good while in that stréete, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting their eies with newe thinges neuer séene of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: they came into a great place, whereas were many soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in good order with their hargabushes, pickes and other armour in a redinesse, apparelled all in a liuerie of silke, with their ancients displayed. At the end of this place, was there a very faire and sumpteous pallace, the gate was wrought of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons worke of stone, very great &amp; full of figures or personages, and aboue it a great window with an iron grate al guilt: they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3380:98"/>
were carried within the gates, the souldiers &amp; the people which were without number, remained without and coulde not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded but with great difficultie. When they were within the first court, there came forth a man very well apparelled and of authoritie, and made signes with his hande vnto them that brought the Spaniards, that they should carrie them into a hal that was vpon the right hand, the which was straightwayes done. The hall was very great &amp; faire, &amp; at the end therof there was an altar, whereon was many Idols, &amp; all did differ the one from the other in their fashion: the altar was rich and very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously trimm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d with burning lampes: the aultar cloth was of cloth of gold, and the fruntlet of the same.</p>
                  <p>After a while that they had béene there whereas the Idols were: there came a seruant from the gouernor and saide vnto them in his behalfe, that they shoulde sende vnto him the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, for that hee woulde talke with him, and tell him some things that they ought to obserue, if they would haue any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of him: they straightwayes commanded him to go. And the gouernor said vnto him that hee should aduise the fathers and the rest of his companions, that if they would talke &amp; treate of such businesse as they came for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it must be done with the same ceremonie and respect, as the Nobles of that prouince do vse to talke with him: which is vppon their knées (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they did sée manie times vsed) if not that they shoulde depart vnto the house whereas they were lodged, and there to tarrie the order that shoulde bee sent from the vizroy of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spaniards when they hearde this message, there was amongst them diuers iudgementes and opinions, striuing amongst themselues a good while, but yet in conclusion, the religious Fathers, whome the gouernour of the Ilandes had ordeined and sent as principalles in this matter, and whose iudgemente they shoulde followe, saide that they ought to accept the condition, seeing that by no other meanes they coulde not come vnto that they pretended: and not to leaue it it off for matters of small importance, for that therein they make no offence vnto GOD, and it may bee a meane vnto the conuerting of that mightie kingdome, whome the diuell maketh reckoning to bee his owne, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3380:99"/>
not nowe to leaue it off, but rather to procure all meanes that may be, as they had begun to do, and seeing that it is no offence vnto God, as aforesaide, neither sent as ambassadors from the king of Spaine, I doo not know to the contrarie, but that wee may consent vnto the will of the <hi>Insuant,</hi> and in especiall being a thing so commonly vsed in that countrie. This opinion and iudgement was followed, although the souldiers that were with them were of a contrarie opinion: so they sent answere vnto the gouernor with the said interpreter, that they will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue their accustomed ceremonies, and will do all that he will commande them according vnto the custome of the countrie: otherwise they could not be permitted to intreat of such things, wherefore they came thither, from farre countries and with so great trauell.</p>

                  <p>WHen that the <hi>Insuanto</hi> vnderstood that the spaniards woulde enter with the reuerence accustomed, and in such order as was declared vnto them, hee straightwaies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they should come into the hall whereas he was, which was a thing to be séene, as well for the bignes, as for the riches that was in it, the which I do let passe because I would not be tedious. The spaniards were carried foorth out of that hall whereas they were first, and after that they had passed the court whereas they came in, they entred into another hall as bigge as the first: whereas were many souldiers with their weapons in their hands in verie good order, and richly apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and next vnto them were many tipstaues and sergeants, with different ensignes or badges, all apparelled with long robes of silke, garded and embroidered with gold, and euery one of them had a helme on his heade, some of siluer and other some of tynne guilt ouer, which was a gallant thing to sée: all had long haire and dyed yealow, which hong downe behinde their eares vpon their backes: they were placed in very good order, and made a lane that the Spaniards might passe thorough:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3380:99"/>
then they came into a gallerie, which was ioyning vnto the chamber where the gouernor was, and there they heard such a noise of instruments of diuerse sorts, which indured a good while, and was of so great melodie, that it séemed vnto them that they neuer before heard the like: which caused vnto them great admiration to see so great maiestie amongst Gentiles.<note place="margin">Great mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then they made signes vnto them for to knéele downe, for that the <hi>Insuanto</hi> was nigh at hande in a rich tower, vnder a canapie of great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and did represent so great maiestie as the king himselfe: he did entertaine them with tokens of great loue, and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and tolde them by their interpreter, that they were verie well welcome, and that he did greatly reioyce to sée them, with many other words of great fauour. This gouernor was a man of goodly person, well fauored, and of a merrie countenance, more then any that they had séene in all that countrie. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be put vpon the shoulders of the fathers and of the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ceremonie is vsed in that kingdome vnto al cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and other men that haue done some valiant exploit, (as we haue tolde you before.) This being doone, the fathers did giue vnto him the letters which they carryed from the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and generall of the fielde, and a note of the present that was sent him: crauing pardon for that it was so smal, but time and oportunitie would not serue as then to sende vnto him a thing of greater price and valor: certifying him, that if the friendship which they pretended did go forwards, &amp; come to be established, that then all things should be amended and amplified. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered vnto their profers with words of great fauor, and made

They had a steward appointed to prouide them and all their company of all thinges necessarie, and that in abundance, and not to take of them any thing, which was giuen by particular commandement by the gouernour.</p>

                  <p>THe next day following, which was sunday the twelfth of Iuly, many of the Gentlemen of the cittie did go vnto the Spaniards to visite them, vsing many ceremonies according to their custome with fauorable words, promising to performe it in déeds, when as néede did so require: and such as could not go themselues did send their seruants, bidding them welcome and to knowe of their good healthes, and howe they did like of their citties and country. The Spaniards did make answere, and gratified them all, as well those that came in person, as the other that sent their seruants: in the which visitation they spent all the whole day, hauing great admyration to sée the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior,

So when they came thither, they were brought whereas hee was, but with lesse ceremony then on the first day: but yet they found him with the like maiestie as before.

But when that he perceiued that <hi>Limahon</hi> was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dead nor prisoner, but onely besieged, he offered vnto them that if they would returne againe vnto <hi>Pagansinan</hi> vpon him whereas he was, hée would giue vnto them fiue hundred ships of warre, with people suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They answered him, that all such cost and labour were but in vaine, for that the generall of the fielde who hath him in siege, with the people and ships that he hath, are sufficient to ende that enterprise, and to

send him hither aliue or deade, and that long before that their fleete should come thither. And besides this, their Ilands were poore of victuals, and could not sustaine so great an armie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes. Being satisfied with these reasons, hee gaue place that the interpreter which they brought should come in where as they were, for hee remained at the doore without, for that he would be fully certified to auoid the suspitious doubt he had before he come in presence, yet he did help them very much. So when their interpreter was come in, the Spaniards séeing good occasion and oportunitie for to declare that which passed the day before, betwixt them and the fathers, touching the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto him on their knées: and séeing as it seemed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he was at that time in a good mind for to heare them,<note place="margin">Note the spaniards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But after that that they vnderstoode the effect of the whole, and how that the gouernor did permit that they should talke with him after their owne fashion, they were maruellously glad thereof, and had a very good hope to conclude their pretence, wherefore they went, and praised God for the good successe of that which they pretended.</p>

                  <p>THe next day following, the gouernor called a Gentleman of his house vnto him, and commanded him to go and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site the Spaniards, and to informe himselfe of them if that that they lacked any thing, as well in their victuals as in their lodgings, and to know if they did require any thing particular to themselues to aduise him therof, and he would furnish them forthwith for the loue that hee bare vnto them, for their good contractation, and for the great seruice that they had done vnto the king, in the businesse of <hi>Limahon.</hi> And also that he should in his name inuite them for the next day folowing to dine with him in his house. This Gentleman went vnto them and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished his message: and the Spaniards answered, kissing his hande for the great care hée had of them: saying that they were furnished in all thinges aboundantly (as in trueth they were) and how they were maruellously well lodged, chéered, and lacked nothing: and that the great care hee had of them was agréeable vnto the hope they had of his good presence and gentlenesse: accepting the inuiting for the next day, the which was giuen them, and accomplished in this forme fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>The next day when they went vnto the pallace which was at dinner time, they were caried into a hall that was below in the second court, whereas were many chaires of veluet &amp; tables

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mber of the tables. All these were placed in circle or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe (as aforesaide) that they might see one another. In the midest betwixt them there was a round compasse, wheras was represented a comedie with much pastime, and indured all the dinnner time, and a good while after. There was also great store of verie good and excellent musicke, accompanied with gallant voyces, also iesters, with puppets and other thinges of great pastime, to driue the time away.</p>
                  <p>On the first table was set to euery one of the guestes, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle baskets wrought with golde and siluer wyre, full of swéete meates made of sugar, as Marchpanes, Castels, Pitchers, Pots, Dishes, Dogges, Bulles, Elephants, and other things verie curious, and all guilt: besides this there were many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes full of flesh, as Capons, Hennes, Géese, Teales, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Bacon, peeces of Béefe, and other sortes of flesh wherewith all the tables were replenished, sauing that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at they did sit to dine, which was replenished with victuals that was dressed (for all the other was rawe) and was of so great aboundance, that there was at times more then fiftie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, and they were serued with great curiositie. They had wine of diuers sortes, and of that which they doo make in that countrie of the Palme trée, but of so great excellencie, that they founde no lacke of that which was made of Grapes. The din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner endured foure houres, and according vnto the aboundance and diuersitie they had in victuals, it might haue indured eight houres, for it was in so good order that it might haue béene gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto any prince in the world.</p>

                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:3380:102"/>Their seruants and slaues that they brought with them at the same time, did dine in another hal nigh vnto the same, with so great abundance as their masters. When dinner was done, the gouernor commanded the people to come vnto him, with whom he did talke and comon with great friendship, and good conuersation, and would not consent that they shoulde kneele downe, neither to bee bare headed. So after that hee had made vnto them tokens of friendshippe, and deteined them a while, in demaunding of many thinges, lastly he told them that there was an order come from the vizroy of <hi>Aucheo,</hi> that they shuld go thither with great spéede, so that it did require that they shoulde depart the next day following, for the which they were verie glad and ioyfull, for that they had great desire the one to sée the other: and againe with him they might treate and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tguching their comming into that countrie, and for what intent: and for all other things néedfull, for that he was a man fit for their purpose, and one welbeloued of the king. So hee tooke his leaue of vs with great friendship and curtesie: who did surrender the same after our custome, putting of our cappes, and making reuerence, for the which hee made shewe that it greatly contented him.</p>
                  <p>At their going foorth out of the hall, they found the captaine that did dine with them, and with him many other Gentlemen that tarried their comming for to beare them company vnto their lodging: going before them many seruants, that did carie the raw meate, that was vpon the other tables ouer and aboue that which they did eate on, the which was done for great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe next day in the morning before that the Spaniards were stirring, there was within the house all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for their iourney, as well of litter chaires, as of horses and men for to carrie them, and their stuffe, the which they did with so good a will (as aforesaid) that they did fall out and striue amongst themselues, who should be the first that should receiue their burthen. So all things being in good order, they departed, hauing in their companie the same captaine and souldiers, that vnto that time had béene their guard, vntil they came vnto the cittie of <hi>Aucheo,</hi> whereas the vizroy was. This iourney was vnto them ioyfull, as well for to entreate of matters touching their comming, and to be resolued what they shuld do, as also to depart out of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> whereas they passed much trouble, by reason of the great number of people that came for to sée them, who neuer would be satisfied: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was in such extremity, that some dayes at tenne of the clocke in the night, the stréete round about their lodging were full of people, and onely to sée them, which caused great trouble and heate with their rumor &amp; presse amongst them. This day by reason they vnderstood that they should depart, the prease and multitude of the people was so great, that although they had tip staues before them, to beate the people away and to make roome, yet was it almost night before they could get out of the citie: so that they were constrained to remaine in a towne there hard by all that night, where as by the commandement of the gouernour they were verie well lodged, and their supper made readie in verie good order, as it was in seauen dayes together, till such time as they came vnto <hi>Aucheo</hi> without taking for the same or for anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing necessarie for their sustentation, anie price or value. There went continuallie before them a Post with a prouision from the gouernour, written in a great borde wherein was declared who they were, and from whence they came, and commanding that there should bee prouided for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:3380:103"/>
them all things necessarie in abundance, vppon the kings cost, which was the occasion that so much people came for to sée them, that in the high waies they were many times disturbed: so with great trouble, the thirde day they came vnto a citie which was called <hi>Megoa,</hi> which was sometimes the head go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, the which was offortie thousand housholds, but a great part thereof was dispeopled: the occasion thereof they tolde vs, (and was) that about thirtie yeares past, the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones,</hi> who brought for their guides thrée <hi>Chinos,</hi> who doo nowe dwell in <hi>Manilla,</hi> and are become Christians, and came vpon that cittie, (to reuenge themselues of an iniurie that was done vnto them) the which they put in execution with so great secrecie and policie, that they made themselues lords of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie without any daunger or hurt vnto themselues: for that fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Iapones,</hi> men fit for that purpose, did apparell themselues in <hi>Chinos</hi> apparell without being knowne, and came vnto a gate of the Cittie, whereas the souldiers that had the charge thereof were voide of all suspition of any enimies that woulde come, which was the occasion that their armor and weapon was not all in a redinesse. And within a little while after that, followed two thousand that did disembarke themselues in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat and vnknowne place, and came in verie secret order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not be discouered, and did beset that gate of the cittie, whereas their companions were, which they sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: who so soone as they saw them nigh at hande, drewe out their weapons the which they caried hid vnder their apparell, and set vpon the souldiers (that were voide of feare and vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) with so great furie and force, that they being amased were easilie slaine, so that they were lordes of the gate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they left verie good guard, and followed their victorie, and made themselues lordes of the Cittie, without any daunger vnto their persons, and did possesse the same certaine dayes, and did sacke the same in spite of them all, with great harme and losse vnto the inhabitants thereof, vntill such time as the vizroy of <hi>Aucheo</hi> did l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In this Citie they were lodged in the kings house, the which was of verie great &amp; faire buildings: there was giuen them to dine and suppe in very good order, and with aboundance. So soone as they came thither, the Friers remained in their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but <hi>Pedro Sarmiento</hi> and <hi>Miguel de Loarcha</hi> went to visite the gouernor, vsing the spanish curtesie with him: and he receiued them with great ioy and curtesie. After they had taken their leaue and returned vnto their lodgings, the gouernor sent to visite them <hi>El Tyu,</hi> who is the auncientest of his counsaile, who was with them a good while verie friendly, and offered his seruice in all thinges that were néedfull, and so departed to his house maruellously well accompanied.</p>

                  <p>At their departure from this Cittie, trauelling towards <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheo,</hi> they passed ouer a mightie great ryuer, by a bridge all made of stone: the goodliest and greatest that euer they had séene, whose greatnesse did cause wonderful admiration, so that they stayed and did measure it from one end to another, that it might be put amongst the wonders of that country, which they tooke a note of. They found that it was one thousand and thrée hundred foote long, and that the least stone wherewith it was built, was ofseuentéene foote, and many of two and twentie foote long, and eight foote broad, and séemed vnto them a thing impossible to be brought thither by mans art, for that all round about so farre as they could sée, was plaine ground without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mountaines: by which they iudged them to be brought from farre. When they were passed that bridge, they trauelled al the rest of the day till night vpon a causie that was very broad and plaine, and on both sides many victualling houses, and the fieldes sowed with Rice, wheate, and other séeds: and so full of people as in the stréetes of a good towne or cittie.</p>
                  <p>So when they came into the suburbes of the citie of <hi>Aucheo,</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:3380:104"/>

                  <head>CHAP. XXII. The entrie of the Spaniards into the Cittie of Aucheo, and how the vizroy did entertaine and receiue them.</head>
                  <p>AFter they had trauelled more then halfe a league in the suburbs of the cittie of <hi>Aucheo,</hi> they met with a post that came from the vizroy: who brought order that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remaine in a house that was appointed for them in the said su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs, and there to be lodged for that night, for that it was late, &amp; they could not come vnto the house appointed in the cittie for them, or else peraduenture to giue content vnto many that had great desire to sée those strangers, for that they must passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Cittie, and better to bee séene in the day then in the night. So soone as they were alighted, there came a gentleman to visite them, sent from the vizroy to bidde them welcome, and to know howe they did with their iourney, and also to sée that they were well prouided for that night of all things necessarie, and that in aboundance. After all the which being done, he told them that the viceroy did verie much reioyce of their comming, and for that it was late, and the Citie farre off, it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that they shoulde bee lodged that night in the suburbes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the next day, then will he giue order, that they may enter into the Cittie with the authoritie conuenient vnto their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. After this Gentleman came other Captaines to visite them, and brought with them great store of conserues, wine, and fruit: which is a common custome amongst them, when that they go in the like visitation, and it is carried by their seruants in little baskets very curiously wrought, or else in barrels made of earth all guilt. Within two houres after their comming thither, there came another messenger from the viz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy with many men laden with Capons, Hens, Géese, Teales, gamons of Bacon and conserues of diuers sorts, and of great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, sufficient for one hundreth men to sup that night, and for their dinner the next day.</p>
                  <p>The next day in the morning very early, there came much
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3380:105"/>
people vnto their lodging, sent by the vizroy, and brought with them two rich Chaires for to carrie the fathers in, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines tied vp, that they might the better be seene, and for their companions verie good horses, sadled after the fashion which they doo vse. They forthwith made haste for to depart, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they made great spéed, yet were they a good houre and a halfe before they coulde come vnto the gates of the Cittie, and séemed vnto them that they had trauelled two leagues in the suburbes: the which was so well peopled, so faire houses, and many shoppes full of merchandise, that if it had not beene told them, they would not haue beléeued it to be the suburbes, but the cittie it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Before they came vnto the gates, they passed a mightie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thrée times ouer bridges that were great and verie faire, and the riuer so déepe, that great shippes came vp the same, but their mastes stooping downe, to passe vnder the bridges. This Cittie is the richest and the best prouided that is in all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: it is the heade Cittie of all the Prouince, verie rich and fertill, and manie townes belonging vnto it, and but eight leagues from the sea, and hath mightie riuers, wherein great shippes come vp to it as aforesaide. At the enterie of the Citie, they founde many Gentlemen that were there at the gate tarrying their comming: who after they had saluted the one the other after their fashions, without anie staying they trauelled forwardes on, thorough a great and broad stréet that went directlie vnto the vizroy his pallace: vpon both sides of the stréete, from the gate forwards was placed one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther full of souldiers with their officers and ancient, euerie one with his weapon in his hands, as pickes, hargabuses, swords and target, all apparelled in one liuerie of silke, and a bunch of fethers vppon their crestes. They all stoode still and kept their places, and would not consent that any should crosse the way in the streete, whereas they went accompanied with the Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>They had no leasure to tell the souldiers, but they sawe that from the gate vntil they came vnto the vizroyes pallace on both sides, which was a good way to beefull of them, and all richly apparelled and of one colour. The people that were at the windowes &amp; in the stréete, betwixt the houses &amp; the soldiers
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3380:105"/>
were so great a number that it séemed to bee doomes day, and that all the people in the worlde were there ioyned together in that streete.</p>
                  <p>So when they came vnto the pallace which was two houres after day, the Gentlemen that were their guides did cause the Spaniardes to enter into a roome which was hard by, till such time as the gate was open, for that it is open but once a day, &amp; so continue no longer time then the audience endureth, which is done by the Uiceroy once euerie day, and that is but a small time. But first before he doth enter into audience, there is shot off foure péeces of artilerie, with a great noyse of trompettes drommes and waites. And there is no day that passeth without audience, as our people did sée by experience so long as they were there, and were likewise informed of others. The houre being come, and the ceremony doone as aforesaide, the gates were opened, and there was in the court many souldiers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled in the same liuerie that those were of in the stréete. From the middest amongst them came forth a gentleman who was as it was told them, the Captaine of the garde of the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, who came with great grauitie and authoritie towards the place whereas our people were, and after they had saluted the one the other, he made signes vnto them that they should go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the gates of the pallace. When they were within the first court, the which was great and wrought with mightie pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, there was a great number of souldiers, &amp; many sergeants that entred into an other great court, and mounted vp a paire of stayres that was on the one side, whereas all the people were with great silence, sauing the captaine of the garde, who went with our people till they came to the gates of the hall, whereas was the viceroy, at which gate he staied with his head discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and made signes vnto ours that they should doo the like, and to tarrie there till such time as hee had aduised the viceroy of their comming, and he to command them to enter.</p>

                  <p>THe next day after that our people came into the Citie, the Uiceroy did sende to inuite them to dinner to his owne house, whereas he made them a great banket in the forme following. At their comming vnto the pallace there came foorth a great number of Gentlemen, seruantes vnto the viceroy, to bid them welcome, with great store of musicke and tokens of mirth. Being entred into the first court, they brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mightie hall that was marueilously well trimmed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was a great number of tables set in such order as they were in the banket that was made them by the gouernour of <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheo,</hi> (as hath beene tolde you) although in the number and furniture did far excell the other.

that the friendship which they did pretende to establish, might be for good both vnto the one and to the other.

This being doone, the first seruice was set vppon the bordes, and the Captaines were set at other tables, which were not so many in number, nor so well furnished nor dressed as the other: the dinner was famous and of manie diuersities of meates, excéeding verie much that which was made them by the Gouernor of <hi>Aucheo.</hi>

                  <p>The time which the banket indured (which was verie late) there was great store of musicke of diuers instrumentes, as of vials, gitterns, and rebuckes, and with them many iesters did make them mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe same night our men did common amongst themselues, to sée if it were good presently to giue order to put in vre the thing they came for: séeing that they might treat ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with the Uiceroy, he being a man that shewed vnto them so much fauour and good will.

                  <p>This is conformable vnto that which the gouernor of <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheo</hi> did, in the presence of our people, at such time as they went to take their leaue of him, for to goe vnto <hi>Aucheo,</hi> which was, that in their presence they commanded to take foorth all that they brought him in present, and shewing it vnto them péece by peece. He asked if it were that which they had brought, and they aunswered that it was the same (although it was with troubled mindes) beléeuing that it was to checke them because it was so small in respect of their mightinesse: he asked them if there lacked any thing, they answered no, then straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes he commanded to put it againe whereas it was taken out in their presence, and before a notarie and witnesses: the which being doone, was mailed and sealed and so sent vnto the viceroy of <hi>Aucheo</hi> in their companie, and saide that hee could not receiue it without the licence aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>So our souldiers séeing that they could not be suffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in with the present, they tooke it for a great discourtesie and disfauour, and therewith departed vnto their lodging, to

giue the fathers to vnderstande thereof, who liked not well thereof, but yet they concluded amongest themselues to suffer for a while, and to commit vnto God the direction thereof, as it best may be for his holy seruice.</p>

                  <p>Then after a time our people seeing, that their beeing in that citie séemed to be long and like to be longer, they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to driue away the time in the best manner they could, and went abroad into the citie and did by eyther of them that which they thought best.<note place="margin">All things good cheape.</note> Whereof they found great abundance, and of so small price, that they bought it almost for nothing.</p>

                  <p>The next day they went to sée the gates of the Citie, and all such curious thinges as were to be séene so farre as they could learne or vnderstande, which were many.

                  <p>But they séeing that his aunswere was long a comming and great delaye made therein, and that they had them as halfe prisoners, they determined to go and speake with the

                  <p>With this their pretended purpose, they did perswade with their captaine to permit them so much libertie as for to go and speake with the viceroy, who for that hee bare them loue and good will did consent therevnto. So they went, but when they came thether they that kept the gates would not consent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should enter, which was the occasion that they returned vnto their lodgings verie sad and sorrowfull, and almost without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hope to bring their matter to passe, for the which they went thether, for that it séemed vnto them although they did plainely declare vnto them their pretence, yet did they worke in such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for to cause them to depart. In this order they remained in the citie certaine daies, and for to conclude either to stay there or depart the kingdome, they were resolute, and determined to write a letter vnto the viceroy, and therein to giue him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand particularly, that their comming thether into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie was to intreat that betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the <hi>Castillos</hi> there should be peace &amp; friendship, and being concluded that their souldiers should with that newes, depart vnto the Ilandes from whence they came, to giue the gouernor to vnderstand therof, &amp; they to remaine in that countrie preaching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gospell.

And in that touching the Fryers remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in that countrie to preach, at that time hee could make them no answere, for that in such matters it was first requisite to haue the good will of the Royall Counsell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet would hee make answere vnto the letter they brought from the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Manilla,</hi> and that they might depart, and returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at such time as they brought <hi>Limahon,</hi> prisoner or dead, the which being done, then shall the friendshippe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded which they doo pretende, and to remaine and preach at their will. With this answere they remained without all hope to remayne there, and did incontinent prepare themselues for to depart from <hi>Manilla,</hi> and bought manie bookes to carie with them, wherein was comprehended all the secrets of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. By reason whereof they might giue large notice vnto the royall maiestie of king Phillip. The which being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode by the Uiceroy, who had set spies to watch their doings, did sende them worde that they should not trouble themselues in the buying of bookes, for that hee would giue them frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all such bookes as they would desire to haue: the which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes he did not accomplish: whether it was for forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse or other occasion, as wee haue more at large declared vnto you, we know not: yet did the Uiceroy send and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to sée some of those bookes that the Fryers had bought, who after that he had séene them, did returne them again, and reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of them some writing of their owne handes, who did acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Our people being verie desirous for to see him, and to learne of him some secrets of that countrie, for that he had béene there a great while, they did procure to talke with him, asking licence of the supreme Iudge and lieutenant vnto the viceroy, who did not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to grant it them, but did make diligent inquirie who they were that did giue them to vnderstande thereof, for to punish them, which without all doubt, should be executed with sharpe and seuere punishment. Yet our people would neuer tell them of whom they had it, although it was demanded of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse times, and with great intreatie. They had so great desire to know it, that they did vse all meanes possible as it appeared in the boldnesse of their demandes.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXVII. There came newes vnto Aucheo that there was a rouer vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coast of Chincheo, which did much harme, and had sacked a towne. The viceroy doth suspect him to be Limahon, and how that our people with Omoncon and Sinsay, had not declared vnto him the truth.</head>
                  <p>THe Spaniards remained in the Citie of <hi>Aucheo</hi> twentie days, in the order as hath béen told you, without any hope, that the religious fathers should remaine in that countrie for to preach the holy gospell, which was the principall occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their going into that kingdome. Upon a suddaine there came newes vnto the citie that the rouer <hi>Limahon</hi> was vpon the coast of <hi>Chincheo</hi> vsing his olde accustomed cruelties, and how that he had spoiled and robbed a towne vpon the sea coast. This newes was throughout all the citie, and appeared to be true, touching the effect of the dead: yet false touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for that the rouer was called <hi>Taocay</hi> an enimie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vnto <hi>Limahon</hi>: but a friend vnto <hi>Vintoquian,</hi> of whom we haue spoken of. But thereupon the viceroy and all them of the citie were conformable in the suspition that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3380:112"/>
which was that our people,<note place="margin">Suspition of euill.</note> were come into that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vpon some euill pretence, and to sée the secrets thereof, to some euil end, which was the occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time forwards they shewed them not so good countenance as they did before.</p>
                  <p>These newes was not so soone come, but straightwayes the viceroy did sende for <hi>Omoncon</hi> (who was then returned from his visiting) and <hi>Sinsay</hi> vnto whom he had done courtesie, and giuen them the title of <hi>Loytias</hi> and captaynes, and he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende them verie sharpely for that they had brought ouer people thether, and sayde that they had tolde him a lye, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Limahon</hi> was besieged, in such sort that hee coulde not escape, neither had the <hi>Castillos</hi> burnt his shippes, and howe that all was but a made matter amongest themselues, and howe that the Captaines which they brought, and sayde that they had taken from <hi>Limahon,</hi> they had robbed from other places, with other wordes in the same order, and said that the Spaniardes were spyes that came to discouer the secretes and strength of the kingdome, and how that they had brought them thether by force of giftes that they had giuen them.</p>
                  <p>They answered him with great humilitie in saying that in all that which they had sayd they did speake the trueth, &amp; that it should appeare at such time as the newes of the rouer should be better knowen, the which if it shall appeare to be contrary, they were there readie for to suffer whatsoeuer punishment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shold be giuen them. The viceroy being somewhat satisfied with this their iustification, bad them to depart, remitting all things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to time for the true declaration thereof. Then <hi>Omoncon</hi> and <hi>Sinsay</hi> came straightwayes to giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards to vnderstand of all that had passed with the viceroy, &amp; what they vnderstoode of him, which caused in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so great feare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the time which it indured (which was till such time as they vnderstoode the truth as aforesaide) they paied very well for their feasts &amp; ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets the which they had made them. All this happened in the time that <hi>Omoncon</hi> &amp; <hi>Sinsay</hi> were at variance, and spake ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniurious words the one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, discouering their intents &amp; deuises, whereby it plainely appeared that in al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they had tolde vnto the viceroy, they lied, but in especiall <hi>Omon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con. Sinsay</hi> did dissemble, for hee sayde and tolde vnto all people, that by his order and industrie, our people did
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3380:113"/>
fire the shippes of <hi>Lymahon,</hi> and besieged him, with other spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the like sort, yet twentie daies before his comming the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all was ended and doone, as appeared. The occasion of their enimitie and falling out, was for that the viceroy had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto <hi>Omoncon</hi> a title and charge of more honor then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sinsay</hi> hauing made betwixt them a consort that the reward or dignitie should be equally deuided betwixt them, and that the one should speake of the other the best they could, because the viceroy should do them friendship. This condition and consort (as appeareth) was euill performed by <hi>Omoncon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing addicted vnto selfe loue, and séemed vnto him that <hi>Sinsay</hi> did not deserue so much as he did, for that hee was a base man, and of the sea, and he of the more nobilitie, and had the office of a captaine. All this which I haue said, was the occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the truth came to light betwixt them, and to cause the viceroye to suspect, that as they lyed in this, they might also fable in the burning of the ships and besieging of <hi>Limahon.</hi>

                  <p>WIth this griefe and care remained the Spaniards cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies kept close in their lodgings, and were not visited so often as they were whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they first came thether, which did augment verie much their feare, till such time as they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode that the viceroy eyther of his owne good will, or else by some particular order from the king &amp; his counsell, had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together all the gouernours of that prouince of <hi>Aucheo</hi> to intreat of matters touching <hi>Limaho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as also in particular, why &amp; wherefore the Spaniards came thether, &amp; to resolue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues wholly in all things requisite for the same. So when that they were all come together, which was in a short time, &amp; amongst them the Gouernor of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> who by an other name was called <hi>Insuanto,</hi> they had particular méetings together with the Uiceroye, in the which they were all agréed to haue a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall méeting, whereunto should bee called the <hi>Castillos,</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:3380:113"/>
and to demande of them in publike audience the cause of their comming (although notwithstanding they had giuen to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thereof vnto the <hi>Insuanto</hi> and vizroy) and being hearde, to giue them their answere according as they had determined: for the which vppon a day appointed they met all togither (but not the vizroy) in the house of the <hi>Cagontoc,</hi> and commanded to come before them the <hi>Castillas,</hi> who did accomplish their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest with a great good will, for that they vnderstoode that they were called to entreat of their matter, either to tarry or depart. So when they came thither, they were commanded to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a mighty hall, whereas they were all set in verie rich chaires with great grauitie and maiestie. The <hi>Insuanto</hi> séemed to bée the chiefest amongst them, but whether it was for that hée was the principallest next vnto the vizroy (or as it was tolde them) for that it was he that sent <hi>Omoncon</hi> in the chase of the rouer <hi>Limahon</hi> they knew not, but so soone as they were entred into the hall, they were commanded to drawe nigh, there, whereas they were all placed, without bidding them to sit downe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they vse any particular circumstances or curtesie.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Insuanto</hi> tooke vpon him the charge, and demanded of the Spaniards (by meanes of the interpreter) what was the occasion of their comming into that country, and to declare their pretence, for that they would giue vnto them the resolute will of the vizroy, at whose commandement they were called and there assembled togither. The Spaniards answered vnto their request and said that their comming thither was to treat with them peace and friendship, by the order of the gouernor of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Philippinas,</hi> who had his authority from the king of Spaine, with a particular charge euer since the said Ilands were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, who in all thinges that possible hath béene, haue shewed themselues not onely in words but in déedes, as vnto this day the gouernor dooth accomplish the same, in ransoming all such <hi>Chinos</hi> as they can finde, or come vnto their powers, and send them home frée into their countrie with giftes, and not in this only, but in other matters, which is not vnknowne vnto them: and more, that which lastly had happened in the destruction of the fléete, and the besieging of the rouer <hi>Limahon,</hi> with which newes they came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hither to intreate and conclude betwéene them and the <hi>Castillias</hi> a perpetuall friendship: this was the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3380:114"/>
principall occasion of their comming, the which if they coulde bring it to passe (as a thing that did accomplish both the one and the other) they would with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same news send word with the souldiers (who came with them for the same effect) vnto the gouernor of <hi>Manilla,</hi> who sent vs thither for that he might send the good successe thereof to the king of Spaine, and there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in such place as they woulde appoint them to studie the learning of the language, and to preach &amp; declare to them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gospell, which was the right way vnto the saluation of their soule. Unto all the which they gaue attentiue eare, although with little desire to see the experience, as appeared, for that the chiefest matter in effect, they did let passe, and asked of them in what order they left the rouer <hi>Limahon,</hi> and whether hée might escape or not, and other questions touching the same matter which endured a good while without touching of anie other matter in effect. The Spaniards answered as they thought, and supposed, that at that time it could not be, but that he was either taken prisoner or slaine.</p>
                  <p>Then did the <hi>Insuanto</hi> conclude his spéech in saying vnto them that they should returne vnto their owne country to the Ilands, and at such time as they did bring <hi>Limahon,</hi> they woulde conclude all things touching the friendship they reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, as also for the preaching of the gospell.</p>
                  <p>So with this last resolution they tooke their leaue and went vnto their lodging with pretence not to speake more of that matter, for that they sawe it booted not: after they had giuen their censure: and againe, as they vnderstood it was by speciall order from the king and his counsaile, and therewith they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to put all thinges in good order for their departure, the which they greatly desired, for that they saw little fruite to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede of their great labour and trauell, as also to sée themselues cleare of that manner of prison in the which they were, not to go forth of their lodgings without expresse licence.</p>
                  <p>So from that day forwards they did procure with all haste for to depart, and gaue the vizroy to vnderstande thereof, who answered them and saide, that they should comfort themselues and receiue ioy and pleasure, and that he would dispatch them, so soone as the visitor of that prouince was come to <hi>Aucheo,</hi> which would bee within tenne dayes, for that hee had written
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3380:114"/>
vnto him, that he should not dispatch them vntil his comming, for that he would sée them.</p>
                  <p>From that day forwards hee commaunded that sometimes they should let them to go forth abrode to recreate themselues, and that they should shew vnto them some particular pleasure or friendship. So one of them was carried to sée the mustering of their men of warre, which they haue in a common custome throughout all the kingdome to doo it the first day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Fiue and twentie dayes after that the <hi>Insuanto</hi> had giuen the resolute answere vnto the Spaniards, came the visitor thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the whole citie went forth to receiue him, who entred in with so great maiestie, that if they had not knowne who hée was, they could not haue béene perswaded but that he had beene the king.</p>

him, for dueties sake, as also for that he had a desire to sée them They found him in his lodging, where he began to make visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the cittie.</p>
                  <p>In their courtes were an infinite number of people which came thither with petitions and complaintes, but in the halles within, there was none but his seruants and sergeants. When that any came for to present his petition, the porter that was at the entrie made a great noise in manner of an <hi>.o.</hi> est. for that it was a good way from the place whereas the visitor did sit, then commeth forth straightwayes one of his pages, and taketh the petition and carrieth it in vnto him. At this time it was told him how that the <hi>Castillas</hi> were there: hee commaunded that they should enter, and talked with them a few words, but with great curtesie, and all was touching the imprisonment of <hi>Limahon</hi> without making any mention of their departure or tarrying. So after a while that he had beholded them and their apparel, hee tooke his leaue of them, saying, that by reason of the great businesse he had in that visitation, he could not shewe them any curtesie, neither to vnderstande of them what their request and desire was, but gaue them great thankes for their curtesie shewed, in that they woulde come to visite him. Hee was set in the same visitation after the same manner and order as they founde the gouernor of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> and the vizroy, with a table before him, with paper, ynke, and other thinges readie to write, the which according as it was giuen them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, is a common vse in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome, vsed with al Iudges, whether it be for sentence of death, or other matters of iustice, as hath béene told you many times before.</p>
                  <p>Thrée dayes after the visitor was come thither, the <hi>Insuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> departed for his owne house, with order that with all spéede possible he should ordaine shippes wherin the <hi>Castillias</hi> should returne vnto the <hi>Philippinas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise the same day, all those that were there assembled by the order of the vizroy departed vnto their owne houses. And the Spaniards were commanded for to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

many banquets, as vppon newyeares day, as hath béene tolde diffusedly.</p>
                  <p>The day before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> departure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards, there came some in behalfe of the vizroy to inuite them, and made them banquet in the order and fashion as at the first: although this (for that it was at their departure) was more sumptuous, wherein was represented a comedie which was very excellent &amp; good, whose argument was first declared vnto them as followeth.</p>
                  <p>There was a young man newly married, and there chanced difference betwixt him and his wife, hee determined to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certaine warres, the which was ordained in a countrie not farre from that whereas he dwelled: whose acts and déeds was therein so valorous, that the king did shewe him great fauour, and being fully certified of his worthinesse, he sent him for chief Captaine of the most importunate enterprises that might bée offered, who did accomplish his charge with conclusion thereof with great content and satisfaction to the king and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailers: for the which he made him his captaine generall, and in his absence did commit vnto his charge his whole campe, with the same authoritie that he had himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The warres being doone, and hee hauing a desire to returne vnto his owne countrie and house, there was giuen vnto him thrée cart loads of golde, and many iewels of an inestimable price, with the which hee entered into his owne countrie with great honour and riches, wheras they receiued him with great honour.</p>
                  <p>All the which they did represent so naturally, &amp; with so good apparell and personages, that it séemed a thing to passe in act. There was not in this banket the vizroy, but those captaines which were there the first time: and another captaine vnto whome was giuen the charge to bring the Spaniards vnto <hi>Manilla,</hi> who was called <hi>Chautalay,</hi> a principall Captaine of that prouince.</p>
                  <p>So when the banquet was ended, they were carried with great company from the hall whereas the banquet was made, vnto the house of the <hi>Cogontoc,</hi> who was the kings tresuror and dwelt there hard by, of whom they were maruellously wel receiued, with louing words and great curtesie: in saying that he hoped very shortly to sée them againe, at such time as they

These visitations and leaue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king being doone, they returned vnto their lodging with great desire for to toke their ease, whereas they remained til the next day following, wherin they departed vnto the port of <hi>Tansuso,</hi> after they had remained in <hi>Aucheo</hi> seuen and forty daies.</p>

                  <p>THe Spaniards departed from the Citie of <hi>Aucheo</hi> vpon a Tewsday, being the 23. of August in the sight of all the

people of the Citie, who came foorth to sée them with so great presse and thronge, as they did when they first came thither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the countrie: they were al carried in litter chaires, yea their verie slaues, for that it was so commaunded by the vizroy: the Friers were carried by eight men a péece, and the souldiers by foure men a péece, and all their seruants and slaues were caried by two men a péece. Looke so many men as was to carrie them, there went so many more to help them when they waxed wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, besides foure and twentie that carried their stuffe. There went alwayes before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a harbinger for to prouide their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp; with him went a paimaster, whose charge was to ordain &amp; prouide men for to cary their litter chaires, &amp; to giue them for their trauell that which is accustomed, &amp; to pay all costs &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges spent by the Spaniard. After that they departed from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheo</hi> they made of two daies iourney one, which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they came to <hi>Chincheo</hi> in foure daies.

They obayed his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, &amp; made so much haste y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in two dayes they came vnto the village of <hi>Tangoa,</hi> wheras they had bin before, &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mention made thereof. In the same village they were lodged, wel entertained and had great good chéere: from thence they went in one day to <hi>Tansuso,</hi> which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first port wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they did disembarke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, when as they came from the Ilands vnto that firme land: the Iustice of the town did lodge them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same house whereas they were first lodged, &amp; did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them of all things necessary &amp; néedfull, &amp; that in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, til y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming of the <hi>Insuanto,</hi> which was within foure dayes after, for that he could not come any sooner (although his desire was) for that it was very foule weather.</p>
                  <p>The next day after his comming thither which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thirde of September, he sent and commanded the Spaniards that they should imbarke themselues, for that it was that day the coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the moone (although at that time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ships were not fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3380:117"/>
made sacrifice with certain Orations and praiers, in the which they craued of the heauens to giue good and faire weather, and a sure voyage and fauorable seas vnto al those that saile in those shippes.</p>
                  <p>This ceremony being done (which is a thing very much vsed in that countrie) the Spaniards went vnto the <hi>Insuanto,</hi> who was there with great company and maiestie: hee entertained them very friendly and with chéerefull words making an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew that hee bare them great loue, and that their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was vnto him a great griefe. Then hee requested them to giue him a remembrance of such thinges as was necessarie and néedfull for their prouision for the sea, for that hee woulde giue order for the prouiding of the same, the which he did, and was with so great aboundance that they had for the voyage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a great deale to spare. Hee then commaunded to bee brought thither cates to eat, and drinke, and gaue it them with his owne hands, as well the one as the other: hee himselfe did eate and drinke with them, which is the greatest fauour that can be shewed amongst them.</p>
                  <p>The banquet being ended, he commaunded them in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to go abord their shippes, because that was a luckie day, and also to accomplish that which the vizroy had commaunded, which was that they should not depart from thence, vntil they had first séene them imbarked. The Spaniards obeyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and tooke their leaue of the <hi>Insuanto</hi> with great curtesie and reuerence, and with outward shewes that they remained indebted for the great curtesie and good will that they had receiued: and therewith they departed to the waters side, towards the boat which was tarrying for them.</p>
                  <p>As they passed by the religious men (that before we spake of) they saw a great table set,<note place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>They being imbarked in the boate, they were carried aborde the Admirall, which was the shippe appointed for them to go in: then presently they beganne to stirre the shippe, from one place vnto another with certain boates and cables which they had there readie for the same purpose. The shippe did not so
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3380:117"/>
soone begin to moue, but the religious men a shore did beginne their sacrifice, the which did indure vntill night, ending their feastes and triumphes in putting forth of the cittie, and vppon their gates many cressets and lights. The souldiers shot off all their hargabushes, and the ships that were in the port shot off all their artilerie, and on the shore a great noise of droms and bels: all the which being ended and done, the Spaniards went a shore againe vnto their lodging: but first the <hi>Insuanto</hi> was departed vnto his owne house, with all the company that hee brought with him.</p>
                  <p>The next day the sayd <hi>Insuanto</hi> did inuite them vnto a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, which was as famous as any which had bene made them vnto that time. He was at the banquet himselfe, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine generall of all that prouince. There was aboundance of meates and many pretie deuises to passe away the time, which made the banquet to indure more then foure houres: the which being done, there was brought forth the present which the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suanto</hi> did sende vnto the gouernor of <hi>Manilla</hi> in returne of that which was sent to him. The present was fourtéene pieces of silke for the gouernor of <hi>Manilla,</hi> and tenne péeces for the generall of the field: hee also commanded to be giuen vnto the Friers each of them foure péeces, and vnto the souldiers each of them two péeces, and vnto their seruants and slaues certaine painted mantels, and there with he tooke his leaue of them very friendly, and gaue vnto them letters, the which hee had wrote vnto the gouernor, &amp; vnto the general of the field, answere vnto those, the which they had wrote vnto him, &amp; said that all things necessarie for their departure was in a redinesse, with victuals for ten monethes put a bord their ships, so that when as winde and wether did serue they might depart. Also that if in their voyage it should so fall out, that any of the <hi>Chinos</hi> that went in their shippes, shoulde do vnto them any euill, either abr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Spaniards did kisse his hands, and said, that they had receiued in curtesie more then they deserued, &amp; that in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3380:118"/>
all thinges, there did abound and not lacke, that they remained greatly indetted vnto him for their friendship, and would giue their king notice thereof, that whensoeuer occasion shoulde bee offered, to repay them with the like: and therewith the <hi>Insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anto</hi> departed to his owne house, leauing in the companie of the Spaniards fiue captaines, those which should go with them in their company to sea, and also <hi>Omoncon</hi> and <hi>Sinsay,</hi> who were that day in the banquet, with the habite and ensigne of <hi>Loytias,</hi> for that the day before it was giuen vnto them by the <hi>Insuanto.</hi>

                  <p>Upon Wednesday which was the fourtéenth of September the wind came faire, wherewith they hoised vp their sailes and went to sea: at their departure there was at the waters side the <hi>Insuanto</hi> and the Iustice of <hi>Chincheo</hi> to sée them saile, the which <hi>Insuanto</hi> had conceiued so great loue and friendship of the <hi>Castillas,</hi> that when he saw them depart, he shedde great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of teares, as was affirmed by diuers <hi>Chinos</hi> that saw it, to which the Spaniards gaue credite vnto, for that they knew him to be a maruellous louing person, and humaine, of a good condition, and of a gallant personage, and did excéede all other that they had séene in all the time of their being in that prouince.</p>

Within a smal space they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3380:118"/>
ariued there, and it had a very faire and sure port, wherein might ride in securitie a great Nauy of ships. All Thursday they were there recreating and sporting themselues, for that it was a pleasant Ilande, and full of fresh riuers. Uppon Friday being the sixtéenth of September, the day being somwhat spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they made saile and tooke port foure leagues from that place in another Ilande called <hi>Laulo,</hi> for to put themselues in a newe course different and contrary vnto that which they brought when as they came vnto that kingdome, for that the <hi>Chinos</hi> had by experience prooued, that in those monethes the windes were more fauorable then in other monethes, and for the most part North and Northeast winds: al that night they remained in that Iland, and the next day following they sailed vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iland which was called <hi>Chautubo,</hi> not farre distant from that of <hi>Laulo.</hi> This Ilande was full of little townes, one of them was called <hi>Gautin</hi> which had fiue fortes of towers made of lime and stone, verie thicke and strongly wrought: they were all foure square, and sixe fatham high, and were made of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose for to receiue into them al the people of those little townes to defend themselues from rouers and théeues that daylie come on that coast.

                  <p>They verie much noted, that although this Ilande were rockie and sandie, yet was it tilled and sowed full of Rice, Wheate, and other séedes and graine. There was in it great store of Kine and Horse,<note place="margin">Mine kine and horse.</note> and they vnderstoode that they were gouerned, not by one particular man, to whom they were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, neither by any other amongst themselues, nor of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> but in common: yet notwithstanding they liued in great peace and quietnesse, for that euerie one did content himselfe with his owne. Uppon sunday in the afternoone they departed from this Ilande, and sailed their course all

that night, and the next morning they ariued at another Iland called <hi>Corchu,</hi> which was twentie leagues from the port of <hi>Tansuso</hi> from whence they departed. The Spaniards séeing what leasure they tooke in this their voyage, they requested the Captaines to commaunde the marriners that they shoulde not enter into so many portes or harbors, for that they had no certaintie of the weather, and not to detract the time, but to take oportunitie before that contrarie weather do come: for to saile in that order it seemed more for recreation then to achiue or obtaine a voyage. The Captaines answered, and requested them to haue patience, for that in making their iournies as they did, they doo accomplish and follow the order set downe by the vizroy and <hi>Insuanto,</hi> who did expressely commaunde them with great charge for to direct their Nauigation by those Ilands with great deliberation and consideration, because they might in safetie and health ariue at <hi>Manilla.</hi>

                  <p>The same day the North winde beganne to blowe verie strongly: in such sort, that they thought it not good to go forth of that harbor (as well for that aforesaid,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chinos</hi> are fearefull of the sea.</note> to be commanded to the contrarie) as also for that the <hi>Chinos</hi> are very searefull of the sea, and men that are not accustomed to ingulfe themselues too farre, neither to passe anie stormes.</p>
                  <p>Néere vnto this Iland there was another somewhat bigger, which is called <hi>Ancon,</hi> wholly dispeopled and without anie dwellers, yet a better countrie and more profitable for to sowe and reape then that of <hi>Corchu.</hi> The Spaniards being at an anker there, vnderstood by the <hi>Chinos</hi> that in times past it was very well inhabited, vnto the which ariued a great fléete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the king of <hi>China,</hi> &amp; by a great storme were all cast away vpon the same: the which losse and destruction being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by another generall that had the guard of that cost, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting that the dwellers thereof had done that slaughter, he came to the shore and slew many of the inhabitants, and caried all the rest in their ships vnto the firme lande, who afterwards would neuer returne thither againe, although they gaue them licence after that they vnderstoode the truth of that successe: so that vnto that time it remained dispeopled and full of wilde swine, of the broode that remained there at such time as they were slaine and caried away as you haue heard.</p>

The captaines Chinos ariued with the Spaniardes at the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Manilla, the Gouernor and those of the citie doo receiue them with great ioy and triumphes, and after they had remained there certaine dayes, they returned vnto the firme land, being instructed and satisfied of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things touching our holy catholike faith, with great desire to receiue the same.</head>
                  <p>AFter that it was knowen vnto the Gouernor of the citie of <hi>Manilla</hi> and vnto the generall of the fielde as also vnto the rest of the captaines and souldiers of the ariuall of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes, whom they with great care desired to heare of, as well for the particular loue they deare vnto them as also for to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and heare the newes from that mightie kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> to be declared by witnesses of so great faith and credite. They altogether went foorth to receiue them with great ioye and pleasure, and likewise all such captaynes and souldiers as came in their companie.</p>
                  <p>They were straightwaies conueighed vnto their lodginges to rest themselues of their long iourney which they had by sea, for it was requisite and néedefull: for the which afterwardes there was great feastes and bankets, which was made by the Gouernor, the generall of the field and other particular persons vnto the <hi>Chinos,</hi> in recompence of that which was done vnto the Spaniards in their countrie.</p>
                  <p>All which feastes did giue them little content when as they did remember the flying and escape of the Rouer, but in especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Omoncon</hi> and <hi>Sinsay,</hi> who continually &amp; euery moment did call vpon the generall of their fleete to make haste &amp; to shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the time that they might depart from the firme land, where giuing notice vnto the Gouernor of <hi>Chincheo</hi> of the estate of <hi>Limahon,</hi> he might giue order that before he had reedified and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3380:122"/>
repayred himselfe they might take him (which is a thing most desired in all that kingdome). The generall was verie glad, and reioyced of their good intertainement, and answered vnto <hi>Omoncon</hi> &amp; <hi>Sinsay,</hi> saying that by reason of the great storme and foule weather past, their ships had great néede of reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and likewise the marriners to ease themselues, the which being done he would with all his heart depart.</p>
                  <p>The generall of the fielde was verie sorrowfull and much gréeued for that the Rouer <hi>Limahon</hi> was so escaped, and the more when he vnderstoode that he was suspected that hee did consent vnto his departure: for which occasion, if that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes had not béene verie much wearied with the long siege, and euill weather which happened in that time, without all doubt he would haue followed him, and neuer to haue left him till he had taken or slaine him.</p>
                  <p>Although they were fully perswaded that <hi>Limahon</hi> was so terrified with the great perill and danger in the which he was, and againe with so small number of people, that rather hee would desire to put himselfe in securitie then to offende or doo any harme, neyther to put himselfe in any place whereas hee might receiue damage of any of them to whom hee had doone so open wrong (who were so much desirous to be reuenged) who for to preuent all that might happen (as after we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode) hauing made readie his barkes and boates which he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned in his fort, and put in them victualles for their iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he departed with his small number of people, vnto an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande farre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now returning to our purpose, after that the <hi>China</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines had recreated them selues with the feastes and sportes that was made vnto them, and taken recreation many dayes, and tarryed hoping that the weather would proue fayrer to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3380:122"/>
prepare themselues to depart. In the same time they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of many thinges in particular touching Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof with great care they did informe themselues of our religious men, and tolde them some secret things that were vnknowen vnto them of their countrie, for that they were strangers.</p>
                  <p>So when as time and weather did serue, they did take their leaue, with many signes and tokens of griefe for to depart and leaue the conuersation of so good companions, and did promise vnto them to procure all that was possible that the friendshippe begunne betwixt them and the <hi>Chinos,</hi> should continue and perseuer, for that it was a thing that did content them all.</p>
                  <p>Their generall himselfe did take this particular charge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe, with a determinate purpose for to declare in effect to the Gouernour of <hi>Aucheo</hi> (whose priuate seruant he was) the good meaning of the <hi>Castillos,</hi> and what principall people they were, and the ceremonies they vsed, with the which hee was marueilously in loue. Likewise hee would giue him to vnderstande of the flying of the Rouer <hi>Limahon,</hi> how and in what manner and order it was, and how that the generall of the field and the other captaines were in no fault thereof. This he would do in respect that if it should so fall out that <hi>Omon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> and <hi>Sinsay</hi> for their owne credite should declare any thing against the Spaniardes that was not true, that they might not be beléeued.</p>
                  <p>Besides all this he tolde the Gouernour certaine thinges in secret, how they might with great ease purchase the friendship they pretended.

                  <p>This law was made to take away nouelties, and to liue all in one vniformitie of religion, with one manner of rites and ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>This only was the occasion that certaine marchants of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> being affectioned vnto the law of the gospell, were baptised at the <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and there doo dwell at this day in the citie of <hi>Manilla</hi> amongest the Spaniardes, and are become verie good Christians.</p>
                  <p>So with these offers and with promises to be great friendes vnto the Spaniardes, the Generall departed from <hi>Manilla</hi> to goe vnto the firme lande, and with him the other Captaynes <hi>Omoncon</hi> and <hi>Sinsay</hi> with great hope that verie shortly they should be all of one faith. So the one tooke their leaue of the other with reasons of great affection and tokens of great loue signifying that in any thing that should be offered they should finde them friendly.</p>
                  <p>They being departed, the Spaniardes remayned verie care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in praying vnto the diuine maiestie, desiring of him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all thinges in this their request, that it might be to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seruice, and also to inspire the catholike maiestie of king Phillip their Lorde for to sende his Embassador vnto the king of <hi>China,</hi> offering his friendship, and to admonish him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He day of the visitation of our Ladie in the yeare 1578. there came out of Spaine to the Citie of <hi>Manilla</hi> in the Ilandes <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinas,</hi> the father Fryer Peter <hi>de Alfaro,</hi> who, went for <hi>Costodio</hi> of that prouince and fourteene more other religious persons of the same order in his companie, and were sent by the king of Spaine and his royall Counsel of the Indias, for to be ayders and helpers of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten Fryers, who vntill that time had béene there alone in those Ilandes, occupied in the conuerting of the people in that countrie, and were the first ministers of the gospell, preaching the same with great zeale, vnto the profite of their soules: of the which people, those Fryers had baptised (when the others ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) more then one hundred thousande, and the rest prepared and cathecised to receiue the like. Because that at the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that might be giuen, they might enter into the kingdome of <hi>China</hi> to preach the holy gospell. The which Fryers when
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:3380:124"/>
that they had béen there the space of one yeare occupying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the same exercise in preaching and conuerting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that countrie. In the same time they were giuen to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande by the relation of the selfe same Austen Fryers, as also by many marchants of <hi>China,</hi> which came vnto them with marchandice, of things to be wondred at of that mightie king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of the infinite number of soules which the diuell had deceiued and brought vnto his seruice with false Idolatrie. The which being by them well vnderstood, they did burne with great zeale and desire of their saluation, and to goe and preach the gospell, although it were to put their persons in whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hazarde or danger.</p>
                  <p>So with this their great desire, they did many and diuerse times communicate with the gouernor that was there at that time for his maiestie, who was called the Doctor <hi>Francisco de Sandi,</hi> desiring his fauour and licence for to goe vnto <hi>China</hi> in the companie of certaine marchants of that countrie, that were at that present in the port with their ships, offering themselues to get their good will, although it were to offer themselues to be slaues or otherwise whatsoeuer. And séeing that at all such times when as they did intreat of that matter, they found him but luke warme, and that he did (as it were) but to detract the time, and feed them with hope. then they calling to minde, that the chiefest intent and cause of their comming out of Spayne, was to enter into that kingdome, caused a newe desire to grow in them, what with the contractation they had with the sayde <hi>Chinos,</hi> as well in conuersation as in talke, and finding them to be a people of great abilitie and discretion, and of verie good iudgements, the which did greatly content their desire, they did perswade themselues that it was an easie matter to make them to vnderstande the thinges appertayning vnto God. So that they determined to put other remedies in practise, because that which they required with the good will of the Gouernor, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be a large and long matter. So it happened that vpon a time intreating of this matter, and hauing requested of God with great instance for to direct them the readie way which was best for his seruice, and for the profite of those soules, there came to the Ilandes <hi>Philippinas</hi> a <hi>Chino,</hi> who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they did vnderstand, was one of the priests &amp; religious
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3380:125"/>
men of that kingdome (of the which priestes there are a great number in euerie towne) this priest went diuerse times vnto the monasterie of the Fryers, and did common with them of the creation of the worlde and other things which did open the way that they might declare vnto him thinges appertayning vnto God, vnto the which he did harken with great good will. And after that hee had declared vnto them in particular the mightinesse and secretes of this mightie kingdome of <hi>China</hi> (whose conuersion they so greatly desired) he very inquisitiuely asked of them matters touching the Christian faith, of whome within a fewe dayes after he desired to be baptised, for that he would be a Christian, being instructed before in many matters touching our catholike faith.</p>
                  <p>Our religious men did accomplish his desire, the which was an incredible ioy vnto all the dwellers of the Citie, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vnto himselfe.</p>
                  <p>So after that he was made a Christian hee remayned in the monasterie amongest the other, but yet would he neuer eate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thing but colde herbes:<note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards rise at thei midnight mattens and whip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</note> and he séeing that all the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men did arise vp at midnight to mattens and discipline themselues, spending the greatest part of the night in prayer before the holy sacrament, hee did not faile one point, but did imitate them in all their dooings, with outwarde showes of a verie good will. All the which did incyte the Fryer <hi>Costodio</hi> and al the rest of his companions to put in execution their great desire they had, according as it hath beene tolde you. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he went once againe vnto the gouernour to intreat him by faire meanes that which before they had comoned with him of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he would procure some order or meanes, that those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men might go to the kingdome of <hi>China</hi> to preach the lawe of God, offering himselfe to be one of them, with prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station that if he would not giue them leaue, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to goe without it, with that authoritie the which hee had of God and of his superiors, for to teach and instruct these poore Infidels their neighbors: and this should be done with the first oportunitie they might finde or haue.</p>
                  <p>But neither this, nor yet the example of that good <hi>Chino,</hi> which was newe christened was sufficient to perswade the gouernor to consent vnto their request, but peseuering in his
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3380:125"/>
first opinion, he answered and said, that it was too timely, and that the friendship which they had with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Chinos,</hi> as yet was very small. And how that the fathers of S. Austen had manie times attempted the entrie into that kingdome, and yet neuer could obtaine their desire. And howe that the <hi>Chinos</hi> that did carrie them did deceiue them, and left them in certaine Ilands, till such time as they heard farther newes of the Rouer <hi>Lima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hon,</hi> and of the returne of the Captaine <hi>Omoncon,</hi> who did carrie them with the good newes of the straight siege in the which they had the rouer: and yet for all that they commanded them to returne from <hi>Aucheo,</hi> without giuing them anie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to remaine in the countrie to preach the holy gospell, and nowe to attempt the same, was but to giue occasion vnto the <hi>Chinos</hi> euerie day to mocke and make a iest of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, and willed them to staye till such time, as it were the will of God to giue way vnto the same, which could not be long.</p>
                  <p>This Fryer <hi>Costodio</hi> vnderstanding the answere of the Gouernour, perseuering still in his first opinion, and did not goe about to séeke any meanes to accomplish their desire for the entring into the firme lande, hee straightwayes beganne se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to procure by all meanes possible to attempt and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish that iourney, although it were without the order and consent of the Gouernour (when that it might not be doone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise) the which incontinent they beganne to put in vre, for that the Fryer <hi>Costodio</hi> and Fryer Steuen <hi>Ortiz</hi> (who was a religious man that for the great desire he had, did learne the <hi>China</hi> tongue, and at that time did speake it resonablie) they both together did giue to vnderstande of their desire and pretence vnto a deuout souldier of their religion and one that they made great account of, who was called Iohn <hi>Dias Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> who often times had made manifest vnto them and saide, thae he had a great desire to doo some especiall seruice vnto God, although it were to hazarde his life in the same, who at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant did accomplish his desire, and did promise them to beare them companie vnto the death.</p>
                  <p>So with this conformitie they went straightwayes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to speake with a Captaine of <hi>China</hi> that was in the same port in a shippe of his owne, who many times did repayre
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3380:126"/>
vnto their couent, to aske of them thinges appertayning vnto God, and the heauens, with showe of a very good vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who vnto their iudgement did consent and accept all with great pleasure and delight.</p>
                  <p>Unto this captayne they did giue to vnderstande the effect of all their desire, requesting him of his ayde and helpe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of the same. Who straightwayes did offer himselfe to accomplish their request and to carrie them vnto <hi>China,</hi> so as they woulde then giue him some thing for to bestowe amongest his marriners. The souldier Iohn <hi>Diaz Pardo</hi> did promise to giue them all that they would aske, and gaue them in earnest certaine ryalles of plate. And for that all thinges shoulde bée doone in good order, and in such sort that the Gouernour nor any other shoulde haue any suspition or knowledge, it was ordayned amongest them that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>China</hi> should with all spéede dispatch himselfe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the port of <hi>Bindoro,</hi> which is twentie leagues from the citie of <hi>Manilla</hi> and there to tarrie for them, and to carrie in his companie the <hi>Chino</hi> that was new baptised as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>The captaine made haste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dispatched himselfe and departed vnto the port appointed, &amp; within a fewe dayes after the father <hi>Costodio</hi> and his company with the souldier his friend did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But when they came thether they found the captaine <hi>Chino</hi> in an other mind, in such sort, that neither gifts nor faire intreatie was sufficient to perswad him, to performe that which he had promised in <hi>Manilla,</hi> but returned vnto them their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest before receiued, affirming that for any thing in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world he would not carrie them, for that he knowe very well, if hee should so doo, it would cost him his life and goods.</p>
                  <p>The newe baptised religious <hi>Chino</hi> séeing that, wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, with discontentment to sée how the diuell had changed the minde of the Captaine, for that in that kingdome the holie gospell should not be preached. The father <hi>Costodio</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue himselue to returne vnto <hi>Manilla</hi> and there to abide a better oportunitie, as in effect they did, whereas they remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned certayne dayes, till such time it happened as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Upon a day the Gouernour sent and called vnto him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Costodio,</hi> and requested of him, that he would let him haue some Fryer for to sende vnto the riuer of <hi>Cagayan,</hi> whether
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3380:126"/>
not long before he had sent certaine Spaniards for to inhabite.</p>
                  <p>The fryer <hi>Costodio</hi> promised him one, and that he should go with him in companie till he came to the prouince of <hi>Illocos</hi> whether he went, and that from thence he would dispatch him vnto the riuer of <hi>Cagayan,</hi> according vnto his worships com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, requesting of him to haue in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie to kéepe watch &amp; warde in that iourney the ensigne <hi>Francisco de Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennas</hi> &amp; Iohn <hi>Diaz Pardo</hi> the souldier his friend as aforesaide, with pretence to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence vnto <hi>China,</hi> as in effect they did, as shall be tolde you. The gouernor being very willing for to pleasure him, did grant his request. So with great spéede he departed, and carried with him the foresaide souldiers, and for companion a religious man called Frier Austin <hi>de Tordesil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> (he who afterwards did put in memorie all thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> passed with them in <hi>China</hi>) out of the which hath béene taken this small relation. So when they came vnto the <hi>Illocos,</hi> they found fryer Iohn <hi>Baptista</hi> and fryer <hi>Sebastian</hi> of S. Francis, of his owne order, occupied in the teaching and instructing the people of that prouince, which was the fourth day of Iune. The next day following they called a counsell, where it was concluded that all those that were there present would venture themselues for to go vnto <hi>China,</hi> to conuert those Gentiles or else to die in the quarrell. And the better to bring their purpose to passe, they thought it good to speake vnto an other souldier that was there with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called <hi>Pedro de villa Roel,</hi> not telling vnto him their pretence because they would not be discouered (but asked him in this manner) if he would beare him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie &amp; the other two souldiers, who altogether went about a busines of great honour and seruice of God, and the benefite &amp; sauing of many soules, and that he would declare vnto them whether he would go or not, without asking whether nor from wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t place, for that as then they could not giue him to vnderstand, till time did serue. His answere was, that straightwaies he would beare them companie, and would neuer leaue them to death.</p>
                  <p>So foorthwith they all together with singular ioy went to the ship wherin the father <hi>Costodio</hi> and his companion with the other two souldiers came in fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Manilla</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place with a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Frigat, although but with fewe marriners, &amp; they not verie expert. So being altogether in the shippe, with all such
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3380:127"/>
thinges as they could get together in that small time for their prouision in that iourney, they made all thinges in a readinesse to set sayle the same day which was the twelfth day of the say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o direct their voyage that it might be to his glorie and seruice, they set sayle vppon a fryday in the morning, with intent to goe foorth of that port, but they could not by no meanes possible, for that the sea went verie loftie vpon the barre, and contending with the sea for to get foorth they were in great danger to haue béene cast away, which was the occasion that with great sorrow they returned into the port, whereas they remayned all day.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. The Fryers and their companions depart from the port of Illocos, after they had committed vnto God the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their voyage. They passe great daungers and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, &amp; do ouercome them all with the confidence they haue in God, and came vnto the kingdome of China mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously.</head>
                  <p>SO the next day after they had committed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to God with great deuotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they embarked themselues and made sayle, and by the will of God they went out of the harbour although with great danger, &amp; they carryed with them an other barke a sterne their ship, in the which they did determine for to set a lande such <hi>Indians</hi> as they carried with them from the <hi>Esquipazon,</hi> to helpe them out of the harbour. the which they did not for feare they should be drowned.

So those which should go on that voyage remained there the same night, who were the frier <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodio,</hi> frier Peter <hi>de Alfaro</hi> borne in Siuel, frier Iohn <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tista,</hi> borne in <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There were thrée Spaniards souldiers that did beare them companie, the one was called the ancient, <hi>Francisco de Duennas,</hi> of <hi>Velez Malaga,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iohn <hi>Diaz Pardo</hi> of Saint <hi>Lucas de Barameda</hi> the third <hi>Pedro de Villa-roel</hi> of the Citie of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Besides these they had a boy of <hi>China,</hi> who could speake the spanish tongue, and was one of them that were taken at the siege of <hi>Limahon</hi> the Rouer, and other foure <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Manilla.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They departed from this little Ilande, vpon a munday the first quarter in the morning, which was the fiftéene day of the said moneth of Iune, and sayled that way, so nigh as they could gesse to be the way vnto <hi>China,</hi> without pilot or any other certaintie, more then that which God did shewe and put into their mindes, with their great desire, which séemed vnto them to comprehende and bring it to passe. This day the winde was contrarie and against them, which was the occasions that they sayled but little. Towardes the euening the winde changed and blewe at the north (the which winde vppon that coast is verie dangerous) which made them greatly afrayde: yet was that feare driuen away by an other feare much greater then that, which was that they should be discouered, and that they should be pursued by the commandement of the gouernour of <hi>Manilla</hi>: for which occasion whereas they should haue shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselues vnder the land, they wrought contrary, and cast about vnto the sea in great danger to haue béene cast away, but it was the will of God that when as night came the winde did calme (which commonly falleth out to the contrary) but the sea remayned very rough and loftie that they thought verily to haue béene drowned with the furie thereof, for it tossed the <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatta</hi> in such sort that it séemed a whole legion of diuels had taken holde on both sides of the shippe forcing the one against the other, that it rowled in such sort that many times the halfe

But the religious men trusting in God, whose zeale had caused them this great trouble, did pray and desire him with many teares that hee would deliuer them out of the same daunger: and not to giue place vnto the diuell for to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe them of their voyage and enterprise.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>In this gut there was thrée other ships and they came to an anker in the middest amongest them, the which beeing done they asked of them what countrie that was, but they answered nothing, nor made any semblance, but looked the one vpon the other, &amp; in beholding of the Spaniards they gaue great laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In this gut they remained all that night almost amased to sée how those people were as though they were inchanted, and they without any light of their desire, which was to knowe wher they were. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day folowing (which was saterday) verie early in the morning they set sayle and went amongest a great sort of Ilandes alwayes bearing vnto them, which they thought to be the firme lande, being greatly amarueiled to sée the infinite number of shippes both great and small that they sawe: some were a fishing, and some vnder sayle, and other some ryding at an anker. The same day about noone there happened vnto them a strange &amp; miraculous thing, and it was, that passing through a straight that was but a quarter of a league of bredth which was betwixt the firme lande and a small Ilande, in the which was continually foure score ships of warre, sette there for watch and warde, they passed thorough the thickest of them and were neuer seene, for if they hadde, without all doubt they had sonke them, or slaine them, their order and commission is so straight giuen them by their generalles of the sea, in the which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that whatsoeuer kinde of people of strange nations that they do méete vpon the coast for to kill them or sinke them,

                  <p>This lawe for to watch and warde was made and ordayned (as they do say) in respect of the <hi>Iapones</hi> who did enter into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of their portes, dissembling themselues to be <hi>Chinos,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparelled as they were and speaking their language, they did vnto them great and strange hurtes and damages, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the booke before this. So when they were passed this straight they sayled almost sixe leagues forwardes into a verie fayre and great bay, following other shippes that went before them, for that it seemed that they would enter into some port, and there they might informe themselues where they were, which was the thing that they most desired. When they had sayled about two leagues in this bay they ouertooke one of the thrée shippes and asked of the people that were within her (by the interpreter they had with them) whether they sayled and what lande that was which they sawe before them. Then the principall that was in that ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did put himselfe into his boat, the which hee had at sterne, and came vnto the ship where the Spaniardes were, the better to vnderstande what they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for they before by reason that they were somewhat farre off the one from the other, could not vnderstande the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards demand but by signes. So when that he vnderstoode their request he answered them that it was the country of <hi>China,</hi> &amp; how that he came laden with salt from the citie of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> and went to make sale thereof vnto the citie of <hi>Canton,</hi> which was so nigh hand that they might ariue there before night. But when that hee was entred into the spanish ship &amp; saw the friers &amp; the rest that were in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie &amp; saw that their apparell &amp; spéech was strange vnto him, he asked of them what they were and from whence they came, &amp; whether they went (and when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he vnderstood y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were <hi>Castillos,</hi> &amp; of the Ilands <hi>Philippinas</hi> &amp; came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the said Ilands, &amp; were bound vnto <hi>China,</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to preach the holy gospell) he asked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose licence they had, to conduct them vnto the firme lande. But when he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that they had none, hee asked them howe they passed and escaped the fléete of ships that was in the straight aforesayde.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3380:129"/>
The Spaniards answered that they found no impediment nor let. So he being greatlie amazed as well of the one as of the other, entred into his owne boate, and with great furie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from their shippe, and went into his owne, but at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture the Spaniards did request him, that he would conduct them vnto the cittie, who gaue them to vnderstande by signes that he woulde, although he feared the rigorous punishment that in that kingdome is executed vppon all such as doo bring into the same any man of a strange nation (as hath béene tolde you in the first part of this historie.) So hee fearing that if hée shoulde enter with him into the port, the fault would be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, therefore at such time as hee came within halfe a league of the riuers mouth, he cast about his shippe and sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to sea, and went so farre that in a short time the Spaniards had lost the sight of them, who when they saw that they had no guide, they followed the course of another shippe that they had discouered before the other did cast about to sea, for which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the other two ships that wee spake off before were depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So a little before the sunne-set they discouered the mouth and entrie of a great and mightie brode riuer, out of the which came two great streames or armes, and in them many ships entering in and going forth, and considering how they had the winde which serued them well, they entered into the same, but when they had sailed forwards a quarter of a league, they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered so great a multitude of barkes, that it seemed vnto them a groue, or some inhabited place, and as wee drewe nigh vnto them, they not knowing our shippe, all began to flie and run away with so great noise, as though they should haue béene all set on fire or smoke in that place. The Spaniards séeing that they were the occasion of this feare amongst them, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themselues into the middest of the riuer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas they strooke saile and came to an anker, &amp; there they did ride all that night, and it was in such a place that none of al the other barks and boates came nigh them by a great way.</p>
                  <p>The next day following which was sunday, the one &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith day of Iune they weighed anker, and went vnder their foresaile vp that arme of the riuer, the which within a little while they had sailed, did ioine with the other arme aforesaide and was in that place of so great widenesse that it séemed to bée

a sea, there sailed in and out many shippes, barkes and boates of whome the Spaniards demaunded how farre the port was off from that place, but they answered nothing at all, but with great laughter and wonder to sée the Spaniards and their kind of attyre, they departed. But when they had sailed two leagues vp the riuer, they discouered a high towre and very faire vnder the which were at an anker a great number of shippes, thither they sailed right on. So when as they came right ouer against the towre, they saw on shore a great mighty crane to discharge merchandize withall, whereat lay many ships: but when they came to the point, fearing that some ordinance would be shot at them, they strooke all their sailes according vnto the vse &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ports of Spaine. They after a while that they had remained in that sort, &amp; saw that neither the towre nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ships did make any motion towards them, they turned and hoised vp againe their sailes and went wheras al the ships were, &amp; when they came amongst them, they let fall their anker wheras they did ride looking when they would come to demand of them any thing.</p>

                  <p>THe Spaniards séeing that they were there at an anker a good while, &amp; that there was none that came vnto them to demand any questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they hoised out their boate, &amp; went in it on shore, wheras they al knéeled downe vpon their knées, and with great deuotion did say <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> giuing thankes to God for that he had so myraculously brought them into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>China,</hi> of them so much desired, without any Pilot or other humane industrie: the which being doone, they began to walke along by the crane aforesaid, nigh vnto the which were certaine houses whereas were kept ropes and tackling belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto the shippes: so they procéeded forwards with intent to séeke the gates of the Citie, the which after they had gone the space of foure hargabus shot, they found the gate which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

great and sumptuous of a strong and gallant edifice. The people of the country séeing them at their comming a shore how they did knéele downe, and how that their manner of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire was different from the people of the same, &amp; not knowing from whence they did come, did cause in them great admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ioyne togither a great troope of people, and followed them with great desire to sée the end of their enterprise.</p>
                  <p>This great multitude of people was the occasion that they entred in at the gates of the Cittie, without being discouered of the guards &amp; ports that were put there for that purpose, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they disturbed of the entry, by reason of the great throng of people, and strangenesse of the matter. So after they had gone a while in the stréete (the people increasing more and more to sée them) they staied in the porch of a great house, there where as the iustices of the sea, or water bailies do kéepe their courts of audience: and in the meane time that they remained there, which was a pretty while, the guardes of the gate vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that amongst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presse &amp; throng of the people, did enter cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine strangers contrary to the precept giuen them vpon great penalties: they straightway with great feare that their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight should be discouered, ran &amp; laid hands vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards &amp; carried them backe againe, &amp; put them out of the gate of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, without doing any euil or harme vnto their persons, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to stay there in that place till such time as they had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernor of the Cittie to vnderstand thereof, &amp; he to send the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> licence that they may enter in againe. So after a good while that they had remained there wheras the guards had set them, there came vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man, who was a <hi>Chino</hi> called <hi>Canguin,</hi> and could speake Portugal: who knowing them to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by their faces &amp; attire, did aske them in the Portingal toong what they sought? y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards answered him, that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into that kingdom was for to shew &amp; declare to them the way to heauen, &amp; to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderstand &amp; know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true God, the creator of heauen &amp; earth: and that they would very faine talke with the gouernor to intreat therof. This <hi>Chino</hi> by &amp; by brought to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man that could speak very good Portuges, who as after they did vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d both he his wife &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened, and although they were borne in <hi>China,</hi> yet did they dwel 3. years with Portugals that were inhabited in <hi>Machao</hi>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:3380:131"/>
which is twenty leagues from that cittie of <hi>Canton.</hi> This did demande the same question of them that the other did, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came into that countrie? they answered him the same as they did the other: hee replied and asked them who was the Pilot that brought them thither? they answered, the will of God, they not knowing howe, nor from whence. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had sailed at the sea certaine dayes, they came vnto that place, that according as it was giuen them to vnderstande, is the cittie of <hi>Canton,</hi> of the which they haue heard declared ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny straunge thinges: the <hi>Chino</hi> asked howe the guardes of the sea and shippes that were in the straight aforesaid did let them passe: they answered that they saw no guards, nor any other that did trouble them their passage. This last answere did cause the Christian <hi>Chino</hi> greatly to admire, who being moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a good zeale, said vnto them, that they should returne againe vnto the shippe, and not to come forth vntill such time as he had giuen aduice of their comming vnto the <hi>Mandelines</hi> of the sea, which be certaine iudges appointed to giue aduice of all such matters to the gouernor, that he may command what is to be done therein.</p>
                  <p>So the Spaniards returned vnto the shippe whereas they remained a good while, and passed great heate, for that it dooth excéede in that port. So after a while they sawe come vnto a house which was néere vnto the gate of the Cittie, a man of great authoritie, who was brought in a litter Chaire, &amp; much people came with him: he stayed at that house, and from thence sent to call vnto him the religious men, and all the rest that came in their company: before them all came one that carried a table all whited, and thereon was written certaine great let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with blacke ynke, the which (as after they vnderstood) was the licence that the gouernor of the cittie gaue them for to come a shoore, without the which there is no stranger permitted. The fathers did straightwayes obey it, and came forth of their shippe with more companie then they desired (of such as came to sée them) who were so many in number, that although the sergeants and officers of the iudge that sent for them, did beate them for to make way, yet was it a good while before they coulde come vnto the house whereas the iudge was, although the way was but short. So when they approched nigh one of

Before him was set a table, whereon was paper and inke: and on the one side and the other two rankes of men, as though they were to guard him, yet without weapons. They had al of them in their hands long canes of foure fingers brode, with the which (as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they did vnderstand) they do beat su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to the last, touching who was their guide vnto that kingdome: they answered, that it was God, vnto whose will all creature are subiect, as vnto the true creator: all the which (as afterward it did appeare) the interpreter did not truely interpret of the interpretation of the Spaniards: vnderstanding that if hee should truely interpret what they saide, the Iudge would forthwith sende them away,

which would be the occasion that he shuld get nothing of them. So that he made his interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it best séemed for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, fearing (as after he did confesse) that if he shu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many dangers and stormes at the sea, according to the will of the heauens they came vnto this port, whose name as yet they knew not. The Iudge asked them where they had that <hi>Chino</hi> that they brought in their company for an interpreter. They answered that he was in <hi>Luzon</hi> &amp; captiue vnto a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard: they tooke him and set him frée, and hée vnderstanding that they were bound vnto the firme land of <hi>China</hi> which was his naturall countrie, he requested them to carrie him thither, the which they did with a very good will, for that they had neede of him to vtter their desire, if néede did so require. All the which the other interpreter fearing, that if he should tel vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge how that he was captiue vnto the Christians, hée woulde bée offended, and therefore hee did falsifie the same and saide, that comming vnto an Iland to take in fresh water, they found the boy there, where he was captiue eight yeares before, and came thither forced with a great storme, in the which was drowned a merchants shippe that was bound to <hi>Luzon,</hi> and he alone esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by swimming, and so hee came aborde the shippe, in the which were the fathers, not knowing whither they went. All these vntruthes he did inuent for to dissemble and go forwards with his knauish pretence, and would not declare the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:3380:132"/>
of the Friers: the which he had decréed with himselfe how to doo before the Iudge did sende to call them. Moreouer the Iudge did aske them what they brought in their small shippe, they answered that they brought nothing but one chest and two little fardels of bookes, and an ornament for to say masse. This did the interpreter declare truely vnto the Iudge, for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience might be made thereof. So the Iudge forthwith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that it should be brought before him, the which being done, he caused it to be vndone, and he perused euery thing by it selfe, the which being strange vnto him, for that he neuer saw the like: he made signes vnto them that he receiued great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in the séeing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but specially of the Images they brought: but that which did best please him, was an <hi>Ara</hi> or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre-altar of a blacke stone, the which did shine so bright that they might sée themselues therein, as well as in a glasse. These Friers did bring the same with them out of the kingdome of <hi>Mexico,</hi> whereas you haue great aboundance, but specially in the prouince of <hi>Mechuacan.</hi> So after that hee had seene all, and sawe that it was drie, without any signe or token that it had béene in the sea, hée called to remembrance the wordes of the interpreter in the name of the fathers, touching the storme wherein their shippe was cast away, and howe that they esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by swimming, and put themselues in that small shippe in the which they came: and considering of the same, it séemed vnto him that they did fable in that which they had saide: so that he did replie and asked if it were true that which they had before declared, and howe it shoulde bee that their bookes and other things were not wet at the sea, which was an euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and plainely to be vnderstood that they had fabled and told lies, and so he beléeued they did in all the rest. The interpreter fearing least by that argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his falshod would be discouered, he fel in talke a while w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Friers, asking &amp; answering things very different to that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a strange &amp; sharpe boldnes answered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difficulty propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge, &amp; said, That as all merchants at such time as their shippes are readie to sinke and to be lost, they doo procure first to saue such thinges as are of most estimation, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the rest: euen so these religious men did procure with great care and diligence to saue those books and that ornament,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3380:133"/>
which is all their treasure, and yet for all their diligences done they lost a great number mo. All these fables and lies, after many dayes the religious fathers came to haue the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of.</p>
                  <p>The Iudge did aske them if they brought any armor or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in their shippe, they answered that they were no men to bring them, neither according vnto their profession they coulde not weare nor vse them, for that they were religious, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed other matters contrary vnto the vse of armor or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, promising and auowing vnto God perpetuall pouertie and chastitie, and vnto their superior prelates obedience all the dayes of their liues. The Iudge returned and asked them if they had any monie, and where withall they did eate and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell themselues, and bought those bookes and ornaments: they answered, that all that which they had was giuen them by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Christians for Gods sake, whome they did serue, for that they should pray for them and for the saluation of their soules.</p>
                  <p>The Iudge when he heard this, was greatly astonied for that the interpreter did declare the truth, and made signes that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued griefe and had pittie on them, although he gaue not full credite to that which he heard, but said that he would go aborde their shippe to sée if they did say the truth, in not bringing anie armor or weapon, neither siluer nor merchandize. This did hée straightwayes put in vre, and commaunded them that brought him in the litter Chaire, vppon their shoulders to go thitherward: all those people did beare him companie, as also a great number that were there ioyned togither to heare the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of those strangers, and also the Spaniards he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go next vnto him.</p>
                  <p>So when that he was in their shippe set in his Chaire, his ministers beganne to search the shippe in all places, both aboue and below, and could finde nothing but a little Rice, which was left of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in their heads and beardes. Then he beganne to demaunde of them certaine thinges, more of curiositie then of suspection: who answered him, casting vp their eies vnto heauen (for that their talke was thereof) &amp; they saw that the Iudge did greatly reioyce and had pleasure therein, for that it séemed that they had the heauens for their God, as they haue, by reason they did so much looke vpwards. After this the Iudge came foorth of the shippe, but the religious men remained behind at his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement with his companions: and likewise hee commaunded certaine of those officers that came with him to remaine about their ship at the waters side, for their guard, more for that none should doo to them any harme, then for any euill suspition they had of them.</p>
                  <p>Al that day that the Spaniards were in their ship, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men came downe to the water side to sée them, and that in so great number, that they did woonder to sée them, and on the other side they greatly reioyced to sée so many soules there ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togither, hoping that when it should bee the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of GOD, to giue them oportunitie, to baptise them all.</p>
                  <p>The next day following in the morning, they sawe another <hi>Mandelin</hi> or Iudge comming towards their shippe, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with much people, and with little lesse maiestie then the other had, who entred into their shippe, and commaunded to search both aboue and belowe to sée whether they brought any armour, weapon, or any other kinde of merchandize, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they coulde finde nothing else but their bookes and their ornament aforesaide, hée commaunded it to bée brought before him, who did peruse the same, péece by péece with great admiration, and shewed great contentment that hee receiued to sée their bookes and Images: although that which did most content him was to sée the <hi>Ara</hi> of blacke stone, as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Then hee commanded one of the Fathers for to reade in one of the saide bookes, and for to write, the which was done before him with so great facilitie, that the Iudge receiued great contentment to sée it. Then hée asked them if that with the said letters they could write any other language that were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent vnto theirs. The Fathers answered yea, that they coulde write any language: and for a plainer proofe, they wrote
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3380:134"/>
on a péece of paper certaine reasons in the Iudges language, the which did cause him greatly to maruell, and said (turning his face to some of them that came with him) these men are not barbarous nor of any euill condition so farre as I can see.</p>
                  <p>With this he departed out of their shippe, and went to giue the gouernour (who sent him) to vnderstand of that he had séene and coulde vnderstande of the Spaniards in this his visitation, who straightwayes did sende them a licence vpon a table, that they shoulde come on shore, and bee suffered to enter into the cittie freely at their will.</p>

                  <p>SO soone as they had their licence, they went forth of their ship and entred in at the gate of the Cittie, although with great trouble, by reason of the great number of people that came to sée them, as a thing neuer séene before: then they went to the christened <hi>Chinos</hi> house, hee that serued for their interpreter, who made very much of them, and giuing them to vnderstande that hée had made a true report of all that they had commanded him, and did offer himselfe, to do so much with the Iustices that he would procure to get licence of the gouernor for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the countrie, and to giue them a house wherein to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and dwel: and did admonish them that at that time they should not deale for to make the <hi>Chinos</hi> Christians, vntil such time as they were better knowne, and coulde speake the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and then should they doo it with a great deale more ease.

of so great importance, about the which they shoulde remaine there a long time (as aforesaide) as they afterwarde did more at large vnderstande. If that interpreter had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in fidelitie all that which they had spoken, without al doubt they woulde not haue suffered them to haue come on shoare, else haue put them in some prison, for that they came on lande without licence, and to haue shewed them the most fauour, they woulde haue caused them to returne from whence they came, whereas the guardes of the straight (of whome we haue spoken off before) woulde either in secrete or publike sinke them at the sea, for that they were all greatly in hatred against them: the reason was that the <hi>Aytao,</hi> who is (as is declared in the first booke of this historie) the president of the counsell of warre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had vnderstanding howe that they passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the fléete and were not séene, which was a thing that they all wondred at.</p>

                  <p>VPon Saint Iohn baptist day they were called before a Iudge, who (as after this did vnderstand) was a superiour vnto the other past: but when they came whereas hee was in place of audience, his ministers did straight wayes commande them to knéele downe at such time as they came in sight of the Iudge, which was vnto the religious men no small torment. Hee demanded of them the same that the others did, and they answered in briefe, that they came to preach the holy Gospell, and requested him to giue them licence to execute the same, and to remaine in that Cittie of <hi>Canton</hi> for to learne the <hi>China</hi> tongue, whereby they might giue them to vnderstande and knowe the trueth of the heauen. The interpreter did falsifie their wordes, as hee had doone vnto the other Iudges, and said no more, but for so much that fortune and fowle weather had driuen them into that port, they woulde liue amongst them, although it were to serue them as slaues, for that if they would returne vnto the Ilande of <hi>Luzon,</hi> or by another name called <hi>Manilla,</hi> they could not, for that they knewe not the way, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they anie Pilot to conduct them.</p>
                  <p>The Iudge had pittie on them, and commanded that such thinges as they had in their shippe should bée brought on land, for that hee woulde sée them: amongst the which, the thing which caused him most to maruell at, was when hée sawe the Images, and <hi>Ara</hi> (or Alter stone) of blacke Iasper stone (of the which we haue made large mention:) hee requested of the Spaniards that they woulde giue them two Images, which when they had giuen them, they made shew to estéeme greatly of the present, for that they were thinges that they haue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. He talked with them very friendly, &amp; caused them to arise from the ground whereas they did knéele, and to shewe them the more fauour, he caused to be giuen them to drinke in his presence a certaine beurage which they do vse, made of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hearbs, and vse it for a comfortable thing for the heart, &amp; is commonly vsed amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although they are not dry: and amongst the <hi>Chinos</hi> is a shew of particular fauour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:3380:135"/>This Iudge did more vnderstande the intent of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards then any of the other past, for their interpreter had tolde vnto him that they woulde remaine in the countrie for to cure sicke persons and to bury the dead, the which they could do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent well. When the Iudge heard these wordes, hee gaue with his hande a great stroke vppon the table that was before him, and said with showes of great wonder vnto other inferior Iudges that were with him: Oh what good people are these as it séemeth: it would be vnto mee a great ioy, if that I coulde of mine owne authoritie accomplish that which they do desire, but our lawes do forbid the same, and that with great rigour. All this did their interpreter tel them afterward. At this time there entred into the place of audience whereas they were, a man of <hi>China,</hi> one of the common sort, al imbrewed with blood, crying out and making a great noise, without any consort, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating himselfe vpon the ground did complaine of other <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> with whom he had fallen out, and was beaten and buffeted in cruell sort.</p>
                  <p>The Iudge when he saw him, did straight wayes command his officers to bring the offenders before him,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chinos</hi> most vpright in all their iudgements and in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iustice</note> the which was done with a trice, &amp; they returned with the plaintife, bringing thrée other <hi>Chinos</hi> bound togither by the armes, and as it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med they were men of base sort. The Iudge incontinent made information wholly of all that passed, and condemned them without writing any letter, in twenty sotes or strokes a peece: the officers forthwith tooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with so great cruelty as though they had bin diuels, &amp; threwe them vpon the ground with their bellies downwards to execute the sentence giuen by the Iudge, and when they had pulled off their hose, they began to whippe them vpon the calues of their legges with a sot made of canes, in manner as hath béene told you before. The religious people who were present all this while: and taking pitie on these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned men, fell downe at the féete of the Iudge, and by signes and tokens did craue of him for the loue of God, that his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence might not be executed: who straightwayes commanded the executioners to cease, condiscending vnto the petition of the Friers, and did pardon the offenders fiftéene sottes or strokes of the twentie, wherein they were condemned.</p>
                  <p>The Iudge did very much woonder at the pouertie of these

religious men, and at the sharpe and asper apparell that they weare: but the chiefest thing that he did maruell at, was when that he vnderstoode howe they had passed the fleete of ships that were put in the straight for to defende and keepe the coast, and were neuer seene, which séemed vnto him a thing impossible, except it were by permission of the heauen.</p>

                  <p>Within few dayes after they vnderstood that the Iudge had accomplished his promise, for that the vizroy had committed the matter vnto another Iudge called <hi>Aytao,</hi> whose office is for to examine and inquire the causes of strangers: the wordes of the commission were as followeth.</p>
                  <p>I am written vnto from <hi>Canton</hi> howe that there are come thither certaine men apparelled very sharpe and asper,<note place="margin">The vizroies commission.</note> after the fashion of our religious men in the wildernesse, who bringe no weapons, neither any other thing that might séeme to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any euill intent: and for that they are thy charge, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them with care and diligence, and prouide to doo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that which shall be most requisite and conuenient: giuing vs to vnderstand the large and true relation of that which shall happen.</p>
                  <p>The verie same day of Saint Iohn, the Spaniards being verie merry and vnmindfull of any thing, for that they had all that day receiued the Sacrament: there came vnto them abord their shippe or frigat the interpreters, and did euidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their euill purpose and intent (saying) that it was appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent what they had done for them, and in what perill they did euery day put themselues in for their matters, and that it was reason that they shoulde pay them for the same, and if not, they would not helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any more, neither interpret or take paines in their businesse: certifying them that if they did faile to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, that they should not finde any that would doo it with

so great good will and diligence (as they should finde by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) and how that they had béene put in prison if they had not béene, for entring into that kingdome without licence: and for that they enterpreted for them with great curtesie and fauour they had also béene commaunded to returne backe againe from whence they came, which by their meanes, was the cause that the Iudges did intreate them so friendly as they did. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Costodio</hi> when he vnderstoode their intent, and did eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently see that it was wholly grounded vppon gaine: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring also the vrgent necessitie that they had of them, and not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying them, it was difficult to finde any for to helpe them in that their necessitie: of two euils he chose the best, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them a pawne for their contentment, one of the two Challices they brought with them,<note place="margin">A sacred thing no doubt of it.</note> giuing them great charge to vse and kéepe it as a sacred thing, and dedicated for to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the blood of Christ. The principall interpreter did take it with great content, and presently gaue it a newe master in selling it vnto a gold-smith for as much as it was woorth, who did melt it, and made things thereof according to his trade: yet they not being content therewith, and that it séemed vnto them that those fathers could not but bring with them much riches, they inquired of the <hi>China</hi> boy whom they brought to bee their interpreter, with faire words to know if they had any g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with base victuals) he would say vnto them, that they shoulde eate without any griefe or care, that when it should so fall out that his substance did saile him, hee woulde then pawne one of his sonnes to buy victuals.</p>
                  <p>The father <hi>Costodio</hi> plainly séeing and vnderstanding that their intent &amp; purpose was wholly grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for to get from him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other challice, he answered that he had not for to giue them, &amp; how that he had giuen the other challice in pawn of that which they had spent in victuals, and for their trauell that they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for them. The interpreter did replie, saying, that if they had nothing, that they shoulde séeke it, séeing that they ought it for their victuals which they had eaten, and that it was the vse of that countrie, that when any man did owe any thing, &amp; hath not for to pay the same, for to sell their children, or else to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come slaues vnto their creditor they demanded the other Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice that remained, for that the other which they had giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did weigh but sixtéene <hi>Taes,</hi> which was but a small matter in respect of their desert, onely for their trauel in their enterpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This Frier <hi>Costodio</hi> did pacifie them in the best maner hee coulde, promising to pay both the one and the other, hauing oportunitie for the same, and that they woulde procure it with as great care as was possible: and requesting him for to keepe the Challice (that he had giuen him in pawne) in great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that hee did estéeme it, much more for the consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and dedication vnto the deuine Colto, then for the value of that it wayed: and more promised him vpon his word to write vnto the Portugals that were in <hi>Machao,</hi> signifying vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their necessitie, and to demande their almes &amp; charity, and looke whatsoeuer they did send them, being little or much, should bee giuen him. Then the interpreter who had his eyes fixed vppon gaine, saide, that they shoulde forthwith write, and that hee woulde giue him a messenger for to carrie the letter, and to bring answere of the same, as hee had doone the like not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes before. The Father <hi>Costodio</hi> did write vnto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe that was in <hi>Machao,</hi> giuing him to vnderstande of his comming, and of his companions vnto the Cittie of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and howe that his comming thither was onelie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for to preach the holy Gospel, and for to conuert and turne to God those blind Idolaters. The which letter being receiued

                  <p>BEcause they would not sée themselues in the like danger with the interpreter, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was past, they would not go any more to eate at his house, but rather to giue an example vnto those of the citie, they went foorth euery day by two and two to aske almes: and although they were infidels, yet they gaue them with great contentment and ioie, because it was a rare thing in that kingdome to sée them begge in the stréetes, by reason (as hath béene tolde you) that they haue no poore folk, neither are they permitted if there be any to aske in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

streetes nor in their temples. When that the Gouernor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode thereof, and how that they did it for pure necessitie, and had no other waies to maintaine themselues, hee commanded to be giuen them euerie day a certaine stipend vpon the kinges cost, the which was with so great abundance, that mainteining the souldiers that came with them and all the rest, yet had they to spare, for that their stipende was giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in money, which was sixe <hi>Mayesses</hi> of siluer, whereof they had to spare, for that all thinges in that countrie is so good cheape, (as hath béen told you in many places.)</p>
                  <p>Their interpreter séeing the good newes that was brought from <hi>Machao</hi> for the Spaniardes, by a bill that a certayne deuout man had sent him in secret, whereupon would be giuen vnto him all that was néedefull, with protestation to pay all that should be giuen vnto them although it should amount vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great summe (with the which hee wrote a letter vnto the Fryer <hi>Costodio</hi> of great comfort, in strengthening him and all the rest to perseuer in their intent which God had put in their mindes for the saluation of those soules) the Interpreter (I say) beganne to imagine, that for to profite himselfe it was conuenient for to delate and detract the departure of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes, and did exact vpon them euery day in the buying of their victuals, the halfe of the money that was giuen them.</p>
                  <p>So vpon a day he came verie much out of order and fayned that the <hi>Aytao</hi> had commanded that they should foorthwith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the kingdome: but yet notwithstanding he would present a petition in their name, saying, that for as much as time did not serue them to nauigate, neither was their shippe in plight for to make their iourney, that it would please them to get them a house whereas they might remaine thrée or foure monethes, in the which time they might prouide them of all thinges necessarie for their voyage, and possible it may so fall out that in this time, they séeing their manner of liuing to bée good, and to shew good examples they may let them to remaine in the countrie liberally and to learne the language, and then beginne to preach and declare the right way vnto heauen. All this he spake with great dissimulation, for to profite himselfe, for he knewe verie well that the <hi>Aytao</hi> had willed him to tell them, that they could not remaine in that countrie with the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3380:139"/>
pretence they had, for that there was a lawe ordayned to the contrarie, without expresse licence from the king, the which will last of all be granted vnto the Spaniardes or Portingals, for that there is a prophesie amongest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, spoken by the mouth of the diuell, and estéemed amongest them for a very truth, for that other thinges which he spake when that was spoken hath béene verified, in the which he doth pronounce,<note place="margin">A prophesie.</note> that a time shall come, that they shall be subiect vnto a nation whose men shall haue great beardes and long noses, and sharpe broade eyes (as we would say cats eyes (in the which they do differ from them. For it is a great maruaile to finde a man amongst them, with more then twentie heares in his beard, little more or lesse, flat noses, and their eyes very little, so that when they will mocke a man, or doo him any iniurie by word, they will call him, cats eyes.</p>
                  <p>Now for that the desire of the Spaniardes was nothing else but to remaine in that countrie, for to bring to effect their good zeale, they did gratifie the interpreter for the great fauour hee shewed them, and did earnestly intreat him for to present the petition, thinking thereby their desire should be vnderstood, and Gods cause iustified, so that they first would enter into them by the way of preaching. He presented the petition when that all the Iudges were together, who had great pitie and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion ouer the Spaniardes, and willed that they should come before them, for that they would sée and vnderstande the roote and foundation of their will. They obeyed their commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with great ioy, and when they were come into the hall, one of the Iudges, who was superiour ouer all the rest, and a man of great authoritie, did aske of them by way of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, what was their pretence in that they did aske a house to dwell in, the Frier <hi>Costodio</hi> did answere, that he did desire it for to learne the language well, by which meanes they might the better learne them to know the true God, and to set them in the true way to goe and glorie with him, because it was his office and his profession.</p>
                  <p>The Interpreter tolde all this truely, the which fewe times before he had done, as hath béene tolde you. Then the Iudge in name of all the rest, sayde, that in that their demand they could not grant, neyther had they any such authoritie to giue licence.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3380:140"/>
This being spoken, the Interpreter replyed, without tarrying to heare what the Spaniardes would say, and said, that at least wayes they would giue them licence to remaine there till such time as the Portingals did come thether for to lade their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice, which would be within few daies, with whom they would go, for that they were all of one law &amp; faith. The Iudge did againe aske the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if that the Portingals &amp; Spaniards were al one. The father <hi>Costodio</hi> answered, that in religion &amp; lawes there was no difference, but the one were subiects to one king &amp; the other to another, although they were kinsmen and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nigh. This last petition seemed to the Iudge to be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and iust than the first, and that they might grant it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with lesse difficultie, although he answered them and said, that he could not grant it vnto them, but he would write vnto the viceroy for to grant it them. For that the Portugals would bee there at the farthest within foure or fiue moneths, &amp; that in the meane time he would giue them a prouision that they may go fréely abroad, and none to hurt nor harme them.</p>
                  <p>So the next day following which was the second of August he did accomplish his word and promise and sent vnto the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy their petition, and therewithall his iudgement and of all the rest that were there with him, what they thought touching that matter. The answere staied many daies after &amp; came not, but in the ende there came a commandement from the viceroy vnto the gouernor of <hi>Canton,</hi> in the which hee willed that the Spaniards should be sent vnto <hi>Aucheo</hi> whereas he was, and that there should be carried with them all such thinges as they brought with them, which was their bookes and ornaments. The Iudge did straightwaies send &amp; gaue them to vnderstande of this new order, because they should make themselues readie for to trauaile: the which they did with great ioy and diligence, as you shall vnderstand in the chapter following.</p>

to sée the viceroy, with great hope and confidence that he would giue them licence for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they pretended. But at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture they would haue left there two Indians for to kéepe their ship or frigat: but the Iudges that were present, said, that it was not néedefull for them to haue any such care, for that they would take the care vppon them to see all thinges in good order. So presently they sent certaine writing in papers, and commaunded them to bee glewed vppon the hatches of their shippe in such sort that they could not bee open, but they must be perceiued. Then presently was brought for the Spaniardes foure barkes verie gallant and wide with verie fayre galleries and windowes, and beeing imbarked, they charged them verie much to make all haste possible to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the commandement of the viceroy, and sent with them conuenient persons for to be their guides, and to giue them all thinges necessarie for their iourney. They traueiled continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a mightie riuer against the current, in the which they did sée many thinges woorthie to be noted for the space of foure daies that their iourney indured.</p>
                  <p>There was alongest the riuer side manie Cities and townes verie great, which were so many in number that they could not make any memorie of them, by reason that they passed manie of them by night.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:3380:141"/>
wondred at aboue all the rest. All the countrie is verie popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and the townes one so néere an other, that it may better be sayde, to be all one towne and not manie, and might with more propertie be called the Citie of <hi>China,</hi> and not the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>China.</hi> In all the whole countrie there is not one foot of ground vnoccupied, by reason of the great abundance of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people that there is, and they permit amongest them no idle people (as more at large it hath béene declared vnto you) and the countrie beeing fertile, is the occasion that they haue all thinges in great abundance and at a lowe price.</p>
                  <p>Now to returne to their voyage the which they made verie well and with great recreation as well in the townes alongst the riuer side, as vpon the riuer, whereas they were cherished with great care: in the end of foure dayes, which was the twentith day of August, they entred into the suburbes of the Citie of <hi>Aucheo,</hi> but so late that they were constrayned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there till the next day: whereas they found all thinges necessarie and in good order, aswell for their bedding as for their supper, to passe away the night. The next day very early in the morning he that was their conduct and guide made great haste, for to goe and sée what the viceroy would command.</p>
                  <p>They trauailed through a great and long stréete, which sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto them to be more than a league, and thought that they had gone through the citie. So when they had passed that street they came vnto the gate of the citie, and there they vnderstoode that the rest which they had gone and passed was the suburbes. The mightinesse of this citie, and the great admiration they had, with the multitude of people, &amp; a wonderfull great bridge the which they passed, with many other thinges of the which they made mention, we do let passe, for that it is declared vnto you more at large in the relation giuen by the Augustin friers in the booke before this, at their entrie into the sayd citie.</p>
                  <p>So when they came to the pallace of the viceroy, he was not stirring, neither was the gate open, for as it hath béene tolde you, it is open but once a day. Their guide séeing that it would be somewhat long before that they would open it, he carried the Spaniardes into a court of an other house, which was ioyning vnto that of the viceroy.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while they were there, came all the Iudges to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3380:141"/>
sit in audience, but when they vnderstoode of the comming of the strangers, they commanded that they should be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: who greatly marueiled at the aspernesse of their apparell, and not at any other thing, for that they had séene there before the Austin fryers. Straightwayes the gate of the pallace was open with great noyse of artilerie and musicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, as trumpets, bagpipes, sackebuttes and hoybukes, with such a noyse that it séemed the whole citie would sincke. At the entrie in the first court, there were many souldiers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and had hargubushes and lances, and in a very good order. In an other court more within, which was very great, &amp; railed round about with timber, painted blacke and blew, which a far off séemed to be yron, and was in height a mans stature, there they sawe also many other souldiers, placed in the same order, and in liuerie as the others were, but they séemed to be men of a gallanter disposition. When they came into this court, there was brought vnto them a commandement from the viceroy, in the which they were commanded to returne and come thether againe in the after noone, for that he could not speake with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, by reason of certaine businesse he had with the Lords of the counsell, which could not be deferred. With this answere they departed out of the pallace, and returned againe in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noone, as they were commanded, and into the same court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaide, out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they were carried into a mightie great hall, very richly hanged and adorned, at the ende thereof was thrée doores, that in the middest was great, but the other two but small, the which did correspond vnto other thrée doores, that were in an other hall more within, wherein was the viceroy, right ouer against the doore in the middest, in at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which there is none permitted to enter nor go foorth. Hee was set in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous rich chayre wrought with iuorie and gold, vnder a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopie or cloth of state all of cloth of gold, &amp; in the middest was embrodered the kings armes, which were (as we haue said) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

He had also before him a table whereon were two candles burning, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late, and a standish with paper.

The order they haue in giuing audience is with the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in all points as it hath béene shewed you in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fathers of S.

So when that the viceroy was giuen to vnderstande how that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillos</hi> were come, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that one of them with alonely
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:3380:143"/>
the interpreter should enter there wheras he was, and to bring in such thinges as he had commanded to be brought. the which was presently accomplished. Hee straightwaies began to looke vpon the images euery one by it selfe, and the bookes: &amp; made a stay betwixt euerie one, to consider well thereof, and made a showe of great content he receiued in the sight of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Although aboue all the rest, the <hi>Ara</hi> of blacke Iasper did most content him, and caused a marueilous strangenesse in the rest of the Iudges that had séene it. All this while was the father <hi>Costo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi> vpon his knées, and the interpreter by him, and hee neuer asked of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any question, neyther did they say any thing. They that did bring those thinges vnto him for to sée them, seemed to be principall and ancient men, who when they gaue it him into his handes they did it knéeling.</p>
                  <p>So after that he had seene them al at his pleasure, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to put them againe in the place that they were taken out, and made signe vnto the father <hi>Coistodio</hi> &amp; to the interpret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One of the ancient men that were with him, did go foorth with the Spaniards, &amp; told them when they came into the second hall, that the viceroy did reioyce much to see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and all those which they brought, &amp; said that they should repaire vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Timpintao,</hi> who was his deputy, &amp; he would dispatch al such matters as were asked of the viceroy by petition following the same till it was concluded, &amp; that he would consult with the viceroy, who would set down such orders as shold be obserued. They straightwaies did put in execution this order, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto the house of the deputie vnto the viceroy, the which was very great &amp; faire, they found that he had a garde very little lesse then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of the viceroy, &amp; almost with as great maiestie. So after they had remained in the court a good while, abiding his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement (to whom it was giuen to vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the viceroy had sent them vnto him) he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them to ascend into the place wheras he was, which was into a hall very well dressed, in the which was almost al such things as they had séene in the hall of the viceroy, and he himselfe in the same manner sate in a rich chaire, with a table before him. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to take out those things which they brought in their chestes, and did behold them with great consideration péece by péece, as the viceroy had done,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:3380:143"/>
and reioysing much to sée the Images, he did demande of them with curiositie the signification of some of them, but in espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall a crucifixe, that after that he had considered with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, he asked what man was that, which was vppon the crosse, and what those letters did signifie that were tituled ouer his head. But when the father <hi>Costodio</hi> had declared it vnto him, he beganne to laugh thereat, as though he had heard some foolish fable. Hee came and féeled the habites of our religious men, and made signes of great woonder to see the aspernesse thereof.</p>
                  <p>The father <hi>Costodio</hi> séeing his affabilitie, and as it séemed by outwarde showe that he did very much pitie them, he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to helpe and fauour him with the viceroy, &amp; that he would aske licence that they might remaine and dwell in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in any place where his pleasure was to appoint, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were men without any hurt, and would put all their care and diligence to do workes of charitie, and to procure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men might go to inioy the happie estate to the which they were borne.</p>
                  <p>The interpreter dealt here in his office with as great fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as at other times, in saying that which the fathers did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of him, was that he should be a meanes vnto the viceroy that he would let them to remaine in that countrie two or thrée moneths, for that as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was an ill time to nauigate the sea, and that without great danger of their liues they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the Ilands <hi>Philippinas.</hi> The Iudge answered that they should not feare, but remaine with content, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would procure that there should be giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a house for those thrée or foure moneths, with a commandement that none whatsoeuer should do them any harme. The Interpreter tolde them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the deputie to the viceroy was very glad y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would remaine in that countrie, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they séemed vnto him men of good example &amp; necessarie in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, &amp; that they might fréely learne the language (as they sayd) for to shew &amp; instruct them the way vnto heauen. The Spaniards hauing heard this, if made them very much to maruaile, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time forwards they had good hope to prosecute that which they did pretend. So with this &amp; with great spirituall &amp; corporal ioy they tooke their leaue of the Iudge, and went vnto their lodging, wheras they gaue thanks vnto God, for the good directing of their busines, &amp; did pray vnto
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:3380:144"/>
him to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they might sée a finall conclusion of their desire. All this falsenes that the interpreter did vse, was by the diuine permission (as afterwards they did gather) when that by himselfe they were put out of all doubt, and did declare what he did pretend by the way &amp; order he tooke. For without all doubt, if that the Iudges had plainly vnderstood that they would haue there remained, they would not haue suffered them to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and séene the countrie. And the viceroy being aduertised thereof, would haue caused them to depart in that troublesome wether, whereas possible they should haue béene all drowned, for that the moneths of Iuly, August and September, in that countrie are ordinarily full of stormes and tempestes.</p>

                  <p>ALl the time that they remained in <hi>Aucheo,</hi> they did occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in visiting of the principals of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> court, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst whom he that did most reioice to see them was the captaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the men of war of that prouince, who after that he had intreated them very friendly and louingly, he desired them that they would returne the next day to visite him, &amp; to bring with them the <hi>Ara</hi> of blacke stone, which they had shewed vnto the viceroy, that he might sée it, for that he had praised it very much: and to bring also of their painted Images. They did obey his commandement, and came vnto him when that he was at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with great maiestie. Then so soone as he had dined he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they should enter into the hal there where he was. The interpreter when he drew nigh vnto him did knéele down, and made signes vnto the Spaniards to follow him and do the like, but the captaine commanded them to arise &amp; to couer their heads, &amp; did very much behold the <hi>Ara</hi> or (altar stone) making a showe of great admiration to beholde it: hee demanded of the Fryers many things of great curiositie, and asked them if they would sell him that stone, and he would giue them for it what
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:3380:144"/>
they would demande. The father <hi>Costodio</hi> answered saying, that they solde nothing, and much lesse that, for that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated and dedicated to the diuine colto (or sacrifice.) The Captaine replied and saide, that if they would not sell it, that they should giue it him, and hee would be gratefull vnto them in some other thing, that they should thinke well of.</p>
                  <p>The father <hi>Costodio</hi> answered that by no maner of meanes he could not do it, for that vpon the same they did celebrate and say masse, at such time as they did sacrifice vnto the true God. At that instant the captaine did put his handes vppon it to féele it, and the father <hi>Costodio</hi> made signes vnto him to take away his handes, for that he sinned greatly therein. Then he séeing that they would not giue it him, he tooke his leaue, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they should leaue it there with him, for that hee would looke vppon it more at leasure, promising to returne it them againe afterwardes. The father <hi>Costodio</hi> did consent thereunto, but first he requested him, not to touch it with his handes.</p>
                  <p>So after that he had satisfied himselfe in the beholding of it, his affection was then much more to remaine therewith: and for to accomplish the same, not fayling of his word and promise that he had made, hee deuised with himselfe a certaine slight and policie, and sent for the father <hi>Costodio,</hi> who came vnto him with great content, thinking verily that he would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned their <hi>Ara.</hi> When he came vnto him, he did intertaine him verie ioyfully and said that he was vpon his iorney to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain warres by the commandement of the king, &amp; that amongst those seruants that he carried with him for his seruice, there were two christened <hi>Chinos,</hi> which had beene captiues vnto the Portugales of the citie of <hi>Machao,</hi> from whence they ran away, of whom he had had vnderstanding in all thinges of the ceremonies of the Christians, and that their comming the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to baptise such as would receiue the same: and hee being fully certified in many thinges touching the same he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked well thereof and gaue great content, and hoped to be one of them that first should receiue the faith when the king should grant licence for the same.</p>
                  <p>All this (as it séemed was that they should let him haue the <hi>Ara,</hi> vnto the which he was so affectioned, as aforesaid. But
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:3380:145"/>
the father <hi>Costodio</hi> vsed the matter in such sort that hee got it out of his fingers, which was no small matter. Within a few dayes after, the Captaine being readie to imbarke himselfe for to make his iourney, he sent vnto the Spaniardes that two of them should come vnto him, and that they should bring with them the blacke stone, for there were certaine friendes of his that would sée it.</p>
                  <p>The father <hi>Costodio</hi> did straightwayes accomplish his commandement and carried with him the <hi>Ara</hi> (or altar stone) for that he durst not do otherwise, yet they did beléeue that in giuing him some pretie or curious thing, they should content him and quiet his mind: they carried also with them the Image of Marie Magdalen made of feathers, which was more woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie than the <hi>Ara,</hi> (setting a part the consecration). So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the religious fathers came wheras he was, he went foorth to méete them more then tenne paces, with signification of great ioy: and carrying them aside, he saide vnto them once againe, that the captiues had told him so many things of their vertuous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of liuing, &amp; of other things touching the heauen: that he had great affection vnto them, &amp; desired that they might remaine in the countrie for to baptise the inhabitants therof, &amp; that he wold be the first: but the cause wherfore he did delay the time is for to eschew the paines y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is pronounced against all those that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any law or strange ceremonie without particular licence of the king. And for that he went in hast to go &amp; inhabite a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine prouince, &amp; that he was ready to depart: in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which so soone as it was possible, he would do so much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al they should become Christians: &amp; for as much as he tolde him that the blacke stone (vnto the which he was affectioned) was consecrated, that he would let him haue it to carry with him, that he might put it in the first church that the baptised should edifie being made chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: the which would be very shortly, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before many daies to send to <hi>Machao</hi> for two friers such as were there, to be fully informed of them in thinges touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Christian faith. Then the father <hi>Costodio</hi> sayde, if that which he had spoken came from his heart, that hee would foorth with depart and goe with him and all his companie.</p>
                  <p>The Captaine answered that as then hee could not doo it, till such time as the Church was built, and licence had for the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:3380:145"/>
same of the king or vizroy, the which at that time he coulde not demande, for the great hast that he had to depart. The father <hi>Costodio</hi> replied and said, that his church being built, he would promise him of his worde to sende it him, and not to giue it to any other, and in pledge and token of the same, he should carry with him the Image of Marie Magdalene made of feathers. The captaine receiued the same with great content: greatlie maruelling at the subtill and fine worke, wherewith it was wrought: and after did so much, that almost perforce he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned also with the <hi>Ara</hi>: and commanded to bee brought foorth two rich péeces of Damaske, and to giue them vnto the Father <hi>Costodio</hi> for to make an ornament in truck and ful satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the same: but the father <hi>Costodio</hi> woulde not receiue them, but was very much gréeued to sée howe that hee did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine therewith, and with the Image of feathers. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine did contende with him for to take the Damaske, but hée would not.</p>
                  <p>Afterward they vnderstood that that the interpreter was bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by a seruant of the Captaines, for to alter the friers words and to offer the captayne the <hi>Ara,</hi> and any thing els that hee would desire. For to the contrary he durst not by any meanes to take it against the will of the fathers. To conclude he did imbarke himselfe vpon his voyage, and caried with him the <hi>Ara,</hi> and the image with great ioy to himselfe: but vnto the fathers and their companions discomfort and sorrow, for that they had lost the two thinges that they so much estéemed. The captayne at his departure did vse great thinges and curtesie, taking his leaue of them, with signes, that signified he bare them great loue and good will, and that it gréeued him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and could not carie them with him as they requested.</p>
                  <p>The interpreter did comfort the Spaniardes, and sayd that they should not be sorrowfull that the captaine had taken those two pieces, for that he was a mightie prince, and that he would fauour and helpe them with the vizroy, and that hee was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he would accomplish that which he promised, that is to become a christian, for that he did beare great good will and affection vnto them: in the which the interpreter did not lie, for that it was told them by the seruants of the Captaine, that were christened, a I told you before.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>So when they came vnto <hi>Canton,</hi> they went straightwayes to visite the gouernour, and to giue him the dispatches which they brought, who after that he had read the same, he bad them welcome, and saide that hee was very glad that the vizroy had shewed them so much fauour, and that the same was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his charge, for the execution of his commission, that they should perswade themselues that hee would performe it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto his commandement, without failing anie thing. And for to beginne the same, hee shewed vnto them a house of the kings which should be for their dwelling, which was in the suburbs halfe fallen downe, and there they were lodged, with a commandement that they should not go foorth, neither enter into the cittie without particular licence. Héere they remained many dayes being deceiued of their purpose, and maruelled very much that the gouernor would not giue them licence for to reedifie a monastery, neither for to enter into the cittie for to giue order in that which they beléeued was granted them by the vizroy, til such time as they vnderstood what was done by their interpreters, &amp; relation giuen by the <hi>Chino</hi> boy which came w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them from the <hi>Philippinas,</hi> who declared to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth in all things: how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the interpreters had neuer told the Iudges how that they would remain in the countrie, neither made any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, but that they came thither as lost men, &amp; that their request was to remaine in the country til it were faire wether,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:3380:147"/>
or the comming of the Portugall shippes. And this was that which the vizroy and his deputie had granted, and no other thing. But when the father <hi>Costodio</hi> and his companions (who verely beléeuing that their desire woulde take effect) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode the craft and wile of the interpreters, and the great fashood that they had vsed, they were very sadde, and beganne amongst themselues to remedie the same: so they determined to séeke a new interpreter, one that should faithfulle and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare their will vnto the gouernor, And although they did finde some that could doo it, for that they did reasonably vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the Portugall tongue, yet there were none that woulde accept it, for any request or giftes that they did promise them. The Father <hi>Costodio</hi> séeing this, and that the time appointed did passe away without doing of any thing, one day hee and the rest of his companions did ioine togither, &amp; entred in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to sée what was best to be done, according vnto the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the which they were driuen. There was amongst them diuers opinions, for that of the father <hi>Costodio</hi> and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious man was, that they woulde go vnto <hi>Machao,</hi> which was not farre off, and there would administer the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and preach the holy Gospel vnto the christened <hi>Chinos</hi> and to learne the <hi>China</hi> language, and to tarrie there and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the first occasion that should bee offered, or else they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to procure it, for hauing the language it were an easie thing to doo it: &amp; they should not haue néede of any interpreter, neither feare to be deceiued as they had béene before. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, they put the Portugals out of all doubt of the false opinion that the Captaine generall had published abroade of them, and of other matters of like effect and purpose. The other two religious men and soulders were of a contrarie opinion: which was, that they should returne vnto the Ilands <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinas,</hi> and not vnto <hi>Machao,</hi> and saide, that they had departed without licence of the gouernor, and did aduenture themselues into the harme and damage that might happen vnto them by that enterprise, and all for to plant the faith of Christ in that kingdome. And now séeing that by the iust iudgement of God wee cannot put it in execution, wee are greatly bounde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe vnto him, of whome we doubt not but with ease to get our pardon for the error passed, representing the zeale
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3380:147"/>
wee had to the honour of God, and the saluation of so manie soules, who did incite vs to giue that great enterprise: with the which we shall remaine blamelesse with them that had giuen wrong iudgement of vs, and accomplish our bounden duetie and obedience which wee doo owe vnto the gouernor.

                  <p>The resolution of these contrary opinions, was by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent delated certaine dayes, in the which they prayed vnto God to put into their hearts, that which was best for his deuine seruice. So in the end the father <hi>Costodio,</hi> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man, who was of his opinion, did determine to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with their pretence, and to go vnto <hi>Machao,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and the rest to returne vnto the Ilands with the first opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie they might finde: but when it should come to effect, one of the religious Friers that shoulde haue gone vnto <hi>Manilla</hi> was deade of an infirmitie that chanced him. They staied there longer then they did think they should, by reason that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudges of the Cittie were occupied with the examinations of students the which is accustomed euery thrée yeares, and is in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order, as hath béene tolde you in the proper chapter for the same: the which examinations endured more then fiue and fortie dayes with great feastes and banquets, without medling in any other particular businesse.</p>

                  <p>IN the meane time of this their examination, the father <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodio</hi> did sende a messenger vnto the bishop of <hi>Machao,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring vnto him his determination, and he also did write vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deuout priest, of whome we haue made mention before:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:3380:148"/>
and craued of them their almes wherewith they might make prouision for them that would depart for the Ilands <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and how that he and his companyon would go and see his lordship. This was not done so secretly, but it came vnto the vnderstanding and knowledge of the captaine generall of the Portugals, who with great choller went and demanded the letters of the priest, those that were giuen him by the <hi>Chino</hi>: threatning him that if hee did not, hee woulde punish him with great rigor, and banish him out of the countrie as a suspected person. He answered him, that of truth he had receiued certaine letters, but that at the very instant hee sent them vnto the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe vnto whome they were directed: about the which there was great holde and kéepe, vntill it came to effect that the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine did lay holde vppon the priest for to apprehende him: but when the bishop vnderstood thereof, hee with all spéed possible went to remedy the danger that might insue, and to take him out of his power.</p>
                  <p>The captaine séeing that hee could not perseuer with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpose, he made many notifications vnto the bishop, requiring that he would not permit that any letters shoulde bée receiued from those religious Spaniards, for that he knew by very certaine relation that they were spies, and no friers, and if so be that any damage should happen vnto them, by their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that hée woulde lay the whole fault vppon him as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter and a helper. The bishoppe answered that he was fully perswaded and certified that they were true religious men, and seruants of God, and that he with a very good will would take vpon him the burthen of any damage that should happen to the country by their meanes, or vnto the king of Portugall. With this the captaine was somewhat quieted, but not so much, but that continually hee did not let to imagine newe matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the poore fathers, to haue occasion to apprehend them, and imagined in his minde for to write a letter vnto the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, in the which hee did offer them great quantities of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if that they would do so much as giue order that the Iudges woulde sende the religious men and Spanish souldiers that were in <hi>Canton</hi> vnto the Cittie of <hi>Machao,</hi> aduertising them howe and which way they shoulde vse the matter to put it in effect, and was, that he should tell the Iudges, that the first time

                  </p>
                  <p>The interpreters straightwayes (with the desire of gaine) did take the charge vppon them, and did vse the matter in such sort that the Iudges did sende them vnto <hi>Machao,</hi> whether it were with or against their willes.

                  <head>CHAP. XII. A Portugall of the Cittie of Macheo doth discouer the euill intent of the captaine general: he giueth the Spaniards warning thereof by a letter without seale, by the which they remedie the danger that was so nigh at hand: they are called before the Aytao of the Cittie, &amp; he declareth vnto them such matters as haue passed with him, and the licence that was graunted for some of them to go vnto Machao, and the other vnto Luzon.</head>
                  <p>BEing vnderstood by a Portugall a good Christian of the towne of <hi>Machao,</hi> of such things as the captaine generall did imagine against the poore religious fathers that were in <hi>Canton,</hi> and their companions the souldiers, of whose holie zeale, he was fully certified, and being gréeued at the very soule that one Christian shoulde hurt and harme another: and more in the disturbing of the saluation of soules, hée determined with himselfe to giue them aduice therof with all spéed that was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, as in effect hee did by sending them a letter without anie name: wherein he gaue them to vnderstand that the Captaine generall by meanes of the interpreters, did pretende that they should be sent thither wheras he might apprehend them, &amp; send them vnto the king of Portugall, or else to doo some hurt vnto their person, with some false information, and willed them to be wel aduised, &amp; to kéepe themselues from the deceit ordained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:3380:149"/>The letter being séene, and wel aduised of all that was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained: they determined to giue notice thereof vnto a <hi>Chino,</hi> a verie friende of theirs, and perfite in the Portugall tongue: whome diuers times they prooued by experience, and founde him a very honest man, and one that had doone them friendshippe: who promised them that before many houres, he would bring al things to light, and to know whether that were true or not.</p>
                  <p>So with this desire he went there whereas the Iudge did sit in audience, and was there as one that knew nothing, vntill such time as he saw come thither one of the interpreters with a petition in his hand, and presented it vnto the supreme Iudge, who was the <hi>Aytao,</hi> the which being read by a scriuener, hée prouided that all things should be granted and doone, that was therein contained. This petition the <hi>Chino</hi> aforesaid saw, and after that the interpreter was departed with contentment, and found that in the same petition he did request (in the name of the Spaniards) of the Iudge to giue them leaue for to go vnto <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chao,</hi> which was more for their purpose then to go vnto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands <hi>Philippinas,</hi> which was granted by the iudge, and lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but to seale or signe the petition, but was dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vntill the euening, by reason of certaine businesse that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at that present: but sure it was the ordinance of God, for that if it had béene signed, they must néeds of force haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished the same, without any replication. So with this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie he went straightwayes vnto the Spaniards, to whom the interpreter had told that by petition he had asked licence for them to go to the Ilands <hi>Philippinas</hi> from whence they came, but the Iudge woulde not graunt vnto that, but for to go vnto <hi>Machao,</hi> which was néerer hand, who commanded them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the same without any replication, vppon paine that they should be carried thither perforce.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards asked councell of the <hi>Chino</hi> their friende, what meanes might be taken to auoide the danger that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter had begun to bring them in, and was alredie gone to conclude the same. The <hi>Chino</hi> said that he was fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the <hi>Aytao</hi> loued them well, and that he vnderstood hée did them great fauour and curtesie to graunt vnto the petition the which the interpreter did present in their name. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3380:149"/>
for so much as it was not signed, there was reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to bee had: if that they woulde present another which hee would giue them, and go presently vnto the <hi>Aytao</hi> and present the same, and say when they giue it him, that they woulde go vnto <hi>Luzon</hi> and not vnto <hi>Machao,</hi> and that he himselfe would go with them for the good will he bare vnto them, if it were not for the great paine that is put vppon all them, whosoeuer that shall speak for any stranger, without licence of the Iustice, or is called and ordained for the same. So they being fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this conclusion, with the petition made &amp; all ready, there entred in at the gate wheras they were, a seruant to the <hi>Aytao,</hi> who in the behalfe of his master, came to cal the Spaniards to come before him, for that he would sée and talke with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure. They straightwayes went forth in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and came vnto the gates of the cittie, after they had gon a good wayes in the suburbs: and there they were staied till such time as another came and brought their licence, writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon a table (in such sort as in other places it hath béene told you.) So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had passed the gate, they passed thorough a long stréet, in the which they saw so great riches, &amp; of so great curiosity, that the father <hi>Costodio</hi> with great admiration said, I haue béene in the principallest citties of all Flanders and Italie, and in all them I haue not séene so great curiositie and riches, as in this stréete alone: and according vnto the report of them all, hee had great reason to maruell thereat. So they comming vnto the end of this stréete, and in sight of another gate, they sawe that the souldiers which kept and garded the same, did shut them in their presence with great hast, and let fall a percullis of yron before the gate, and demanded to sée their licence at a window out of the saide percullis: and when they had it, although they saw with them the seruant of the <hi>Aytao</hi> and the interpreter, yet would they not open the gate vntill such time as it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and newe firmed by another Iudge, the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, they presently did open the gates &amp; did conduct them vnto the house of one which is to be compared to a Iudge of the court, &amp; called in their language <hi>Tequisi,</hi> that he might go with them to the <hi>Aytao,</hi> for so it was commanded &amp; ordained. Unto this <hi>Tequisi</hi> they gaue their petition that they had made, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giuing the interpreter to vnderstand therof, requesting him
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3380:150"/>
by signes &amp; some words which they had learned of the language that he woulde giue it to the <hi>Aytao,</hi> &amp; to procure that hee might accept &amp; grant that which by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same they did demand: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they gaue it him, it caused great alteration in the interpreter, for that they told the Iudge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was a théefe &amp; a traitor, &amp; how that he had sold them to the captaine general of <hi>Machao,</hi> &amp; how that hee had presented a petition in their name: howe that they would go thither, &amp; not to the Iland of <hi>Luzon,</hi> where all their desire is to returne, and this hath he done by gifts that the saide captaine general hath promised to giue him, if that he do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his desire. The <hi>Tequisi</hi> when he heard this, he forthwith departed with vs from his owne house, towards the house of the <hi>Aytao</hi> which was hard by, and as he went by the way he read their petition, and sawe that it was different to that which the interpreter had giuen before vnto the <hi>Aytao,</hi> he being present: whereat he made a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay &amp; began to consider of the same, as also of that which the Spaniards had said vnto him, at such time as they gaue him their petition, for by the signes and tokens they made, as by their semblant in spéech, it séemed to him, that they were maruellously indigned against the interpreter, but he did not wel vnderstand them, for that they could not plainly declare it in their language, till such time as hee found the contrarietie that was in the petitions &amp; the turbation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> interpreter, whom presently hee called vnto him, and asked him what the matter was: hee trembling for feare, answered and saide that hée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood that the father <hi>Costodio</hi> (whome all the rest doo obey as their head, and with whom he alonely did comunicate) that it was his pleasure, and gaue order to go vnto <hi>Machao,</hi> and that hee was certaine that all the rest were of that opinion, wherein he thought he had done well, and therefore he presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that petition in asking licence, whereby they might doo it liberallie, with this discharge: and againe the Spaniards séeing how he was terrified, and how that he requested them so hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie they would not procéede any farther with their complaint, wherewith the <hi>Tequisi</hi> was satisfied, who said vnto the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards being in the gallerie of the <hi>Aytao</hi> his house, that they shoulde tarry there, and hee entred in with the petition in his hand. So within a while after they were commanded to enter into the hall there whereas the Iudges were, and had séene the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:3380:150"/>
petition and comoned about the same. And at their entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hall whereas the <hi>Aytao</hi> was, there were signes made vnto them that they should knéele downe, the which they did almost twenty paces before they came to the table that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: hee had in hande the petition that <hi>Tequisi</hi> had giuen vnto him, and although that he had read it before, yet did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and looked againe vppon it, and asked which were they that would go vnto <hi>Machao.</hi> The father <hi>Costodio</hi> signified himselfe and frier Iohn <hi>Baptista</hi> his companion, and said, that they for that they were old and timorous of the sea, they would go thither for that it was nearer hande, and howe that the rest that were not of such yeares, neither so timorous, they woulde returne vnto the Iland of <hi>Luzon</hi> from whence they came, and there dwell with other of their brethren and friends that were there. The interpreter whose euill conscience did accuse him, for the euils which he had done, was so timorous, that all men might sée plainly his default, and without al doubt the Iustices are so right in executing the same, that if their complaint had gone forwards, they would haue punished him and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and that very cruelly: but the religious Friers woulde not consent that the souldiers shoulde declare against them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their will was good, but thought it a sufficient punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to sée in what affliction the poore men were in, and tooke pittie on them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aytao</hi> was desirous to sée their Images and book which was the chiefest occasion wherefore hee sent to call them, and when he saw them he receiued great content, and called the Fa-<hi>Costodio</hi> to come nigh vnto him, and asked the signification of some of them, such as séemed vnto him most strangest, and being satisfied thereof, hee commanded the Frier <hi>Costo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi> to reade on one of these bookes, hée harkening vnto it with great attention, and as one amased to sée those letters, and the forme of them so farre different vnto theirs, which are all in manner of caractes, as hath béene told you. So after that they had passed away the time a while in this, hee saide, that those which woulde go vnto <hi>Machao</hi> shoulde put themselues on the one side, and they that woulde go vnto <hi>Luzon</hi> on the other: the which being doone hee tooke his leaue of them verie louinglie, and saide that hee would giue them the licence which
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:3380:151"/>
they did aske at all times whensoeuer they woulde, &amp; although hee coulde not grant it them without first to consult with the vizroy of <hi>Aucheo,</hi> yet he would doo it within tenne dayes, and then those which woulde go vnto <hi>Macheo</hi> might presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and those which would go vnto <hi>Luzo,</hi> he would send them vnto <hi>Chincheo,</hi> that from thence the gouernour shoulde cause them to be sent in the first passage that goeth with merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Aytao</hi> was very peaceable and humaine, who hauing compassion on the Spaniards, for that they séemed vnto him to be good men: he commanded to bee giuen to them ouer &amp; aboue the kings alowance, a Hogge and Rice and other kind of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. So here with they went vnto their lodgings with content, and also the interpreter, who thought that hée was new borne againe that day.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. The Spaniards remaine certaine dayes in Canton, whither came certaine Portugals from Machao: at the first they feared them, but afterwards they were assured by the contractation they had the one with the other, that they were friendes: the vizroy of Aucheo commeth to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and dispatcheth the Spaniards, &amp; giueth them good prouision and intertainment.</head>
                  <p>AFter that the ten daies were past appointed by the <hi>Aytao,</hi> and some more, &amp; séeing that no more mention was made of them, but as though they had neuer séene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they were very sorowfull, &amp; in ielousie that the captaine general of <hi>Machao</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaide had knowledge howe that his craft and subtiltie was discouered, &amp; thereupon to begin &amp; frame some other: procuring for an instrument in the performing of the same, some Iudge or some other person of power and authoritie.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3380:151"/>
the one vnto the other, they presently did forget the euill suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that they had of them, and not onely that, but they did giue them great almes and charitie, helping and aiding them in all things, as it was méete and reason amongst Christians. So being void of their first care, they put all their diligence and care in their departure: and seeing that there was no mention made thereof by reason that the Iudges were occupied in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering the souldiers of that circuit in a great and mightie field whereas they were trained vp in Military exercises, some shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in bowes, some with hargabushes, tossing the pike, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of horses, and many other exercises mo: and after that they had many different proofes, as well of thinges past, as at that present, they ordained Captaines, such as were aduanced aboue all the rest, and most worthy: all which being finished, the Spaniards determined to put the <hi>Aytao</hi> in remembrance of his promise, &amp; the better y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might doo it, and with most breuitie, they ordained a petition, and went with the same vnto the house of the <hi>Aytao,</hi> therewith to aske licence to put it in vre. The first Iudge they met withall was the <hi>Tequisi</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, who made signes that they should come vnto him, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of them what they would haue.

So being read by the <hi>Aytao,</hi> he made answere by the same petition, that he had a particular care of them, and tarried onely for order from the vizroy, which could not tarrie long: the receiuing whereof hée woulde aduertise them, the which hee did accomplish in fewe dayes, which came with great content vnto the Spaniards, for that he commanded that they should be sent away in verie good order, and to giue them all that was néedfull for their iourney, and that in aboundance. The same day that this commission came, there came also newes that the vizroy would come vnto the cittie of <hi>Canton</hi>

should come thither: with great and mighty triumphall arkes, rich hangings, with other things, the which I do not here make mention of, although they were very curious, because I would not be tedious, for that I haue a great desire to conclude this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle historie: and if I should declare all that passed therin, it were requisite for the same alone to make a great volume.</p>
                  <p>Foure dayes after the comming of the vizroy, by his order, there was giuen both to the one &amp; to the other a prouision, in the which he commanded all Iudges and gouernors to receiue the Spaniards into their iurisdictions, whereas they should passe &amp; not to permit any to do them harme or iniury, but to giue them frée passage with securitie till such time as they should come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place appointed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said prouision, which was vnto <hi>Machao</hi> &amp; vnto <hi>Luzon</hi>: and iointly therewith he commanded two cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to beare them company til such time as they had brought them out of all danger.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3380:153"/>
they were shipped in a bigger barke, and entred into another riuer, which seemed to be an arme of the sea, in the which they sailed fiue dayes, and sawe sailing vp and downe the said riuer so many barks and boats, that it made them to be greatly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. These riuers were as wel replenished of cities and townes, as the other riuer whereof we haue spoken. Al which is a helpe to beleeue that which hath béene said of the mightinesse, and the great number of people that are in that mighty kingdom. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding this riuer they entred into another, but not so broade as the last, but a swifter current, and beset with mightie trées both on the one side and the other, and were so thick that almost they could not sée the sunne thorough them: and although the country very asper there alongst the riuers side, yet was there many walled citties, &amp; an infinite number of townes and vila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in such sort that the suburbs did almost ioyne the one vnto the other. So when they were disembarked out of this riuer, they trauelled by land other foure dayes, and greatly maruelled to see the great fertilitie of the country, and many other things more, which they do passe ouer, for that in the relation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

The host of the house where as they were lodged, when he saw that the people did spoile and distroy his house, he requested the Spaniards to go forth into a greene fielde which was there harde by, placed amongst a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Orchards, the which they did to satisfie him, &amp; also to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the multitude of people that were come thither only to sée them. The noise of the people was so great, that the gouernor feared there had bin some other matter, &amp; commanded a Iudge to go &amp; examine the cause and know the truth: but when that hee was certified thereof, hee commaunded the Spaniards to come vnto his house, for that hee was desirous and would sée them. They presently did accomplish his commandement, and went their way, and as they passed thorough the stréete, there were certaine representing a comedie, but so soone as
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:3380:153"/>
the people that were there did sée the Spaniardes they left the players all alone and followed them. They entred into the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors house, and found him with great maiestie of seruants and souldiers of his gard: he entertayned them with great loue, and asked them who they were, and from whence they came. The interpreter presently shewed the prouision they brought from the viceroy, which was in summe, their licence giuen by him for them to go vnto <hi>Chincheo,</hi> and that none should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe them in their iourney. But to ayde and giue them all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor possible &amp; that which was néedefull for their iourney. And when that he had read the same, he saide that thereby he did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that which he desired to know, &amp; how that the viceroy did command all gouernors, &amp; him as one of them, they should offer to do all that lay in them: the which he did accomplish and shewed them great fauour and friendship.</p>
                  <p>The dext day following, they departed out of this citie by land, being giuen vnto them by the gouernor, very good proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the way. The same day they came vnto a towne that was very fresh, and fiue leagues from the place they departed, there they determined to tarrie all that night, fearing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> passage through a citie which was but a league before, suspecting that they should be as much troubled with the people as they were in the other citie the day before. And although this was but a small towne, yet was there so great a concourse of people that came from the villages there abouts, that it caused them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the next morning more early than they thought, and all the night they could not sléepe, because of the great noyse of the people.</p>
                  <p>So within a while after they departed from that towne, they came vnto the citie aforesaide, the which for situation and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant buildings, was the fairest in all that prouince. Through the midst thereof ranne a mightie riuer, ouer the which were many bridges very great and most faire. Here were they so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with much people that came to sée them, that they were detayned in the presse a good while before they could enter into the citie: and after they were within they were compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in such sort, that they could not goe to seeke to eate, but were constrained to enter into a barke and go downe the riuer and shroud themselues amongst a company of trées, &amp; although
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3380:154"/>
they did vse this policie. Yet the number of people were so great that leapt into the same barke that they were readie to sinke, till such time as they that had entred the barke, to auoid that perill, returned and lept a shoore, leauing them all alone with the barkemen and marriners that did rowe, who went to seeke and bring them to eate, and they remained in the barke all that night.</p>
                  <p>So the next day in the morning, before the people could come to disturbe them, they rowed towards the great and huge citie of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> and entred into the same vppon a sunday in the morning being the sixt day of December.</p>
                  <p>They remained still in the barke for their owne quietnesse and security, and sent their interpreter with their prouision vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gouernour, that he might ordaine at his pleasure that which was therein commanded. The Gouernor when he had receiued commission he said vnto the interpreter that he should tell the Spaniards that he was very glad that they were come thither in safetie and in good health, and that hee should receiue great ioy to sée them, and to shew them the courtesie that was commanded him by the viceroy, in their prouision or commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     </gap>ble: and for the accomplishing of the same hee kept the commission of the viceroy, and gaue an other commission vnto the gouernor of the port whether as hee sent them, in the which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to be accomplished all that he had promised.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards, although they would very gladly haue séene the citie of <hi>Chincheo</hi> and the mightinesse thereof, yet did they accomplish that which the gouernor did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand without anie reply, for that they considered that it should come then better to passe. So they came vnto the said port the next day folowing in the morning, whereas they did remaine in the barke, doing as they did at <hi>Chincheo,</hi> &amp; sent their interpreter with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission vnto the gouernor, who presently after he had read the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3380:154"/>
same, sent &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that the Spaniards should come a shore and come and sée him: who did accomplish the same although with no lesse trouble than in other places, by reason of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that came to sée them. The gouernor intertained them with great loue and faire words, and before they departed from him, he sent to call a captaine of one of the ships y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was there bound vnto <hi>Luzon</hi> and asked of him when he would depart from that place, who answered within ten daies: then the gouernor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he should carrie them in his ship and to giue them the best intertainment that was possible, who promised him to accomplish the same, &amp; therwith he tooke his leaue of them, and sent them with the said captaine, who offered them all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour &amp; friendship that was requisite. He presently carried them vnto his ship, who after he had shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie therof, he made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a colation or banket with great friendship.</p>
                  <p>They remained in this port more than fiftéene daies, wheras they suffered very much colde and séeing that the ship wherein they were appointed to go, was not redie, neither any order for them to depart in many daies, considering the great desire they had to be amongst their owne nation, &amp; to take their ease, and hauing knowledge of an other ship that was ready &amp; would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, they altogither went vnto the gouernor (who was set in audience) &amp; said vnto him with a loud voice (as is vsed in al that countrie) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the captaine whom he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to carrie them vnto <hi>Luzon,</hi> was not readie to depart, neither any signe that he would in many daies, &amp; that he would giue them licence and command a captaine of an other ship that was there readie to depart, and went vnto the same Iland of <hi>Luzon,</hi> that he might carrie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they were so ill at ease, and suffered so much colde that they felt great griefe.</p>
                  <p>When the Gouernor heard this he was very angry, &amp; with great choler he commaunded one of his officers that was there with him, to go presently &amp; bring before him that captaine vnto whom he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the carriage of the Spaniards: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was accomplished and that in so short time, that it caused great wonder: who when he came before the gouernor, had so great feare, that he knew not whether he was in heauen or in earth. The gouernor straighwaies asked him what was the occasion that he did not depart within the tenne daies as he had sayde.</p>

                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:3380:155"/>The Captaine answered, that they had had no wether, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at that present wherewith they might nauigate. He asked him againe and saide, séeing that the weather and time would not serue, how is it that there is an other ship readie to depart. The captaine at this demand did faulter in his spéech, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered friuolous wordes, wherefore the Gouernor comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he should be whipped in his presence, for the lie which he had tolde, and as they were pulling off his apparell for to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the commandement, the Spaniards hauing pitie &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of him, for that he séemed to be an honest man, they fell all vpon their knées at the gouernors féete, and requested him to pardon his offence, who did presently consent therunto with a good will, and commanded to let him alone, but he spake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him very sharpe wordes, such as so farre foorth as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niardes could perceiue by the semblance both of the one and of the other, that was as much griefe vnto him as though he had béene whipped. Then presently he commanded to call the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of that ship that was readie to depart, and deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the commission that he had giuen vnto the other, with a great penaltie, and charged him to carrie the Spaniards vnto the Ilande of <hi>Luzon,</hi> and charged him to bring a testimoniall from thence, how that he had carried them in very good order and in saftie and left them at the place that they desired. This Captaine vnderstanding what had passed with the other, and because he would not sée himselfe in the like perplexitie, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the commandement, and thought the time long of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from thence, and did promise them more than they did demand, and made hast to depart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The next day following they went to sea, to prosecute their voyage, whereas they were taken with so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and foule weather, that the ship did driue they knew not whither, and many times in daunger to be drowned. This storme indured four dayes although more stronger at one time than at an other: in the which storme was separated the thrée ships the one from the other, in such sort that euerie one tooke his way, procuring to saue themselues, as commonly in such cases is vsed, without hauing any care the one of the other, and God was so pleased that the ship wherin the Spaniards were, and one of the other two entred into a sure port, although with great trouble and with so great a leake, that they could scarce kéepe her aboue water: but in especiall that which came in their safe conduct. And afterwarde they vnderstood that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ship had taken port fiftie leagues from that place with the like perill and danger. In this port they remained certaine dayes trimming their ships and tarrying for a faire winde. So they departed from thence the thrée and twentie day of Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and to their iudgementes with a setled and good winde, with the which they sayled fiue dayes, in the end wherof they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Iland of <hi>Luzon,</hi> with a singular ioy vnto them all, for the which the Spaniards gaue thankes vnto God, by whose fauour they had escaped the storme past.</p>
                  <p>But it so fell out, as they were going alongest the coast of the Iland for to enter into the port of <hi>Manilla,</hi> and being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fiue leagues of the entrie thereof, vpon a soddaine there arose the north wind with so great furie, and caused so great a sea, that they found themselues in a great deale more danger than in the other storme past, in such sort that they sponed before the winde with their foresayle halfe mast hie, shaking it selfe all to péeces, and in euerie minute of an houre readie to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The <hi>Chinos</hi> for that they are superstitious and witches, beganne to inuocate and call vpon the diuell, for to bring them out of that trouble (which is a thing commonly vsed amongest them, at all times when they finde themselues in the like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie)

                  <p>But when the Spaniards vnderstoode their dealinges, they did disturbe them that they shoulde not perseuer in their lottes and inuocations, and beganne to coniure the diuelles, which was the occasion that they would not answere vnto the inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Chinos,</hi> who did call them after diuerse man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (as hath béene declared in the first part of this historie) yet they heard a diuell saye, that they should not blame them because they did not answere vnto their demaunde, for they could not doo it for that they were disturbed by the coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So presently when the night was come God was so pleased that the storme ceased, and became in fewe houres very calme, although it indured but a while, for as they beganne to set sayle to nauigate towardes the port, and almost at the point to enter into the same a newe storme seised on them, and with so great force, that they were constrayned to returne vnto the sea, for feare to be broken in péeces vpon the shore.</p>
                  <p>At this time they wanted both water and victualles which was vnto them a newe torment, &amp; they were brought into so great extremitie, that for ninetie and sixe persons that were in the shippe, there was not left victuals for two dayes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chinos</hi> beganne a newe to inuocate the diuels by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which is a way that they neuer let but doo answere them, as they did at this instant, and were not disturbed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurations of the fathers, yet notwithstanding they lyed in their answere, for that they saide that within thrée dayes they should be within the citie of <hi>Manilla,</hi> and after it was more then four dayes.</p>

               <p>There was a ship that was bound vnto the firme land, and did arriue at that Ilande, in the which went two religious Fryers of the order of Saint Francis, and hauing no care as aforesayde, but very desirous to be a lande, they went a shore without any feare or suspition of any harme that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto them, and being at a riuer side sporting themselues with great recreation, by reason of the freshnesse thereof, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues of the long and painefull nauigation which they had comming from the Ilandes of the <hi>Canarias</hi> vnto that place, when the <hi>Caribes</hi> did sée them without any feare, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a soddaine they descended from a mountayne, and did kill them all, without leauing any person aliue. Many dayes they made great feastes and bankets, eating of those bodies which they had slaine, some sodde and some roasted, as their pleasure was.

               <p>Of these euils they haue committed an infinite number, and haue at this day with them many Spaniardes both men and women, whose liues they pardoned for to serue their vses, or euilles because they were verie young, of the which they say that some haue fled away.

Euery day they doo finde and discouer new countries, as in the yeare of fourescore and thrée you may perceiue by the entry which was made by <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio de Espeio,</hi> who with his companions did discouer a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in the which they found fiftéene prouinces, al ful of townes which were full of houses of foure and fiue stories high, the which they did name <hi>Nueuo Mexico,</hi> for that it doth resemble the old <hi>Mexico</hi> in many thinges.<note place="margin">New <hi>Mexico</hi>
                  </note> It is towards the North, and they do beleeue that that way, by inhabited place, they may come vnto that country which is called of the <hi>Labrador</hi> (of which shal be spoken more at large hereafter.)</p>
               <p>This kingdome towards the Orient dooth ioyne vnto the country of <hi>Peru,</hi>

               <p>To conclude, this kingdome is so great that vnto this day they cannot find the end therof: but euery day doth discouer new countries, whereas all the Indians that they do finde are verie easie to bee reduced vnto the Catholike faith, for that they are people very docible, ingenious, and of a good vnderstanding. There is amongst them diuers languages, and verie different

climes, although all generally doo vnderstande the <hi>Mexican</hi> tongue, which is most common. There are many prouinces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by Indians and Spaniards, that euery one of them is as bigge as a reasonable kingdome, yet the greatest and most principall is that of <hi>Mexico,</hi> whereas are many Indians and Spaniards which doo excéed all the rest in number: the names of them are <hi>Honduras, Guatimala, Campeche, Chiapa, Guaiaca, Mechuacan, Nueua galicia, Nueua Viscaya, Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi> and others mo, which I leaue out because I woulde not be tedious: in all the which, they haue either a royall audience and gouernors, or other Iustices all Spaniards.</p>
               <p>The naturall people whereof, neuer since they were conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted haue béene found in any heresie, nor in any thing contrarie vnto the Romish faith. All these prouinces are subiect and doo acknowledge that of <hi>Mexico</hi> as the principall: there whereas his maiestie hath his vizroy, an inquisition, an archbishop and a royall audience or court of Chancerie.</p>
               <p>This Cittie of <hi>Mexico</hi> is one of the best that is in all the whole world, and is situated vpon water after the manner and fashion of Uenice in Italie: in all this kingdome almost you cannot know when it is winter, or when it is summer, for that in al the whole yeare, there is smal difference betwixt the daies and the nights, by reason of the temperature of the countrie, the fieldes are gréene almost all the whole yeare, and trées beare fruit also almost all the whole yeare: for when it is winter in <hi>Europa,</hi> then doo their fall dewes from heauen which dooth cause all things to budde and flowre, and in the summer it doth ordinarily raine, but especially in the monethes of Iune, Iuly,<note place="margin">It rayneth almost euery day.</note> August and September in the which monethes it is a maruel when it raineth not euery day, and it is to bee wondred at, for that almost it neuer rayneth but from noone forwards, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer passeth midnight, so that it neuer troubleth them that doo trauell by the way, for that they may beginne their iourney at midnight, and trauell vntill the next day at noone. It raineth vnreasonably and with so great furie and force, that the time that it dooth indure, it is requisite to flie from the showers, for that many times they are so hurtfull that one sole shower ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the life of a man.</p>

Touching the dressing and adorning of a church with flowers and other curiosities, they are maruellous politike: they are reasonable good painters in some places: they make images of the feathers of small birdes which they call in their language <hi>Cinsones,</hi> which haue no féete, and féede of nothing else, but of the dewe that falleth from heauen, and is a thing greatly to be séene, and was wont in Spaine to cause great admiration, but in especiall vnto such as were famous painters,<note place="margin">Pictures made of fethers.</note> to sée with what curiositie and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie they did make their pictures, in applying euery colour of the feathers in his place. They are people of great charitie, but in especiall vnto the Ecclesiasticals: which is the occasion that one of them may trauell from sea to sea (which is more then fiue hundred leagues) without the spending of one riall of plate in victuals, or in any other thing, for that the naturals doo giue it them with great good will and affection, for the which in all their common places of resort, which is an Inne for strangers: they haue men appointed for to prouide for all Ecclesiastical men that doo trauel, of all that they haue néede, and likewise vnto the common people for their money. They doo not onely receiue great content with them, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues doo go and request them to come vnto their townes, at the entrie whereof they make them great entertainement: they go all foorth of the towne both small and great in procession, and manie times more then halfe a league, with the sounde of trumpets, flutes and hoybuckes. The principallest amongst them go forth with bowes and nosegayes in their hands, of the which they doo make a present vnto such religious as they doo receiue: and sometimes they cast them more flowers then they woulde willingly they shoulde. Generally, they doo reuerence all Ecclesiasticals, but in particular, those of such religious houses, which in that kingdome were the first that did conuert them, and baptise them, &amp; they do it in such sort, that if the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man will for any offence punish or whippe any of them, they do it with such facilitie, as a master of a schoole doth beate his schollers that he doth learne.</p>

                  </note> in the which by a certaine occasion the naturall people thereof did kill one of the Friers companions: who, as also the souldiers that went with him, séeing and perceiuing the successe, and likewise fearing that thereof might happen some other greater danger, they determined with a common consent to returne vnto the mines from whence they departed, with consideration, that the company which went with him were very fewe to make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance against such successes as might happen, being so farre distant from the dwellings of the Spaniards, and from their necessarie succour. The two religious men which remained did not onely refuse their determination, but rather sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good occasion to put their good desire in execution, and so much ripe <hi>Mies,</hi> or dainties for the Lordes table, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:3380:167"/>
séeing they could not perswade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> souldiers to procéed forwards in the discouering thereof: they alone remained in the said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince with their Indian boyes, and a <hi>Mestizo</hi> that they carried with them, thinking that although they did remaine alone, yet were they there in securitie, by reason of the great affabilitie and loue wherewith the naturall people did intreat them.</p>
               <p>So when the eight souldiers came vnto the place that they desired, they straight wayes sent the newes of al that happened vnto the Cittie of <hi>Mexico,</hi> vnto the vizroy, which is distant from the mines of Saint <hi>Barbora</hi> one hundred and thrée score leagues. But the Friers of S. Francis were very much agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for the remaining there of their brethren, and fearing least they should be slaine for that they were there alone, they began to moue the hearts &amp; minds of other souldiers, that were in the company of another religious Frier of that order, called Frier <hi>Bernardino Beltran,</hi> for to returne to the said prouince, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the aforesaide two religious men out of danger, and from thence to prosecute &amp; go forwards with their enterprise begun.</p>
               <p>At this time there were at the said mines by a certaine occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, an inhabitant of the Cittie of <hi>Mexico</hi> called <hi>Antonio de Espeio,</hi> a very rich man of great courage and industrie, and verie zealous in the seruice of the maiestie of king Philip: hée was naturally borne of <hi>Cordoua,</hi> who when that he vnderstood the great desire of the saide Friers, and howe much it did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, did offer himselfe to go on that iournay, and to spend ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on part of his substance, besides the venturing of his life. So licence being granted vnto him to prosecute the same by some that did represent the kings person, and was procured by the saide Friers, there was appointed and giuen him for captaine Iohn <hi>de Ontiueros</hi> (who was chiefe bayley for his maiestie, in the townes which are called the foure <hi>Cienegas</hi> which are in the gouernement of the new Biscay, seuenty leagues from the aforesaid mines of S. <hi>Barbora</hi>) and he to go with him, and gather togither men and souldiers, such as he could, for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, and helpe to follow their Christian intent.</p>
               <p>The said <hi>Antonio de Espeio</hi> was so earnest in this matter, that in a few dayes he had ioyned togither souldiers, and made prouision necessarie for the iourney, and spent therein a great part of his substance, and departed altogether from the valley

               <p>Within few dayes after they came vnto a great inhabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Indians, where they came foorth to receiue them, by newes that they had of their neighbours, and brought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many curious thinges made of feathers of different colours and many mantles made of cotton, barred with blewe and white, like vnto them that are brought from <hi>China,</hi> to truck for other thinges.

               <p>So following the saide riuer, they came vnto an other inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitance of much more people than the other past, of whom they were well receiued, and welcomed with many presents, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of fish, for that they haue great store by reason of certaine great lakes not farre from thence, wherein is bred great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.

               <p>From this prouince they folowed their iourney for the space of 15. daies, without méeting any people: they trauelled amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst high &amp; mightie pine trées like those of Spaine, at the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, after they had traueiled to their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts four score leagues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they came vnto a small village of very few people, very poore, &amp; their houses made of strawe: they had great quantity of déere skins as well dressed as those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are brought out of Flanders, great store of excellent white &amp; good salt.

               <p>In the ende of two dayes trauaile amongest these trées, they came vnto tenne townes the which were situated alongst this riuer side on both partes, besides others that appeared, but farther distant.

               <p>In this Prouince they did receiue them courteously, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them vnto their townes whereas they gaue them great store of prouision and hennes of the countrie, with many other things, and that with a great good will. In these townes were houses of foure stories high, verie well wrought and gallant chambers,<note place="margin">Houses of 4. tories high.</note> and most of them had steuues or hote houses for the winter. They are all apparelled with cotton and of deares skinnes. the manner and apparell both of the men and of the women, is much like vnto the Indians, of the kingdome of <hi>Mexico.</hi> But that which did cause them most for to woonder,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3380:170"/>
was, to sée both men and women to weare both bootes and shooes of very good lether, with thrée sooles of neates leather: a thing which they haue not séene but onely there. The women go without any thing vpon their heades, but their haire trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kembed and dressed.

               <p>In all their tyllages and ploughed groundes, of the which they haue many and very great: they haue on the one side of them, a portall or shedde built vppon foure pillers, whereas the labourers doo eate and passe away the heate of the day, and are people verie much giuen to labour, and doo continually oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie themselues therein: it is a countrie full of mountaynes and woods of pine trées.

               <p>SO after they had béene foure dayes in this prouince, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, &amp; not farre distant from the same, they came vnto an
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:3380:171"/>
other, which was called the prouince of the <hi>Tiguas,</hi> in the which they found sixtéene townes, in the one of the same called <hi>Poa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> they vnderstood that the Indians had slaine the two Friers <hi>Francisco Lopez</hi> and Frier <hi>Augustine,</hi> whome they went to seeke: and with them thrée boyes &amp; a <hi>Mestizo.</hi> But when they of this towne &amp; their neighbours vnderstoode, being pricked in conscience, &amp; fearing that the Spaniards came to plague them, and to be reuenged for the death of the saide fathers, they durst not abide, but left their houses voide, and fled vnto the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that were nighest hande, from whence they could neuer cause them to descende, neither by giftes nor policie. They founde in their houses great store of victualles and an infinite number of hennes of the countrie, diuers sortes of metals, and some of them séemed to be very good: they could not perfectly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande the number of people that were in that countrie, for that they were fled vnto the mountaines, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Being fully certified of the death of them that they went to séeke for, they entred into counsell to determine whether they should returne vnto new <hi>Bizcaya,</hi> from whence they came, or to procéede forwarde: in the which there were diuers opinions. But by reason that they vnderstoode there, that towardes the port of the orient from that place, and not farre distant from that prouince, there were very great townes and rich, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues so nigh them, the captaine <hi>Antonio de Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> with the consent of the religious Fryer aforesaide called <hi>Bernardino Beltran,</hi> and the most part of his souldiers &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, determined to procéede forwardes in the discouerie thereof, till such time as they did sée to what end it would come. that they might the better giue perfect and iust notice therof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his maiestie, as witnesses that had séene it.</p>
               <p>So being in conformitie they determined, they remayning there sentenela, or royall companie, the captaine with other two companions with him should go forwardes in the demand of their desire, which foorthwith they put in execution. So at the end of two dayes of their trauaile, they came vnto a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, where they discouered aleuen townes, and much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in them, which in their iudgement did passe fortie thousand soules. It was a countrie very well replenished &amp; fertile, whose confines are ioyned vnto the lande of the <hi>Cibola,</hi> whereas is
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3380:171"/>
great store of kyne, of whose skins they do apparell themselues and with cotton, hauing the vse of gouernement amongest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as their neighbours haue: there are signes and tokens of many rich mynes, and found in their houses certaine mettalles, these Indians do worship Idols: they receiued the Spaniardes with peace, and gaue them to eate. Seéing this and the disposition of the countrie they returned vnto their sentenela from whence they departed, to giue notice vnto their companions of all that hath béene saide.</p>
               <p>So when they were come vnto their companions aforesaid, they had notice and vnderstanding of an other prouince called the <hi>Quires,</hi> which was vp the riuer on the north, sixe leagues distant. So they departed thitherwardes, and when they came within a league of the place: there came foorth in peace a great companie of Indians, and requested that they would goe with them vnto their townes: the which they did, and were verie well entertayned and had great cheare. In this prouince they sawe but onely fiue townes, in the which there was a great number of people, which vnto their iudgement did passe fiftéene thousand soules, and doo worship Idolles as their n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighbours doo. They found in one of these townes a Pye in a cage, as is the vse in Spaine, &amp; <hi>Tirasoles</hi> as those which are brought from <hi>China,</hi> and painted on them the sunne &amp; the moone with many starres: and taking the altitude thereof, they founde it to be in seuen and thirtie degrées and a halfe vnder the north poole.</p>
               <p>They departed from this prouince, and trauelling by the same course or Rutter, fourtéene leagues from thence, they came to an other prouince called the <hi>Cunames,</hi> whereas they discouered other fiue townes: and that which was the principal and biggest of them, is called <hi>Cia,</hi> which was of such huge big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it had in it eight places: their houses be plastered with lyme, and painted with diuerse colours, much better than they had séene in any prouince past. It séemed that the people that were there did passe in number twentie thousande soules: they gaue presentes vnto the Spaniardes with many curious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles, and of victualles to eate maruellously well dressed, and iudged the people to be more curious and of more estimation of themselues, than any that thitherto they had séene, and of greater gouernement. They shewed vnto them rich metalles,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:3380:172"/>
and the mountaines that were hard by,<note place="margin">ich metals.</note> whereas they did take it out. Here they had notice of an other prouince which was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north west, and determined to go thither.</p>
               <p>So after they departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, &amp; had trauailed sixe leagues, they came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said prouince, which was called <hi>Arneias,</hi> in the which was seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great townes, &amp; in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thirtie thousand soules: they said that one of these seuen townes was very great &amp; faire, the which they would not go to see, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was situated behinde a mountaine, as also they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some euill successe, if that they should be deuided the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. They are people after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fashion of the other prouince their neighbors, with as much prouision and as well gouerned. Fiftéene leagues from this prouince, trauelling co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> northwest, they came to a great towne called <hi>Acoma</hi>: it had in it more than sixe thousande soules: it was situated and placed vpon a high rock, the which was more than fiftie fadam in height, and had no other entry but by a payre of staires, the which was made &amp; cut out of the same rocke, a thing the which did cause great admiration vnto the Spaniardes: all the water that they had in this towne was in cesterns. The principallest hereof came with peace for to sée the Spaniards, &amp; brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many mantles, and shamwayes very well dressed, and great quantitie of prouision, they haue their corne fields two leagues from that place, and for to water them they take water out of a small riuer there harde by. Upon the saide riuer side they sawe many fields with roses, like vnto those that are in Spain: there are many mountaines which shewe to haue mettals, although they went not vp to sée it, for that the Indians be many, &amp; very warrelike people. The Spaniards remained in this place thrée daies, in one of the which the naturall people thereof did make vnto them a solemne dance, &amp; came foorth in the same with gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant apparell and with maruellous ingenious pastimes with the which they reioyced excéedingly. So four &amp; twentie leagues from this place, they came vnto a prouince called in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall language <hi>Zuny,</hi> and the Spaniards do call it <hi>Cibola,</hi> there is in it a great number of Indians. In the which was <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco Vazquez Coronado,</hi> and left there erected many crosses and many other signes and tokens of christendome, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually did remaine standing. They found there three christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:3380:172"/>
Indians, which were left there at that time, whose names were, <hi>Andres de Cuyoacon, Gasper de Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio de Guadalaiara,</hi> who had almost forgotten their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, &amp; could speake very well that of this countrie: yet with a little vse after they had talked with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they did easily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them. Of these they vnderstood that thrée score iourneyes from thence was there a lake very great about the which was situated many excellent good townes, &amp; that the natural people thereof had very much gold, &amp; it séemed to be true for that they did all weare braslets &amp; eareringes of the same. The foresaide <hi>Francisco Vazques Coronado</hi> hauing certaine intelligence of the same he departed from this prouince of <hi>Cibola,</hi> &amp; went that way: and hauing trauelled twelue iourneyes, his water did faile him, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he determined to returne backe againe as he did, with pretence to returne an other time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better oportunity should be had: the which afterwards he did not put in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that by death all his determinations &amp; prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces were cut off.</p>

               <p>VPon the newes of this great riches aforesaide, the sayde captaine <hi>Antonio de Espeio,</hi> determined to go thether, where were of his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most part of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religious fryer was of the contrarie opinion, &amp; sayd that it was high time to returne vnto new <hi>Bizcaya</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence they came, for to giue notice of all that they had séene, the which they did put in execution within few daies after, the most part of them: and left the captain with alonely nine companions that would follow him. Who after that hee had fully certified himselfe of the riches aboue said, and of the great quantitie of good metals, that were there.

               <p>So after that they had trauelled eight and twentie leagues, they came into an other prouince the which was very great, in the which to their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t were more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fifty thousand soules: whose inhabitants, when they vnderstood of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming they sent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a messenger, which said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if they would not be slaine of them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should not approch any nearer vnto their townes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:3380:173"/>Unto the which the said captaine answered, that they came not thether to do them any harme as they should well perceiue, and also did request them that they would not disturbe them in the prosecuting of their pretence, and gaue vnto the messenger certaine things such as they carryed with them, who did praise so much the Spaniards, that he did appease the troubled minds of the Indians, in such sort, that they did of their owne good wil grant them licence for to enter into their townes. The which they did with one hundreth and fiftie Indians their friends, of the Prouince of <hi>Cibola</hi> aforesaide, and with the thrée Indians of <hi>Mexico,</hi> of whom we made mention.</p>
               <p>Before they came vnto the first towne by a league, there went foorth to méete and receiue the Spaniards more than two thousande Indians laden with victualles and prouision, vnto whome our Captaine did giue thinges of small price: yet it seemed vnto them to be of great estimation more than golde. So when they came nigher vnto the towne called <hi>Zaguato,</hi> there came foorth to receiue them a great number of Indians, and amongest them their <hi>Caciques,</hi> and made a great showe of mirth and ioy, and threw vppon the ground much flower of <hi>Maiz</hi> that their horse might tread vpon it. With these feastes, ioy and pleasure, they entred into the towne, whereas they were very well receiued, lodged, and made much of: the which the captaine did partly recompence, in giuing vnto all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallest amongest them, hattes, and glasse beades, and many other thinges more, which they carried with them to serue the like oportunitie.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caciques</hi> did foorthwith dispatch and send aduice vnto all those of that prouince, giuing them to vnderstande of the comming of their new guestes, and how that they were verie curteous men, &amp; did no harme. Which was occasion sufficient to cause them all to come laden with presentes vnto the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes, and did request them for to goe vnto their townes to sport and recreate themselues: the which they did, but alwaies with great care and respect of what so euer might happen. For the which t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e captaine did vse a policie with them, which was, that he tolde vnto the <hi>Caciques,</hi> that for so much as his horse were verie fierce and furious, and that they had told them that they would kill them, therefore for to shunne the damage and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:3380:173"/>
harme that might happen vnto the Indians, it were requisite to make a fort with lyme and stone, to put them in. The <hi>Caci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> did giue such credite vnto his words that in a few houres they had ioyned together so much people, that they made a fort according as the Spaniardes did request, &amp; that with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible breuitie. Besides this when the captaine sayd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would depart, they brought vnto him a present of fortie thousand ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of cotton, some white, and some painted: and a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of hand towels with tassels at the corners, and many other thinges, and amongst them rich metals, which shewed to haue much siluer. Amongst these Indians they had great notice and knowledge of the lake aforesaid, &amp; they were conformable vnto the other, in that touching the great riches &amp; abundance of gold.</p>
               <p>The captaine hauing great confidence in this people and of their good dispositions, he determined after certaine daies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had bin there, to leaue fiue of his companions and the rest of the Indians his friends, that they might returne vnto the prouince of <hi>Zuny</hi> with all their bagage: and hee himselfe with the other four that remained, would go more at quiet to discouer certaine very rich mynes, of the which he had true notice. So according vnto his determination he departed with the guides he had, and hauing trauelled toward the northwest fiue &amp; forty leagues, he came vnto the saide mynes, and tooke out of the same with his owne hands rich metals, and very much siluer:<note place="margin">Rich metals.</note> the mynes had a great &amp; brode veine, it was vpon a rocke whereas they might go vp to it with great ease, for that there was a way open to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> effect: nigh therunto were certain townes of Indians amongst the mountaines, who shewed friendship vnto them, and came foorth to receiue them with crosses in their hands, &amp; other signes and tokens of peace: nigh vnto the same they saw two reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riuers, vppon whose hankes there were many vines full of excellent good grapes, great walnut trées, and very much flaxe, like vnto that of Spaine, and it was tolde them by signes, that on the other side of the saide mountaines there was a riuer of 8. leagues brode But they could not vnderstand how nigh it was, yet did they make demonstration, that it did run his course to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north sea, and vpon both sides thereof was situated many townes, and of so huge bignes, that in comparison those wherein they were, were but suburbes in respect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:3380:174"/>So after the Captaine had taken all this relation hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towardes the prouince of <hi>Zuny,</hi> whither he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his other companions to goe, and at their comming thether in health, which was by an other excellent way, he found therwith his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Unto whom the naturals of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie had giuen good intertaynement and all thinges necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and that in abundance: and afterwardes did the like vnto the sayde Captaine and vnto them that came with him, and went foorth to receiue him with demonstration of great ioy, and gaue them great store of prouision for their iourney pretended, requesting him to returne againe with breuitie, and to bring with him many <hi>Castillas</hi> (for so they doo call the Spaniardes) and they would giue them all to eate: for the which (the better to accomplish the same) they had sowed that yeare more wheate and other graine, then they had done in any other yeare past.</p>
               <p>At this present the sayde religious Fryer and the rest of the souldiers did ratifie their first determination aforesaide, and concluded to returne vnto the Prouince from whence they came, with the pretence before spoken of, and there ioyned with him in that iourney, <hi>Gregorio Hernandez,</hi> who was standert bearer in that attempt.</p>
               <p>So when they were departed the captain who remained but with eight souldiers, did fully resolue himselfe to prosecute his begun pretence, &amp; to take his course vp alongst the north riuer: which being but in execution, and hauing trauelled about 60. leagues towards the prouince of <hi>Quires</hi> aforesaid, 12. leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence towards the orient, they came vnto a prouince called <hi>Gubates,</hi> whereas the Indians receiued them with peace, and gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great store of prouision<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also notice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence there were certaine rich mynes, the which they founde, and tooke out of them glystering metale and very good, with the which they returned to the towne from whence they departed.</p>
               <p>They iudged this prouince to haue nigh vpon fiue &amp; twentie thousande soules, all well apparelled with painted mantles of cotton, &amp; shamwayes skins very well dressed. There are many

By the which they trauelled one hundred and twentie leagues. From thence they came vnto the riuer of the <hi>Conchas</hi> there whereas they first entred, and from thence vnto the vale of S.

And when they came thether they vnderstood that many dayes before were arriued there in health, frier <hi>Bernardino Beltran</hi> and his companions, &amp; were gonefrom thence vnto the village of <hi>Guadiana.</hi> In this towne the captaine <hi>Antonio de Espeio</hi> made a certaine &amp; true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all this aforesaide, the which presently he sent vnto the Earle of <hi>Corunnia,</hi> viceroy of that kingdome: and he sent it vnto his maiestie, and vnto the Lords of the royall counsell of the Indians, that therin they might ordaine that which séemed them best, the which they haue done with great care. I beséech the Lord God if it be his pleasure that it may go forwardes in such order, that so many soules redéemed by his precious bloud be not condemned: whose wits &amp; vnderstanding do farre excéed those of <hi>Mexico</hi> &amp; <hi>Peru,</hi> as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> information of those y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue delt with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appeareth, wherby we may presume that with great facilitie they will imbrace the law of the gospell, and leaue the Idolatrie that the most part of them do vse, which God for his mercies sake permit, so it may be for his glorie, and exalting of the catholike faith</p>

               <p>Being departed from this port they sayle towards the south west, till they come into twelue degrées &amp; a halfe, to séeke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous wind to serue their turne, which the marriners do call <hi>Brizas,</hi> and are northerly windes, which are there of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance &amp; so fauourable, that being in the moneths of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, December, and Ianuarie, they haue no néede to touch their sayles, which is the occasion that they do make their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages with so great ease. So that for that, &amp; for the fewe stormes that happened in that passage, they do cal it the <hi>mar de Damas</hi> (which is the sea of Ladies).<note place="margin">The sea of Ladies.</note> They sayle alwayes towards the west, following the sunne when as she departeth from our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mispherie. In this south sea they sayle fortie daies without séeing anie lande: at the end whereof they came to the Ilandes of <hi>Velas,</hi> which by an other name are called <hi>de los Ladrones</hi>: there are seuen or eight of them, they do lye north and south, and are inhabited with much people, in the order as you shall vnderstand.</p>

               <p>In these Ilands there is one the strangest custome that euer hath bin heard of or séene in all the whole world, which is, that vnto the young men there is a time limited for them to marrie in (according vnto their custome) in all which time, they may fréely enter into the houses ofsuch as are married, and be there with their wiues, without being punished for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, although their proper husbands should sée them: they doo carrie in their handes a staffe or rodde, &amp; when they do enter into the married mans house they doo leaue it standing at the doore, in such sort, that if any do come after, they may plainly sée it: which is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that although it be her proper husband, he cannot enter in till it be taken away. The which custome is obserued and kept with so great rigour and force, that whosoeuer is against this lawe, all the rest do kill him.</p>

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:3380:176"/>
were woont to haue warre the one with the other, when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion did force them: as it happened at such time as the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes were there in the port of the said Iland: there came abord their ships to the number of two hundred small barkes or botes in the which came many of the inhabitants thereof, to sell vnto them of the ships, hens, &amp; nuts called <hi>cocos, patatas,</hi> and other thinges of that Iland, and to buy other such things as our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did carrie with them, but in especiall yron (vnto the which they are very much affectionated) and vnto things of chrystall and such like of small estimation. But there grew a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention amongest them, which people of what Ilande should first come vnto the shippes, and was in such order that they fell vnto blowes, and wounded the one the other maruellously more liker beastes than men: of the which there were many slaine in the presence of the Spaniards, and would neuer leaue off their contention a good while, till in the end by way of peace they consented a conclusion amongest themselues, but with a great noyse, which was, that those of one Iland should go to the larbord of the ship, and those of the other Iland should go to the starbord, with the which they were pacified, and did buy and sel at their pleasure. But at their departure from our people, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their good intertainment they threw into the ship of their dartes hardened with fire, with the which they did hurt many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were aboue hatches: yet went they not away scotfrée, for that our people with their hargabushes did paye them in readie money their bold attempt.</p>

If that at such time as the ships doo passe that way vnto <hi>Manilla</hi> they would leaue there some religious men, with souldiers to garde them till the next yeare, and might be doone with small cost.

The language which they doo vse, to any mans iudgement is easie to be learned, for that their pronunciation is verie plaine, they call ginger <hi>asno,</hi> and for to say (take away your harga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush) they say <hi>arrepeque.</hi> The pronunciation of their wordes is neither in the nose nor in the throte. It is vnderstood that they be all Gentiles, by certaine signes and tokens that our people haue seene them do, and that they doo worship Idols, and the diuell, vnto whom they do sacrifice such as they do take in the warres of their borderers.

               <p>So after a while that he had beene there resting of himselfe, he returned and diued vnder the water againe, &amp; swam so farre

as he thought that the bullet of the hargubush could not reach to hurt him, and finding himselfe in securitie, he tooke the sword from betwixt his legges whereas he did carrie it in secret, and beganne to florish with the same, mocking our people whom he had so easily deceiued.</p>
               <p>This kind of stealing, and many others which they had done and that with great subtiltie, is the occasion that they beare the names of théeues, and all the Ilandes whereas they doo dwell doo beare the name thereof, the which they will easily pardon, if they might ordinarily finde, where as they might execute their inclination.</p>

This citie standeth in fourtéen degrées &amp; a quarter, and round about the same there are so many Ilandes, that vnto this day there is none that euer could number them: they do extend all of them northwest and southwest, &amp; north &amp; south, in so much that the one part stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the straight of <hi>Sincapura</hi> which is fiue and twentie leagues from <hi>Malaca,</hi> and the other part vnto the <hi>Malucos,</hi> &amp; other Ilandes, whereas they gather a great number of cloues, pepper, &amp; ginger, of the which there are great mountaines full.

               <p>So when all things were in a redinesse for to depart on their voyage (the which was done with great breuitie) they ordained for generall of all that sleete one <hi>Villa Lobos,</hi> commanding him to go by the <hi>Nueua Espania.</hi> This <hi>Villa Lobos,</hi> arriued at the Ilands of <hi>Malucas,</hi> and at those of <hi>Terrenate</hi> &amp; at other Ilands ioyning vnto them, the which Ilands were laid to gage by the aforesaid Emperor vnto the crowne of Portugal.</p>
               <p>In these Ilands they had great wars by meanes of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals, and séeing themselues with little helpe and small resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, for to go forwards with their conquest, they left it off, and went to the most part of them with the aforesaide Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals vnto the <hi>India</hi> of Portugall, from whence afterwards they sent them as prisoners vnto the said king of Portugall, as offenders, that had entred his Ilands without his licence: who did not onely leaue to do them any harme, but did intreat them very well and sent them vnto their owne country of Spaine, &amp; gaue them al thinges necessary for their iourney, and that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance.</p>

               <p>Of ancient time these Ilandes were subiect vnto the king of <hi>China,</hi> vntill such time as hee did deliuer them vp of his owne frée will, for such reasons as were spoken off in the first part of this historie: &amp; that was the occasion that when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards came vnto them, they were without Lorde or heade, or anie other to whom they shoulde shewe duetie, but hee which had most power and people did most command: so that this (and that there were so many of equal power) was the occasion that ciuill warres continued, without any respect of nature, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or any other duety, but like vnto brute beasts, killing, spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and captiuing one another, the which was a great help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> vnto the Spaniards for to subiect that countrie with so great ease vnto the king, and called them the Ilands <hi>Philippinas</hi> in respect of his name. They did vse amongst them to make cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and slaues such as they did take in vnlawfull wars, and for trifling matters, the which God did remedie by the going thither of the Spaniards: for you should haue a man with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or fiftie other friends in his company, or seruants, that vpon a sodaine would go and set vpon a small village of poore people and vnprouided, and take and binde them all, and carrie them away for slaues without any occasion or reason, and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to serue them all the dayes of their life, or else sell them to other Ilands. And if it so chanced that one did lende vnto another a basket or two of Rice (the which might bee woorth a ryall of plate) with condition to returne it againe within ten dayes: if the debter did not pay it the same day, the next day following he should pay it dooble, and afterward to double it euery day so long as he did kéepe it, which in conclusion the debt would grow to be so great, that to pay the same, he is forced to yéeld himselfe for captiue and slaue.</p>
               <p>But vnto all such as were captiued in this order, or in such

               <head>CHAP. XIII. Here is declared of some notable things that are, and haue beene seene in these Ilands Philippinas.</head>
               <p>THey of these Ilandes were accustomed to celebrate their feastes aforesaid, and to make sacrifices vnto their Idols, by the order of certaine women which were witches,<note place="margin">Vitches.</note> whome they do call in their language <hi>Holgoi,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were had in as great estimation amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as be the priests amongst Christians. These did talke ordinarily with the diuell, and many times in publike, and do diuellish witchcrafts both in words and déeds: into whom it is to be beléeued that the diuell did enter, for that straightwayes they did answere vnto all things that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them, although for the most part they woulde tell a lie, or els such wordes that might bee giuen diuers interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of, and of diuers vnderstandings. They did also vse to cast lottes, in such sorte as hath bene declared in the first part of this history: they were great <hi>Agorismers</hi> or obseruers of times: in so much that if they begin any iourney, and at the beginning they méete with a <hi>Cayman</hi> or lyzarde, or any other sauage worme, they know it to be a signe of euill fortune, whereupon they would straightwayes leaue off their iourney, although it did import them very much, and returne vnto their houses, saying, that the heauen will not that they shoulde go forwards on that iourney: but all these lies and falsenes which béene taught them, &amp; they perswaded to by the diuell, is ouerthrowne and taken away by the law of the Gospel (as aforesaide) &amp; haue now amongst them many monasteries full of religious men, of the order of saint Austen, saint Francis, and of Iesuits. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the common opinion, at this day there is conuerted and baptised more then foure hundred thousand soules, which is a great number: yet in respect of the quantitie that are not as yet conuerted, there are but a few. It is left vndone (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) for want of ministers, for that, although his maiesty doth ordinarily send thither without any respect of the great charge in doing the same, yet by reason that there are so many Ilands, and euerie day they doo discouer more &amp; more, and being so far off, they cannot come vnto them all, as necessitie requireth.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:3380:179"/>
Such as are baptised, doo receiue the fayth with great firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and are good Christians, and would be better, if that they were holpen with good ensamples: as those which haue béene there so long time are bounde to doe: that the lacke thereof doth cause some of the inhabitantes so much to abhorre them, that they would not sée them once paynted vpon a wall. For proofe whereof (and for to moue such as haue power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to put remedie in the same, I will declare vnto you here a strange case, the which Royally did passe of a trueth in one of these Ilandes, and is verie well knowne amongst them: that is, there chanced to die an Ilander, a principall man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, a few dayes after that he was baptised, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contrite for his sinnes the which hee had done against God before he was baptised, and after hee died. So after by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine permission of God he appeared vnto many of that Ilands whom he did perswade forthwith to receiue the baptisme, with reasons of great efficacie, and declared vnto them (as one that had experienced the same) the rewarde of that good déede which without all doubt shoulde bee giuen vnto them, if they would receiue the same, and liue after conformable, and according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the commandements of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the which he told them and said that forthwith so soone as he was dead, he was carried by the Angels into glorie, there whereas all things were of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, pleasure, and content, and did communicate onely in the sight of God, and that there was none that entred therein, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde enter, except hee were baptised, according vnto the preaching of the Spaniards, of whome and of others that were like vnto them, there was an infinite number. Therefore if so be that they would go and inioy of those benefites and delights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is necessarie that first they should be baptised, and afterwards to obserue and kéepe the commandements that be preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by the fathers, that are amongst the <hi>Castillas,</hi> and therewith he vanished away,<note place="margin">The Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would not go into heauen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there were spanish souldiers.</note> and they remained treating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues concerning that which they had hearde, and was the occasion that some of them forthwith receiued the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and that others did delay it, saying, that because there were Spaniard souldiers in glory, they would not go thither, because they would not be in their company.</p>

               <p>FOr that the principall intent of these religious men when they went out of Spaine, was for to go vnto the mightie kingdome of <hi>China</hi> for to preach the holy gospell, and did perseuer continually with that desire, they woulde neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of any other thing, but onely to put it in execution: and for the accomplishing of the same, they sought many meanes and waies, sometimes in requesting the gouernor of his aide and helpe to procure the same, for that it was an easie thing to be performed, hauing continually ships of the merchants of <hi>China</hi> in the port of <hi>Manilla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The gouernor did driue them off with many reasons, but principally he laid before them that rigorous lawe, which they knew was established against such as did enter into that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without particular licence, yet notwithstanding all this was not sufficient to abate the louing desire of those Friers, which was onely setled in their mindes for to go and preach the holy gospel in that kingdome by one meanes or other, although it were to put their liues in hazard: and for the prosecuting hereof, the comissary of those Ilands, who was Frier <hi>Geroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo de Burgos</hi> did elect sixe religious men for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: amongst them was the father <hi>Ignatio,</hi> of whome I (as I haue said) vnderstood by writing and relation, many thinges, the which is declared in these <hi>Itinerario</hi> or comentarie: so that there was with him seuen religious men, all seruants of God, and very desirous of the saluation of soules, which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that they put themselues in so long and tedious a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, leauing their owne countrie and quietnesse.

and perseuerance, and carried in their company a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard their friende, called Iohn <hi>De Feria,</hi> of <hi>Andolozia,</hi> and other two souldiers that went with pretence to become friers, one Portugall and sixe Indian Ilanders: all the which the eight day after <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> which was the one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie day of Iune, in <hi>anno</hi> 1582. they departed from the port of <hi>Cabite,</hi> whereas they did imbarke themselues in a barke of the saide Iohn <hi>De Feria,</hi> and making saile at fiue of the clocke in the afternoone, in the morning betimes they founde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues twentie leagues ouerthwart the port that is called <hi>Del Fraile,</hi> whereas they determined to go to sea, leauing the coast of the Ilande of <hi>Manilla,</hi> which lieth North and South with <hi>China</hi>: from the which Cittie which is (as I haue saide) in fourtéene degrées and a halfe, vnto the Cape of <hi>Boxeador</hi> which is in ninetéene, it is one hundreth leagues sailing, and from this Cape to the firme land of <hi>China,</hi> they count it scarce fourescore leagues. And God was so pleased, although they had two dayes calme, the seuenth day, which was the day before the apostle saint Peter and saint Paule, at eight of the clocke in the morning, they discouered the firme lande of <hi>China</hi>: then straightwaies vpon the sight thereof, the comissarie commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bring foorth the habites which hee carried readie made for to put vpon the Friers, for that when the <hi>Chinos</hi> shoulde see that they were all Friers, they should be voide of all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to thinke them to be spies, as they thought when the first Friers went thither (as hath beene tolde you,) and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented herewith, hee threw all the souldiers apparell into the sea, and one hargabus of Iohn <hi>De Feria,</hi> with the Flaske wherein he carried his powder, and all other thinges such as he thought woulde be a hurt and hindrance vnto them, if it should so fall out that they shoulde erre out of the port whereas the Portugals doo vse, and fall vppon the coast, as afterwards it fell so out, they left nothing but a match which they forgot, which lacked very little to haue cost them full deere. But when they had sight of the lande, they did not well knowe it, for that they had neuer séene it before, &amp; were also ignorant of the ports, although they were very neere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bay of <hi>Canton,</hi> they tooke their course vnto the Northwest, wheras they should haue gone to the Southwest, which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they came vnto the

               <p>They were not so soone at an anker, but they saw come forth of the said port many barkes, both small and great, and in them many souldiers with hargabusses, lances, swordes and targets, and in their soreshippe some small péeces of ordinance. And when they came nigh vnto the barke wherein the Spaniards were, within musket shot, they stayed and discharged great stoare of hargabus shot. But they who carried no armor to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende others, neither to defende themselues, the answere that they gaue vnto the shot, was making of many signes of peace, calling them with their handes to come nearer vnto them, that they might sée and vnderstand that they came not thither with any pretence to do harme: Yet all was not sufficient to cause them to leaue off their shooting, neither to come any nearer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their barke. At this present there was amongst the souldiers one <hi>Chino</hi> that had béene at <hi>Luzon,</hi> and did knowe the Spani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:3380:182"/>So when they came before the captaine, they founde him more meeker and milder then they thought to haue done (sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a worke done by God in recompence of the great perill that those his seruants did put themselues in to doo his seruice and commandement). He asked of them, from whence they came, and wherefore, with many other questions in effect: but when that hee was certified of the truth, hee commanded them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe vnto their barke, without doing vnto them anie other harme, yet with a straite precept that they should not go forth without his expresse licence.</p>
               <p>So with this commandement they remained in their barke thrée dayes, guarded with many barkes and souldiers: and the last of them, the Captaine sent for two of the religious men, and when they came before him, he commanded them to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before a Iustice, a friend of his there hard by. These Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did talke with them with so great grauitie, and signes of cruelty, that euery time they came before them, they thought verely that forthwith they would command them to be carried to be executed: and without all doubt, either they had wil to do it, or else to put them in great feare of death, for that it was plainely seene in diuers things they commanded: but especially in one day there came vnto them a Iudge, with many armed men, and compassed their barke round about with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Brigandines,</hi> with plaine signes to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> assalt, or else to sinke them: but within a little while they were all in quiet, and the Iudge entred into a shippe that was thereby at anker, and being set in a rich chaire, guarded with many souldiers about him, hée commanded the rest that were in the <hi>Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> forthwith to go to visite and search their barke, and sent with them an interpreter, one of <hi>Chincheo,</hi> who did a little vnderstande the Portugall tongue.

With this feare aforesaid they were carried towards the tower: but when they came nigh to it, there followed after the souldiers that carried them a skiffe, with many oares, in great hast, &amp; called a loud vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the captaine general commanded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should bring back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine those prisoners to his shippe, the which forthwith they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished: &amp; after he had demanded of them certain questions, he commanded to carry them to the said tower, the which was done, as they could perceiue, for to put them in more feare.

from their Idols, and did spit at them, giuing the captain to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by signes, that he should not worshippe them, for that they had no more goodnesse in them, then was giuen by man, so that by good reason, to the contrary, those Idols should giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence vnto men because they made them, and to whome they ought to giue their true worship, is vnto the true God, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>By this act it is plainely to bee séene the gift of strength, the which the holy Ghost doth giue vnto his baptized Christians as in these religious men, that were at deathes doore, yet had they strength and spirit for to resist and reprehende them that could take away their liues. The captaine although he made a shew that he was offended with that which hee had séene them do, yet hee did them no harme, but presently brought them out of the temple, and commanded the souldiers to remaine there and guard them all that night: the which they passed lying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grounde, and yet thought themselues happie, and gaue thankes to God for that hee had deliuered them from the death that was so nigh vnto them.</p>

               <p>Yet notwithstanding at their comming to the citty <hi>Quixue,</hi> the souldiers had them in continuall guard and kéeping, till the next day following, then they were carried before the generall, where he was in a very great &amp; faire house, the which had two cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Right ouer against the inwarde court there was a gallerie, whereon was many soulidiers which did guarde and kee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the person of the generall, who was in a mightie great and gallant hall, set in an Iuorie chaire with great maiestie. Before they entred into the seconde court, there was dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged within, both artilerie and habagus shot, and played vpon a drum, which was as bigge as those which they vse in Spaine: that being doone, there was a great sounde of hoybuckes and trumpets, and of many other instruments: the which being doone, they straightwayes opened the gates of the innermost court, whereas the gallerie was aforesaide, from whence they might sée the throne whereas the generall was set. There was before him a table whereon was paper and other necessaries for to write (a thing commonly vsed in all that countrie:) the souldiers that were his guarde were, all in one liuerie of silke, &amp; were in so gallant consort, &amp; had so great sylence, which made the Spaniards greatly to maruell: The first order was of the hargabushes, and the seconde were pikes, and betwixt the one and the other, was placed a sworde and a target, there might be about foure hundred souldiers. Behinde them were placed the officers of iustice or executioners, with their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for to whippe and punish offenders: and in the midst of them were the scriueners and proctors.</p>
               <p>About thirtie paces more or lesse from the chaire where the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:3380:184"/>
generall was set, was placed certaine Gentlemen, and to the number, of a dosen pages bare headed, verie gallantlie apparelled in silke and golde. In the middest amongst these souldiers were the Spaniards carried, and before them such tokens and shewes, as they doo vse when as they doo present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudges such as bee condemned vnto death. A good way before they came nigh vnto the place whereas the general was, they caused them to knéele downe: at which instant there was brought foorth certaine <hi>Chinos</hi> that were prisoners to be iudged, and so soone as their inditement was read, and iudgement giuen, the executioners did execute the rigour of the sentence in the presence of the Spaniards, first pulling off their apparell, and then making fast their hands and féete verie fast with cordes, in such sort, that they shriked that the noise reached vnto heauens: they kept them so bounde vntill they sawe farther what the Iudge woulde commaunde. who when hee had heard his inditement, if hee woulde that hee should bée whipped, hée striketh a blow with his hand vppon the table that is before him: then the executioners doo strike fiue blowes vppon the calues of the legges of the offender with a broad cane, in the order as hath béene saide, and is so cruell that none can suffer fiftie of them but he dieth. The blowe being giuen vppon the table by the generall, straightwayes one of the proctors maketh a crie or noise, where at presently commeth the executioner for to execute his office. And if the offender dooth deserue more, then the Iudge dooth strike another blowe vppon the table: then is there giuen him other fiue blowes, and in this sort dooth the Iudge so manie times as his offence dooth deserue. At the lamentations and shrikes that these miserable offenders doo giue, the Iudges shewe no more signe of pittie then if they were stroken vppon a stone. So the audience being concluded and doone with the naturals of the countrie, the generall commaunded that the Spanyardes shoulde come a little nearer, and looked and searched their garments and all the rest, as also their <hi>Breuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios</hi> &amp; books: that being done, they were informed by those that brought them, how and in what order they were apprehended, and of all other thinges touching their comming into that kingdome: vnderstanding thereof, hee commaunded them to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:3380:185"/>
be carried vnto prison, where they were put in sure holde, and with great watch and guard for certaine dayes, in the which time they passed incredible trouble, as well of hunger as of thirst and heat, which was the occasion that the most part of them fell sicke of agues, and of the laske.</p>
               <p>So after these dayes that they were in prison, they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried once againe to the audience, and many other more were brought forth to be visited, all people beléeuing that the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards should no more returne, but bee executed, for the which they receiued great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, to be cleared by one death, of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as dayly they had before their eyes. In the conclusion of this audience the generall did decrée, that they should be carried by sea vnto the Cittie of <hi>Canton,</hi> whereas was the vizroy of that prouince, and he to commande them to be executed or punished according as hee thought best, according vnto the penalty put vppon whatsoeuer straunger that should enter into that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without licence (as they did enter). But when they saw that they were carried out of the prison vnto the sea, they ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie beléeued that it was to drowne them therin, for the which (hauing a newe confessed themselues, and commended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto God) they did animate one another, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the reward which was prepared for them: but when they came vnto the barre whereas they should imbarke themselues, vppon a suddaine the sea beganne to waxe verie loftie and troublesome, that it séemed almost a myracle, and it increased in such sort, that the souldiers and mariners said, that neuer before they had séene the like torment, the which endured the space of tenne dayes: the which was the occasion that they did not imbarke themselues, and that the generall did change his pretence, and determined that they shoulde be carried by lande vnto the great Cittie of <hi>Saucheo Fu,</hi> the which was presently put in vre: they were manie dayes on this iourney, with fiftie souldiers that did guarde them: in the which they sawe so manie curious thinges, and of so great riches, that they iudged it to bée the best countrie in all the world.</p>
               <p>So when they came vnto the citty, with so small trouble and werinesse, by reason of their long iourney and euill intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings by the souldiers, they were presently carried (as might
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:3380:185"/>
be sayde) from Herode to Pylate, and escaped not one day, but they were carried to the publike audience, or else before some particular Iudge. This citie was very fresh both within and without, and full of many orchards, whereas were an infinite number of fruite, with gardens, stanges of water, and other thinges of great recreation. This citie is thrée times so bigge as Siuell, and compassed about with a mightie strong wall, their houses are very great and well wrought, their stréetes are excéeding faire, brode and long and so straight that from the one end vnto the other they may sée a man. In equall distance the one from the other, there are built many triumphall arkes: (which is an ordinarie and common thing vsed in the cities of that kingdome) vpon their gates there are little towers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is planted all the artilerie that they haue for the defence of the citie (as hath béen said) all the which is inuironed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed about with a riuer which is great and faire, on the which is ordinarily sayling an infinite number of barkes and brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines, and is of so great depth, they may come &amp; lye harde vnto the wall, yea ships of great burden. On the one side of the citie there is a little Iland of great recreation, vnto the which they do passe by a very faire bridge, the one halfe made of stone and the other of timber, and is of so great a length, that on the part that is made of stone, the father fryer <hi>Ignacio</hi> did tell thirtie Innes or victualing houses wheras was to be bought, not only flesh and fish, but also great store of marchandice, of great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and valure, as amber, musk e, péeces of silke and cloth of golde.</p>

Of the which, although I haue had particular

relation of many of them, I leaue off heere the declaring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for that of an <hi>Itinerario</hi> or commentarie I will not make a historie. But principally for that many of them doo séeme to be incredible, and will be more vnto those that haue not had any notice of the mightinesse of this kingdome.</p>
               <p>In the discourse of this their iourney, the cities and townes they sawe, were many and verie bigge, and all compassed with strong walles: and at one of them there was a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie riuer, on the which was edified more than fiue hundreth engynes or whéeles, and they were made with so much art, that alonely with the violence of the streame of the riuer, that dooth force them, they water all the groundes there abouts for the space of two leagues and more, without any other helpe or humaine force.</p>
               <p>In this citie they were certaine daies in visiting, and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, after the which they were commaunded to goe vnto <hi>Canton,</hi> of the which in the two relations before, is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mention. So when they came vnto the Citie they were carried vnto the prison of the <hi>Thequixi,</hi> which is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as are put such as are condemned to die, the which they plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiued. There they remayned verie manie dayes, and the most part of them were carried vnto the tribunall seate of the Iudges, in companie with others that were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die.</p>
               <p>At this time there was in the citie, the <hi>Tutan,</hi> who was the viceroye of the prouince: and the <hi>Chacu,</hi> who is the generall visitor, and that was at such time as was doone great Iustice for to cleare the prisons, whereas were thousandes of men, and some that had béene there more than tenne yeares. There was some day at that time that in the presence of our people, were brought foorth to be iudged two thousand prisoners, some to the death, and others to be whipped, and other to be banished with other kinde of penalties, according vnto the disposition &amp; rigor of their lawes. That day wherein they make capitall audience, they vse particular ceremonies, as shooting of certaine péeces of artilerie, and to shut the gates of the citie, not permitting anie to enter in, neither go foorth, till such time as that act and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice be finished, and many other things as hath béene declared in the first part of this historie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:3380:186"/>The Spaniards being in the citie at this time of so great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, it so fell out that the same time there was a gentleman of Portingall called <hi>Arias Gonsalo de Miranda,</hi> chiefe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the citie of <hi>Machao</hi> (very deuout vnto religious men, and a friende vnto Spaniardes) who vnderstanding the great trouble and danger wherein they were, hee tooke order by all meanes possible to set them at libertie, and had so great care therein, that hee went through with his intent, in such sort that they were deliuered out of pryson, and from the great feare in which they were, and all by the intercession of this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who did vse so good persuasions for the loue he did bears vnto them, that he made voyde the euill opinion they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and with compulsion to reuoke the rigorous sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death pronounced against them.

               <p>And although in the bookes before, haue béen declared the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of that kingdome, and all thinges in particular, yet for the better certification, I thought it good (and not without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) to declare in the chapter following, some of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Here it doth intreat of the mightinesse, goodnesse, riches, and fortitude of the kingdome of China.</head>
               <p>THis kingdome is vnder the tropike of Capricorne, and stretched foorth on the sea coast, south west and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east, more than fiue hundreth leagues: it hath on the partes south west the kingdome of <hi>Cochinchina,</hi> and on the north east, it dooth confine on <hi>Tartaria,</hi> a kingdome which dooth compasse the most part of the lande, on the other part to the northwest, there is an other mightie kingdome of white people, which is beyonde the kingdome of Persia, it is called <hi>Catay</hi>: there be in it Christians, and the king thereof is called <hi>Manuell.</hi> It is sayd of a truth that from the furthest part of this kingdome vnto Ierusalem is sixe moneths trauaile by lande,<note place="margin">Sixe months trauaile from Ierusalem vnto <hi>China.</hi>
                  </note> the which they vnderstoode by certaine Indians which came from that kingdome by Persia, whose testimonials were made in Ierusalem sixe moneths before, wherein was declared how that they had trauelled by <hi>Arabia felix,</hi> and passed the red sea. The other fourth part of this kingdome is compassed with a verie asper and high mountaine, which is fiue hundreth leagues vpon a right line: but nature had left certaine places open towards the northwest, which might be fourscore leagues little more or lesse, towards the sea of <hi>Iapon</hi> which is towards the <hi>Septentrion.</hi> The great riches of this countrie, and the great number of people that be therein, did supplie the same (as in the first part of this historie is more at large declared). And for that the king of this countrie séeing himselfe oppressed and troubled by the mightie <hi>Tartaro</hi> &amp; seemed that easily he might defende himselfe from him, in shutting vp of those gates which nature had left open betwixt the mountaines, he did shut it vp with the death of many thousande of people, for that hee vsed therein great tyrannie, which afterwardes was the occasion of his owne death.</p>
               <p>This mountaine, with the supply by man is the famous wall of the kingdom of <hi>China,</hi> that is of fiue hundred leagues long, yet you must vnderstande it in the manner aforesaide, the better to giue credite thereunto, for alonely f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ure score leagues were
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:3380:187"/>
made by mans handes with great industrie, and there is vpon it an infinite number of bulwarkes, which maketh it the more fayrer and stronger: But yet not so strong as is the other four hundreth and twentie leagues which were made by nature.</p>
               <p>Nigh vnto the same there is a great desert full of ditches and lakes of water,<note place="margin">Great dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches &amp; lakes.</note> which is the occasion that this kingdome hath béene conserued for more than two thousand yeares, as doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their owne histories, which they holde to bee verie true.</p>
               <p>All is imparted into fiftéene prouinces with that of <hi>Aynao,</hi> and euerie one of them hath a principall Citie of the which it beareth the name. In the middest of this kingdome there is a great lake,<note place="margin">A mightie lake.</note> out of the which proceedeth many great and mightie riuers, which runne through all the kingdome, and are so big that there sayleth vp and downe in them barkes, sregats, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandines, and many other vessels of an other kinde of making. This great abundance of water is the occasion that it is so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and so well prouided of all thinges, and againe the most part of their cities and townes are situated on the riuers side, so that by them the one prouince doth communicate with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, carrying the one vnto the other, great store of marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and other thinges of great curiositie, and is done with little cost, for that all things are done very good cheape.</p>
               <p>This sea cost of this kingdome is the biggest and the best that is knowen in all the world, there is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it fiue prouinces which be these, of <hi>Canton, Chincheo, Liampon, Nanquin</hi> and that of <hi>Paquian,</hi> which is the furthest towardes the northwest, in the which is resident the king and his counsel with all his court ordinarily, and the most part of the men of warre that it hath, for that this prouince doth confine vpon the <hi>Tartaros</hi> their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Some will say, that the kings ordinarie dwelling there, is for that it is the best and most fertilest of all the kingdome. But I beleeue (according to the saying of some of the <hi>Chinos</hi>) that he doth it not but because it is so nigh vnto <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and to finde himselfe there, whereas hee may supply all necessities which might happen vpon a soddaine by his enimies. In these riuers there are certaine Ilandes, the which are very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto all the kingdome, for that there is nourished &amp; brought vp in them great store of deare, hogges and other beasts, which
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:3380:188"/>
is the occasion that the cities are so well prouided and serued.</p>
               <p>But one of the things which causeth most admiration to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that go to this kingdome, is to see so infinite a number of ships, and barkes that be in euerie port thereof, and are so many, that there hath béene a man in the citie of <hi>Machao</hi> that hath layde a wager,<note place="margin">More ships in one port than in all Spaine.</note> that alonely in the riuer of <hi>Canton,</hi> there be more ships and vessels than in all the cost of Spaine.</p>
               <p>One thing I may affirme, that I haue heard declared by persons of great credite, that haue béene in that kingdome (but in especiall of the father <hi>Ignacio</hi> whom I do follow in this <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerario</hi>) that it is an easie thing in any one of these fiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces that be vpon the sea cost, to ioyne together a thousande ships of warre and all of them (as they say in Spaine) dedicated for that purpose. The occasion why there be so many, is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die declared in his proper chapter. There are diuers opinions touching the greatnesse of this kingdome: but the most are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable with the father fryer, <hi>Martin de Herrada,</hi> who like a good Geomatrician and Mathematician went nighest the pricke. This opinion is declared in the first part of this historie, whereunto I referre me, and in that which toucheth in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, things of that kingdom, for that it is there declared at large as it was taken out of their bookes. But one thing I cannot let passe but declare, for that it séemeth woorthie to make thereof a particular memorie: and I vnderstood it, by the mouth of the said father <hi>Ignacio,</hi> which is that he doth affirme it to bee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine true &amp; approued,<note place="margin">They neuer had the plague.</note> that euery day in the yeare one with an other (besides wars and the plague, the which in this countrio they remember not to haue any, neither do they find written in their histories for 2000. yeares, neither by famin nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accidentall occasions to consume the people) yet doth there die many thousands of people both smal &amp; great, in al the fiftéen prouinces of this kingdome: which is no small griefe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who with a christian zeale doth consider this heauie tribute of so many soules that the diuell doth recouer eueri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>All this kingdome is so fertile, as well for the ordinarie wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring as also for the temperature of the heauen, that almost all the whole yeare they do gather fruits, but in especiall of wheat and rice: so that both the one and the other are very good cheape,

They say that in this countrie there be many elephants, lyons, tygres, ownses, &amp; other brute breastes, of the which these friers sawe verie few aliue, but many skins of them, which is a signe that it is of truth. There are many beasts whereof come the muske, the which are, of the tygres &amp; like vnto a litle dogge, the which they do kill &amp; put them vnder the ground certaine dayes, and after that it is putrified &amp; rotten, the flesh and bloud is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into that swéete powder. There be also many cyuet cats &amp; little worth, a great number of horse. &amp; although those which the said friers did sée were litle, yet is it a common voice &amp; fame that in some of the fiftéene prouinces there are very good: but they were not there, so that they can not say they had seene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the hens, géese, duckes, and other poultrie that are in all partes of this kingdome are without number, which is the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion that they are of small estimation: the abundance of fish ia no lesse, as well of the sea as of the riuers, in the which they are conformable. All they that do declare of the thinges of this countrie, and the small price that it is solde for, is such, that the saide Frier doth affirme, and others that haue bin in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that for the value of sixe marauadies (which is a pennie) may four companions eat very wel of flesh, fish, rice, and fruits, and drinke good wine of that countrie.</p>

of their antecessors, who said, that many yeares past there was in that kingdome a man that did preach vnto them a new law. whereby they might goe vnto heauen: who after that hee had preached certaine daies, &amp; saw little fruit thereof (for that they were all occupied in ciuill wars) he departed from thence vnto the Indians. But first he left certaine disciples behind him that were baptised and well instructed in matters of faith that they might preach vnto them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as occasion did serue for the same. In many places they do worship the diuell, only for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should do them no harme, and so the said fryer did tell me, for that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This picture was put before him at the point that hee should yeelde vp the ghost, strengthening him, that he should put great trust thereon.</p>
               <p>And as the fryer did demand of them what reason they had to do the same: some of them answered, and saide, because the diuell should do no harme vnto the dead man in the other world they put his picture before him, that he might knowe him, and take him for his friend.</p>
               <p>That which is vnderstood of these <hi>Chinos</hi> is, that although they haue amongst them many errors of the Gentiles, yet with great ease they would be reduced vnto our faith, if they might haue libertie for to preach, and they to receiue it.</p>
               <p>When as the sunne and the moone is in eclypse, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue verily, that the prince of the heauen will destroye them, and for verye feare they put them selues in that colour: the people generally doo worshippe vnto them, and beléeue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that the sunne is a man and the moone a woman. And therefore, when as they beginne to bee eclypsed, they make great sacrifices and inuocations vnto the prince afore said, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therfore they do vse to make in the fields sepulchres wherin they command the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be buried after they be dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:3380:191"/>When they should be buried, they command to kill all their seruants, or their wiues, those that best he loued in his life, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do it, that they should go with them to serue them in the other world, wheras they beléeue they shall liue eternally &amp; die no more.

The said frier did tell me, that one day passing by an hermitage, whereas dwelled an hermite, who had vpon the altar in the same, an Idoll for his saint: before whom was there a <hi>Chino</hi> a principall man, worshipping the same, the said father without any feare went vnto him, &amp; began to reprehende him, and to spit at the Idoll, &amp; caused him therewith to leaue off his worshipping, whereof he was greatly amased both he &amp; all the rest of his companie, to sée with what boldnes it was done, and no harme done vnto him for the same, eyther they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

of them daily, who giuetokens and outwarde showes to bee good christians, and say that the greatest difficultie for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert all the whole kingdome, will be in them that doo gouerne in the same, for they had néede of a particular ayde and helpe of the mercie of God, to bring them vnto the faith: for that they are had in reuerence and obeyed as Gods vpon the earth.

The one is, that vnto none they do giue the office to gouerne, by no manner of wayes nor meanes, although they be suborned by friendship: but onely by his owne merites, and sufficient abilitie. The seconde, that none can be viceroy, gouernour, nor Iudge of a prouince or citie in the which hee is naturall borne, the which they say is done to take away the occasion of dooing any iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, beeing carried away or led by parentes or friendshippe.

The king <hi>Nobunanga</hi> who died in the yeare 1583. was the most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and greatest Lord amongst them all, as well of people, as of riches: who was slaine by a captaine of his, and punished by God by this meanes for his luciferine pride, for that it did farre excéede that of <hi>Nabuchadonozor,</hi> and was come vnto that point that he would haue béene worshipped for a God: for the which he commanded to make a sumptuous temple, and to put in it thinges that did well declare and showe his follie: of the which that you may sée how farre it did extend, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare here onely that which he did promise vnto them that did visite his temple.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A luciferine pride.</note>First the rich men that came vnto the saide temple, and did worshippe his picture, should be more richer: and those that were poore should obtaine great riches: and both the one and the other, that had no successors to inherite their goods, should also obtaine them, and also long life for to enioy the same, with great peace and quietnesse.</p>
               <p>The second, that their life should be prolonged to 80. yeares.</p>
               <p>The third, that they should bee hole of all their infirmities and diseases, and shall obtaine full accomplishment of all their desires with health and tranquillitie. And the last he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that euery month they should celebrate a feast for his birth day, and therein to visite his temple, with certification that all those that did beléeue in him, and in that which hee promised, should without all doubt sée it accomplished, and those which in this life were faultie and did not doo in effect his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, in the other they should goe the way to perdition.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:3380:193"/>
And the better to accomplish this his will, he commaunded to be put in this temple, al the Idols in his kingdomes that were most worshipped, such as to whom frequented most pilgrimes: the which being done, he presently forbad rhat not one of them all should be worshipped, but he onely that was the true <hi>Foto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi> and vniuersall God, the author and creator of nature.</p>
               <p>This foolishnesse did this proud king a little before his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable death, and many other more, that I do leaue out for feare that I should be too tedious in this <hi>Itinerario.</hi> There did succéed this proude king in the kingdome his sonne called <hi>Vozequixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> who for that he is very yong, at this day it is gouerned by a worthy captaine called <hi>Faxiuandono.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All men that are borne in this land are naturally inclined to warres and robberies, and it is vsed ordinarily amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, alwayes he that hath most power and strength, doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the best part, and yet he doth inioy it with little secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, for that as the prouerbe saith (he findeth a last for his shoo, or the length of his foote is found) and another commeth (when he thinketh least off) and carrieth away their spoile with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, reuenging iniuries the one for the other, without being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested thereunto: which is the occasion that they are neuer without ciuill warres, &amp; that séemeth to bée the influence of the clime of that land. This and the continual exercise in armes, and in robberies hath giuen them the name of warriers, and do terrifie all their borderers and neighbors.</p>
               <p>They vse many weapons, but especially hargabusses, swords and lances, and are very expert in them. On the firme land of <hi>China</hi> they haue done many suddaine robberies and thefts, and haue gone thorough therewith at their pleasure: and would haue done the like at the Ilands of <hi>Luzon,</hi> &amp; vsed for the same all meanes possible, but yet it fell out contrary vnto their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and returned their backes full euill against their wils, with their hands vpon their owne heads.</p>
               <p>On a time they came vnto the <hi>Illocos,</hi> who with the fauour of the Spaniards (whose vassals they are) did desende them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues worthily: that the <hi>Iapones</hi> thought it best to returne vnto their houses and to leaue their begun pretence, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination neuer to put themselues in the like perill, for that they had lost many of their companie. Not many yeares since
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:3380:194"/>
there happened vnto them the like disgrace in <hi>China,</hi> there went tenne thousande of them to robbe and steale, and at their going on lande, they did sacke a cittie with little hurt, and smal resistance, who with the content of that pray, forgot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and did not preuent the harme that might chance vnto them: the <hi>Chinos</hi> being offended did compasse them about in such sort, that when the <hi>Iapones</hi> remembred, themselues, they were in that case that they were constrained to yéelde vnto their enimies, who at their willes did repay themselues very well of the iniurie receiued, and a very good warning vnto all those that shall heare thereof, to slie from putting themselues into the like trance: so the <hi>Chinos</hi> were very wel reuenged of the iniury by them receiued.</p>
               <p>The faith of Christ is very well planted in some of these I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, by the good diligence and trauell of the fathers and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, but in particular, by that which was doone by master <hi>Francisco Xabier,</hi> one of the tenne companions of the father <hi>Ignacio de Loyola</hi> founder of the saide religion: hee trauelled with great zeale, in the conuerting of the saide Ilands, and that which was a great helpe vnto the same, was his holy doctrine and apostolike life, as vnto this day the <hi>Iapones</hi> doo confesse, attributing vnto him (next vnto God) the goodnesse that hath come vnto them by receiuing the baptisme, whome the fathers of that companie haue followed in all pointes, such as remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after his death, as also such as haue gone thither since that time.</p>
               <p>So that vnto them may bee attributed the thankes for the mollifying of such adamantine hearts, as are those of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natural people of these Ilandes, whose wittes (although they be good and subtill) are naturally knowne to be inclined vnto warres, robberies and doing of euill: and at this day, being Christians, they do followe their euill inclinations, yet notwithstanding, by the good doctrine and ensample of the saide fathers, they are much better Christians then those of the Orientall or East <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not set downe here the number of those that are baptised in these Ilands, for that there are therein diuers opinions, as also for that the fathers of the name of Iesus or Iesuits doo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly declare in their letters.

of the number of people that are to bée conuerted, the number that are baptised are very fewe, and that there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are not, for lacke of ministers and preachers: the which may easily be remedied, in commaunding to go thither, more religious men of other orders, for to aide and helpe the saide Iesuites, the which shoulde be vnto them a particular content and comfort as I doo beléeue, as hath béene seene by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all partes of the <hi>Indians,</hi> whereas haue come religious men vnto places of their doctrine, for that the quantitie of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is so great that are in these Ilandes, that although there shoulde go thither many laborers of the Gospell, and all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of religious men, the one shoulde not be a let or hinderance vnto the other, and they shoulde all of them finde enough to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie themselues, especially if that the successor of <hi>Nobunan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> were conuerted with his subiectes.

               <p>They haue amongst them many priests of their Idols, whom they do call <hi>Bonsos,</hi> of the which there be great couents.

thrée or foure letters, requesting him to send him the saide reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, with certification that hauing them there, both hee and all the rest of his kingdome woulde receiue the faith of Christ and the holy baptisme: vnto the which letters they did alwaies make answere with promises that he would send them vnto him: but after because they did not accomplish the same, the king did complaine of him vnto certaine Portugall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants with great griefe saying: this your bishop of <hi>Machao</hi> doth greatly lye: for that I haue requested him by foure letters to send me religious men for to preach the law of the gospell, &amp; he consenting vnto my wil, did neuer accomplish nor performe his word. Unto this day they haue not accomplished this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, for the great lacke they haue of such ministers as they doo demande, &amp; are requisite in those parts, and cannot supply their want and necessitie, except they should leaue them vnprouided that bee already baptised.

And this was the answere that was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Machao</hi> vnto certaine messengers or ambassadors that were sent by the aforesaid king, for the same demand, the which was required with great instance.

the end thereof, hee changed his minde, and determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto his owne countrie, and there to liue according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which he had learned of the Christians, the which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued to doo with ease, without any gainesaying or contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas when hée came thither, hee did obserue all such things as a Christian was bounde to doo: but amongst other signes and tokens of the same, he made a crosse and set it by the doore of his house, wherunto he did reuerence at all times when he passed by the same with great deuotion. His neighbours when as they saw that signe, a thing of them neuer séene before, and howe that that Christian did make particular reuerence, they beganne to mocke and scorne him, and the crosse, and pulled it downe from the place whereas it was set, &amp; did other things in dispite thereof, and of him that had set it there in that place, whose hatred and discourtesie was so much, that they determined in their minds to burne it, and to put the same in execution, who at the same instance did all miraculously die, I say those that would haue burnt the same, the which was séene of many other, who haue giuen sufficient testimony therof. And within fewe dayes after, all the whole linage of those dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did follow the same way, and not one escaped. This mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle being spread throughout all the kingdome, the naturals thereof did set vp many crosses in all parts.</p>
               <p>This they say was the principall motion that God put into their hearts for to moue them to demande for such as shoulde baptise them, and preach the holy gospell. Likewise a great helpe vnto the same was the declaration of the painted cloth, which the aforesaid religious man did send to the king. Since that time there hath gone vnto the Cittie of <hi>Machao</hi> certaine naturals of that kingdome, who being affectioned vnto our faith were baptised there: with the which, and with the hope aforesaid, they are all sustained, till such time as it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleasure of God to send them the remedie for their soules, the which hée hath caused them to desire, which cannot be long, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which hath béene séene, and the miracles that God doth worke, the more for to kindle their desire, as the myracle of the crosse before spoken off, and others the which certaine <hi>Cochin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinos</hi> did declare in the Cittie of <hi>Machao,</hi> in <hi>anno,</hi> 1583. and happened the same yeare, and was very fresh in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

The one of them was, that one of the Christians aforesaid went to visite a principall man that had the palsie, and kept his bed many yeares before:<note place="margin">Another my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racle.</note> and conferring with his long sickenesse, he told of certaine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, such as he had vnderstanding that was done by Christ our redéemer, when that he was man amongst men whome hée redéemed: but in particular those which he did in the healing of the like infirmities, such as he lay sicke of: alonely with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine vertue, in touching of them with any part of his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or shadow. The Iudge hearing this, hee had a particular faith &amp; deuotion to him that had doone these myracles that the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian had told him, &amp; asked what his name was, &amp; what signes &amp; tokens he had: he told him that his name was Iesus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth redéemer of the worlde, the sauiour and glorifier of men. And the better to declare vnto him his signes, he shewed to him an Image or picture that he had of his, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was giuen him such time as he was baptised, printed in paper: &amp; of Iesu Christ when he ascended vp into heauen, the which for lacke of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and other of greater volume, hee should haue continually with him &amp; make his praiers thereunto. This sicke man tooke it, and fixed his eies thereon with so great deuotion and faith, in requesting him to giue him his health, &amp; that he would present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue in him, &amp; bée baptised. At the same instant in the sight of them all, he felt himselfe whole of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infirmitie that he had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered so many yeares before, and neuer could find any humaine remedy for the same, although he had prooued an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. He straightwayes willed the Christian to baptise him, vnto whome hée gaue a great summe of monie, the which hee receiued against his will, and spent it in workes of mercie, and with part thereof he bought a bigge barke in the which at this day he dooth passe people thorough a riuer, whereas they were wont to passe great perill and danger, and hee doth it for Gods sake, and receiueth nothing for the same.</p>
               <p>A fewe dayes after in another part of this kingdome, there happened another myracle of no lesser substance then the first, that is, there was a <hi>Cochinchina</hi> in the said citie of <hi>Machao,</hi> who did aske to bee baptised of a barefoote Frier, which after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee had catechised sufficiently, hée gaue it vnto him: and after a great time that hee had béene in his company, and had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:3380:198"/>
of his Christianitie &amp; deuotion, he gaue him licence for to returne vnto his country, with a good token, that at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither he would procure to augment the desire of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, the which God had begunne to kindle in their brest.</p>
               <p>This good new christian did procure the same with so great care, that he did profite very much (being holpen with the fauor of God, who made him his instrument) hee healed certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, in shewing vnto the patients an Image of our ladie, the which he had continually about his necke, and had therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great deuotion, and woulde declare to them with great zeale the Lords prayer, or <hi>Pater noster.</hi> His fame was so much spred abrode in all parts of this prouince, wherein he dwelled, that it came vnto the eares of a <hi>Mandarin,</hi> or principall Iudge of the same, who was many dayes in his bedde a leaper, both of handes and féete, and neuer coulde finde any phisition nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine, that could giue him his health, nor any other humaine remedie: who being verie desirous to be healed, hée sent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or the saide Christian, and asked if hée would take vppon him to heale him of that infirmitie, as it was affirmed that hee had done by others of greater importance. The Christian saide hée would, then the Iudge did promise vnto him for the same, great giftes and rewardes, but hee made no account thereof, but oneli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> requested of him for reward, that after hee should bee hole, that he would be baptised and become a Christian: the which he did accept, and principally he shewed vnto him the Image that hée had of our lady, saying: If thou wilt beléeue in this lady, that is heere ingraued, and in her most holy sonne Iesus Christ the redéemer of the whole world, thou shalt presently be made hole. This <hi>Mandarin</hi> or Iudge did beholde the same with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and thought on the words which he had heard spoken. And in determining with himselfe to beléeue the same, at the very point that he did put it in execution, he was healed of al his infirmitie, a thing which caused great admiration in all that prouince.</p>
               <p>These myracles and that of the crosse, in a short time being knowne abrode, haue caused such a desire vnto the inhabitants of that kingdome to become Christians, that by all manner of meanes possible they do procure the same: the which is not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for lacke of ministers, as aforesaid, and is no smal griefe
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:3380:198"/>
vnto them that Christianly doo put themselues to consider how the diuel our aduersary doth carry vnto his infernal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, those soules which séeme to bee well disposed for to inioy the benefite of God, and his eternal goodnesse: all the which is for lacke of ministers, and not for any other default. God reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the same for his mercies sake.</p>
               <p>The said father <hi>Ignacio</hi> (whom as I haue said, I do follow in many things of this <hi>Itinerario</hi>) did tell me, that as he passed by this kingdome for to go vnto Spaine, he saw the deuotion of the people thereof, and the great desire they had to bee Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and how that the people were ready and bent for to receiue the holy Gospell, very humble and of good vnderstanding. Hee would haue tarried for to baptise them, and would haue done it, onely for charity and compassion, séeing with what deuotion they did demand the same, and the great number of soules that were condemned: but hee was constrained by force to go vnto <hi>Malaca,</hi> and againe it séemed vnto him, that amongst so many people, his smal force might do little good: and that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to go vnto Spaine, and to procure more compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to helpe him, as he did, and returned with them, and with many other rewards, of Pope Gregory the thirtéenth receiued: and he also receiued great fauours of the king of Spaine, and with great hope, that his maiestie will giue his particular aide, for to go thorow with this enterprise, which will not be of small effect. I do beléeue of a truth, that in small time all that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome shall bee subiect vnto the Catholike saith of Rome, and to be the gate, whereby to enter the lawe of the Gospel into the mightie kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> for that this of <hi>Cochinchina</hi> is vpon the same firme land, and their language and customes are almost in one manner.</p>
               <p>They are verie white people of this kingdome, and are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled like vnto those of <hi>China</hi>: their women are verie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and shamefast,<note place="margin">Their wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are honest &amp; shamefast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In all the countrie almost, all of them are apparelled in silke, for that they haue there verie much, and excellent good: the countrie is verie holesome, and full of old folkes and children, which is a sufficient proofe for the goodnesse thereof.</p>

               <p>In this kingdome there is a religious man of the order of S.

This petition did not take effect according to his desire, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was not to serue his turne, nor any that was vnoccupied.

They haue amongst them many religious men after their fashion, who doo liue in common, and leade an asper and sharp life: for the which they are had of al the rest in great veneration. The penance which they do is wonderfull &amp; strange, as you may iudge by some things that I will declare here: amongst a great number that be tolde of them, there are none of them that can marrie, neither speake to any woman, &amp; if by chance he do, they arewithout remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> punished by death. They go alwayes barefoote, &amp; very poorely apparelled, &amp; do eate nothing but rice &amp; gréene herbes, and this they do aske for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie euery day, going from doore to doore with their wallet at their backes, alwayes with their eyes looking on the ground, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such modesty &amp; honesty, that it is to be wondred at: they doo not craue their charity, neither take it with their hands, nor do any other thing but cal or knocke, &amp; stand still, till such time as they giue them their answer, or put some thing into their wallets. It is told them for a truth, that many times for penance they
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:3380:200"/>
do put themselues starke naked in the heate of the sunne, which is there very great, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> country is in twenty sixe degrees of the Equinoctiall, whereas they are much troubled there with gnats, whereof there is an infinite number, and is a thing that if they did passe it for Gods sake: it is a kinde of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of great desert. God for his mercy lighten them with his grace, that this which they do smally vnto the profite of their soules, may bee the occasion that after they are baptised, they may deserue for the same many degrées of glory.</p>
               <p>Likewise in secreat they doo great penance, and doo rise vp at midnight to praie vnto their Idols, and they do it in quiers, as is vsed amongst vs Christians. It is not permitted them any rentes, nor any other kinde of contractation: and if they bée séene to deale in any, they are detested and hated, as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike is amongst vs.</p>
               <p>For this kind of asper liuing (the which they do, according vnto the report) for the loue of the heauen, and that with great zeale: they are respected of the common people for saints, and for such they do reuerence them, and do commit them vnto their praiers, when they are in any trouble or infirmity.

There is in this citie two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentes of religious men, the one of the companie of Iesus, and the other of the order of S. Francis.</p>
               <p>From this citie of <hi>Calamina</hi> to that of <hi>Visnaga</hi> there wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the king is, it is fiue and thirtie leagues by land. This king is mightie, and his kingdome very great and full of people, and hath great rentes. They say that onely the rent he hath of fine gold, is worth vnto him thrée millions, of the which he spendeth but one onely, and doth keepe euerie yeare two millions in his treasorie, the which according vnto the report &amp; fame, is at this day with many millions. He hath twelue principall or chiefe captaines, and euerie one of them hath the gouernement of an infinite number of people &amp; hath great rent for the same, for he that hath least rent hath sixe hundred thousand ducats yearely. Euerie one of them are bound to giue the king to eate, and all the people of his house, one month in the yeare: so that by this account the twelue captaines which are the lordes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome (and as wee might say) dukes, doo beare his cost all the whole yeare. The million the which he doth spend, is in giftes and in extraordinarie thinges. The king hath in his house, what with wiues, seruants and slaues, nigh about fourtéene thousand persons, and in his stable ordinarily a thousand horse, and for his seruice and garde eight hundreth Elephants, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth spend euerie day eight hundreth ducats.

He hath also in his house thrée hundreth wiues besides a great number of concubines: they goe all gallantly apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and with rich iewels, of the which there are of great esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome, they do almost euerie three daies change newe colors of apparell. They do ordinarily vse colors of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones, such as are called in spaine <hi>ojo de gato</hi> cats eies. They haue great store of saphires, pearles, diamonds, rubies, &amp; many other stones, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in that kingdome in great abundance.</p>

               <p>When the king of this kingdome doth die, they do carrie him foorth into a mightie fielde, with great sadnesse and mourning apparell, and there in the presence of those twelue péeres a fore saide, they do burne his bodie with wood of <hi>Sandalo,</hi> which is of a great smell, with the which they do make a great fire.</p>
               <p>After that the bodie of the king is burned and consumed, they throwe into the same the wiues that hee best loued, with seruants and slaues, those that he most estéemed in his life time: the which they do with so great content, that euery one dooth procure to be the first for to enter into the fire, and they that are last, do thinke themselues vnhappie. All these do say that they go to serue the king in the other life, whereas they shalbe with great ioy. This is the occasion that they goe with so good a will to die, and carrie with them the most richest and festiuall appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell they haue. Of this is gathered that they do beléeue the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of the soule, for that they doo confesse there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, and that thither they do returne and liue for euer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ende. They are people that would be conuerted with the like facilitie vnto the holy gospell as their neighbours, if there went any thether to preach.</p>

               <p>This Ilande is fertile, peaceable, &amp; healthfull, and all full of woods, and there are mountaines very thicke of orenge trees, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>Limas, Plantanos,</hi> &amp; <hi>Palmas,</hi> and many synamon trées, which be the best in all the world, &amp; of most strength &amp; effect, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they go to buy, for to bring it vnto Europe, &amp; they giue it for a small price.

The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall people doo say, that with a good will they would againe returne and receiue the law of the gospell, if they had it there preached. From this Iland after they had passed a little gulfe, they came vpon the coast of a kingdome called <hi>Tutucuriu,</hi> and ran all alongest the cost of the same, running from the cape of <hi>Comerin</hi> to <hi>Cuylan.</hi> Here there is a <hi>Pagode</hi> or temple of their gods very great and rich, thether come all the Gentiles of that kingdom, at certain feasts in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare with great deuotion: there is in is it a triumphant chariot, so great that 20. horse cannot mooue it, they bring it foorth in publike vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their festiual daies, &amp; is carried by elephants, &amp; by an infinite number of men, who voluntarily do hale and pull at certaine roapes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are made fast therunto.

Many other maners and fashions of idolatrie is declared of this kingdome, and more beastly than this we haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, the which I let passe, because I would not be tedious in this <hi>Itinerario.</hi> All the people of this kingdom, be very bad and ill inclined, for which cause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers of the company of Iesus, that are in certaine townes nigh vnto the same, cannot as yet bring them out of their errors, although they haue put therein great care and diligence.</p>
               <p>Upon the same cost, &amp; a litle distant from this kingdom there is a towne of Portingals called <hi>Coulan,</hi> and 25. leagues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a citie which is called <hi>Cochin,</hi> in the which there are reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men of S. Francis, of S. Dominicke, of S. Austin, &amp; of the companie of Iesus, who haue there a very good studie, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie, whereas they do bring foorth much fruite. Nigh vnto this citie is <hi>Santo Tome,</hi> whereas are many baptised and good christians, very abstinent and chast, vnto whom the patriarkes of Babylon doo prouide them of bishops: the authoritie where with they do it, is not knowen, nor whence they haue it, for that as I do vnderstand, the seat apostolicke did neuer giue it them. About the same matter, at this present there is in Rome a bishop of this kingdome, and one of the kingdome of <hi>Pimien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> with whom I haue talked diuers times, and is come the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue his obedience vnto the Pope and to knowe of him the order that his pleasure is should be obserued, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of those bishops which come thether by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the patriarke. In this kingdome there are many kings, but the principallest of them is he of <hi>Cochin,</hi> and next vnto him, he of <hi>Coulan,</hi> &amp; nigh vnto them are many petie kings, as is hee of <hi>Mangate</hi> &amp; <hi>Cranganor,</hi> and are all Gentils, although amongst them there are mixed many Moores.

                  <hi>Palestina</hi> &amp; those parts. There is in this countrie vniuersally, a lawe verie strange and little heard of, which is, that the sonnes doo not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite after their fathers, but his brothers sonne, and the reason they giue for the same, is, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue no certaintie of their children, for that they haue no wiues proper nor appointed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, I promise you it séemeth to me, their reason to be as
