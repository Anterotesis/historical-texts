            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable
Sir JOHN SHORTER, Knight,
Lord Mayor
OF THE
CITY of LONDON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen your Lordship desired me to Preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, the improvement of it to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
usefulness was my concern. To this
end it was needful to fix on Subjects suitable
to an Auditery so promiscuous; none occurred to me so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive
to my purpose as this, which led me to deal with all
men in things most important to their Eternal Condition;
and yet to mind your Lordship and Brethren of somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
to your present Office.</p>
            <p>The second Subject I Preached on, was pursuant to this, viz.
<hi>The Dedication of our Lives to Christ and his Interests,</hi>
from Phil. 1. 21.</p>
            <p>After I had Preached the Second time, I was surprised
with a Request of your Lordships and some of the Aldermen
to Publish both these Discourses; but there wanted not many
Reasons, which prevented any design of Compliance with that
desire, tho enforced by your undeserved respects to one so much
a Stranger.</p>
            <p>But finding some few days past, that after all my care to
obviate any such snrmises; some passages in that Second Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
are misrepresented, as irritating of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62563:3"/>
I am inclined to Publish very soon that Second Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
if I may prevent or remove any such offences, which
are now at least more fatal than any Imprudent Propagators
thereof do apprehend.</p>
            <p>Being thus disposed to publish the last, I am obedient to
your Lordships repeated intreaties in sending out the First
Sermon in its order.</p>
            <p>Tho two days being all the time I had to prepare either of
these Discourses, and absence from my Library limiting me
to the use of no Book besides the Bible, are my just Apology
for some defects in them; yet I must say, that I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
nothing but what I believe to be the Will of God; and
had my helps or abilities been more considerable, I would
not debase matters of so great concernment, by vain Sallies
of Wit; nor deaden their common use by laborious Periods, or
a lighter Stile. The Institutions of God have their proper
decency, and are best managed by a tendency to Spiritual
Ends, and general Edification.</p>
            <p>The substance of the Account of the nature of the Kingdom
of God, I give in Scripture-words, tho chiefly for greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;
yet also that none may arraign it as <hi>Cant,</hi> without
ridiculing the Divine Oracles, which surely must command
dread in all who esteem themselves by a Christian Name.</p>
            <p>I believe, Your Lordship in calling us <hi>Nonconformists</hi> to
preach before you, and we in undertaking that Labour, can
have no Turn to serve, besides the enlargement of Christ's
Kingdom; and the revival of the Power of Godliness, so
much degenerated into Formality among all Parties. We
value Capacious Places no otherwise, than as an opportunity
for this: and now we enjoy such, we desire no attempts for
more Splendid ones, to the offence of any.</p>
            <p>Perhaps Your Lordship may share in our wonder at the
silly Descants of some on our Persons and Performances in
this Liberty: We must needs be Tradesmen, because we
have preached so long without Publick Sallary. Our Sermons
<pb facs="tcp:62563:3"/>
are <hi>Cant,</hi> because we use Scripture-Expressions, though in
their proper sense: They are <hi>Enthusiastick,</hi> if we say any
thing of Heart-work, or the Spirit's influence; We do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>whine,</hi> and <hi>make faces,</hi> if we appear in the least
moved by what we say and believe, or seem concerned to
prevail with our Hearers. We do ill to preach now, we
do not suffer by it: though they know we thought it our
Duty, when we paid so dear for it. Or at best, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent
Events should supersede our Labours, as a pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Act: when we are under a solemn dedication to the
Work of Christ, as Ministers; and our Labours to bring the
Souls of men under the power of Truth, will prove the best
security to the Professors of it; when great Offers, and
awakening Fears will trample on the clearest Notions of an
Vnregenerate Heart. But I enlarge too far.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship's acting the part of a Christian Magistrate,
is recompence for whatever Censures you undergo: the
World is not yet of the temper, to speak well of all that
do well: and Christ exempts not the Vsefullest from hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
on this lower stage. Peace of Conscience in having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
our Duty, and the Testimony of Christ to our Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
in the Great Judgment, is all the Comfort a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
can now be sure of, and what he ought to be contented
with.</p>
            <p>There are many Prayers sent to the Throne of Grace for
Your Lordship; That you may want neither Wisdom nor
Steddiness in a Place so Eminent, and Circumstances so
perplexing. That Promise (which hath somewhat of a Rule
in it) is applicable to you,<note place="margin">Prov. 11. 3.</note> 
               <hi>The Integrity of the Upright
shall guide them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That you may find this accomplished to Publick Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and a Comfortable Event of your Present Employ, is
the unfeigned Desire of</p>
            <closer>

most humble Servant,

            <head>A
SERMON
Preached before the
RIGHT HONOURABLE
THE
Lord Mayor, &amp;c.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 COR. IV. 20.</bibl>
               <q>For the Kingdom of God is not in Word, but in
Power.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apostle in the latter part of this Chapter,
doth more than hint at some Attempts against
the credit of his Person and Ministry; the
Men he points at as guilty of this design, did
not only wear a Christian Name, but pretended to a
more than common Zeal and Light, while they imputed
to the Apostle some contemptible plainness and remisness.</p>
            <p>He not only vindicates himself, but threatneth an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into these plausible pretences of theirs; resolving
on that Enquiry, to determine, whether that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Profession was expressive of the power of Godliness,
or only a dead Image; and whether the improved Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
they boasted of, were the great essential T<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uths
of the Gospel, and those delivered in a manner conducive
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62563:5"/>
to the advancement of Gods Kingdom. This is the sense
of <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>My Text is a Reason of that designed Enquiry; and
the force of it, as a Reason, lay in these Implications.</p>
            <p>All this noise may be without any Substance; the
Power of Religion lies in somewhat above these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;
the Kingdom of God, which is the only valuable
Concern, consists not in Externals, but in the Power of
Religion: and it's most suspicious, that these censorious
Pretenders (who obstruct my Ministry) are little sharers
in, or Friends to the Kingdom of God, after all this <hi>fair
shew in the Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On these accounts, the Apostle's search in order to a
Judgment of these mens Profession and Doctrines, was
justifiable and necessary. And his Practice, with the
Reason of it, calls all Christians, tho not to busy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
Surmises; yet to a prudent Examination of
Men, that deal with them in the concernments of their
Souls. And more especially, if they challenge the
Graces and Truths we have received, and pretend to
outdo and blast the Labours of such we have profited by,
as if none but they could be Instruments of conferring
Grace, or investing us in the priviledges of the Church.</p>
            <p>This Examination is frequently enjoined, 1 <hi>John 4. 1.
1 Thes.</hi> 5. 21. God hath given us a Rule to judg of Men
and Doctrines by; and some degree of Abilities to
judg of them by that Rule.</p>
            <p>It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> as an inspired Person, had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Spirit of discerning, which ordinary Christians
cannot pretend to. Nevertheless, God hath appointed
private Christians to try all Doctrines by the Scriptures,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. and directed our Judgment of men by their
<hi>Fruits, Matt.</hi> 7. 16, 20. As men, we are not utterly
incapable to compare and judg of these; as Believers,
there is an additional fitness for it by the Life, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62563:5"/>
anointing they have received. This spiritual Life is not
so void of Sensation,<note place="margin">Job 12. 11.</note> but that <hi>the Ears can try Words;</hi> and
God's promise is a security, that the Anointing shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their finally erring in fundamental Truths, 1 <hi>John</hi>
2. 27.</p>
            <p>These things must excuse any Christian from blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giving up his Faith, or Hope, to such who can most
daringly pretend to Dominion over them. He ought
to plead a Judgment of Discretion as his right, in what
concerns his own Faith and Practice. And tho some
(whose designs be thereby justly suspected) decry this
private Judgment; let not us be discouraged from the
use of it. For it is a more publick Judgment, if true,
than the mistaken Sense of a whole Council. It's what
distinguisheth us from Bruits, in our deliberate Acts.
Yea, they that condemn it, are forced to use this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Judgement in the choice of their Church and
Guides.</p>
            <p>But I shall wave any further regard to the Connexion
of the Text, with the rest of the Chapter, and improve
it as a Rule, to judg our own State by, under this plain
Position,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The Kingdom of God is not in Word, but in
Power.</p>
            <p>With what concern ought we to attend to a Truth,
which is designed to discriminate the very Professors of
Christianity? And which implies, that many such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
are deceived in their chief concernments in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
as being content without that Power, wherein
the Kingdom of God consisteth? Yet what is more usual
with fallen Man, than to debase Religion to what his
own Lusts and Fancy will prescribe? He is scarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeable,
that God will exact more from him, than a
carnal, idle spirit is disposed to allow. We are content,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62563:6"/>
that some external Homage be paid to the Almighty;
and that some sleight attempts and attainments be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
but we confine our religious endeavours within
those limits; not regarding that real godliness consists
chiefly in such dispositions and acts, as express the supreme
interest of God in the Soul; and the effectual energy of
his Grace and Power in a renewed mind.</p>
            <p>The Text tends to awaken deep convictions in you,
That God hath not admitted vain man into the Consult
about the Nature or Standard of his Kingdom; nor will
he model the Statutes of it according to a Sinner's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Hopes; but whether they will be his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or continue their Rebellion, his Kingdom truly is,
and will shortly appear to be, <hi>not in Word but in
Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall give you, 1. Some account of what is intended
by the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>2. I shall under the same Heads explain, how it is <hi>not
in Word but in Power:</hi> and evidence the truth of the
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>I begin with some account of the Kingdom of God.
This hath various acceptations in Scripture, and denotes
several things, more than is designed by this Kingdom in
my Text: as</p>
            <p>1. Gods Providential Government over all things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is that Kingdom which ruleth over all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 103. 19.</note> He hath
not so left the Creatures to their own Conduct, but that
he secureth his blessed ends by his management of them.
This is that Dominion, to be subject to which, no mans
consent is asked: to which all are obedient against their
repugnant inclinations, and deepest contrivance. Sinners
in their utmost neglects of the revealed will of God, yea
in their most notorious violations of them, are subject to

wrath of man shall praise thee,</hi>

               <hi>and the remainder thereof

that blessed Effects do oft proceed from dismal Causes;
and what seems very destructive, doth contribute to the
best event. We may well say of this Kingdom, it is <hi>in
Power;</hi> it being the irresistible execution of what the
Divine Will hath decreed; yea is the effective will of
the Supreme Disposer of all things.</p>
            <p>2. The glorious State, Rewards and Priviledges of God's
Subjects in the highest Heavens: That's the Kingdom of
glory, and completes the things begun in this Kingdom
of Grace. There God ruleth, and is obeyed in a manner
incomprehensible to us. We shall be Subjects, and yet <hi>Kings,
Rev.</hi> 1. 6.<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 6.</note> We must always pay our homage, but in

               <hi>will be all in all,</hi> yet we
shall behold in the Humane Nature of Christ, as great
manifestations of God, as Men or Angels were capable
of; the divine glory shineth in the face of Christ above
all other things; and he seemeth designed to be a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of fruition, for the improvement of the Glory of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
as well as the other glorified Subjects of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
The Glory of God doth lighten that Heavenly
City, and <hi>the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> By all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
improvements we labour for,<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 23.</note> and hasten to that
Kingdom; and therein terminate all the blessed methods
we are under in this our lower state.</p>
            <p>But the Kingdom of God which my Text refers to, is
the Moral Government of God among men on Earth,
especially as he is King Redeemer, in and by the Lord
Jesus.</p>
            <p>There be three things belonging to this Kingdom,
which are severally called by this same term, <hi>the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62563:7"/>
Kingdom of God,</hi> and each of them may well be intended
by the Holy Ghost in my Text.</p>
            <p>I. The Gospel, which containeth the Laws, Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Charter of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>II. The Graces and Actings which qualifie men as
Subjects of this Kingdom; and express God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over them, and their Loyalty to Him.</p>
            <p>III. All true Believers, who are the real Subjects that
make up this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I might insist on some other things, but these will be
of greatest use to us, and are principally intended.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I. The Kingdom of God is the Gospel, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
the Laws, Institutions, and Charter of our King
Redeemer.</p>
            <p>So it's taken,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Mat. 21. 43. The Kingdom of God shall be
taken from you:</hi> that is the Gospel. But when I use the
word <hi>Gospel,</hi> I do not mean the Gospel, in opposition to
the <hi>Mosaical</hi> dispensation, as it is oft used. The Gospel
Administration in this sense is often called in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> as being a fairer, more
full, and powerful Edition of the Institutes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
than was published before; tho yet the Kingdom
commenced, and had its essential Laws and Rules long
before Christ's coming. But I mean the Gospel as a Law
of Grace; in opposition to the Law of Works delivered
to man in his Innocent State.</p>
            <p>To direct your conceptions in this important Truth.
You must consider, 1. That God had, and exercised a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority over men, as he was their Creator.
He enacted Laws for our observance, well becoming his
Nature to injoin and our Condition to obey. For some
time we continued Loyal in <hi>Adam,</hi> our common Head:
but by his fall, Mankind became rebellious against God;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62563:7"/>
and by the Penal Sanction of the law of Works, and the
Rule fixed for man's propagating his Condition with his
Nature, we lost our original power to obey; and forfeited
our right to all that Good which was promised to perfect
obedience; Yea, are exposed to the utmost misery in
that Curse denounced against the least sin.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> This is the
condition of all men as related to God as our Creator;
though he has lost nothing of his right to command, or
punish his Rebellious Creatures.</p>
            <p>How justly might our injured Lord have confined our
state to these methods? Who might complain? if God
had finally executed <hi>that judgment which past on all men
unto condemnation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 16, 18.</note> The irremediable state of Devils on
their Rebellion, may awaken Mankind, to ascribe all
new overtures for happiness to the riches of the Grace of
God. Yea, every part of that Curse which exerts its
self by any degree of misery in Soul or Body, should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us, that it's of meer mercy we are not bound in
chains to the judgment of the great day.</p>
            <p>2. Immediately after the fall, God erected a new King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in and by Christ as Redeemer. In the Curse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against the Serpent, he opened a door of Grace
to sinful Man. He treats with us in order to our reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and resolved eventually to save the Elect: yet this
was to be in no other way, but by becoming subject to the
Rules of this new Kingdom. This Kingdom is owing to
Christ as the procuring Cause; and the management
thereof was deputed to him. He managed it in a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of successive administration; as Lawgiver he enacted
Terms of life, Rules of practice, Directions for Worship
and Discipline among his Subjects. He published bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Promises, and denounced Threats against the unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeable.</p>
            <p>No man was ever saved but by the Rules of this New
Kingdom, and owes it to the Grace and Merits of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62563:8"/>
Christ: though every dispensation did not give equal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
of Him, or that explicite knowledge of God-man
Redeemer; notwithstanding that Sacrifices pointed to
Him, and sundry Prophetick Revelations foretold Him.</p>
            <p>3. All Mankind are under all the Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as far as they can attain to the knowledg of
them.</p>
            <p>They are obliged to obey the terms of Life, which are
injoined by the Redeemer in their respective Age, and
Place. Life is offer'd to them, and they are saveable on
those terms. Sinners now act a new Rebellion, as well as
bind the first Curse on themselves, when they refuse
obedience to the Remedial Law. Yea, they aggravate
their ruine by their wilful obstinacy, which is a great
part of the undoing-impotency of Mankind. Awful is
that complaint of Christ, wherein he leaves the blood of
lost man on their own heads;<note place="margin">John 5. 40.</note> 
               <hi>Ye will not come to me,
that ye may have life.</hi> Refusers of Christ add to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against the Creator, most notorious disloyalty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Redeemer, who hath an additional claim to
dominion over us.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 10.</note> For, <hi>We are bought with a price, and
therefore should glorify him with our bodies, and our souls,
which are his:</hi> And he had a respect to this new acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Authority in his death;<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 9.</note> for, <hi>to this end he died, and
rose again, that he might be Lord both of the dead, and of
the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All of us are further engaged to observe all the Laws
of his House, the Rules of Worship and Practice, yea,
every Institution of his. There is an amazing Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the different promulgation of these to the World:
but to give my sense thereof, would exceed the limits
of one Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II. The Kingdom of God denotes the graces and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which qualify men as Subjects of God's Kingdom;
and express God's Authority over them, and their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62563:8"/>
to him. Thus you must understand that Scripture;
<hi>The Kingdom of God is not in meat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> 
               <hi>and drink; but in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. q. d.</hi> The
dominoin of God over Christians, and their loyal state
of obedience to God; lieth not in your poor differences
about meat, or such low matters. Therefore judg not
others, who may differ from you; nor be you satisfied
with your own usages in these less momentous things, as
an evidence of your Christian state: God's Kingdom is
in far higher matters, even in righteousness, peace, and
joy in the Holy Ghost. How can any man after so plain
a signification of the Divine Will, place all his Religion
in trifles; or sacrifice the undoubted Concernments of
God's Kingdom, to disputable things of far less moment?
Peace alone, by this Text, is more valuable, than all the
things for which some have long divided the Church.
This is the Kingdom of God as erected in the heart, and is
inclusive of whatever denotes sincere subjection to Christ.
To this belongs every Grace which is essential to a real
Christian, and all those acts which are necessary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the prevalency of such Graces over all opposite Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Defects.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom is advanced to the degrees of mens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
in the Divine Life, and the Dominion of
God over their Designs and Actings.</p>
            <p>III. The Kingdom of God is used for all true Believers; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
who are the real Subjects that make up this Kingdom.
These are they, in whom the former Graces abide, and
do acknowledg the Authority of the Lord Redeemer.<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note>
They are <hi>all translated into the Kingdom of Christ.</hi> By their
consent to the terms of the Gospel, they who were Aliens,
are Naturalized; and the Outlawry is reversed, which
stood against them as Rebellious Subjects. This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62563:9"/>
is of the same extent with the Church Mystical;
and as these Subjects multiply, it is enlarged.</p>
            <p>It's true, that all who credibly profess subjection to
Christ, are Parts of this Kingdom, as it's visible and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal:
they are Subjects in the judgment of Charity,
and as to external Privileges. This Christ asserts in that
Parable;<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 47, 48.</note> 
               <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Net cast
into the Sea, and gather'd of every kind, which when it
was full, they drew to shore; and gathered the good into
Vessels, bnt cast the bad away.</hi> You see that Hypocrites
and Sincere Believers are of the Kingdom: but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
belong to it, as they wear the visage of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere;
and therefore the name of Subjects belongs to
them only equivocally. Whereas in the most proper
sense, it is confined to men heartily devoted to Christ.
He is eminently <hi>King of Saints;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 15. 3.</note> even of such who have
unfeignedly subscribed his Covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 5. All
such are esteemed by him for his People, and they, yea
only they can say concerning God,<note place="margin">Isa. 33. 22.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
the Lord is our King, he will save us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can hardly forbear to bewail the dangerous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many men professing Christianity. Crowds will
be found Rebels in heart, dead as to a Spiritual Life,
whilst <hi>they have a</hi> name to live:<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 2.</note> and obeying their
Lusts, when they bow the Knee to Jesus.</p>
            <p>Having finished this Account of the Kingdom of God;
I proceed to explain how it is not <hi>in Word,</hi> but <hi>in Power.</hi>
And with the Explication I will insert the proof of the
Doctrine, That the Kingdom of God in the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Instances is not <hi>in Word,</hi> but <hi>in Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever mens Conceits be of this Kingdom, it
will be found to consist not in Weak Appearances,
but in effectual Realities. It attaineth the ends of
the Constitution, it is expressive of a Divine and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62563:9"/>
Virtue, and is not a dead Image, and carnal
Matter.</p>
            <p>1. The Gospel of Christ our Redeemer is effectual by
the Spirit, to recover fallen Men, and to govern, and
improve them unto eternal Life.</p>
            <p>This is not an empty Sound, it consists not in low or
weak Matters, but is Life and Power. Every command
is enstamped with the Authority of the Lord of Heaven
and Earth, and is not the faint advice of poor Mortals.
Men disobey them at their utmost peril, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 25.
Life and Death is annexed to them by a Soveraign, who
is able, and resolved to execute his Royal Sanction. They
have a Virtue in them to dispose us to Obedience, and are
holy, spiritual and perfect.</p>
            <p>The Matters revealed by the Gospel are not vain
Conceits, but glorious Realities; they are beyond the
Light of Nature to conceive; they shine in a Light fit to
illuminate the darkned minds of Sinners; and when
they are apprehended, they must inspire with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Resentments, and make lasting Impressions on the
Soul.</p>
            <p>The Promises are not doubtful Words, but great and
sure; they contain all that's good, they are founded on
the Veracity of God, who cannot lye; and on the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Christs Undertakings and Death, which cannot
be disappointed. Yea, they are mighty, to dispence the
Grace contained therein to needy Souls; and are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Instrument to invest men in all the blessings of
the Covenant, when the Condition is performed by
them.</p>
            <p>The Sacraments, and all Institutions of Christ, as
to Worship or Discipline, are powerful to improve our
Graces, mortifie our Lusts, maintain our Converses with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62563:10"/>
God, and dispence Joy and Comfort, through the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God by them.</p>
            <p>The Arguments urged by the Gospel, are fit to move,
and have all in them necessary to an Instrument of moral
Government.</p>
            <p>The Presence of God is promised, and the Efficacy of
all these means argue the Spirit's operation by them;
they are the Vehicle of the Holy Ghost, and therefore
when we are profitable to the Souls of Men,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 1. 5.</note> our <hi>Gospel
cometh to them not in Word only, but in Power, and in the
Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gospel is called, The <hi>Arm of God revealed, the
Scepter of his Kingdom, and Rod of his Strength.</hi> This
affords <hi>those Weapons which are mighty through God to
the pulling down of strong holds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and bringing every thought
to the obedience of Christ.</hi> God hath appointed it to raise
dead Souls, and subdue rebellious Sinners to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
In the Institutions of the Gospel God meets
us, and blesseth us; he communicateth Light and
Strength, whereby the weak Christian is enabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe.</p>
            <p>What Trophies of its Power are in Heaven and Earth?
How many great Sinners hath it changed? Every Age
and Place where it cometh, yield a Testimony of its
Energy; restraining some, turning others from Idols, to
serve the Living God; from a carnal Life, to a spiritual.
This hath made the Ambitious and Covetous to Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
all to the concerns of an invisible World, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
their former Idols, to the Profession of Truth.</p>
            <p>How many weak Christians hath it strengthned to
do, and suffer unexpected things? What Joy hath it
infused into sadned Hearts? On these accounts, the
<hi>Gospel is the Power of God unto Salvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>to every one that
believeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62563:10"/>
2. The Graces and Actings which qualify the Subjects
of Christ, are so spiritual, real and sublime, as to argue
a Divine life, and the Dominion of God in the Soul.</p>
            <p>What this Kingdom requireth and effecteth, are not
bare Pretences, weak Attempts, sleight Attainments, or
external Performances; these are too mean for God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join
or accept.</p>
            <p>He doth not paint a dead Carkass, but raise it to Life:
he createth a new Heart, wherein his Laws are prevalent
Dispositions, and communicateth a nature too Divine
to derive its birth from a lower Original than Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
by the Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>Hence all real Christians are said <hi>to be born of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and
partakers of the divine Nature.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> Our crying Lord, Lord,
and all external Alterations, signify little in this <hi>new
Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 24.</note> 
               <hi>which after God is created in Wisdom, and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi>
I will hint at some particulars which have the
chief place in this Kingdom, and you'l see that none of
them is in <hi>Word, but in Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith is not a faint assent to the Truths of the Gospel,
but such a realizing of invisible Objects, reliance on
Christ, and consent to Him the Redeemer, as purifieth
the Heart, worketh by Love, and derives from Christ fit
supports in the way of truth and holiness to eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Gospel Repentance is not a bare sorrow for Sin, but
a true hatred, and forsaking of Sin on Gospel-motives.</p>
            <p>Our love to God is not in a few kind or sleighty thoughts
of God, but a prevalent esteem of God, and delight in
him, as the supreme Good; and this expressing it self
in sincere Obedience to his strictest Laws, and Zeal for
his Interests when most despised.<note place="margin">John 14. 23.</note> 
               <hi>If a man love me,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>he will keep my words:</hi> If we love any thing
as him, it's a hating of him by the Rules of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Worship which Christ insisteth on, and disposeth
all his Subjects for, <hi>is in Spirit and in Truth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 24.</note> it's no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62563:11"/>
sleight performance, nor by humane Inventions. Prayer
must be a fervent pouring out of the Soul to God, and
not lip-labour:<note place="margin">Psal. 62. 8.</note> Hearing the Word is of no esteem with
him,<note place="margin">Isa. 29. 13.</note> unless the heart be obedient to the word, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baptism is not the putting away the filth of the flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>but
the answer of a good Conscience toward God.</hi> That is, Baptism
lieth in the Souls true Correspondence to, and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of our Baptismal Profession and Vows, and not a
meer sprinkling of water in an external act of the Minister.</p>
            <p>Receiving the Lords Supper is not the bare partaking
of the Consecrated Elements; but Communion with
our Crucified Christ, by Faith and Love, under the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 53, 63. We see that God
chiefly regardeth the inward Worship of the Soul, and not
bodily performances.</p>
            <p>The same power extends to every thing, wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is concerned: if this Kingdom of Grace obtaineth
in the Soul, Gods Authority is set above our wills, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and lusts; Satan is dethroned, Sin hath not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6, 14. Spiritual things are relish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above sensitive good: we are brought to live to God,
and not to carnal self: and there is an impartial respect
to all Gods Commandments, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 22.</p>
            <p>To finish this particular, this Kingdom consists of
Holy Inclinations in the Heart, and implies a degree of
strength to act those Inclinations. Here are not faint
Velleities, and uneffectual Desires or Complaints; <hi>but a
Spirit of Power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 7.</note> 
               <hi>of Love, and a sound Mind;</hi> whereby
Temptations are in a good measure resisted, and Holy
Actions performed.</p>
            <p>This is the Model of the Kingdom, this his Gospel
Injoineth, this his Grace Effecteth, and any thing below
it would not improve a Sinner to the Holiness our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
designed reconciled Sinners to. God's Kingdom
never hath place, where any of these Essentials are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62563:11"/>
wanting, or where there is only some dead form of
them.</p>
            <p>3. Believers who are the Subjects of Gods Kingdom, are
not meer Professors of Christianity, but truly Regenerate
and Practical Christians.</p>
            <p>They are of another spirit than what they once were;
or the rest of the World continue yet to be; their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
is higher, <hi>being born not of the will of the
flesh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>or of the will of man, but of the will of God,</hi>
They have far different apprehensions of Spiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
than a carnal mind is capable of; these practically
know the great things of God in a Spiritual evidence,
<hi>being taught by him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>as the truth is in Jesus.</hi> They are a
people made willing <hi>in the day of God's power.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 110. 3.</note> Then a
mighty Arm subdued their obstinacy without violence;
silenced their prejudices, and made them obedient by
agreeable inclinations to the Law, and powerful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of God's Authority and Goodness. Their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
is not in empty speculations. As every truth
tends to practice, so they feel the power of Truth. The
objective <hi>Glory of Christ transformeth them into the same
Glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>in their measure.</hi> They walk with God whom the
world knows not; they live above what Sinners dote
on; to please and honour God is their governing-aim;
To keep a Conscience void of offence towards God and
men, is their exercise; and working out their Salvation,
is their chief business; while as Pilgrims here, they are
waiting for the expected Inheritance: <hi>These live the life
of Christ,</hi> are acted by his Spirit which dwells in them
by an abiding Relation, and are appointed for his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
purposes.</p>
            <p>They are not Hypocritical pretenders, tho censured
as Cheats by such men whose Corruptions represent all
better pretences as Hypocrisie. How much do the
Conceptions, Designs, Experience, Attainments and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62563:12"/>
Actings of these men, exceed the rest of mankind? There
is more Piety in many of their common Actions, than
in the Religious Performances of others: these are they
whom the Apostle describes as a <hi>chosen generation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>a royal
priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people,</hi> fit and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
<hi>to shew forth the praises of him, who called them out
of darkness into his marvellous light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can any of you doubt these express Characters of all
sincere Christians? Of these, and only these Christs
Kingdom doth consist. There are such persons in the
World, or God hath no Kingdom in it. Such as are
wholly otherwise in their Temper and Actings, are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
and Aliens in Gods esteem; and declared incapable
of Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some of you may Prophanely Scoff at this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
as if it were impossible to be thus Sincere and
Spiritual; or it were needless to be thus Pious, Just,
Temperate, or Heavenly-minded: but be it known to
you, that you will shortly be convinced, your selves
ought to be such men; and passionately wish all this
could have been truly said of you.</p>
            <p>I have designedly given the Character of the Subjects
of this Kingdom in Scripture-Expressions, lest any should
esteem it a Fancy, which they owe not that regard to, as
to judge of themselves by it. But I hope you cannot
shut your eye against the Testimony of God; nor put
any Gloss on those Scriptures which can prevent your
suspecting your own Condition. Must not you think
now, how few are Members of this Kingdom? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
am I to these Subjects of Christ, when I never
found any of these things, nor proposed them to my self
as things necessary to be attained by me? What a change
must there be in my Heart and Life, before such a wretch
can be meet to be partaker of the Inheritance with the
Saints in Light,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 12.</note> as every real Christian is?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62563:12"/>
It remaineth that I apply more particularly such things
as you have heard of the Nature and Power of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>1. What you have heard of the Gospel may direct us in
our judgment of a Gospel Ministry.</p>
            <p>We Ministers are appointed by Christ to persuade Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
both to yield subjection to God Redeemer, and then to
walk in all due Loyalty towards Him; all our Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
must be managed by those Laws which respect our
Office, otherwise we affront the Lord Jesus, in whose Name
we act, and become useless to Men, for whose good we are
designed.</p>
            <p>The matter of our Preaching ought to be the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,<note place="margin">Act. 28. 31.</note>
               <hi>even the Kingdom of God, and the things which
concern our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> the manner ought to be
such as most conduceth to render it effectual to those Ends
for which it is published. Ministers are to do their utmost,
that this Gospel may come not in Word only, but in Power,
and that all may be brought to a compliance with it.</p>
            <p>Therefore we ought not to make State Affairs,<note place="margin">Act. 19. 8.</note> human
Conceits or dictates of Men, the matter of our Preaching;
the Rules of the Covenant of Works, nor the Law of Nature
as under a respect to that Covenant, are not to be urged by
us; tho the Law of Nature as a rule of our Actions, is still
of force in this Kingdom of God Redeemer, and so must be
insisted on.</p>
            <p>The great things we ought to persuade, are the things
God hath made the terms of Life to <hi>redeemed</hi> Man. The
methods of Reconciliation must be intended; for God now
dealeth with Men not only as his rational Creatures, but as
fallen Sinners, under new Overtures for Life. Sinners must
be directed by us to Christ, as He <hi>on whose Shoulders this
New</hi> Government is, and in whom there is Grace, Strength
and Pardon, which our Apostacy made impossible by the
Law of Works.</p>
            <p>The great Doctrins of Regeneration, Repentance, Faith
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62563:13"/>
in Christ, love of God, and sincere Obedience (as explained
by the Gospel Standard,) are the things to be urged as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Salvation; should we mistake these Terms of Life,
or neglect to persuade your Compliance therewith, other
things would be vain, and leave you dead in your sins. What
profit is it that you learn and do all things else, if you submit
not to the Terms of the Gospel? For this is the lowest Rule
of Gods judgment by which the salvation of any sinner is
possible.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>He will judge the secrets of all men by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>manner</hi> also of a Ministers preaching of these Truths
is considerable. We should publish these in the greatest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and in a way most probable to be attended with the
influence of the Spirit. Much of that divine Power which
persuades you, is exerted in fitting the Preacher to plead
with you. Ministers of the Gospel are therefore to avoid
<hi>the enticeing words of mans wisdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and must preach in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> We must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
things in the greatest plainness; urge Gospel Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
with the fullest Evidence and Importunity, <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our selves to every mans Conscience</hi> to the utmost, for
their Conviction and Persuasion. It's not invaluable to you
that the Minister in all his work is under the power of
what he preacheth, and doth all in a humble dependance on
the blessing and power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>This Ministry answers the Gospel description; this
hath a tendency and fitness to subdue Souls to Christ; this
is that the Lord Jesus (who ordinarily works according
to the aptitude of means) doth usually bless. Such a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
is a sign that God intends the enlargement of his
Kingdom; and according to what appears of it among
us, we may expect proportionable Effects. The Lord bring
the vain Minds of Hearers to approve this sort of Preaching,
and convince us Ministers of all levity and mistakes
in our Ministration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62563:13"/>
2. What you have heard of the nature of Grace, and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Actings towards Christ, may sharply reprove all such
who seem by Principle to place Religion in any thing short
of this Power. It's needful they lock up the Scriptures (those
Royal Statutes of Christ) who dare place Christianity in
external Rites, tho the Heart and Life be unsanctified. Its
Disloyalty to Christ to exchange his Institutions for human
Inventions.<note place="margin">Col. 2. 18, 19, 23.</note> Yea, it's Disloyalty to exclude internal
Worship for external, and define Graces and spiritual
Acts by no more than a dead Image of them. How
must they debase Religion who commend Pomp for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Devotion, and make carnal Observances serve instead
of Gospel Faith and Love? Surely they little regard the
Authority and Constitutions of Christ, who account Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be Repentance, and represent Pilgrimages, Confession,
Penance, and blind Obedience to the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> too like
an Atonement for the absence of the essential Terms of
Life. What can more expresly contradict Mens pleasing
God by meer external Acts or Profession, than my Text doth?
But alas! the Doctrin of <hi>Opus operatum</hi> is too natural to a
dead sinner, to be confined within the Walls where first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed.
All are too apt to throw off Duties as a Penance,
and think the eternal Spirit is satisfied with bodily Homage.
Many judge that Ordinances edify them as a meer Charm,
without any due exercise of Soul in them: A mistake in this
essential Point, is the reason also why many jear at the
Graces of God, promise Life to a just and civil demeanour,
and scoff at Holiness as Preciseness. The like Effects of a
carnal Spirit is Mens esteeming Regeneration to be no more
than external Baptism, when that is but a visible Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the nature of it, and a Seal and Instrument of
investitute in Gospel Blessing, on supposition that we are
inwardly Regenerated. What a gross conceit is it, that
Conversion is but a turning from a gross Infidels State by a
bare external Profession of Christianity, tho the mind be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62563:14"/>
still unrenewed, and the Heart unimpressed by a divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple?
From these Sentiments Men ridicule all Pretences to
those things which the Scriptures expresly declare concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Believer, as praying in the Spirit, Communion
with God, Union to Christ, Spiritual Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho the things
are intelligible by any that are judicious, and experienced
by such as have any converse by Faith with God and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Things. It's pity that a prophane Spirit should arraign
the Matters peculiar to a Life so far above its self; especially
when God hath told us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>A natural man cannot know the
things of God, because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> But
whilst they must be <hi>foolishness</hi> to them,<note place="margin">Luke 7. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Wisdom will be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by its Children,</hi> as better Advocates and fitter Judges.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless the Devil attains a destructive End by these
Notions; for his Dominion is supported, and poor sinners
are secure in a State of Rebellion against Christ, whiles they
flatter themselves as Subjects to him, because they do a few
trifles which neither Satan nor their Lusts forbid, and
Custom, Interest, or natural Conscience persuade to. How
will any Soul among you who stands guilty of this Charge
dare to look the Blessed Redeemer in the Face? What terror
will surprize you, when you are accused by him as disloyal in
your very Principles, and asserters of that for Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Gods Sovereignty over the Heart is excluded, and all real
actings of Grace unprovided for? You have reproached that
which God lays the greatest Stress on, which his Kingdom
chiefly consists in, and his Saints most value themselves by.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to the Exhortations I design, it's need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to insert two <hi>Cautions</hi> that may obviate our abuse of
this Subject.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Caution.</hi> Do not deny this Power of Religion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Person or Party without manifest Grounds.</p>
            <p>Charity binds you to think all are truly Religious that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to be so, unless their Defects or Works palpably blast their
Pretences, or their Profession be nullified by a direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62563:14"/>
As the power of Religion should not be sacrificed
to a Ceremony, so lesser Faults do not warrant us to accuse
men as wanting the power of Godliness. Whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the habitual subjection of a Soul to Christ, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
justifie our excluding that Soul out of Christs Kingdom.
We may say, yea must affirm of Men differing from us in
many things,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The same</hi> Christ <hi>is their Lord and ours.</hi>
Peace and Love are essentials in Christs Kingdom; and
shall we challenge our own interest by being censorious; or
enviously narrow the Dominion of our Blessed Redeemer?</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Caution.</hi> Despise not the external Institutions of Christ
under pretence of this Power; the Power and Spirit of Christ
concur with his Ordinances, and the life and vigor of our
Graces are exerted in those Ordinances, and nourished by
them.</p>
            <p>That Spirit is a delusion which puts Men above divine
Appointments, and the Guilty are as truly Superstitious as
the greatest Formalist. Whiles we are Subjects of Christs
Kingdom here below, we must attend the Ordinances of the
lower State of this Kingdom, and divine Institutions are
parts of this Kingdom; which tho it be not in word so
as to exclude the Power,<note place="margin">Act. 28. 19, 20.</note> yet it lies in power as inclusive of
a Christian Profession and external Ordinances.</p>
            <p>The next improvement I shall make of the Text, is by way
of Exhortation, wherein I shall regard the Kingdom of God
as the power thereof lies in Graces, and acts expressive of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Life, and the governing Authority of God in the Soul.
This includes the two other particulars; for these are the
effects of the Power of the Gospel, these answer the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Rules and Demands of the Gospel; and because of
these the Subjects of Christs Kingdom are not Hypocrites,
but truly regenerate and practical Christians.</p>
            <p>1. Be throughly convinced that the Kingdom of God is
in these Graces and vital Acts, and can consist in nothing
lower. I have given you undoubted Proof of this, if you
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62563:15"/>
will believe the Gospel beyond your own Fancy, or Satans
suggestions: And whether you will enlarge your judgment
to Gods decision or no, the time is near when this great
King <hi>will judge the secrets of your hearts and lives</hi> by this
very Gospel Rule.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It's undoing to most Professors of Christianity, that they
fondly persuade themselves the Demands of God are not so
high and exact, as truly they be; it's true indeed, he makes
not legal Perfection to be the Condition of a Right to Life,
but yet he enjoyns a spiritual Life and Faith (extensively
taken) in order to our Interest in Christ, and to Salvation
on his account.<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 36.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks you can hardly in a serious Frame conceive how
any thing below real Grace and vital Acts should serve your
turn. Consider the glorious Nature of God; and can meer
external Performances be suitable to him, either to injoin
or accept?<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 14.</note> Would Christ have died to raise dead Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to no more Conformity to God than an unholy
Heart, and hypocritical Actings amount to? Are the design
of the Gospel, and the attested Influences of the Spirit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
by a dead Soul or formal Duty? Judge you whether
an ungodly, stupid, graceless Professor of Christianity, can
either here or in Eternity serve the purposes, for which God
erects this Kingdom among Men? What delight can his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Nature take in such? What Service or Glory can he and
his Christ have by such? Yea, what satisfaction can
such Men have in God or Heaven? These and the like
Considerations may well awaken you to juster apprehensions
of this matter, and convince you that the Kingdom of God
must lie in this <hi>Power.</hi> And if it be needful to add more,
consider wherein can the Kingdom of Satan and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sin consist, but in the want of these gracious Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
neglect of those Acts, and the prevalency of what
is opposite to them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62563:15"/>
Set therefore this Standard before the Eye of thy Soul, as
that which thou must examine thy self by, and be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to, if thou desirest to belong to this Kingdom of the
Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Labor industriously for,<note place="margin">Exhort. 2.</note> and rest not contented till you
have attained this Power of Religion.</p>
            <p>I do in the Name of your Redeemer press you to get the
Graces, and perform those Acts which argue a spiritual
Life, and the restauration of Gods Image and Authority in
your Souls. Be Christians in Truth as well as in Name; let
no external Performance or Profession content you; see that
your Wills be subjected to God, that your Lives be regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Laws, and all your religious Acts inspired with
a divine Power. This is the principal matter we are to treat
of with you, and what you are chiefly concerned to attend
to. To accomplish this, it is, that you are entrusted with
the Means of Grace, and yet spared after so long provoking
Obstinacy, which is more aggravated by your treacherous
Pretensions.</p>
            <p>That I may enforce this Exhortation, I shall desire you
to apply to your selves these few Motives.</p>
            <p>You pretend and engage to no less than this Power
of Religion by your Christianity.<note place="margin">Mot. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>What you despise in others and neglect in your selves,
even this you pretend to, and have solemnly Promised. Do
not you profess to be the Subjects of Christ? Have not you
renounced the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
to fight under Christs Banner? And ought you not
to be and do all this truly? Renounce all these Rivals with
Christ, and he must then Reign in Power. Can you think
that the Covenant you have sealed so oft at the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
engageth you to no more than external Profession?
When you stipulated with Father, Son and Spirit, was no
more intended than that you would pay them a slight bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Worship? Sure you profess as much sincere Subjection
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62563:16"/>
as the strictest, in professing your selves Christians; and
are not you Hypocrites then, whiles your Souls are unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
and your Lives not governed by the Laws of
Christ?<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> Oh! tremble to think <hi>that you profess to know,
and yet in works deny him.</hi> Your Hearts breath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against God, whiles you seem Loyal to him.
What agreeableness to thy Name do a covetous, intemperate,
carnal, irreligious Spirit and Life bear? Renounce the Name,
or else be and do what that Name is designed for.</p>
            <p>How sad will the thoughts of thy State be, when thou
findest thy self branded by the Heart-searching God, as one
<hi>that hath a Form of Godliness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>but denying the Power thereof.</hi>
The word we render Form, is Mó<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>q. d.</hi> they
have the visage or appearance of true Piety; thou wilt
be found a Virgin without Oyl, at the Feast without a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Garment; the Son that said to his Father, I will work
in the Vineyard, but failest to do so. Surely, what induceth
thee to profess to be a devout Christian, should encline thee
to be so.</p>
            <p>2. Any thing short of this Power of Religion will avail
you nothing, but greatly damage you.</p>
            <p>You are Enemies in Gods account whatever you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and he will treat you as such when the time of Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
cometh. How wilt thou, Oh rebellious Christian,
endure that Sentence?<note place="margin">Luke 19. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Bring these my enemies that would
not that I should Reign over them, and slay them before me.</hi>
What a loss wilt thou sustain when thy Gold becomes
Dross, when thy Knowledge, Duties, yea, all thy
Religion is vain? Oh that so much should be attained in
vain, and done to no purpose! You will find that if your
Graces be not sincere, they will not save; yea, and if they
partake not of this Power, they are but guilded Vices.
Your feigned Faith is but Unbelief; your pretended Love
is Enmity, your partial Obedience is Rebellion; and will
God reward, nay, must not God severely punish unbelieving,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62563:16"/>
irreconcileable, rebellious Professors of Christianity, and give
you a Portion with the most prophane? Nay, your Guilt
is aggravated, and your Woes will be the greater. What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
will you reap by Orthodox Principles,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 23.</note> while you are Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
in Heart? Church-Membership will expose to
the forest rebukes;<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 12.</note> for if <hi>the Children of the Kingdom perish,
they are cast into outer darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last pity your selves. Why should you be at any pains, if
you will not do enough to bring you to Heaven? Can any
thing this side <hi>Glory</hi> be the Reward you intend by being
Religious? Why then will you not be so Religious as to obtain
that Glory? Oh! mock God no longer, delude thy own Soul
no more; thou art almost a Christian, be altogether so; or
the Convictions, and Helps that have almost persuaded thee,
will aggravate thy ruin when thou fallest into Hell, from
a pitch so much higher than the <hi>Atheist</hi> and <hi>Pagan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Very plausible Appearances of Religion may be
without this Power.</p>
            <p>Men may appear sincere to others, yea, to themselves,
and yet be Hypocrites. There is a very probable Form,
without the Power of Godliness. Every living Grace hath
its dead Image; thy Heart may be hard when Groans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound;
thou may'st cry loud and oft to God, and thy Soul
never pray; thy Affections may be on Earth, when thy
Eyes are lifted up to Heaven. So inward is the Life of Grace,
and so deceitful are our Hearts, that we can say of the seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
greatest Christians, but as <hi>Peter</hi> did of <hi>Silvanus; a
faithful Brother,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>as I suppose.</hi> (For the Supposition may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that, as well as the uncertainty of his being <hi>Peters</hi>
Messenger): Yea, we are so subject to deceive our selves,
that we have need to pray with <hi>David, Lord search me,
and try me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alass! How many with <hi>Alexander</hi> may have great Zeal,
and want Integrity? Promise much, and perform the
contrary.<note place="margin">Jer. 42. 5. 2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> You will be found Virgins with Lamps, and yet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62563:17"/>
want Oyl; seem lively Saints, and be dead Sinners. We
may with bleeding Hearts consider, that very many have
been not far from Grace, and yet never attained it, because
some one Lust opposed it, or some one Idol prevented it. It's
a great thing to be truly Religious. The best natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the most splendid Acts, the exactest Profession, are not
infallible Evidences of a Mans being truly Pious; but are
separable from saving Grace.</p>
            <p>You have need therefore of the strictest care and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
in dealing with your Hearts. Oh! look to it, that
your Religion hath in it the undoubted Characters of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life; and of Gods Kingdom being set up in you, in
its very Power. The hardest task is to arrive at this Power
of Godliness; to get Carnal-self dethroned, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of Christ chearfully submitted to.<note place="margin">Act. 20. 25.</note> This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in its Duties and Priviledges hath been long preached
to you; now God is importunate that you exclude not your
selves from the Rewards of it, by Rebelling against the Laws
and Terms of it. Were you acquainted with the Nature of
Christs Kingdom, it would soon be desirable. The King
is our rightful Lord, and not an Usurper; He hath the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of a Father, is infinitely Wise and Good: He admits
all his Subjects to the State of Children, yea, the Dignity
of Kings. All the Laws of it refer to our Good, and tend
to our Perfection; and whatever is required of us, he is
present to assist us in; yea, ready to forgive all Weaknesses
consistent with sincere Endeavors: And can you refuse this
easie Yoak of Christ from day to day? Will you refuse this,
that you may continue Slaves to the Devils, and Servants
to your Lusts? Oh! that even now you were made willing,
and able to submit to Christ; and inspired with that Divine
Nature which agrees to this State, that is, even the heavenly
Kingdom begun. Oh! perish not in your Misconceits, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Disobedience after all these Pleadings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62563:17"/>
3. Improve in the Power of Religion, if you have attained
to any degree of it.</p>
            <p>There are remains of Weakness and Disloyalty in the
best of us, and so there's place for our utmost Endeavors to
become more suited to this happy State in our Temper and
Behaviour. How much are we short of our Fellow Subjects
in Light,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 22, 23.</note> Strength and Love? <hi>We are come to mount</hi> Zion,
<hi>the City of the living God, to an innumerable Company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels

Men made perfect.</hi> We serve the same Lord, we partake of
the same Nature, are admitted to the same Relation, and
we expect the same Glory which our King doth design us to
as well as them: And must not these things cause a Blush in
us, that we are so remiss in our Improvements? Can they
fail to awaken our Souls to proceed <hi>from strength to strength?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 84. 7.</note>
Therefore, let Mortification be your work while any Lusts
remain. Be more Spiritual in every Duty, more Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in your Minds; and let all your Works be more perfect.
What should be so much your concern, as that the Laws of
Christ have a more absolute Authority in you, that Gods
Image impress the whole Man, and your Souls be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
and listed up in all the ways of this Kingdom? Rest
not till you find Christ Rules alone, and that you entirely
live to Christ under the very constraints of Love to Him.
How happy will you be, when the very Peace of God rules
in your Hearts, yea, so rule as that it restrains all that may
interrupt it, and command to all that can express and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it? When this is your Frame, your Delights will be
more refined;<note place="margin">Psal. 43. 4.</note> you will now live much nigher to God, your
<hi>exceeding Joy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 11.</note> and have an <hi>abundant Entrance</hi> to his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
above, when a few Days are over. Resolve then that
you will still grow up into Christ, till nothing inspires you
but his Life, and nothing be done by you but what is Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62563:18"/>
4. Visibly express the sincerity of your Subjection to
God, and the Efficacy of his Grace in your Souls. This
is incumbent on all Christians; but I shall apply my self
more especially to you that are Magistrates, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this Assembly. You do profess your selves real
Subjects to Christ; evidence then, that real Christians are
more fitted to serve their Generation than other Men. Let
Christ Govern by all your Power, and his Interests be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
by you to the utmost of your Talents. Convince the
World, that nothing can allure or affright you from exact
Obedience to Christs Laws, and Fidelity to his Concerns.
Christs Eye is on your Hearts, and Behaviour, in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Circumstances. The Eyes of many of very different
sorts are on you; yea, the credit of Religion is concerned
in your Behaviour. And it's but a few Days, when you
must with awakened Spirits review your present Actings;
it may be under afflictive Dispensations, when thrust off
your present Stage: But certainly, when you come to die,
and appear before the Tribunal of the Lord your Judge.
Therefore create not bitter Reflections by selfish Aims, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Neglects, or unbecoming Deviations. A tormenting
Conscience in that Day, will not be countervailed by any
present Advantage. You are employed in a time that may
evidence the utmost which a Christian can do or endure.
But whatever may be your Exercise, let it be seen, that you
serve Christ with the same honourable Thoughts of him,
and Devotedness to him, as ever. You have the same Lord,
whose Laws Authority and Interests do not vary with the
uncertain Motions of this lower World; and whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
are of an infinitly higher Nature than the poor and
perishing Toyls of Mortals.</p>
            <p>That I may improve and enforce this Exhortation,
Consider.</p>
            <p>1. As Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as Magistrates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Christ, and so owe the utmost Fidelity and Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62563:18"/>
to him. If you are real Believers, you are of his
Kingdom; and that admits none that will not serve Him
without Limitations. Duty and Gratitude binds you to
act with a Supream regard to Christ; and to all others
only in subordination to Him. You must with <hi>Joshua,
follow him fully.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 15. 8.</note> It ill becomes you to consult with Flesh
and Blood.<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> For did not you Covenant thus with Christ;
<hi>Lord, do but save me, and I solemnly surrender my self to
thee?</hi> What tho his Service may expose you to some Acts
of Self-denial, doth not he deserve that from you? Shall a
dying Christ endure so much for you, and will you think
a little Contempt too much to bear for him? Doth not He
in the midst of his exalted Glory in the Heavens, intercede
for you? And can you in a little painted Honor forget to
plead his Cause? Shall your Mite (which also is His) be
unimployed for Christ, who daily lays out his Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Fullness, for every Believers use?</p>
            <p>As you are Magistrates, you are appointed to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of this Redeemer. All Power and Judgment is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him; Magistracy is his Ordinance, and should be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
in Christs behalf, as well as the Ministry. He is
<hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> and hath appointed the
Rulers of the Earth work in his Kingdom, whether they
attend it or no. Magistrates have the Sword, as Ministers
have the Word; they have the Coercive Power, we the
Persuasive; and Christ will as truly bring the unfaithful
Magistrate to an account for his Neglects and Mistakes, as
the unfaithful Minister.</p>
            <p>2. Your Sovereign Lord will prosper you, according to
what he designs to effect in your Day, and by your Hands.
You serve him who manageth all by his Providence; and
hath chalked out in his Purpose, what shall be executed in
every Age. <hi>De jure,</hi> the Kingdoms of the Earth are his from
the First; but from Age to Age he is advancing Mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his Dominion, and erecting a holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62563:19"/>
in the World, on the Ruins of Satans Kingdom.
He hath a Kingdom which all the Powers of Hell shall not
extirpate the ruder beginnings of,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 14.</note> nor prevent its utmost
growth. This Kingdom lies in the Dominion of Light o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Darkness, Truth over Error, Holiness over Sin, pure
Gospel-worship over corrupt Worship, and the Interests of
Jesus over all Rivals. It includes the devotedness of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Powers to Christs Service, and a national Dedication to
him as Supream Lord.<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 7.</note> This Kingdom he enlargeth in set
times,<note place="margin">Zech. 14. 9, 16, 19.</note> and towards the latter Days more eminently,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 15.</note> upon
the desolations of <hi>Paganism</hi> and <hi>Antichristianism.</hi> This happy
time I live expecting, and rejoyce in some hopeful, tho aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prognosticks of.</p>
            <p>It pleaseth Christ more eminently to employ his real
Subjects as his Instruments to advance his Interests by; and
they shall not want an Anointing to fit and succeed them,
let the Work seem never so hard,<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 32.</note> and the Success never so
improbable.</p>
            <p>It's not in you or me to allot our selves our Day or
Work; we must take that as our great Disposer hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted.
This only is incumbent on you, that you fill up
your Places, and see that Christ wants no Service he calls
you to, and qualifies you for.</p>
            <p>It's not without his Counsel that you are at this Season
in the Magistracy; this he appointed you to and hath some
design to scrue by you: And tho it now appears not what
may be the Influence, or Event of this Surprize, leave that
to him, whose Counsels are a great depth, and doth nothing
in vain; yea hath ordinarily some great things to do by
such, whom he signally calls to an opportunity of Service.
You ought therefore to do what good your Hand finds to
do from day to day, and that with all your might. Resign
up your selves to his Conduct, and be faithful in present
Trust, within the bounds of your Places. Keep innocent in
all your VVays; suppress all Sin, and advance Righteousness.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62563:19"/>
Whiles you are thus Exercised, you may expect the Presence
of God with you, and have a considerable Influence in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
work Christ hath now in hand. Others may little
esteem any Usefulness of this Kind; but what to a discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christian can be more pleasing, than contributing any
thing to Christs Interests? What can be more honourable
than to be one of them whom Christ designs in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 14.</note>
               <hi>They that are with him are called, and chosen, and
faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Kingdom of Glory is reserved, and will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
bestowed on all such as are Loyal to Christ in all their
present Trust.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 8.</note> They that follow the Lord, shall Reign
with him. Will you repent present Hardships when you
stand about the Throne? Can you grudge him a few days
Service, who hope to be ever with him? Will you not in
those Rivers of Pleasures, even relent that your Service
was no greater? You will wish, Oh that I had exceeded
the utmost, which I did best perform! That I had been
entrusted with Opportunities for more difficult work! It's
no such wonder the damned should have lived to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and guide their Course by secular Interests. But that
the <hi>Heirs of Glory</hi> should be afraid, or ashamed of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
to Christ, would be strange.</p>
            <p>Must not these things reallized by Faith, endue you
with new Vigor. Oh! therefore gird up the Loins of your
Minds; be prepared to endure Reproach, and any Evil that
may attend you. Be fortified against all Allurements;
be not of them that are <hi>corrupt with Flatterys,</hi> which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are more ensnaring than Frowns.<note place="margin">Dan. 11. 32.</note> Whatever others
choose, see that in all your perplexing Doubts you be most
sollicitous, What now would Christ have me to do? And let
your Determinations be fixed, by the Light you gain thro
that Enquiry. Examin your Duty as under the Eye of Christ,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62563:20"/>
and resolve in it as Men persuaded, that your Happiness
or Misery depends only on his Favor, or his Frowns; and
that he will deal with you according to your Faithfulness to
him. He will not put you off with vain Hopes, or an
imaginary Kingdom; if his Grace rule in you, and you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it in your Station, by a Carriage becoming the Living
Subjects of this Kingdom of Grace.</p>
