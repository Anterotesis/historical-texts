            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Chose the Psalms of <hi>David</hi> for the Platform of my Devotions, because no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be supposed more acceptable to God in duties of this nature, than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his steps, who was a man after God's own heart. The Original is so well penned, so full and lofty in its expressions, that <hi>Cowley,</hi> when he gave his censure of the Translators, says, that <hi>Shimei</hi> hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled <hi>David</hi> more, than some of them have done. However, I reckon not my self concerned in that charge, seeing I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the best Translation our Language bears. Were this Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> duly weighed, and considered, men might find materials for their addresses to Heaven fitted for all states and conditions; as if it were a mirrour of the Passages of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb facs="tcp:29952:7"/>
Life, and comprehended all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and offices of a good man. Though <hi>David</hi>'s Composures were elegant and harmonious in their native dress, yet 'twas not the Instrument, but the strings of his heart made the sweetest melody. Nothing is more charming than a soul so well tuned, so well skill'd in all the parts of Divine musick: Thus we joyn consort with the harmony of the sphears; we may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Eccho is rebounded with the exultation and Hallelujahs of Heaven it self.</p>

            <p>SErve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce unto him with reverence, 2.11. But know, that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the Lord will hear me when I call upon him, 4.3. Offer the sacrifices of Righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 5. For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, neither shall evil dwell with thee, 5.4. For thou, Lord, wilt bless the Righteous: with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield, 12. God judgeth the Righteous, and God is angry with the Wicked every
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29952:8"/>
day. If he turn not, he will whet his Sword, he hath bent his Bow, and made it ready; 7.11, 12. The Wicked shall be turned into Hell, and all the Nations that forget God. For the Needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever, 9.17, 18. The Lord tryeth the Righteous; but the Wicked, and him that loveth violence, his Soul hateth. For the Righteous Lord loveth Righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright, 11.56.7. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise saith the Lord, I will set him in safety, from him that pusseth at him. The words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tryed in a furnace of Earth purified seven times in the fire, 12.5, 6. The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children of Men, to see if there were any that would understand and seek after God, 14.2. Lord, who shall abide in thy Tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy Hill? He that walketh uprightly and worketh Righteousness, and speaketh the Truth in his Heart, 15.1, 2. In whose eyes a vise person is contemned, but he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth them that fear the Lord: he that sweareth to his neighbour, and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him not. Thou wilt shew me the path of Life; in thy presence is the fulness of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29952:8"/>
joy, at thy right hand there is pleasure for evermore, 16.11. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be safe from mine enemies, 18.3. I was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before him, and I kept my self from mine iniquity: therefore the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced me according to my Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and according to the cleanness of mine hand in his eye-sight. With the merciful thou shalt shew thy self merciful, with an upright man, thou shalt shew thy self upright; <hi>vers.</hi> 23, 24, 25. He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Man. Great deliverance giveth he to his King, and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to <hi>David,</hi> and to his Seed for evermore, <hi>vers.</hi> 48, 51.</p>
            <p>The Heavens declare the glory of God; and the Firmament sheweth his handy-work, 19.1. The Lord hear thee in the day of Trouble; the Name of the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> defend thee, 20.1. Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. Our Fathers trusted in thee, and thou didst deliver them; 22.4. For he hath not despised, nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither hath he hid his face from him, but when he cryed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29952:9"/>
unto him, he heard him, <hi>vers.</hi> 24. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall want nothing, 23.1. He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart, who hath not lift up his Soul to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, nor sworn deceitfully, 24.4, 5, He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the Lord of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy honour dwelleth, 26.8. Wait upon the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord, 27.14. I hate them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the Lord. I will be glad and rejoyce in thy mercy, for thou hast considered my trouble, thou hast known my Soul in adversities, 31.6, 7. For my life is spent with grief, my strength fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me because of my Iniquity, and my bones are consumed, <hi>vers.</hi> 10. Blessed is he whose Transgression is forgiven, and whose Sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in whose spirit is no Guile. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my Sin unto thee, and mine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities have I not hid: I said, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my Transgression unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my Sin. Be glad in the Lord, ô ye Righteous, and rejoyce, and shout for joy all ye that are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29952:9"/>
upright in heart, 32.1, 2, 5, 11. He lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Righteousness, and Judgment, the Earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. Let all the Earth fear the Lord, let all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the World stand in awe of him. The Lord looketh from Heaven: he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all the Sons of Men. Depart from evil and do good, seek Peace, and pursue it. From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the Inhabitants of the Earth. He fashioneth all their hearts alike: he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth their works. There is nothing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the multitude of an Host, neither a mighty man delivered by great strength. Behold, the Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, and upon them that hope in his mercy: To deliver their Soul from Death, and to keep them alive in Famine, 33.5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth. O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us extol his Name together. I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears. The poor cryeth, and the Lord heareth him, and saveth him out of all his troubles. The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. O taste and see how good the Lord is to them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29952:10"/>
that fear him, and trusteth in him. O fear the Lord, ye his Saints, for there is no want to them that fear him. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ons do lack, and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord shall want no manner of thing that is good. Keep thy Tongue from evil, and thy Lips from speaking guile. Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. The Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, and his Ears open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their cry. The Face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them from the Earth. The Righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite Spirit. Many are the troubles of the Righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of all. Evil shall slay the Wicked, and they that hate the Righteous shall be desolate. The Lord redeemeth the Souls of his Servants, and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate, 34.1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22. For he flattereth himself in his own Eye, until his abominable Sins be found to be abominable. For with thee is the fountain of Life: and in thy Light, shall we see Light.

               </gap> 36.2, 9, 10. Fret not thy self because of the evil doers, neither be envious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut down like the Grass, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the green herb. Trust in the Lord, and be doing good, so shalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Delight thy self in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of thy heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in him, and he shall bring it to pass. Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently upon him: fret not thy self because of him who pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth in his way, because of the man that bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thy self in any wise to do evil: For evil doers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the Land. A little that the Righteous man hath, is better than the riches of the ungodly. The Wicked borroweth and payeth not again, but the Righteous sheweth mercy, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For such as be blessed of God, shall inherit the Land: and they that be cursed of him, shall be cut off. The steps of a good man is blessed of the Lord, and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29952:11"/>
he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand, I have been young, and now am old; yet never saw I the Righteous forsaken, nor their seed begging their Bread. He is ever mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and lendeth, and his Seed is blessed. Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the Land; when the Wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. I have seen the Wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay-tree; Yet he passeth away, and lo, he was gone: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. Mark the perfect man, and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for the end of that man is peace. The Salvation of the Righteous is of the Lord, he is their strength in the time of trouble. And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them from the Wicked, and save them, because they put their trust in him. 37.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40. For in thee O Lord do I hope thou wilt hear, O Lord my God, 38.15. I said, I will take heed to my ways that I offend not with my Tongue: I will keep my mouth with a Bridle, while the Wicked is before me. Behold, thou hast made my daies as an hand breath, and my daies are as nothing before thee: verily, every man at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29952:11"/>
his best state is altogether vanity, <hi>Selah.</hi> When thou with rebuke doth chasten man for Sin, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth fretting a Garment, surely every man is vanity, <hi>Selah.</hi> 39.1, 5, 11. Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his Trust: and respecteth not the proud, nor such as go about with lies, 40.4. The Lord will preserve him and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the Earth, and thou wilt not deliver him to the will of his Enemies, 41.2. As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, so panteth my soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, O my God. Why art thou cast down O my Soul, and why art thou so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted within me? hope thou in God, for I will yet praise him, for the light of his countenance, 42.5. God is my refuge and my strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will I not fear, though the Earth be moved, and the Mountains be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midst of the Sea, 46.1, 2. For the Lord most high is terrible, he is a great King over all the Earth, 47.2. Hear this all ye People, give ear all ye Inhabitants of the Earth, 49.1. The mighty God, even the Lord hath spoken, and called the Earth from the rising of the Sun unto the going down of the same. For every Beast of the Forest is mine, and the Cattel upon a

thousand Hills. I know all the Fowls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mountains, and the wild Beasts of the Fields are mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the World is mine, and the fulness thereof. Call upon me in time of trouble, I will hear thee, and thou shalt glorifie me. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit, 50.10, 11, 12, 15, 19. Thy Tongue deviseth mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, like a sharp Rasor; thou lovest evil, more than good; and Lying rather than to speak Righteousness, <hi>Selah.</hi> But I am like a green Olive-tree in the House of my God. I trust in the mercy of God, for ever and ever, 52.2, 3, 8. It was thou mine own familiar Friend, my guide, and my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that hath done me this disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Cast thy burthen upon the Lord and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the Righteous to be moved. But thou, O Lord, shalt bring them down into the pit of Destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their daies, but I will trust in thee O Lord, 55.13, 22, 23. In God I will praise his Word, in God I have put my trust, I will not fear what flesh can do unto me. Cast thy burthen upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the Righteous to be moved. But, O Lord, thou shalt bring
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29952:12"/>
them to the pit of Destruction: bloody and deceitful men, shall not live out half their daies, but I will trust in thee. In God will I praise his Word, in God I have put my Trust, I will not fear what Flesh can do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. When I cry unto thee, then shall mine Enemies turn their Back: this I know, for God is for me, in God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid what man can do unto me, 56.4, 9, 11. Truly my Soul waiteth upon God, for of him cometh my Salvation. He only is my Rock and my Salvation: he is my defence, so that I shall not greatly be moved. Trust not in oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in Robbery: if Riches encrease, set not your heart upon them. God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this, that power belongeth unto God. Also unto thee O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest to every man according to his Works, 62.1, 2, 10, 11, 12. He Ruleth by his Power for ever, his eyes behold the Nations: let not the rebellious exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>Selah.</hi> O bless our God, ye People, and make the voice of his praise to be heard. For thou, O God, hast proved, thou hast tryed us, even as Silver is tryed. Sing forth the honour of his Name, make his praise glorious, 66.2, 7, 8, 10. He is a Father of the Fatherless, and Judge of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29952:13"/>
God is in his holy Habitation. He that is our God, is the God of our Salvation: and unto God, belongeth the issues from Death, 68.5, 20. The humble shall see this and be glad, and your Soul shall live that seek God. For the Lord heareth the poor, and despiseth not his Prisoners, 69.32, 33. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the Souls of the needy. He shall redeem their Souls from deceit and violence, and precious shall their Blood be in his sight, 72.13, 14. The Prosperity of the Wicked; they are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued like other Men, therefore pride compasseth them about as a Chain, violence covereth them as a Garment. Their Eyes stand out with fatness, they have more than heart can wish. My Flesh and my Heart faileth, but God is the strength of my Heart, and my portion for ever. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places, thou castest them down into Destruction. How are they brought into Desolation, as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrours. But it is good for me to draw neer unto God, I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy works, 37.6, 18, 19, 26, 28. All the horns of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will I cut off, but the horns of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy? <hi>Selah.</hi> 77.8, 9. Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so fire was kindled against <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his anger also came up against <hi>Israel.</hi> Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his Salvation. Give ear O my people, to my Laws, incline your Ears to the words of my Mouth. That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the work of God, but to keep his Commandments, 78.1, 7, 21, 22. The Wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of <hi>Israel.</hi> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for all his wondrous Works. But he being full of compassion, forgave all their Iniquities, and destroyed them not; yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his Wrath. For he remembred that they were but flesh, a wind that passed and cometh not again, 78.31, 32, 38, 39. God standeth in the Congregation of the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he judgeth among the Gods. Defend the Poor and Fatherless: do Justice to the Afflicted and Needy. Deliver the Poor and Needy out of the hand of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

82.1, 3, 4. Thou hast forgiven the Iniquity of thy People, thou hast covered all their Sins. Thou hast taken away all thy Wrath: thou hast turned thy self from thy fierce anger. Turn us O God of our Salvation, and cause thine anger to cease from us, 85.2, 3, 4. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good, and our Land shall give her increase, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. For thou O Lord art good, and ready to forgive, and plentious in Mercy unto all them that call upon thee. In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. For great is thy mercy towards me, for thou hast delivered my Soul from the lowest Hell. For thou O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious: long suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and plentious in mercy and truth, 86.5, 7, 13, 15. Thy Wrath lyeth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy Waves and Stormes. But unto thee have I cryed O Lord, in the morning shall my Prayer prevent thee, 88.7, 13. Thou rulest the raging of the Sea, when the Waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. The Heavens are thine, the Earth also is thine: as for the World and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded them. For the Lord is our defence, and the holy One of <hi>Israel</hi> is our King. His Seed also will he make
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29952:14"/>
to endure for ever: and his Throne as the days of Heaven. If his Children forsake my Law, and walk in my Judgments: If they will break my Statutes, and keep not my Commandments: Then will I visit their Transgressions with the Rod, and their Iniquities with stripes. Nevertheless my loving kindness will I not utterly take from him: nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. My Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not fail <hi>David.</hi> His Seed shall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me. How long Lord, wilt thou hide thy self, for ever? shall thy Wrath burn like fire, 89.9, 11, 18, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 46. O satisfie us early with thy mercy, that we may rejoyce, and be glad all our days. Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us: and the year wherein we have seen evil. 90, 14, 15. Only with thine Eyes thou shalt behold, and see the reward of the Wicked. There shall no evil befal thee, neither any Plague come neer thy dwelling. He shall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy Foot against a Stone. He shall call upon me,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29952:15"/>
and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him, and honour him. With long Life will I satisfie him, and shew him my Salvation, 91.8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16. Lord, how long, how long shall the Wicked triumph? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of Man, they are but vain. Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy Law. For the Lord will not cast off his People: neither will he cast off his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. When I said, my Foot slipped, thy mercy O Lord held me up. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my Soul. My Lord is my defence: and my God is the Rock of my refuge, 94.3, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, 22. Come let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker, 95.6. Rejoyce in the Lord, O ye Righteous, and give thanks at the remembrance of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, 97.12. Let them praise thy great and terrible Name, for it is holy, 99.3. I will behave my self wisely, with a perfect heart, O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my House with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart. A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. Whoso privily slandreth his Neighbour, him will I destroy: him that hath a high look,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29952:15"/>
and a proud heart, I will not suffer; my Eyes shall be upon the faithful in the Land, they shall dwell with me. He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall be my Servant. He that worketh deceit, shall not dwell in my House: He that telleth Lies, shall not tarry in my sight I will early destroy all the wicked of the Land, that may cut off all the wicked do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the City of the Lord, 101.2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. For he hath looked down from the height of his Sanctuary, from Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth: To hear the groaning of the Prisoners, to loose those that are appointed to death, 102.19, 20. Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is with me bless his holy Name. Bless the Lord O my Soul and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all their iniquity: who healeth all thy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases. For as the Heaven is above all the Earth, so great is his mercy towards them that fear him. The Lord is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. He will not alway chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever. He hath not dealt with us after our Sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquity. As far as the East is from the West, so far hath he set our Sins from us. Like as the Father pitieth his Children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame, he remembreth we
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29952:16"/>
are dust, 103.1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. As to the Seas thou hast set bounds that they pass not over: that they turn not again to cover the Earth. O Lord, how mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold are thy Works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the Earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide Sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are things creeping innumerable, both small and great Beasts, 104.9, 24, 25. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ye in his holy Name: Let the Heart of them rejoyce that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord and his strength: seek his face ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth. He is the Lord our God, his judgments are in all the world. And confirmed the same unto <hi>Jacob</hi> for a Law, and unto <hi>Israel</hi> for an everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Saying, unto thee will I give the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the lot of your inheritance. He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved Kings for their sakes: Saying, touch not my Anointed, and do my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets no harm. Moreover, he called for a Famine upon the Land: he brake the whole Staff of Bread. He sent a man before them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Joseph,</hi> who was sold for a Servant. Whose feet they hurt with fetters, he was laid in Iron. Until that time the Word came, the Word of the Lord tryed him. The King
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29952:16"/>
came and loosed him: even the Ruler of the People, and let him go free. <hi>Israel</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> sojourned in the Land of <hi>Ham.</hi> He turned their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Bloud, and slew their Fish. Their Land brought forth Frogs in abundance, in the Chamber of their King. He spake, and there came divers sorts of Flies, and Lice in all their Coasts. He opened their Rocks, and the Water gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a River, 105.3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 29, 30, 31, 41. Our Fathers understood not thy wonders in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> neither remembred the great multitude of thy Mercies, but provoked him at the Sea, even at the Red-Sea. He rebuked the Red-sea also, and it was dryed up: so led them through the depths as through the Wilderness. And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them from the hand of the Enemy. The waves covered their Enemies: there was none of them left. And a Fire was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in their company, the flame burnt up the Wicked. Therefore he said he would destroy them, had not <hi>Moses</hi> stood before them in the breach, to turn away his Wrath lest he should destroy them. Yea, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised that pleasant Land, they believed not his Word. But murmured in their Tents,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29952:17"/>
and hearkned not unto the voice of the Lord. Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to over-throw them in the Wilderness. Thus they provoked him to anger, with their inventions, and the Plague barke in upon them. Then stood up <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> and so the Plague ceased. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred him also at the Waters of strife, so that it went ill with <hi>Moses</hi> for their sake. They served their Idols which were a snare unto them. And shed innocent Bloud, even the bloud of their Sons and of their Daughters, whom they Sacrificed unto the Idols of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and the Land was polluted with Bloud. Thus were they defiled with their own Works, and went a Whoring with their own inventions. Therefore was the Wrath of God kindled against his People, insomuch that he abhorred his own Inheritance. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry. And he remembred them for his Covenant, and repented him according to the multitude of his Mercies. He made them also to be pitied of them that carryed them away Captive, 106.7, 9, 10, 18, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 32, 36, 38, 39, 44, 45, 46. Blessed are they that keep Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he that doth Righteousness at all times, 106.3. They hunger and thirst, their Soul fainteth in them. Then they cryed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29952:17"/>
unto the Lord in their trouble, and he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them out of their distresses. O that Man would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men. For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness. Then they cryed unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distress. Fools, because of their Transgressions, and because of their Iniquities are afflicted. And a fruitful Land is turned into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein. He turneth the Wilderness into a standing Water, and dry ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water-springs. The Righteous shall see it and rejoyce, and all Iniquity shall stop her mouth. Whoso is wise, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve those things, shall understand the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindness of the Lord, 107.5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 33, 35, 42, 43.</p>
            <p>For thy Mercy is greater than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and thy Truth reacheth unto the Clouds. O help us against the Enemy, for vain is the help of Man. Through God we shall do great Acts, for vain is the help of Man, 108.4, 12.13. I will give thanks unto the Lord, with my whole heart se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly among the Faithful, and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. His work is worthy to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and in honour, and his Righteousness
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29952:18"/>
endureth for ever. The merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord hath so done his marvelous works, that they ought to be had in remembrance. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom, a good understanding have all they that do his Commandments; his praise endureth for ever, 111.1, 3, 4, 10. Blessed is the Man that feareth the Lord, he hath great delight in his Commandments. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and plenteousness shall be in his House, and his Righteousness endureth for ever. Unto the godly there ariseth Light in the Darkness, he is Merciful, Loving, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: A good man is merciful and lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and will guide his Words with discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will not be afraid of any evil tyding. His heart standeth fast, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Lord. His heart is Established, and will not shrink, until he seeth his desire upon his Enemies. He hath dispersed and given to the Poor, and his Righteousness remaineth for ever. His Horn shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted with Honour, 121.1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. He maketh the Barren Woman to keep house, and to be a joyful Mother of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 113.8 <hi>vers.</hi>

            <p>Tremble thou Earth at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> 114.7. As for our God he is in Heaven, he hath done whatsoever pleased him, but thou

House of <hi>Israel,</hi> put thou thy trust in the Lord, he is their helper and defence; ye that fear the Lord, he is their helper and defender, he shall preserve them that fear the Lord, both small and great, 115.3, 9, 11, 13. The Lord hath enclined his Ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. I shall find trouble and heaviness, and I shall call upon the Name of the Lord. O Lord I beseech thee deliver my Soul. Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the Lord and righteous; yea, our God is merciful; the Lord preserveth the simple; I was in misery, and he helped me; I will offer unto thee the sacrifice of Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and call upon the Name of the Lord, 116.4, 5, 6, 15. It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put any confidence in Man: it is better to trust in the Lord, than to put any confidence in Princes; the Lord is on my side, I will not fear what Man can do unto me; thou art my God, I will praise thee; thou art my God, I will thank thee, O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious, and his Mercy endureth for ever, 118.6, 8, 9, 28, 29. thou hast charged that we should diligently keep thy Commandements; wherewithal shall a young Man cleanse his way, even by ruling himself after thy word; teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes, and I shall keep it unto the end; O give me

understanding, and I shall keep thy Law; yea, I shall keep it with my whole heart; O turn away my eyes, lest they behold vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and quicken thou me in thy way; O establish thy word in thy Servant, that I may fear thee; O think upon thy Servant as concerning thy word, wherein thou hast caused me to put my trust; the same is my comfort in my trouble; for thy word hath quickned me: O Lord thou hast dealt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously according to thy word; before I was troubled I went wrong; but now I have kept thy word, thou art good and gracious; O teach me thy Statutes: O let my heart be sound in thy Statutes that I be not ashamed; quicken me after thy loving kindness, and so shall I keep the Testimonies of thy mouth: O how sweet are thy words unto my Taste, yea sweeter than Honey unto my Mouth; through thy Commandments I get understanding, therefore I hate all wicked ways; let the free-will offerings of my mouth please thee; O Lord, teach me thy Judgements: O establish me according to thy word that I may live, and let me not be disappointed of my hope; hold thou me up, and I shall be safe; yea my delight shall ever be in thy Statutes; O deal with thy Servant according to thy loving Mercy, and teach me thy Statutes; order my steps

The Lord is loving unto every Man, and his mercy is over all his works; great is the Lord and marvellous, worthy to be praised; there is no end of his greatness; the Lord upholdeth all such as fall, and lifteth up all those that be down; the eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord, and thou givest them Meat in due season; thou openest thine hand, and fillest all things living with plenteousness; the Lord is Righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works; the Lord is nigh unto all that call upon him; yea, all such as call upon him faithfully; he will fulfill the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of them that fear him; he also will hear them, and will help them, 145.3, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. O praise the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praise unto our God; yea, a joyful and a pleasant thing it is to be thankful; he healeth those that are broken in heart, and giveth Medicine to heal their sickness; he telleth the number of the Stars,

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29952:40"/>
suffering, and of great goodness; thou art not alwaies chiding, neither keepest thou thine anger for ever; thou dost not deal with me after my sins, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest thou me according to my wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for look how high the Heaven is in comparison of the Earth, so far hast thou set my sins from thee; yea, like as a Father pitieth his own Children, even so the Lord is merciful to them that fear him; for he knoweth whereof we be made; he remembreth we are but dust, and the merciful goodness of the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever, and ever, to them that fear him, and his Righteousness to his Childrens Children, even upon such as keep his Covenant, and think upon his Commandments, to do them. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, he hath great delight in his Commandments, his seed shall be mighty upon earth; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the faithful shall be blessed; riches and plentiousness shall be in his house, his Righteousness endureth for ever. Unto the godly there riseth up light in the darkness; he is merciful, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and righteous. A good man is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and lendeth, and will guide his words with discretion, for he shall never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the righteous shall be had in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29952:40"/>
everlasting remembrance; for he will not be afraid of any evil tydings, for his heart standeth fast, and is stablished in the Lord, and will not shrink, until he seeth his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire upon his enemies; therefore not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but give the praise unto thy Name, for thy loving mercy, for thy Truth sake; as for our God, he is in Heaven, he hath done what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever pleased him. Gracious is the Lord, and righteous, yea our God is merciful. O blessed Jesu, who didst descend from Heaven into the womb of the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, like Rain into a fleece of wooll; thou that punishest the wrong doer, and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the Children of the poor, and them that have no helper, have mercy upon thy Church, be pleased by her Ministry to extend thy blessing upon thy domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, from the one Sea to the other, even to the worlds end, that all the Kings of the earth may fall down before thee, and all Nations may do thee service. Make thy righteous people to flourish, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due their enemies under them; deliver them from falshood and wrong, that they may be blessed with abundance of grace, and be satisfied with thy righteousness and salvation, through thy mercies, O blessed Saviour and Redemer Jesu. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>O Thou Almighty Goodness, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Fatherless, the portion of the poor, and protector of strangers, cast thy gracious eyes upon a miserable sinner, who with humility implores thy mercy. When I look on my self, I dare scarce be so bold as to lift up mine eyes unto thee. When I think in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I am, and what I have done, it so confounds me, that I can hardly think of any thing else; it is the greatness of my misery alone, that constrains me to the presumption of prostrating my self at thy feet; the weight of which presseth me so much, that it hath left me no more power than to expose my self before thee, as an admirer of thy wondrous charity. O my sins are wondrous great, in which all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort forsakes my soul. O thy terrours have consumed me, how dreadful are they!

by the heat of thy displeasure; may I not now beg one drop of comfort from thee? O my God, my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a barren and dry ground. I remember thy loving kindness of old time; I can but wish at least to see thy power and thy glory, as I have known thee in thy Sanctuary. There is none in Heaven that I desire but thee, nor on Earth besides thee. My soul followeth hard after thee, O when wilt thou come unto me? O hide not thy face from thy servant, lest I come to misery. Hear me speedily, for I am poor and needy. Make haste unto me, O my God, thou art my helper and deliverer. O Lord, make no long tarrying, I am come a great way from my friends and kindred, and here is none to pity me. O my God, be not thou far from me. Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it. I am poor and sorrowful, let thy salvation set me up on high, for thou who searchest the heart, knowest that I set my heart only to seek thee. I desire to leave all the world, that I may find my happiness only in thee. O heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with my whole heart I desire to do thy blessed will in all things; yea thus far I acknowledge thou hast most gratefully

conducted me. Hitherto I have been highly favoured, and wonderfully helped and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by thee, and wilt thou now at last abandon me, who desire at last to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all things else for thy sake. Hast thou called me from mine own Country, and from my Fathers house, and now to be forsaken by thee? O my God, give me leave to plead for a soul that I thought was once dear unto thee: Pity, O pity an heart which thou hast made too great for all the world, and cannot be satisfied with less than thee: Canst thou see it die for want of one smile from thee? yea, canst thou let it die of love to thee, for that hath brought me thus far to seek thee, and wilt thou suffer it to die at thy feet? canst thou endure to behold it in thine arms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it now throws it self with all the force it hath? shall it miscarry full of prayers and longings after thee? shall it expire in cries and tears when it calls for mercy? O where are thy bowels? what is become of thine ancient loving kindness? are they all forfeited by one offence against thee? O my God, I cannot think so hardly of thee; I begin to live, methinks, because thou permittest these addresses to thee; it inspires me with some hopes to find these
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:29952:66"/>
holy breathings in me; it rejoyces me much that I feel thee drawing my very heart after thee; O take it, I beseech thee, take it quite away from me, unto thy self, shape it after thine own heart; make it such as thou canst embrace it; create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and uphold me with thy free spirit, and all this for Jesus Christ his sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>O Lord Jesus Christ, our health and our salvation, our life, our hope, and our resurrection from the dead, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign my self up to thy holy will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, either to life, that I may live longer to thy service, and my amendment, or to death, to the perpetual enjoyment of thy presence, and of thy glory, into thy hands I commend my spirit, for I know, O Lord, that nothing can perish which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thy mercy: I believe, help thou my unbelief. I believe, O Lord, that I shall receive my body again at the resurrection of the Just: I relinquish all care of that, only I beg of thee mercy for my soul; strengthen it with thy grace against all temptation; let thy loving kindness de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it as with a shield against all violence and hostile assaults of Satan; let the same mercy be my guard and defence, which protected thy Martyrs, crowning them with victory in the midst of flames, horrid torments, and most cruel deaths. There is no help in me, O Lord; I cannot by my own strength or power give a minutes rest
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:29952:81"/>
to my wearied body, but my trust is in thy mercies, and I call to mind, to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable comfort, that thou wert hungry, and thirsty, and wearied, and whipt, and crowned with thorns, and mocked, and crucified for me; O let that mercy of thine which made thee suffer so much, pardon me, and save me; let thy merits answer for my impieties; let thy Righteousness cover my sins, thy blood wash away my stains, and thy comforts refresh my soul; as my body grows weaker, let thy grace be stronger; let not my faith doubt, nor my hope tremble, nor my charity grow cold, nor my soul be afrighted with the terrours of death, but let the light of thy countenance enlighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death eternal, and when my tongue fails, let thy Spirit teach my heart with strong crying and groans that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable. O let not the enemy do me any violence, but let thy holy mercies, and thy Angels repel and defeat his malice, and find that my soul may by thy strength triumph in the joys of eternity, in the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thee, my life, my joy, my hope, my exceeding great reward, my Lord, and and my Saviour Jesus Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>

already so often trampled these precious things under foot, either carelesly neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or unworthily refusing those holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Mysteries. O Lord, my horrible guiltiness makes me tremble to come, and makes me not dare to keep away; for where, O Lord, shall my polluted soul be washed, if not in this fountain which thou hast opened for sin and for unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? hitherto therefore I come, and thou hast promised, that him that cometh to thee, thou wilt in no wise cast out. This is, O Lord, the Blood of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, grant to me so to receive it, that it may be to me for remission of sins; and though I have so often, and so wickedly broken my part of that Covenant, whereof this Sacrament is a seal, yet be thou gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased to make thine good, to be merciful to my unrighteousness, and to remember my sins and my iniquities no more; and not only so, but to put thy Laws in my heart, and to write them in my mind; and by the power of thy grace dispose my soul to such a sincere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant obedience, that I may never again provoke thee.

Raise up my dull and earthly mind from groveling here below, and inspire it with a holy zeal, that I may with a spiritual affection ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach this spiritual Feast.

I am a sinner, a great one, O let me find this saving efficacy: Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful, for my soul trusteth in thee; and in the clefts of thy wounds shall be my Refuge, until thy Fathers indignation be over past.

Lord, my own heart condemns me, and thou art infinitely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than my heart, and thou knowest all things; the sins I remember fill me with horrour: There are also multitudes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

And to add more terrour, my very countenance, and repentance, I fear, will not abide thy tryal; my frequent relapses heretofore have sufficiently witnessed the insincerity of my heart, and best resolutions; and then, O Lord, what can secure me that my present dislikes of my sins are not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the effects of my amazing danger, than of any real change. And, O Lord, I know thou art not, nor wilt accept of any thing that is not sincere. O Lord, when I consider this, fearfulness and trembling comes upon me, and a horrible dread over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms me; my flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and my heart is wounded within me. But, O Lord, who wills not the death of a sinner, be merciful unto me. One deep calleth upon another, the depth of my misery upon the depth of thy mercy: Lord, save me now, or I perish eternally.

O Lord, one day with thee is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a thousand elsewhere. O let thy mighty Spirit work in me now in this my last day, whatsoever thou seest wanting, to fit me for mercy and acceptation. Give me a perfect and an entire hatred of all my sins, and enable me to present thee with a sacrifice of a broken and a contrite heart, which thou hast promised not to despise, that by this I may be made capable of that atonement, which thy dear Son hath by the more excellent oblation of himself, made for all repenting sinners; he is the Propitiation for our sins; he was wounded for our transgressions; he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisements of our peace was upon him: O heal me by these stripes, and let the cry of his blood cry down the clamour of my sins. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the child of wrath, but he is the Son of thy Love; for his sake spare me, O Lord, spare thy poor creature, whom he hath redeemed with his most precious blood, and be not angry with me for ever.

Hear me, O Lord, hear me, and do not repay me for my former neglects of thy calls, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to answer me in this time of my greatest need. Lord, there's but a step between me and death; but seal my pardon before I go hence and be no more seen: Thy loving-kindness is better than life it self; Oh let me have that in exchange, and I shall most gladly lay down this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life.

I stretch forth my hand unto thee, my soul gaspeth unto thee, as a thirsty land; draw nigh unto my soul and save it. O deliver me, because of mine enemies, for my soul is full of trouble, and my life draweth nigh unto hell. Save me from the Lions mouth: Hear me from among the horns of the Unicorns. O set me upon the Rock that is higher than I, for thou art my hope, and a strong Tower for me against the enemy; Why art thou so heavy, O my soul, and why art thou so disquieted within me? put thy trust in God, for I will yet give him thanks, for the help of his countenance.

O that I had wings like a Dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest. O send out thy Light and thy Truth, that they may lead me, and bring me to thy Hill, and to thy dwelling; for one day in thy Court is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a thousand elsewhere.

               <p>O Most mighty and gracious God, full of incomprehensible Power and Majesty, whose glory the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens is not able to contain; look down from Heaven upon me thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy servant, who here prostrate my self at the footstool of thy Throne of grace, not as I am in my self, but look upon me, O Father, through the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ, thy beloved Son, in whom thou art well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for of my self I am not able to stand in thy presence, or to speak with my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lips to so holy a God as thou art; for thou knowest that in sin I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and born, and that I have lived ever since in iniquity, so that I have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all thy holy Laws and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by sinful motions, unclean thoughts, evil words, and wicked works, omitting many of those duties of piety which thou requirest for thy service, and committing many of those vices which thou under the penalty of thy displeasure hast forbidden; <hi>here thou mayest confess to God thy secret sins, which most burden thy conscience, with
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:29952:112"/>
the circumstances of the time, place, person, and the manner how it is committed, saying, but more especially,</hi> I do here with grief of heart confess unto thee, for these my sins, O Lord, I stand guilty of thy curse, with all the miseries of this life, and the life to come, namely, everlasting torment in Hell fire, when this wretched life is ended. If thou shouldest deal with me according to my deserts; yea Lord, I confess thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which endureth for ever is the cause I have not been long ago consumed and confounded, but with thee, O Lord, there is mercy and plenteous redemption; in the multitude therefore of thy mercies, and confidence in Christs merits, I intreat thy Divine Majesty, that thou wouldest not enter into judgment with thy servant, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be extream to mark what I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done amiss; for if thou dost, then no flesh can be justified in thy sight, nor any living stand in thy presence; but be thou merciful unto me, and wash away all the uncleanness of my sins, in the merits of that precious blood which Jesus Christ hath shed for me; and seeing that he hath born the burden of that curse, which was due for my transgression, O Lord, deliver me from my sins, and from all those Judgments which hang over my head as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:29952:112"/>
due unto me for them, and separate them as far from thy presence, as the East is from the West; bury them in the burial of Christ, that they may never rise up in this world to shame me, nor in the world to come to condemn me. And I beseech thee, O Lord, not only to wash away my sins with the blood of thy Immaculate Lamb, but also to purge my heart by thy Holy Spirit from the dross of my natural corruptions, that I may feel thy Spirit more and more killing my sins in the power and practice thereof, so that I may with more freedom of mind, and liberty of will, serve thee the ever living God, in Righteousness and true Holiness this day, and give me grace, that by the direction and assistance of thy Holy Spirit, I may persevere to be thy faithful and unfeigned servant unto my lifes end, and when this mortal life is ended, I may be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of immortality, and everlasting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in thy heavenly Kingdom. In the mean time, O Lord, whilst it is thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed will and pleasure, that I may continue to spend and end that small number and remnant of my daies, that I may apply my heart to wisdom; and as thou dost add daies to my life, so I beseech thee to add repentance and amendment to my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:29952:113"/>
daies, that as I grow in years, I may grow in grace and favour with thee, and all thy people; and to this end, give unto me a supply of all those graces which thou knowest to be wanting in me, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for me, with an increase of all those good gifts wherewith thou hast already endowed me, that so I may be the better enabled to lead such a godly life, and an honest conversation, as that thy Name may thereby be glorified, others may take good example by me, and my soul may cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully feed on the peace of a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and be more replenished with the Joy of the Holy Ghost: And here, O Lord, according to my bounden duty, I give the most humble and hearty thanks for all those blessings which of thy goodness thou hast bestowed upon me; and namely, for that thou hast of thy free grace and love, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thine eternal purpose, elected me before the foundation of the world was laid, unto salvation, in Jesus Christ: For that thou hast created me in thine own Image, and hast begun to restore that in me which was lost in our First Parents: For that thou hast effectually called me by the working of thy Holy Spirit, in the Preaching of the Gospel, and the Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Sacrament, to the knowledge of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:29952:113"/>
thy saving grace, and obedience to thy blessed Will: For that thou hast bought and redeemed me with the blood of thy only begotten Son, from the torment of Hell, and thraldom of Satan: For that thou hast by Faith in Christ, freely justified me, who am by nature the child of wrath: For that thou hast in good measure justified me by thy Holy Spirit, and given me so large a time to repent, together with the means of Repentance: I thank thee likewise, good Lord, for my life, health, wealth, liberty, food, rayment, peace, prosperity and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for that thou hast preserved me this night from all perils and dangers of soul and body, and hast brought me safe to the beginning of this day; and as thou hast now awakened my body from sleep, so I beseech thee to awaken my body from sin, and carnal security; and as thou hast caused the light of the day to shine in our bodily eyes, so good Lord, cause the light of thy Word, and Holy Spirit, to illuminate my understanding, and give me grace, as one of thy children of light, to walk in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience before thy face this day, and all the daies and time of my whole life, and that I may endeavour to keep faith and a good conscience towards God, and towards all men, in all my thoughts, words and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:29952:114"/>
dealings; and so good Lord bless all stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and actions, which I shall take in hand this day, as that they may tend to thy glory, the good of others, and the comfort of my own soul and conscience in that day, when I shall make my final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest unto thee for them. O my God, keep thy servant, that I do not evil unto any man this day, and let it be thy blessed will, not to suffer the Devil, nor his wicked Angels, nor any of his evil members, or my malicious enemies, to have any power to do me any hurt or harm this day, but let the eyes of thy holy providence watch over me for good and not for evil, and command thy holy Angels to pitch their tents round about me, for my defence and safety in my going out, and my coming in, as thou hast promised they should do about them that fear thy Name; for into thy hands, O Father, I do here commend my soul and body, my actions, and all that ever I have, to be guided and protected by thee, being assured that whatsoever thou takest into thy custody, cannot suffer or take any hurt or harm; and if I at any time, this day, shall through frailty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee, yet Lord, I beseech thee, do thou in mercy remember me: And I pray not alone for my self unto thee, O Father, but I
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:29952:114"/>
beseech thee also be merciful unto thy whole Church, and chosen people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they live upon the face of the whole Earth, defend them from the rage and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Devil, the World, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ; give thy Gospel a free and a joyful passage through the world, for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those who belong to thine Election and Kingdom: Bless the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms wherein we live, with the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of peace and true Religion, and Justice: Defend our gracious King <hi>Charles</hi> from all his enemies, and grant him a long life in health and all happiness to raign over us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bless our gracious Queen <hi>Katherine, James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and all the rest of the Royal Family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> increase in them all heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and spiritual graces which may make them fit for those places for which thou ordainedst them; direct all the Nobility, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Magistrates of this Kingdom and Commonwealth; govern thou them that they may govern the Commons in true Religion, Justice, Obedience, and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Be merciful unto all the people that fear thee, and call upon thy Name; and comfort as many among them as lie sick, or are comfortless in body, or mind; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be favourable to all such as suffer any trouble or persecution for the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

               <p>O Most gracious God and merciful Father, I thine unworthy servant do acknowledge that as I have been born in sin, so I have lived in iniquity, and broken every one of thy commandments, in thought, word and deed, following the desires of my own will, and lusts of my flesh, not caring to be governed by thy holy Word and Spirit; therefore I have justly deserved all shame and misery in this life, and everlasting condemnation in Hell fire; if that thou shouldest but deal with me according to thy Justice, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts. Wherefore, O heavenly Father, I humbly beseech thee, for thy Son Jesus Christ his sake, and for the merits of that bloody death and passion, which I believe he hath suffered for me, that thou wouldest pardon and forgive me all my sins, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the Hell and vengeance which is due unto me for them, and send thy holy Spirit into my heart, which may assure me that thou art my Father, and that I am thy child, and that thou lovest me with an unchangeable love; and let thy good Spirit lead me into all truth, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie

               <p>O most gracious and loving Father, who art about my bed, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est my lying down, and my rising up, and art near unto all that call upon thee in Truth and sincerity, I a wretched sinner do humbly beseech thee to look upon me with the eyes of mercy, and not to behold me, as I am in my self, for then thou shalt see but an unclean and defiled creature, conceived in sin, and living in iniquity, so that I am ashamed to lift up my eyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, knowing how grievously I have sinned against Heaven and before thee; for, O Lord, I have transgressed all thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and Righteous Laws, not through negligence and infirmity, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes through wilful presumption, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my knowledge, and the motions of thy holy Spirit reclaiming me from them, so that I have wounded my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and grieved thy holy Spirit, by whom thou hast sealed me to the day of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Thou hast consecrated my soul and body to be the Temple of the Holy Ghost, I wretched sinner have defiled both, with all manner of pollution and uncleanness;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:29952:117"/>
mine eyes in taking pleasure to behold va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, that I am ashamed to lift up my eyes unto thee; mine ears in hearing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and unclean speeches; my tongue in evil speaking; my hands are so full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, that I am ashamed to lift them up unto thee; and my feet have carried me after mine own waies; my understanding and reasonings, which are so quick in all earthly matters, are only blind and stupid; when I come to meditate or discourse of spiritual and heavenly things, my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which should be a treasury of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is not so apt to remember any thing, as those things that are vile and vain; yea Lord, by woful experience I find that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally all the imaginations of the thoughts of my heart are only evil altogether, and continually; for these my sins are more in number than the hairs of my head, and they have grown over me, like a loathsom leprosie, from the crown of my head, to the soal of my feet; there remains no part which they have not infected; they make me seem vile in mine own eyes, how much more abominable must I appear in thy sight! the custom of sinning hath almost taken away the conscience of sin, and pull'd upon me such dulness of sense, and hardness of heart, that thy judgments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:29952:118"/>
against my sins, by the faithful Preachers of thy Word, do not terrifie me to return unto thee with unfeigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and if thou Lord shouldest but deal with me according to thy Justice, and my deserts, I should utterly be confounded and condemned; but seeing that of thine own mercy thou hast spared me so long, and still waitest for my repentance, I humbly beseech thee for the blood, death and passions sake, which Jesus Christ hath suffered for me, that thou wouldest par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgive me all my sins, and mine offences, and open unto me that ever-streaming fountain of the blood of Christ, which thou hast promised to open under the New Testament, to the penitent of the house of <hi>David,</hi> that all my sins and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness may be so bathed in his blood, buried in his death, and hid in his wounds, that they never more be seen to shame me in this life, nor to condemn me in the world to come, before the judgment seat of God. And for as much, O Lord, as thou knowest that it is not in man to turn his own heart, unless thou first give him grace to convert: And seeing it is as easie with thee to make me righteous and holy, as to suffer me to be such, O my God, give me grace to do what thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:29952:118"/>
then command what thou wilt and thou shalt find me willing to do what thou commandest, and to observe thy blessed Will in all things; to this end give unto me thy Holy Spirit, which thou hast promised to give to the worlds end, unto all thine elect people; and let the same Holy Spirit purge my heart from the dross of my natural corruption; heal my soul and body, that they may become the Temple of the Holy Ghost, to serve thee in Righteousness and true Holiness all the daies of my life, that when by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and assistance of thy Holy Spirit I shall finish my course in this short and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory life, I may cheerfully leave this world, and resign my soul into thy father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hands in assured confidence of enjoying everlasting life with thee in thy heavenly Kingdom, which thou hast prepared for thine Elect Saints who love the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and expect his appearing. In the mean while, O Father, I beseech thee, let thy Holy Spirit work in me such a serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as that I may with tears lament my sins past, with grief of heart be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for my sins present, and with all my endeavours resist the like filthy sins for the time to come, and let the same Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit keep me in the Unity of the Church,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:29952:119"/>
lead me in the Truth of thy Word, and preserve me that I may never swerve from the same to Popery, or any other error or false Worship; and let thy Spirit open mine eyes more and more, to see the wondrous things of thy Law; and open my lips that my mouth may set forth thy praise; increase in me those good gifts with which thou hast already endowed me of thy mercy, and give unto me a penitent spirit, and a chaste heart, a contented mind, pure affections, a wise behaviour, and all other graces which thou seest necessary for me to govern my heart in thy fear, and to guide all my life in thy favour, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I live or die, I may live and die unto thee, who art my God and my Redeemer. And here, O Lord, according as I am bound, I render unto thee, from the Altar of my humblest heart, all possible thanks and praise for all those blessings and benefits which graciously and plentifully thou hast bestowed upon my soul and body, for this life, and that which is to come, namely, for my Election, Creation, Redemption, Justification, Sanctification and Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from my childhood until this present day and hour, and for the firm hope which thou hast given me of my Glorification: Likewise for my Life, Liberty, Food and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:29952:119"/>
Rayment, a competent estate for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this present life, and prosperity; more especially, for that thou hast defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me this day now past from all peril and dangers, both of body and soul, furnishing me with all necessary good things that I stand in need of; and as thou hast ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the day for man to travel in, and the night for him to take his rest; so I beseech thee to sanctifie unto me this nights rest and sleep, that I may be the better disposed to serve thee in all honesty and godliness, and that I may enjoy the same as thy sweet blessing and benefit, that so dull and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a body of mine being refreshed with moderate rest and sleep, I may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enabled to work before thee, doing all such good works as thou hast provided for me; and when it shall please thee by thy divine providence to awaken me the next morning, do thou, O Lord, who art the keeper of <hi>Israel,</hi> who never slumberest nor sleepest, watch over me in thy holy providence, to protect me from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, so that neither the evil Angels of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, nor any wicked enemy may have any power to do me any harm, or evil; and to this end give a charge unto thy holy Angels, that they at thy appointment may pitch their tents round about me for my

defence and safety, as thou hast promised they should do about them that fear thy Name; and knowing that thy Name is a strong Tower of defence unto all those that trust therein, I here recommend my self, and all that belongs unto me unto thy holy protection and custody, if it be thy blessed will to call for me in my sleep. O Lord, for Christ his sake, have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and receive my soul unto thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom; and if it be thy blessed pleasure to add more daies to my life, add more amendment unto my daies, and wean my mind from the love of the world, and the vanity thereof, and cause me more and more to settle my conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Heaven and heavenly things, and perfect daily in me that good work which thou hast begun, to the glory of thy Name, and the salvation of my sinful soul. O Lord, I beseech thee likewise, save and defend from all evil and danger thy whole Church, our gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> and grant him a long and prosperous Raign over us: Bless our gracious Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine, James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and all the Royal Family; endue them with thy grace, and defend them from all evil: Bless the Nobility, Magistrates, and Ministers of these Churches and Kingdoms, each of

               <p>O Lord our God and heavenly Father, who art the only Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of Earth, and all therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we confess that we are unworthy to appear in thy sight and presence, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our manifold sins and offences, which we have committed against Heaven, and before thee: and how that we have been born in sin, and do daily break thy holy Laws and Commandments contrary to our knowledge and consciences; albeit we know thou art our Creator, who hast made us, our Redeemer, who hast bought us with the blood of thy only begotten Son, and our Comforter, who bestowest
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:29952:123"/>
upon us all the good and holy graces which we enjoy in our souls, and in our bodies; and if thou shouldest but deal with us as our wickedness and unthankfulness have deserved, what other thing might we, O Lord, expect from thee, but shame and confusion in this life, and in the world to come wrath and everlasting condemnation; yet, O Lord, in the obedience of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and in the confidence which we have in thy unspeakable and endless mercy in thy Son, and our Saviour Jesus Christ the Righteous, we thy poor ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants appealing from thy Throne of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to thy Throne of Crace, whose mercy reigneth to pardon abounding sin, do from the bottom of our hearts, most humbly beseech thee, to remit and forgive unto us all our sins and our offences, and misdeeds, that by the vertue of the precious blood of Jesus Christ, thy innocent Lamb, which he so abundantly shed upon the Cross, to take away the sins of the world, all our sins, both original and actual, may be so cleansed and washed from us, that they may never be laid to our charge, nor ever have power to rise up in judgment against us; and we beseech thee, good Father, for Christ his death and passion sake, that thou wilt not suffer to fall upon us that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:29952:123"/>
fearful curse and vengeance which thy Law hath threatned, and our sins have justly deserved: And for as much, O Lord, as we are taught by thy Word, that no Idolaters, Adulterers, covetous men, contentious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, drunkards, gluttons, and such inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate livers, shall inherit the Kingdom of God; pour the grace of thy Holy Spirit into our hearts, whereby we may see the filthiness of our sins, and abhor them, and may be more and more stirred up to live in newness of life, and love of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, so we may daily increase in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of thy words, and in conscionable care of keeping thy Commandments. And now, O Lord, I render unto thee most hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thanks, for that thou hast elected, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, called, justified us in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in this life, and given us an assured hope that thou wilt glorifie us in thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, when this mortal life is ended. Likewise we thank thee for our life, health, wealth, liberty, prosperity, and peace; especially, O Lord, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thy holy Gospel amongst us, and for sparing us so long, and granting us so gracious a time of repentance: Also we praise thee for all other thy mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon us; more especially for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving us this night past, and from all
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:29952:124"/>
dangers that might have befallen our souls or bodies; and seeing thou hast now brought us safe to the beginning of this day, we beseech thee protect and direct us in the same: Bless and defend us in our going out and in our coming in, this day, and ever more; shield us, O Lord, from the temptations of the Devil, and grant us the custody of thy holy Angels, to defend and direct us in all our waies; and to this end we recommend our selves, and all those that belong unto us, and are abroad from us, unto thy hands and almighty tuition; Lord defend them from all evil, prosper them with all graces, and fill them with thy goodness: Preserve us likewise this day, from falling into any gross sins, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those whereunto our natures are most prone; set a watch before the door of our lips, that we offend not thy Divine Majesty by any rash or false oaths, or by any leud or lying speeches; give unto us patient minds, pure and chast hearts, and all other graces of thy Spirit, which thou knowest to be needful for us, that we may be the better enabled to serve thee in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and righteousness all the daies of our life; and seeing that all mens labours are in vain, without thy blessing, bless every one of us in our several places and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:29952:124"/>
callings; direct thou the works of our hands upon us, even prosper thou our handy-works; for except thou guide us with thy grace, our endeavours can have no good success; and provide for us all things which thou, O Father, knowest to be needful for every one of us, in our souls and bodies this day, and grant that we may pass through the pilgrimage of this short life, that our hearts being not settled upon any transitory things, which we meet with in the way, our souls may every day be more and more ravished with the love of our home, and thine everlasting Kingdom: Defend likewise, O Lord, thy universal Church, and every particular member thereof; especially we beseech thee to continue the peace and tranquility of these Churches and Kingdoms wherein we live; preserve from all evil and dangers our most gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> endue his Royal heart with more and more grace, wisdom and understanding, and grant that his daies may be long, prosperous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: Bless our gracious Queen <hi>Katherine, James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and all the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, multiply their daies with bliss and felicity, and afterwards crown them with everlasting joy and glory: Bless all our Ministers and Magistrates with all graces
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:29952:125"/>
needful for their places, govern thou them, that they may govern us in peace, godliness, and true Religion; and of thy mercy, O Lord, comfort all our Brethren that are distressed, sick, or comfortless, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those who are afflicted either with an evil conscience, because they have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against thy Word, or for a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, because they will not sin against the Truth; make the first to know that not one drop of the blood of Christ was a drop of vengeance, but all drops of grace, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to procure pardon upon repentance, for the greatest sins of the chiefest sinners in the world; and for the other, let not, O Lord, thy long sufferance, either too much discourage them, or too much incourage their enemies; but grant them patience in suffering, and a gracious and speedy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, which may stand best with thy glory, and their comfort; and give every one of us grace to be alwaies mindful of his last end, and to be alwaies prepared with faith and repentance, as with a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing garment, against the time thou shalt call for us out of this sinful world; and that in the mean while, we may in all things, and above all things, seek thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that when this mortal life is ended, we may then be made partakers of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:29952:125"/>
and Life eternal in thy heavenly Kingdom; these, and all other graces and blessings, which thou, O heavenly Father, seest to be necessary for us, and for thy whole Church, we humbly beg and crave at thy hands, concluding this our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect prayer, in that most perfect form of prayer which Christ himself hath taught us, saying, <hi>Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>O Eternal God, and most merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we thine unworthy servants here assembled, do cast down our selves at the foosttool of thy grace, acknowledging our selves that we inherit our Fathers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in thought, word and deed, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing thy holy Commandments, so that in us naturally, there dwelleth nothing that is good; for our hearts are full of secret pride, anger, impatience, dissembling, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lust, vanity, prophaneness, distrust, too much love of our selves, too little love of thee, and thy Kingdom, but full of enmity, and void of love, patience, and every spiritual grace; if thou therefore
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:29952:126"/>
shouldest enter into judgment with us, and search out our natural corruptions, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all the cursed fruit and effects that we have derived from thence, Satan might justly challenge us for his own, and we could not expect any from thy Majesty, but thy wrath, and our condemnation, which we have long ago deserved: But, good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for Jesus Christ his sake, who is thy dear Son, in whom only thou art well pleased, and for the merits of that bitter death and passion, which we believe he hath suffered for us, have mercy upon us, and free us from the shame and confusion which is due unto us for them, that they may never seize upon us to our confusion in this life, or to condemnation in the world which is to come: And for as much as thou hast created us, to serve thee, as all other creatures to serve us, so we humbly beseech thee inspire thy Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into our hearts, that by his illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effectual working we may have the inward sight and feeling of our sins, and natural corruptions; and that we may not be blinded in them through custom, as the Reprobate are, but that we may more and more loath them, and be heartily grieved for them, endeavouring by the use of all good means to overcome them, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:29952:126"/>
get out of them. O let us feel the power of Christ's death killing sin in our mortal bodies, and the vertue of his Resurrection, raising up our souls to newness of life; convert our hearts, subdue our affections, regenerate our minds, purifie our natures, and suffer us not to be drowned in the streams of those filthy vices, and sinful pleasures, wherewith thousands are carried headlong to eternal destruction, but daily frame us more and more to the likeness of thy Son Jesus Christ, that in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and true Holiness we may so serve and glorifie thee, that living in thy fear, and dying in thy favour, we may in thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, attain to the blessed Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Just unto eternal life; in the mean while, O Lord, increase our faith in the sweet promises of the Gospel, and our repentance from dead works, the assurance of our hopes in thy promises, our fear of thy Name, the hatred of all our sins, and our love unto thy children, especially whom we see to stand in need of our help and comfort, that so by the fruit of piety, and a righteous life, we may be assured that thy Holy Spirit doth dwell in us, and that we are thy children by grace and adoption; and grant us, good Father, the continuance of health, peace and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

and all other outward good things, so far forth as thy Divine Wisdom shall think meet to be requisite and necessary for every one. And here, O Lord, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our bounden duty, we confess that thou hast been exceeding merciful unto us all in things of this life, but infinitely more merciful in the things of a better life; therefore we do here from our very souls, render unto thee most humble and hearty thanks from our very souls, for all thy blessings and benefits bestowed upon our souls and our bodies, acknowledging thee to be that Father of Light from whom we have received all those good and perfect gifts, and unto thee alone for them we ascribe to be due, all glory, honour, might, majesty and praise, both now and for ever more: But more especially we praise thy Divine Majesty, for that thou hast defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us this day past from all perils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, so that none of those Judgments which our sins have deserved have fallen upon any one of us. Good Lord, forgive us the sins which this day we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against thy Divine Majesty, or our Brethren, and for Christ his sake, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto us for them; and we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech thee likewise of thine infinite goodness, to defend and protect us this

night, and all that belong unto us, from all perils and dangers of fire, robbery, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of evil Angels, or any other fear, which for our sins might justly have fallen upon us, and that we may be safe under the shadow of thy wings; and to this end and purpose we here recommend our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and souls, and all that we have unto thine Almighty Protection; Lord bless and defend both us and them from all evil; whilst we sleep, do thou, O Father, who never slumberest nor sleepest, watch over thy children, and give a charge to thy holy Angels to pitch their tents round about our houses and dwellings this night, to guard us from all dangers, that sleeping with thee, we may the next morning be awakened by thee, and so being refreshed with moderate sleep, we may be the fitter to set forth thy glory in the conscionable duties of our callings; and we beseech thee, O Lord, to be merciful likewise to thy whole Church, and to continue the tranquility of these Kingdoms wherein we live, turning from us those plagues which the crying sins of this Nation do cry aloud for. O Lord, preserve the principal mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof, our most gracious King <hi>Charles,</hi> endue his Royal heart with grace, wisdom and understanding, and grant that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:29952:128"/>
his daies may be many, prosperous, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and happy; cloath his enemies with shame, but upon his head let his Crown flourish: Bless our gracious Queen <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine, James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the rest of the Royal Family, endow them with thy grace, and defend them from all evil: Bless all our Magistrates and Ministers with all those graces and gifts necessary for their places; govern thou them, that they may govern us in peace, godliness, and true Religion: Bless all that fear thee, and call upon thy Name; all our Christian Brethren and Sisters, that suffer sickness, or any other affliction, or misery, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those who do any where suffer perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for the testimony of thy holy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grant them patience to bear thy Cross, and deliverance when, and which way it shall seem best to thy Divine Wisdom; and Lord, suffer us never to forget our last end, and those reckonings which then we must render unto thee; in health and prosperity make us mindful of sickness, and of the evil day that is behind, that these things may not overtake us as a snare, but that we may in some good measure, like wise Virgins, be found prepared for the coming of Christ, the sweet Bridegroom of our souls. And now, O Lord, most holy and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:29952:128"/>
just, we confess there is no cause why thou who art so much displeased with sin, shouldest hear the prayers of sinners, but for his sake who suffered for sin, and sinned not, in the only mediation therefore of thine eternal Son Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour, we humbly beg these and all other graces which thou knowest to be needful for us and for thy whole Church, shutting up these our imperfect requests in that most holy prayer which Christ himself hath taught us to say unto thee, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

I know, O Lord, and tremble to think, that three parts of the good seed falls upon bad ground; O let

Open likewise, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, O Lord, the door of utterance unto thy faithful servant, whom thou hast sent unto us to open our eyes, that we may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that we may receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them which are sanctified by Faith in Christ; and give me grace to submit my self to his Ministry, as well when he terrifieth me with judgments, as when he comforteth me with thy mercies; and that I may have him in a singular love

In the multitude of the mercies and merits of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ my Saviour, I beseech thee, O Lord, who despisest not the sighing of a contrite heart, nor desirest the death of a penitent sinner, to pardon and forgive unto me all these my sins, and all the errours of that day, and of my whole life, and free my soul from that curse and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is due unto me for them. Thou that didst justifie the contrite Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can for four words of confession, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivedst the prodigal Child when he had spent all the stock of grace, into favour, upon his repentance, pardon all my sins

               <p>O Eternal Son of Righteousness, who camest from the bosom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to enlighten the darkness of the world, I praise thy Name that thou hast preserved me from the danger of this night, and hast continued to me still the opportunities of serving thee, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing my hopes of a blessed eternity, let thy mercies shine brightly upon me, and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the clouds and darknesses of my spirit and understanding; rectifie my affections, and purifie my will, and all my actions, that whatsoever I shall do or suffer this day, or in my whole life, my words and purposes, my thoughts, and all my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may be sanctified, and be acceptable to thy Divine Majesty. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>O Powerful and Eternal God, to whom nothing is so great that it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, or so small that it is contemned, look upon my miseries with the eye of mercy, and let thy infinite power vouchsafe to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit out some proportion of deliverance unto me, as to thee shall seem most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; let not injury O Lord, triumph over me, and let my falls by thy hand be corrected; and make not my unjust ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the Ministers of thy Justice; but yet my God, if in thy wisdom this be the aptest castisement for my inexcusable transgressions; if this ungrateful bondage be fittest for my over high desires; if the pride of my not enough humble heart be to be thus broken, O Lord, I yield to thy Will, chearfully embracing what sorrow thou wilt have me suffer; only thus much let me crave of thee: Let my craving, O Lord, be acceptable unto thee, since it even proceeds from thee, that by good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is thy self, thou will suffer some beam of thy Majesty so to shine in my heart, that I, who acknowledge it my
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:29952:145"/>
noblest title to be thy creature, may still in my greatest affliction depend confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on thee; let calamity be the exercise, but not the overthrow of my vertue: O let not their prevailing power be to my destruction; and if it be thy will that they more and more vex me with punishment, yet, O Lord, never let their wickedness have such a hand, but that I may still carry a pure mind, and a stedfast resolution ever to serve thee without fear or presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet with that humble confidence which may best please thee; so that at the last I may come to thy eternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, through the merits of thy Son our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>O Merciful Father, who art the Lord and giver of life, to whom belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the issues of death, we thy children here assembled, do acknowledge that in respect of our manifold sins, we are not worthy to ask any blessing for our selves at thy hands, much less to become suiters to thy Divine Majesty in the behalf of others, yet because thou hast promised, that the prayers of the righteous shall avail much with thee, in the obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thy commandment, and in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thy gracious promise, we are bold to become humble suiters to thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty in the behalf of this our dear Brother or Sister, whom thou hast visited with the chastisement of thy own fatherly hand, we could gladly wish the restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his health, and a longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his life, and Christian-fellowship amongst us; but for as much as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as far as we can discern that thou hast appointed by this visitation to call for him out of this mortal life, we submit
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:29952:146"/>
our wills to thy blessed will, and humbly entreat thee, for Jesus Christ his sake, and the merits of his bitter death and passion which he hath suffered for him, that thou wouldest pardon and forgive unto him all his sins, as well that wherein he was conceived and born, as also the offences and transgressions which ever since to this day and hour he hath committed, in thought, word and deed, against thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty; cast them behind thy back; remove them as far from thy presence as the East is from the West; blot them out of the book of thy remembrance; lay them not to his charge; wash them away with the blood of Christ, that they may never be more seen; and deliver him from all the Judgments which are due unto him for all his sins, that they may never trouble his conscience, nor rise in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against his soul; and impute unto him the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, whereby he may appear righteous in thy sight; and in his extremity at this time we beseech thee look down from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with those eyes of grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, wherewith thou art wont to look upon thy children in their affliction and misery; pity thy wounded servant, like

the good <hi>Samaritan</hi>; for here is a sick soul that needeth the help of such a heavenly Physician, O Lord, increase his faith, that he may believe that Christ died for him, and that his blood cleanseth all his sins; and either asswage his pain, or else in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his patience, to endure thy blessed will and pleasure in all things: And good Lord, lay no more upon him than thou wilt enable him to bear: heave him up unto thy self with those sighs and groans that cannot be expressed; make him now to see what is the hope of his calling, and what is the exceeding greatness of thy mercy and power towards them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in thee; and in his weakness, O Lord, shew thou thy strength; defend him against the suggestions and temptations of the Devil, who as in all his life-time, will now in his weakness seek to assail him, and to devour him; oh save his soul, and reprove Satan, and command thy holy Angels to be about him, and aid him; and chase away all evil and malignant spirits far from him; make him more and more to loath the world, and desire to be loosed, and to be with Christ; and when that good hour and time shall come, wherein thou hast determined to call for him out
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:29952:147"/>
of this present life; give him grace peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and joyfully to yield up his soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy merciful hands, and do thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him unto thy mercy, and let thy blessed Angels carry him into thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; make his last hour his best hour, his last words his best words, his last thoughts his best thoughts, and when the sight of his eyes is gone, and his tongue shall fail to do his office, grant O Lord, that his soul with <hi>Stephen</hi> may behold Jesus Christ in Heaven ready to receive him; and that thy Spirit within him may make requests for him with sighs that cannot be expressed. Teach us in him to read and see our own ends and mortality, and therefore to be careful to prepare our selves for our last end, and put our selves in readiness against the time that thou shalt call for us in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Thus, O Lord, we recommend this our dear Brother (or Sister) thy sick ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, unto thy eternal grace and mercy in that prayer which Christ our Saviour hath taught us, saying, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>O Most merciful Father, though my sins are many and grievous, that I may rather expect the effects of thine anger, than so great a deliverance as to deliver me from my present great danger, yet, O Lord, since thy mercies are over all thy works, and thou never failest to relieve all those who with humble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned repentance come to thee for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, it were to multiply, not to diminish my transgressions, to dispair of thy heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favours; wherefore I humbly desire thy Divine Majesty, that thou wilt not only forgive all my sins, but also free me out of the hand of mine enemies, and protect me from the malice of my cruel adversary; but if thy wrath, and my hainous sins and offences will not otherwise be satisfied, than by suffering me to fall under my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent afflictions, thy will be done; yet with humble importunity I do, and shall never

leave to implore the assistance of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirit, that my cause, as I am thy distressed servant, may not suffer through my weakness, or want of courage. O Lord, so strengthen and enlighten all the faculties of my mind, that with clearness I may shew forth, and manfully endure this bloody tryal, that so my sufferings may not only glorifie thee, but likewise be a furtherance to my salvation hereafter; grant this, O heavenly Father, for his sake who suffered for me, even Jesus Christ the Righteous. <hi>Amen.</hi>
