            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Servant of the Lord, and a Priſoner for the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Jeſus, whom he hath called by his grace to deny the world, and am made partaker of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, being in outward bonds (by the deceit) in <hi>Weſt-Cheſter,</hi> and of his free-will hath given me not only to beleeve, but to ſuffer for his Name ſake, who hath called me out of my own Country, and from my fathers houſe, and to go in obedience to his Command whitherſoever he ſhall call me: while I was young I girded my ſelf, and went whither I would, and then I yielded obedience to my own will and to the will of man, and was a man-pleaſer, but the Will of God I knew not, neither was obedient to his Commands; but when the Lord was pleaſed to reveal his Son in me, and

make known his Will unto me, to enlighten me with his true Light which hath enlightened every one that cometh into the world, and by it let me ſee my ſelf to be a ſtrrnger to him, and knew him not, though I was grown mighty in the <hi>Egyptians</hi> wiſdom, and was in love with the world, and in the favour of men, and in a profeſſion and words of mans wiſdom exceeded others, being in a form of godlineſs, but was ignorant of his Power and his Word; but when his Power was made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and his Word ſpoken within me, which Word was in my heart, and was as a fire or a hammer, and this Word being made manifeſt within me, and my Conſcience being awakened by the light of God, which did convince me of ſin, and did teſtifie againſt all my words and actions, and that juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God were revealed from Heaven againſt that nature I lived in, and the Trumpet of the Lord was ſounded within me, and the Earth did tremble, and the vials of the wrath of the Almighty was poured down upon me, and the powers of the Earth were terribly ſhaken, the foundation of wiſdom and earthly knowledg was ſhaken, and the Judgments of God were upon the outward man till my fleſh was waſted off my bones, and the bones ſmote one againſt another, and I knew the Lord to be terrible, and his Word powerful, in burning up and hammering down the luſtful nature I lived in, in pleaſure and wantonneſs, in pride and fulneſs, which the Word of the Lord was declared againſt, and this Word I witneſs ſpoken from the Lords own Power within me, which made my fleſh and bones to tremble exceedingly, and did cauſe pain in all my loyns, and paleneſs of face, my comlineſs was turned into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and my joy into lamentation, and I was brought to the bed of ſorrows, where I cryed out in the bitterneſs of my ſpirit, and I had no eaſe nor reſt, day nor night, for the hearing of the ear which I did hear, and the ſight of mine eyes which I did ſee; I heard the ſound of the Trumpet, the Alarum of War within me, terrors, wo, miſery and deſtruction was upon me, in my trouble I cryed in the evening would God it were morning, and in the morning would God it were evening; and the terrors of the Almighty being upon me, my Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
