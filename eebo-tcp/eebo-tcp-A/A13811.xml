            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

or other thynges for to wrytte in. The ymages be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> symylytudes of the thynges that we wyll retayne in mynde. Than I wyl fyrst p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare my carde wherin we may colloke &amp; ordre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ymages in places. And for the foundacion of this fyrst co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon I wyll put foure rules. <hi>THE</hi> fyrste is this. The places are the wyndowes set in walles, pyllers, &amp; anglets, with other lyke. <hi>THE</hi> .ii. rule is. The places ought nat to be to nere togyther nor to fare a so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For the nerenesse trouble great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the naturall memory, by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posytion of thynges for yf y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places were to fare dystaunt. We wyl re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyte with a lytel leaser the thynges that shalbe gyuen to places, where by they shalbe of meane dystaunce. And that shalbe done whan one is. vi. fote fro y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. <hi>THE</hi> .iii. rule is suche. But it is vayne as me se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.
<pb facs="tcp:7751:5"/>
For it is the opynyon of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers that the places ought nat to be made where as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do haunt, as in churche and comyn places. For it suffyseth to haue sene church va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caunt wher as people walke nat al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way and in that hath ben taught y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary experyence. Whiche is the mayster of those thynges. <hi>THE</hi> .iiii. rule is thꝭ. That the places be nat to hye. For I wyl that the men set for the ymages or in the steade of ymages may touch the places, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche I haue iudged as behoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. I take than the churche great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly knowen by me, the partyes wher of I do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>syder, and go into it wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge it .iii. or .iiii. tymes, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> retourne home to my house, &amp; there I tourne in my thought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre the thynges by me sene. And in that maner I gyue the begynnyng of the worke to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ryght

syde of the gate fro the whiche men go in the ryght pathe or yle to the hygh auter ther I fyx and ordayne the fyrst place, and the seconde on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walle next it a .v. or .vi. fote of. And yf there be any notable thynge set, as a pyler in the wyndowe, or other lyke, there put the place. And yf the notable thyng be nat there, or lacke I feyn that in my ymagynation or at myne arbytre ymagynary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some forgynge these placꝭ wolde leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fearynge that he shulde put in forgetfulnes. The thynge opposyd to that is taken &amp; suffred, so that he be myndfull to haue constytued and ordeyned the place. And so to be ꝓceded fro place to place tyl y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fabrycant of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces retourne to the same gate. And these thynges to be done on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrste walle of the churche, al thyngs lest that be in the myds therof. And yf

any desyre to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the places entre by ordre in to a mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nastery, and fyll it ful all of places or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare the places on the walles without the churche. And he that wylbe reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred of many thynges, must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare many placꝭ. But bicau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue wylled to surmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all the men of Itally by habundau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thynges and holy scryptures, in Canone lawe and Cyuyl, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authoritees of many thynges, whyle that I was but yonge ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescent I haue prepared a C. M. places. And now I haue added to them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other .x.

a wayfarer. I may frely say that I bere with me all my thynges, and yet I ceas nat to edyfy. I do you to wyte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the places in any churche or mynster is sene onely for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose &amp; marke the thigꝭ which must be recyted euery day as be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, reasons, hystoryes, fables and predicacions made in Lenten. And let this offyce be deputed to these places onely. And I haue set &amp; declared at the ende for these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a thynge that shalbe Iudged necessary and vtile. For I wyl that the yonge infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts shalbe couyetous herof by my ryght docume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ensyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the places so constytuted &amp; put in ordre, by ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repetynge, thre or foure tymes in a moneth. For the repeticion of placꝭ can nat be praysed in any maner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7751:8"/>THe seconde conclusyon shalbe that whan any hath the carde or scroll I wyll shewe the maner to wryt in the same, as I was some tyme beynge yonge adolescent in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of sondry noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               </gap>s shulde say I denye nat that. And these be the names that folowe. I dyd set in the fyrst place a certayne frende of myne hauynge the same name. In the seconde place lykewyse, and as names dyd I colloke &amp; set in place as they had named, and they thus collocated were by me recyted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde. And let the collocatoure aduyse him to set alway his frende doynge the thynge that he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to do comynly, and procede this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion clerely, and names knowen.

            <p>THe .ix. conclusyon shalbe, that I wyll shew how placꝭ ought to be gyuen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rubrysshes of eche lawe, &amp; set two ymages for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same as I am wont, for yf I wyll reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>THe .x. is in collocatynge, argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes. For the whiche I am accustomed to set two images.

before two wytnesses, and a rynge that sealeth the sayde testamente. The seconde ymage is it that collo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gateth two other diction more prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cypall of the argument. Take here of an example, thou Iurisconsul, of this phylosophres wote my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge. Whan in the act the wyll is demaunded of any, he ought to ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede.

And than we may say by and in memory y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of the argument of the collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of two or thre dyctions. The other thynges we shall recyte ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, &amp; beleue this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the mayster hath experyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it ryght well.</p>
            <p>THe .xi. conclusyon, and thus I haue the ymages vnto the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a C. whiche are .x. I haue also .ix ymages of the nombre begynninge
