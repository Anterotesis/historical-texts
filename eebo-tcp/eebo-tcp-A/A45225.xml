            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ambition of the Press is a fault, which it is not sufficient to repent; and, in case this common danger were wanting, my fear would create a new one, though that which deserved to come to the Eyes of their Majesties, might well lose the fear of all Mens Ears; for caution, advertency, and study, were more due to those that Acted it, than to those that shall read it; and this being more than sufficient for approbation, the Council was not pleased it should have any other: I

two Currents, sometimes in suspence, some times hasty, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it an Isle, and serving it for a Wall, over which the Trees are one way delightful Battlements, another, they are flow'ry Margents. Amidst the intricacy of the matted Hearbs, of the Galleries of Flowers, of the Meandrian Wildernesses, of the diversified Plats, of the Crystal Fountains (Competitors in Plenty and Novelty) there is reserv'd a most beautiful Space, which hath the openness of a Market-place, and wants not the pleasantness of a Forrest. This the Queen made choice of to Celebrate therein (with the greatest Magnificence that any Age hath seen, boast what it will the <hi>Roman</hi> Ostentation) the happy Birth-day of Our Soveraign Lord the King, the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Year of his flourishing Age, and the Second of his most blessed Reign.</p>
                     <p>One of the greatest things of which is composed the Majesty of the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> is, the Splendour of their Court, in which they do more surpass the other Princes of the World, than even in having under their Command so many Kingdoms; and the chief Point of this Splendour consists in that of their Maids of Honour, who, being Daughters of great Lords and Gentlemen, the veneration of all Men gives them new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by themselves preserved in such manner, that they find respect and applause wherever they appear: For there needs nothing else to make it a Festival Show at any time, than that they will permit themselves to be look'd upon. And now on this Occasion to Solemnize the Kings Birth-day, and Wait upon the Queen, they excell'd themselves in bravery, both of Cloaths and Carriage.</p>
                     <p>These Representations, which refuse the vulgar Name of Comedies, and aspire to that of <hi>Opere,</hi> to describe how they were performed by the Court (the Eclipse, rather than Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, of the Ancient Stage, upon which <hi>Italy</hi> values it self at this day) would require a better Pen than mine: But to stay to seek one could worthily Write it, were to Damme it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual

                     <p>Many Circumstances-make me suspitious of my self, and two amount to fear; the poverty of words to describe the <hi>brave Cloaths,</hi> which are distinguishable only by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and here all being reduc'd to Gold and Silver, that falls out to be rich, which a Revalation would have various ***</p>

                     <p>THe Court was divided into two Squadrons, to make the Festivals distinct; of the first the Queen was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who with her Greatness render'd it worthy of her Self; and of the second was Captain the Lady <hi>Leonora Pimentel,</hi> a Dame of a transcendent Wit, and who with that alone might promise her self equality, if it had been possible.</p>

                     <p>TO Erect the Scenes for the <hi>Opera</hi> of Her Majesty came to <hi>Aranjuez</hi> Captain <hi>Iulius Caesar Fontana,</hi> chief Engineer and Superintendent of the Fortifications of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> Son to that so celebrated Artichitect of the Fabricks of <hi>Sextus Quintus,</hi> and Artificer comparable with his Father. There was raised a Theatre of 150 Foot long, and 78 in breadth, and seven Arches on each side with Pilasters, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes and Battlements, of <hi>Dorick</hi> Work, and on the top of those certain Galleries with Balasters of Gold, Silver, and Blew, which compass'd the whole, and the same susteined
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55427:98"/>
seventy Massie Candlesticks holding white Wax Torches and Tapers innumerable, with certain Pillars imboss'd at the Corners of them ten Foot high, upon which was fastened a Canopy in imitation of a clear Night, when a multitude of Stars break out of a gloomy shadow, and upon the Stage, two Figures of a large proportion, which served for imaginary Gyants; and to correspond with the Frontispiece, and by the Cornishes of the open Galleries, many Statues of Brass, and pendant from the Arches, certain Globes of Crystal, which made great Lights; and round about Benches for Gentlemen, with a most beautiful Rail to keep out the Common-people. In the midst a Throne, upon which were the Chairs of the King, and of the Princes <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> his Brothers: Below them again Foot-paces, on which Carpets with Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the Ladies and Damsels. There was form'd a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of fifty foot broad, and eighty in circumference, which was made to split it self into two, and, though it was so vast in bulk, yet one Man moved it with much ease. It cover'd the Scene, and was of the same <hi>Dorick</hi> Work, and it had an Ascent by many Steps to a spatious Cave, peopled with many wild Beasts. What this Mountain hid shall be revealed, when we speak of the Scenes, as they served in their proper places of the <hi>Mask.</hi>

                     <p>The Subject was the Glory of <hi>Niquea,</hi> notorious in the Books of <hi>Amadis</hi>; it was written for the height of the Court, as knowing the little liberty which that affords to the Muses, and the great Caution wherewith these Virgins of <hi>Parnassus</hi> must there demean themselves, the want of which knowledge occasions many absurdities to those Poets (how eminent soever in other respects) who have been bred far from the severity of that School.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Festival</hi> was appointed for St. <hi>Philips</hi> Day, but the embroylment of so much Fabrick deferr'd it till <hi>Whit-Monday,</hi> by which time all was in perfection. At the shutting in of day

Tapers were lighted, equivocating Night. All took their places, who had leave to see, which was granted sparingly. For as to have indulged a general Liberty, would have caused great confusion, by the People that would have flocked from <hi>Madrid,</hi> so the Court-Attendance alone, of their Majesties, and their Highnesses, was enough, not to want Spectators if that had been the thing;) yet those who came unlicensed were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, least so justifiable an Ambition should be condemn'd, as to desire to see Festivals prepared by so great a Queen, in Honour of a King so Glorious, and moreover their own. He being now out of Mourning for his Great Father, which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served so religiously, that till the Year was over, even, the last Day, the first of his sorrow.

Thank'd him for his early Valour, and the great Anticipation upon his Age, having already Reign'd in One Year many Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, served by two Ministers of State, so zealous of his Glory, and of the Splendour of his Actions, of whose Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Profoundness the most ample Relation might savour something of Affection and Love, but nothing either of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Errour. The accurateness of the Stanza's could not complain of being discompos'd one jot in the Acting, nor did the few Years of the Lady <hi>Antonia</hi> apprehend the least scruple in the World to represent <hi>Time.</hi> The Eagle ascended above the whole Fabrick of the Theatre with an Artifice so well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, that the Flight was seen all the while, but not how it was done.

                     <p>IN the first Scene entered <hi>Darinel,</hi> Squire to <hi>Amadis,</hi> who notified to <hi>Dantes</hi> (a Shepherd of <hi>Tagus</hi>) the Occasion that obliged his Master to tread those Fields: He recounted to him his famous Actions, his Adventures, and that *** which was ministred unto him by the Inchantment of <hi>Niquea,</hi> oppress'd by the Arts of <hi>Anastarax,</hi> the hated Lover of her Beauty, for whom the Magitian <hi>Alquile</hi> (her Uncle) reserved her. The Squire reciprocally informed himself from the Shepherd touching the Borders of that River, whom the Swain cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously

answer'd, and paid his Narration with another of the Preparations there made upon so great an Occasion, as to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Birth-day of their King. The Squire was represented by the Lady <hi>Guevara</hi> of the Queens Chamber, in a brave Suit of Cloaths, a Sword girded to her, a Hat with a tossing Feather, and Roses of Diamonds; the Shepherd, by the Lady <hi>Bernarda de Bilbao</hi> of the Chamber of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> in an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garlin, and Smock-coat Green and Silver, Budget of Cloth of the same; the Action and Bravery of them both not yielding to the proudest Competitors: A Quire of <hi>Sirens</hi> were heard to Sing. <hi>Tagus</hi> listens from his Sphere of Crystal, who despising to be a River hath the Ambition of a Sea.</p>

                     <p>A Trumpet Sounded, and following the Ecchoes thereof, they entered among the matted Trees: Presently came out, as amused at the Noise of the same, that Knight of the <hi>Burning Sword.</hi> He was represented by the Lady <hi>Isabella</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> joyning the Mettle of <hi>Amadis</hi> to the Beauty of <hi>Niquea:</hi> Her Habit, Braces of Cloth of Silver Carnation and Black, with Embroideries of the same, a Souldiers Cassack with the same trimming, Armour of burnish'd Silver neatly Filed, the Clasps and Studs thereof of Gold, and the Murrion Crown'd with a Mountain of Plumes, a Mantle of Cloth of Silver hanging at the Shoulders, and a Sword girded to her; a Dwarf attended her, who carried the Inchanted Shield (which was <hi>Don Michael Sopilio</hi>) who succeeded <hi>Bonami</hi> in the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Littleness, and he was sheath'd in an old fashion Suit, Black and Silver.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amadis</hi> found upon the Trees various Inscriptions, which put him into a confusion, and (assaulted by Sleep) demanded quarter of the fatigue of the way; but (his Spirit complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the faint resistance made by his Flesh) whilst he was yet awake he was scandaliz'd to imagin himself asleep, and quite

overcome at last (as he that is never so much a Lover remains a Man for all that, and cannot put off Mortality) did stay himself at a Rock; then came forth <hi>Night,</hi> represented by a <hi>Portugal Black-moor</hi> Maid, and a most excellent Singer, Maid to the Queen, Clad in a whole Kirtle of Black Taffaty, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with Stars of Silver, and a Mantle falling from her Shoulders, thick wrought with the same Stars—</p>

the Shield, invaded the Rock with so generous a smartness, that it was all, which it was possible for a Lady to do without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composing her self. The Rock opened, and there appeared a Pallace of a beautiful Structure, and in the Portal thereof four Pillars of Thirty Foot high, which at the instant that <hi>Amadis</hi> knock'd at the Gates sank down to the Centre so swiftly, that the Eye could not overtake them. Four Gyants shew'd themselves Arm'd with Breast-plates and Murrions, who grew into Choler at the rashness of the Knight, and with threat'ning only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to carry the Victory. But <hi>Amadis,</hi> who had not the Name given his Sword for nothing, with the first flourishing thereof, and shewing them the Shield into the bargain, put them all four to Coward-flight (for so the Books of Knighthood will have it:) Represented these were by <hi>Donna Leonora de Quiros, Donna Luysa Ortiz, Donna Catalina de Z<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Many Nymphs came-out with Flowers to put upon his Head, and with treacherous fawnings sought to get him out of the Castle. He knowing their falshood, shew'd them the Shield, at which they fled, Lyons rising in their places, into which they transform'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with such natural fierceness, that true ones could not have struck more terrour, and (seeing the Shield) these likewise vanish'd: He ascended by the Stairs until he was stopt by this Inscription:

                     <p>AT the approach of <hi>Amadis</hi> to the place where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment appear'd dissolv'd, <hi>Anastarax</hi> stood upon his Guard, and with deep fetch'd Groans complain'd of the violence of Fate, and of Heaven, that had given to Morral Man so great Valour as to that Adventure. <hi>Amadis</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd him to the torments of his own Jealousie, and took <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quea</hi> out of the Inchanted Castle.

                     <head>The Second SCENE.</head>
                     <p>A Nymph appearing came forth singing a Sonnet, in which she presented the Festival to the King; when presently the Squire and the Shepherd, struck with admiration of what they had seen, hear the rattling of Chains, and grievous Lamentation with which <hi>Anastarax</hi> did bemoan himself from the Hell of Love; and (imagining it was some new Inchantment) had not the courage either to advance, or stay where they were. Putting aside the Boughs with their hands, forth came the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Frances Tabara,</hi> in different Habits from the former, that of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (who Acted <hi>Albida</hi>) Petticoat and Hungarlin of Cloth of Silver Grass Green, laid thick with Silver Passemans, Cloth of Silver Mantle with Roses of Diamonds, Plume White and Green: That of the Lady <hi>Frances</hi> (who Acted <hi>Lurcano</hi>) Petticoat of Cloth of Silver Primrose Colour, with Embroidery of Silver and Gold both on the Field and Border, and a Hungarlin of Black Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet uncut, Laced long-ways with Silver Passemans, a Sword and sprightful Hat, the Brim turn'd up to the Crown, with a Black Plume fasten'd on with a Brooche of Diamonds.</p>
                     <p>I advertised before, that this which the People would think strange for a Comedy, and in Court is called an Invention or <hi>Opera,</hi> is not measur'd by the common Rules of a Play (which is a Fable all of one piece) is made up of incoherent variety; of which the Sight got a better share than the Hearing, and where the Comedy (if it may be call'd so) was such to the Eye more than to the Ear. <hi>Lurcano</hi> painted forth (in rich, and no vulgar Verses) the Pleasures and Content of a Countrey Life in general, and <hi>Albida</hi> described her Gardens as in the beautiful
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55427:105"/>
Season of <hi>May,</hi> then her Lover <hi>Lurcano</hi> imparted to her his amorous Passion mask'd in cautiousness and fears, and <hi>Albida,</hi> not to favour him by doubting it, nor oblige her self by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, answer'd him according to the little heed she gave unto other folks torments, living without any of her own: In this Dialogue (no less than in that of <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Niquea</hi>) the Author shew'd the Decorum with which Verses should be written for Ladies; those which they hear, discreet; those which they speak, severe: Where, whatsoever is not despair, is presumption; all should be Veneration, and nothing Love. It was superexcellent, and (if it were possible) the Acting of it exceeded the Penning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anastarax</hi> return'd to his Complaints, Cursing the Knight of the <hi>Burning Sword</hi> with so hearty a good will, with so melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a voice, with so doleful groans, that he adorned his pain, and the Lady <hi>Antonia Mendoza</hi> her Part, so much, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ever so applauded, or more worthy to be so. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bida</hi> demanded of <hi>Darinel</hi> the cause of those Lamentations, but he was as ignorant thereof as her self. In the mean time the howling went on, and the compassionate <hi>Albida</hi> had a longing desire to set <hi>Anastarax</hi> at liberty. She heard a voice, which (singing) animated her pity, she read an Inscription, and that incited it likewise; she followed the Ecchoes of the Complaints, and advising <hi>Lurcano,</hi> as a Friend, to Cure himself with loving some other Beauty (taking him it should seem for a Man) she had the daring to undertake that which appeared so difficult; <hi>Lurcano</hi> endevoured to stay her, and, not being able, follow'd her to get first to the danger: And making hast to outstrip her, a flying Dragon opposeth his passage, who carryed between his Wings <hi>Florisbella</hi> (represented by the Lady <hi>Anxa Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique</hi>) with whom he, admiring her Beauty, and to verifie the Prognostication of <hi>Albida,</hi> falls presently in Love, endevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to arrest her Perfections by the force of Sighs and Prayers; he made Love to her most in feeling language, the Dragon flew away, and the disdainful Nymph would not leave him so much as a presumption that she had heard his Addresses: <hi>Lurcano</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55427:105"/>
in amorous Doubts, sometimes he thought himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep, sometimes inchanted; he found in her more Marks of a Goddess, than of a Nymph; he thought his Love much, for so short a view; little, for so beautiful an Object; The Pen of the Author left me no gallant thing unsaid in these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and the Lady <hi>Franscisca</hi> pronouncing them, added of her own a Spirit, the perfection of Poetry, this being one of the most admired Strains in the whole Festival.</p>
                     <p>A Quire of Musick bid him not despair, for that he should sometime, and that soon, behold her again. He demanded Aid of Love in so doubtful an occasion, and in so soveraign a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votement, when on the top of the Theatre, a Balcone open'd it self, in which at the Sounds of many Instruments appeared the Nymph <hi>Arethusa,</hi> represented by the Lady <hi>Mary Gus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (this second Habit much surpassing the former) Clad in a Carnation Petticoat, laid thick with flat Pease, and Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries of Pearl and Silver, and a deep Kirtle after the Mode of <hi>France,</hi> with Gathers of Cloth of Silver Carnation, wrought with little Snails or Periwincles of Silver, as it were creeping up from the bottom to the top, and half Sleeves of Needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work lin'd with Cloth of Silver White, and Ermins, a flying Mantle Carnation and Silver, with Roses of Diamonds, and a Bunch of Plumes Carnation and White, a Bough of Laurel and Mirtle she carried in her hand, saying, that she came sent from the Goddess <hi>Venus</hi> to disperse the Cloud which involved so great Lovers, she bade <hi>Lurcano</hi> be of good Courage, since <hi>Anastarax</hi> himself was now coming out of the Hell of Love: This Scene was accompanied with great Harmony, and from the midst of the flames (which were made with various splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, not causing horrour but delight) came forth <hi>Anastarax,</hi> handed by <hi>Albida,</hi> whom <hi>Arethusa</hi> thank'd for her valour, and <hi>Anastarax</hi> for his deliverance: Then (the different Quires of Musick joyning) forth came the Goddess of Beauty with <hi>Niquea, Amadis,</hi> and all the Nymphs, and <hi>Anastarax</hi> begg'd pardon of <hi>Niquea</hi> for his presumptuous Love, and she par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd him. The Goddess of Beauty gave to <hi>Amadis</hi> the name
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55427:106"/>
of the most refined Servant, and valiant Knight, in the whole World, loving without design, conquering without reward; and <hi>Amadis</hi> with that, of being acknowledged so perfect a Lover, rested fully satisfied. <hi>Florisbella</hi> came forth, to whom <hi>Lurcaro</hi> fell down upon his Knees, and begg'd, in recompense of all his Love, she would not look upon it as an injury, being the most courteous affront that could be offer'd to Beauty. <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusa</hi> celebrated the great Mercy extended by one Sex, the great Love made good by the other; she gave to <hi>Niquea</hi> the joy of her disinchantment, and to the Goddess, the Glory of the Festival. She commanded that with Musick and Dances should be celebrated the Liberty of the Princess, of the Beauty of the Goddess, and so with a great Harmony of all the Instruments at once, they went out, concluding the Representation, in which (being the last) the Lady <hi>Mary Gusman</hi> carried the first Praise.</p>
                     <p>All of a sudden the Mountain cover'd the whole Face of the Theatre, and presently that Bulk open'd it self at the sounding of the Instruments, when with unexpected novelty, that which was a Mountain and a Building, we saw turn'd into most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Gardens of Flowers, and natural Fountains, so ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and with so great quickness metamorphosed, that though the Artifice was much, the brevity was the thing admired: And for a decision of a Wager between the Queen and the Lady <hi>Leonor Pimentel</hi> (observing an ancient Pastime in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, which is called <hi>Divination,</hi> at which they stake a Jewel for victory, not for avarice) there appeared on the highest part of the Throne Her Majesty and the <hi>Infawa,</hi> the Ladies and <hi>Menina's</hi> seated upon the Steps thereof making a glorious show, and each of them having tyed about her right Arm a Scarlet Ribbon, all of one length and breadth, and fastened in such manner that made no distinction; the Preceipt, that shuffling all these together, the Lady <hi>Leonor</hi> (to overcome) must light upon that which had hung upon the Arm of the Queen.</p>
                     <p>The Lady <hi>Leonor</hi> approached, and lost only the possibility of gaining, for (to be an absolute loser) the Law was, the Queen,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55427:106"/>
when her turn came, should light upon the Ribbon that was fastened to <hi>Leonors</hi> Arm. The Action was accompanied by all the Instruments and Singers: For, as <hi>Spain</hi> is the most proper Element of the most excellent Voyces in the World; so the Centre of them is the Kings Chappel; to whose Master, Musick is beholden, for uniting dexterity in the Tunes, with an excellent Ayr in Singing, making the Majesty of the Theorbo comply with the sweetness of the Lute; and to the eminency of whose Art she owes the Novelty of <hi>Palomares,</hi> the Delicacy of <hi>Iohn Blas,</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Alvaro,</hi> and all made use of upon this occasion.</p>

Wit, Motion, and Bravery, were drawn dry and wearied in the Service, nay the Graces themselves had not any delight, which by this time was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to the Spectators; nor any thanks, which they return'd not to the Actors. If the Expectation had been infinite, the Performance was more. The admirations and praises paid but a small part of the sight, for (to go about to measure it that way) Hyperboles themselves would have made a luke-warm Narration, and of such none were wanting, and the greatest was none.</p>
                     <p>The flourishing years of the King (which may they multiply to as many as his Virtues deserve, and as <hi>Spain</hi> prays for, and hath need of) could by no less demonstrations of joy be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently solemnized, nor at any time with greater reason have disengag'd the pleasing thirst of seeing more.</p>
                     <p>The Splendour of the Court had been always admirable, but was never seen greater than now; having in the first place the Queen (whom God preserve) of few Years, of much Beauty, accompanied with all those excellent Endowments which form a Royal Perfection; then the <hi>Infanta,</hi> of equal Majesty and Beauty; also the Ladies, who in Bravery, Beauty, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, were inferiour unto those two only; for they were a Pool

of all the Illustrious Blood in the Kingdom, and being (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they are) the Load-stone of all Eyes: Imagin them seen upon the Theatre, on the most Tryumphant day of the World, every of them vying with other, and making a modest ostentation of her Bravery, her Meen, and her Beauty. No one can be particularly commended without an injury to all: She seem'd the most glorious drest, upon whom the Eye happen'd to be; she the best Actor, who was then Speaking.</p>
                     <p>The Queen, Foundress and Glory of the Festival, so twice Hers, and justly, for neither from Her could it be expected less, nor did it deserve a less Mistress, by her presence did free it from the fear of competition, and from the hope of being more; who, because, only by Her being of the Company, She gave the Scene so much Lustre, without pronouncing one Verse: In these following was written in Figures, that which many had not been sufficient to comprehend in words at length.</p>
