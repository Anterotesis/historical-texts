            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I thinke Sir, 'tis as dull as foolish, there cannot bee a sence of pleasure, where there is so little sence. Greatnesse is the center of all happinesse, and felicity like our lands, at first is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Crowne, kings come nere unto the gods, and are like them both in power and pleasure, doe command all, enjoy all, are miserable onely in too much, and want but what to wish for, this is the dazeling happinesse. Tis vaine therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre private joyes before the Crowne-pleasures, the King may throw by his greatnesse when he please, and be poorely happy, the beggar will nere sigh unto a Scepter.</p>

               <l>Not I Sir, nor of my Lord the Foole's there,</l>
               <l>Kings are more miserable than they seeme</l>
               <l>Happy, flattered by themselves and others</l>
               <l>Into a Ioy that is not, and what they</l>
               <l>Feele, they rather doe beleeve, than finde so.</l>
               <l>Yet I grant too, a King may be happy</l>
               <l>But never as a King. Felicity</l>
               <l>Is a purchase, and no inheritance,</l>
               <l>Nor hath the prerogative more than one</l>
               <l>Life in't neither, it dies still with the buyer,</l>
               <l>Troubles are the good kings profession,</l>
               <l>In the warres the first dart is throwne at him,</l>
               <l>Where his happinesse is in a glorious death,</l>
               <l>Or else his God-like rayes pluckt from him</l>
               <l>By some accursed hand, and so falls lesse</l>

private meeting and close Counsell is more just, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious then the lowdest deede in Court, that all our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Acts, edicts, and formes of Law, are darke and impious compared to it; nay, that this time and place made holy by our purposes hath the gods more manifest and present, then the Sacrifice and Temples, long since made void and empty of a Deity, by those which sue for favours and request for him, who justly heare deserves their horridst vengeance, we are not met heere to plot a generall ruine for a private injury, we know and teach the greatest <hi>Donne</hi> by the King unto the Subject, can not give him cause to throw off his faith. Kings are petty gods and may tempt us, nor is it want or desire of Innovation that thus Stirreth us, wee are in the best ill State allready, nor ambition to Strike at that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell which the Thunder spares, no we reverence it, and know that as men are the workes of nature, so Kings of <hi>Jove.</hi> But 'tis our oath the Sacrament we tooke, which still holds us though our Lord be dead, untill his successor doe quit us from it, by taking of a new one, we are not subjects, but slaves to him we now obey, and therefore as slaves we ought to hate our Master; he was borne lesse then we, and hides the private man under the publique gowne; the purple which he weares was dipt deepe in the blood of Innocents to collour't so. But I vainely wast my selfe in words, here are no minds to be perswaded, nor eares to be instructed; the sinnes we are to punish, we all know, and the gods remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, our Strength then is all we are to speake of, which is the greatest halfe of the Jsle 16. yeares undisturb'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, so carelesly was that provided for which was got by blood, there is but one Lordship, small in respect of others, the Tyrants owne possession that will stand strong for him, but they are so besotted with their fortunes that their greatest aide will be but in their will to doe him service. They may offer up their lives, like so many Sacrifices for his sake, but not like Souldiers, they are unworthy of that name: They may dy but never conquer, warr is never talk't of but in their banquets, nor dare they fight beyond a Brawle.</p>

               <p>Royall Sir you are wellcome.

And Sir, though it bee a short warning to so great a matter, you must presently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parè to bee a King; wee have no time now to instruct you in your right, and how you lost it, it was yeares a doing, and will require yeares for to relate it.

               <p>If I thought so, I'de grant to your request, and kill you; I could doe it, I have strength, and justice enough to make me able, but you are not so bad, as you suppose, these are dispairing, and not malitious thoughts; yet ere I goe one way or other Ile give you satisfaction, I came for that intent. Let me see your Articles —</p>

               <p>And if these may not be granted, that thus accompanied, wee may depart the Isle. How poore are these requests? without more commission I dare grant you greater. Why, these are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands within the compasse of a subjects breast, deceive not your selves, you were not so safe in your owne raigne, as in your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. The State is not translated from one tyranny to another, but to a kingdome. A Prince governes now, which is the name of mercy, as well as power, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he truly knowes, and in his first deeds desires to shew on you; he does not thinke he's then like Iove when he can thunder, but when he can hold it in, not when he is the voice of death, but when he sits harmelesse, with the power of death about him. Revenge, Torments, Executions, are not expressions of a king, but a distruction, he rivalls not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall powers in Temples, statues, adoration, but transcendent
<pb facs="tcp:8442:49"/>
virtues, divine performances, these are the additions by which he climbes heaven, and appeares a god on earth.</p>

               <p>Why should I bee a stranger to these virtues, more than this man? I was not borne for lesse things than he, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when nature made this frame, she intended it for the noblest actions.</p>

               <p>I will goe on in mercy, tis my commission, and if you will not dam against its streames, it may flow to you: yet the way is even; why looke you strangely at the word? tis no wonder to the sender of it, nor they which live about him. Though the dangers may seeme great, twere not worthy of the high name of his mercy, if the offence were not such. This is but the least of his expressions, that his enemies were courted for to live, but presently you thinke tis not to save you, but to deferre your death. A vaine thought, when can it be done more safely, and more justly, you are now as farre from those to help you, as to pity you. None but himselfe has any care of you. Tis true, there is a Lady that had a share in you, but with your honor you threw her off, nor can you claime an interest, when you have neglected her in all her miseries; not in your flight, your articles, no, not in your thoughts providing for her. And, had she not fallen into the hands of enemies that were servants too, to honour; you had throwne away a Jewell that had a first thought, even among the gods.</p>

These your last words comes neere unto me, and makes me with reverence beleeve all that you have spoken; before your virtues onely sturd my hate and envie, this deed first taught me to admire, and cannot doubt there is a want of any noblenesse, when you have shewne such passionate care in preserving a distressed Virgin, whom I durst not thinke of, least I should thinke too, of her dishonour.</p>

               <p>Sir, I have found a royall wellcome, such as cannot be betterd but by your owne wishes, which are the onely things above your actions. Yet ere I goe, I have a request to you, but 'tis such as I must not receive, unlesse another will bee content to aske it for me, you are the man, my Lord, and your company I desire, which if I can obtaine, I dare promise to my selfe a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious enterprise.</p>

               <p>I thus give it with the rest, by this request, My Lord, I perceive youle keepe your word, and suddenly returne, you would not else at once bereft us of your selfe, and so neere a servant.</p>

               <p>How gladly I would thinke my selfe so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernd, as to aske a leave of you, but I have ever made my selfe a stranger to you or whats worse, a knowne enemy, and can expect onely ill wishes from you.</p>

               <p>Sir, I thinke not so, you have deserv'd better from me, and if I give you not a leave, tis because I am loath to have you goe, twas you confirm'd my life, when I thought it not in the power of Art, or heaven to have done it, and that before I made not these large expressions, twas because they then became me not, if I had owed lesse, I would have said more.</p>

               <p>You have given mee a happinesse, which neither envy, malice, nor the worst of fortune can take from me. I stand the onely man above the stroke of Fate, may I hope to see that ioy dwell in your face againe, which I was never yet so blest as to behold?</p>

               <p>I hope I understand you, and that I may yet expect a happinesse, equall to the happinesse of this day. Hitherto our Kingdome hath been like the Kingdome of the gods. Felicity upon felicity, joy crow'nd with joy; and though this day concluded what it hath begun. I have raign'd a perfect raigne, having beheld in few howers the numerous changes of an age.</p>
