            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

glorie which I had with thee before the worlde was.
I haue declarede thy Name vnto the men which thou
gaueſt me out of the worlde: thine they were, and thou
gaueſt them me, and they haue kept thy worde. Nowe
they knowe that all things whatſoeuer thou haſt giuen

are mine, and I am glorified in them. And now am I
no more in the worlde, but theſe are in the worlde, and
I come to thee. Holy Father, kepe them in thy Name,
euen them whom thou haſt geuen me, that they may be
one, as we are. Whyle I was with them in the world,
I kept them in thy name: thoſe that thou gaueſt me,
haue I kept, and none of them is loſt, but the childe of
perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. And
nowe come I to thee, and theſe thinges ſpeake I in the
worlde, that they might haue my ioye fulfilled in them

hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the worlde, as
I am not of the world. I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt
take them out of the worlde, but that thou kepe them
from euill. They are not of the world, as I am not of
the worlde. Sanctifie them with thy trueth: thy word
is trueth. As thou dideſt ſend me into the world, ſo haue
I ſent them into the worlde. And for their ſakes ſantifie
I my ſelfe, that they alſo may be ſanctified through the
trueth. I praye not for theſe alone, but for them alſo
which ſhall beleue in me, through their worde. That
they all may be one, as thou, O Father, art in me, and
I in thee: euen that they may be alſo one in vs, that the
world may beleue that thou haſt ſent me. And the glory
that thou gaueſt me, I haue geuen them, that they may
be one, as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that
they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may
knowe, that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loued them, as
thou haſt loued me. Father, I will that they which thou
haſt giuen me, be with me euen where I am, that they
may behold my glory, which thou haſt geuen me: for
thou louedſt me before the foundation of the world. O

               <p>NOw then their is no condemnation to them that
are in Chriſt Ieſus, which walke not after the
fleſh, but after the Spirite. For the Lawe of
the Spirite of lyfe which is in Chriſt Ieſus, hath freied
me from the Lawe of ſinne and of death: For (that that
was impoſible to the Law, in as much as it was weake
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16621:17"/>
becauſe of the fleſh) God ſendinge his owne Sonne, in
the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſinne, condemned
ſinne in the fleſh, That the righteouſnes of the Lawe
might be fulfilled in vs, which walke not after the fleſh,
but after the Spirite. For they that are after the fleſh,
ſauour the thinges of the fleſh: but they that are after
the Spirite, the thinges of the Spirite. For the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the fleſh is death: but the wiſedome of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
is lyfe and peace, Becauſe the wiſedome of the fleſh
is enimitie againſt God: for it is not ſubiect to the Law
of God, neither indede can be. So then they that are in
the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God. Now ye are not in the fleſh,
but in the Spirite, becauſe the Spirite of God dwelleth
in you: but if any man hath not the Spirite of Chriſt,
the ſame is not his. And if Chriſt be in you, the bodie is
dead, becauſe of ſinne: but the ſpirite is lyfe for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes
ſake. But if the ſpirite of him that raiſed vp Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
from the dead, dwell in you, he that raiſed vp Chriſt
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead, ſhal alſo quicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your mortal bodies, becauſe
that his Spirite dwelleth in you. Therfore bretherne,
we are detters not to the fleſh, to liue after the fleſh:
For if ye liue after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye: but if ye mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effye
the dedes of the bodie by the Spirite, ye ſhall liue.
For as many as are led by the ſpirite of God, they are
the ſonnes of God. For ye haue not receiued the ſpirite
of bondage to feare againe: but ye haue receiued the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of adoption, whereby we crye Abba Father. The
ſame ſpirite beareth witneſſe with our ſpirite, that we
are the children of God. If we be children, we are alſo
heires, euen the heires of God, and heires annexed with
Chriſt, if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we maye
alſo be glorified with him. For I count the afflictions
of this preſent time are not worthy of the glorie, which
ſhalbe ſhewed vnto vs. For the feruent deſire of the
creature waiteth when the ſonnes of god ſhalbe reueled.
Becauſe the creature is ſubiect to vanitie, not of it owne
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16621:17"/>
will, but by reaſon of him, which hath ſubdued it vnder
hope, Becauſe the creature alſo ſhalbe deliuered from
the bondage of corruption into the glorious libertie of
the ſonnes of God. For we knowe that euery creature
groneth with vs alſo, and trauaileth in paine together
vnto this preſent. And not onely the creature, but we
alſo which haue the firſt frutes of the Spirite, euen we
do ſigh in our ſelues, waiting for the adoption, euen the
redemption of our bodie. For we are ſaued by hope: but
hope that is ſene, is not hope: for howe can a man hope
for that which he ſeeth: But if we hope for that we ſee
not, we do with patience abide for it. Likewiſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
alſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what
to praye as we ought: but the ſpirite it ſelfe maketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
for vs with ſighes, which can not be expreſſed.
But he that ſearcheth the hartes, knoweth what is the
meaning of the Spirite: for he maketh requeſt for the
Sainctes, according to the will of God. Alſo we know
that all thinges worke together for the beſt vnto them
that loue God, euen to them that are called of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
For thoſe which he knew before, he alſo predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to be made like to the Image of his Sonne, that
he might be the firſt borne amonge manye bretherne.
Moreouer whom he predeſtinate, them alſo he called,
and whom he called, them alſo he iuſtified, and whome
he iuſtified, them alſo glorified. What ſhall we then ſaye
to theſe thinges? If God be of our ſide, who can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vs? who ſpared not his owne Sonne, but gaue
him for vs all to death, how ſhall he not with him giue
vs all things alſo? Who ſhal laye any thing to the charge
of Gods choſen? it is God that iuſtifieth, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demne?
it is Chriſt, which is dead, yea or rather which
is riſen againe, who is alſo at the right hand of God, and
maketh requeſt alſo for vs. Who ſhall ſeperate vs from
the loue of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation or anguiſh, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecucion,
or famine, or nakednes, or perrill, or ſworde?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16621:18"/>
As it is written, For thy ſake are killed all daye longe:
we are counted as ſhepe from the ſlaughter, Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
in all theſe thinges we are more then conquerers
through him that loued vs. For I am perſwaded that
neither death, no, lyfe, nor Angels, nor principalities,

Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhalbe

Among whom we alſo had our conuerſation in tyme
paſt, in the luſtes of our fleſh, in fulfilling the wil of the
fleſh, and of the minde, and were by nature the children
of wrath, as well as others. But God which is riche
in mercy, through his great loue wherwith he loued vs.
Euen when we were dead by ſinnes, hath quickened
vs together in Chriſt, by whoſe grace ye are ſaued, And
hath rayſed vs vp together, and made vs ſitte together
in the heauenly places in Chriſt Ieſus, That he might
ſhewe in the ages to come the excedinge riches of his

For by grace are ye ſaued through fayth, and that

of them, which are called circumciſion in the fleſh,
made with handes, That ye were, I ſaye, at that time

which once were farre of, are made nere by the bloud of
Chriſt. For he is our peace, which hath made of both
one, and hath broken the ſtoppe of the particion wall.
In abrogatinge through his fleſh the hatred, that is, the
Lawe of commaundements which ſtandeth in ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for to make of twayne one newe man in himſelfe,
ſo making peace. And that he might reconcile both vnto

And came, and preached peace to you which were a

we both haue an entraunce vnto the Father by one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.

walke not as other Gentiles walke, in vanitie of their

the harte of the Kyng ſhall periſh, and the harte of the

thee theſe thinges, ſuch is thy wickednes: therfore it
ſhalbe bitter, therfore it ſhall perce vnto thine harte.
My bely, my bely, I am peined, euen at the very harte:
mine harte is troubled within me: I can not be ſtill: for
my ſoule hath harde the ſound of the trumpet, and the
alarme of the battell. Deſtruction vpon deſtruction is

For my people is fooliſh, they haue not knowne
me: they are fooliſh children, and haue none vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge:
they are wiſe to do euill, but to do well they haue
no knowledge. I haue loked vpon the earth, and lo, it
was without forme and voyde: and to the heauens, &amp;
they had no light. I beheld the mountaines and lo, they
trembled and all the hilles ſhoke. I beheld, and lo, there
was no man. and all the birdes of the heauen were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
I beheld, and lo, the fruitefull place was a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes,
and all the cities therof were broken downe
at the preſence of the Lord, and by his fierce wrath.
For thus hath the Lord ſayd, The whole land ſhalbe

the earth mourns, and the heauens aboue ſhalbe darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
becauſe I haue pronounced it: I haue thought it,

The whole citie ſhal flee, for the noyſe of the horſemen

               <p>AND I ſawe a newe heauen, and a newe earth:
for the firſt heauen, and the firſt earth were paſſed
awaye, and there was no more ſea. And I Iohn
ſawe the holy citie newe Ieruſalem come downe
from God out of heauen, prepared as a bride trimmed
for her houſband. And I heard a great voyce out of
heauen ſayinge, Beholde, the Tabernacle of God is
with men, and he will dwell with them: and they ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
his people, and God him ſelfe ſhalbe their God with
them. And God ſhall wipe away all teares from theyr
eyes: and there ſhalbe no more death, neither ſorrowe,
neither crying, neither ſhall there be any more paine: for
the firſt thinges are paſſed. And he that ſate vpon the
throne, ſayd, Beholde, I make all thinges newe: and
he ſayd vnto me, Write: for theſe wordes are faythfull
and true. And he ſayd vnto me, It is done, I am and
the beginning and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end. I will giue to him that is a

ouercommeth, ſhall inherit all thinges, and I will be

vnbeleuing, and the abhominable, and murderers, and
whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all
liars ſhal haue the parte in the lake, which burneth with
fyre and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death. And there
came vnto me one of the ſeuen Angels, which had the
ſeuen viales full of the ſeuen laſt plagues, and talked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

great citie, holy Ieruſalem, deſcendinge out of heauen
from God, Hauing the glory of God: and her ſhining
was like vnto a ſtone moſte precious, as a Iaſper
ſtone cleare as criſtall. And had a great wall an hie, and

and on the Weſtſide thre gates. And the wall of the
citie had twelue foundations, and in them the names of
the Lambes twelue Apoſtles. And he that talked with
me, had a golden rede to meaſure the citie with all, and
the gates therof, and the wall therof. And the citie laye
foure ſquare, and the length is as large as the bredth of
it, and he meaſured the citie with the rede, twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande

height of it are equall. And he meaſured the wall therof,
an hundreth, fortie and foure cubites, by the meaſure of
man, that is, of the Angell. And the building of the wal
of it was of Iaſper: and the citie was pure golde, like
