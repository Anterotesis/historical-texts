            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Of theſe two parts (in mine opinion) that is more excellent, which preſerveth health and preventeth ſickeneſſe. For as much as health is the moſt perfect ſtate of mans body in this life,<note place="margin">The end of Phyſick is to maintaine health.</note> and the onely end or marke whereunto the Phyſician directeth all his doings; which ſtate to continue, which end to enioy, which marke to hit, is much better then after we are fallen and erred, and miſſed, eftſoones to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſame. Even as it is better to ſtand faſt ſtill, than to fall and riſe againe; better keep ſtill a Caſtle or City, than after we have ſuffered the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to enter, to reſcue it again. For as the Poet
<pb facs="tcp:8894:3"/>
ſaith, <hi>Aegrius eijcitur quam non admittitur hoſpes.</hi> And for this cauſe (as I thinke) <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> that famous Phyſitian, leauing in a manner the uſe of medicine, bent all his ſtudy to the order of dyet: As though diet were of ſuch force, that by it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes might bee cured better than by medicines. Or, as <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſaith: <hi>Quia omnia fere medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camenta ſtomachum laedunt,</hi>

How little is ſufficient for a man well taught and thereby he belcheth not in his chamber nor fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth any paine. A wholeſome ſleepe commeth of a temperate belly. Hee riſeth up in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and is well at eaſe in himſelfe. But paine in watching and chollericke diſeaſes, and pangs of the belly are with an unſatiable man.

And when he was demanded why hee did ſo, that I may not accuſtome my ſelfe, (quoth he) to follow my ſenſuall appetites, luſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Alſo the ſame Philoſopher affirmeth, that ſuch as had well broken themſelves to virtuous living and temperate diet, did perceive and take of the ſame, both much more pleaſure and leſſe paines, than ſuch as with all high care &amp; diligence did on every ſide make proviſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to have all things of pleaſure.

in the ninth <hi>Clinie,</hi> all one with our elevation. <hi>England</hi> then lyeth in the temperate <hi>Zone</hi> Northward, and the ninth <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> having on the South-Eaſt ſide <hi>France,</hi> on the North-Eaſt, <hi>Norwey,</hi> on the South-Weſt <hi>Spaine,</hi> on the Weſt <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on the North <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now concerning the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ayre in <hi>England,</hi> whether it bee in a meane, or doe exceed the meane, in heat, cold, dryth or moyſture, ſhall beſt bee perceived by compariſon of other countries. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> in the end of his third booke of <hi>Prenotions,</hi> ſetteth downe three Countries for example of temperate or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate aire in heate or cold, that is <hi>Libya, Delos</hi> and <hi>Scythia, Libya</hi> or <hi>Affricke</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as over hot, <hi>Scythia</hi> or <hi>Tartaria</hi> as over cold, and the Iland <hi>Delos</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> as meane &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate betwixt both. The like compariſon is made of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> in the 7. booke and 7. Chapter of his Politikes. Thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (ſaith he) which inhabite cold countries, are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, but they have little wit and cunning. Wherefore they live in more libertie, and hardly receive good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance of the weale publike, neither can they well rule their borderers. And ſuch as dwell in <hi>Aſia,</hi> excell in wit and art, but they want audacitie, for which cauſe they live in ſubjection to others. But the Graecians as they have a Countrey in a meane betweene both, ſo have they both qualities. For they are both valiant and witty. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that they live at liberty, and have good government, and ſuch a ſtate as may rule all other. Hereunto I will adde the judgement of <hi>Galen</hi> that famous Phyſitian, written in the ſecond booke <hi>de San. tu.</hi> and 7. Chapter, which may be as an interpretation of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> The beſt temperature of body (ſaith hee) is as a rule of <hi>Polycletus,</hi> ſuch as in our ſituation being very temperate, you may ſee many. But in <hi>France, Scythia, Egypt</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> a man may not ſo much as dreame of any like. And of our Countrey which hath no ſmall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that part which lieth in the middeſt is moſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as the Countrey of <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> for that there VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; Summer hath a meane temperature, and at the Spring and fall of the leafe much better. So that Greece by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe men is moſt temperate, and <hi>France</hi> diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
<pb facs="tcp:8894:8"/>
with cold by the opinion of <hi>Galen.</hi> And if <hi>France</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the meane in cold, then is not <hi>England</hi> in a perfect temperature, but more declining to cold, becauſe it is three degrees and ten minutes farther North, comparing <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> together in the elevation of the Pole <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> Howbeit <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in the fift book of his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, thinketh the ayre to bee more temperate in <hi>Britaine,</hi> (in thoſe places where he was) than in <hi>France,</hi> and the cold leſſer. And <hi>Polidorus Virgilius</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>England</hi> ſeemeth to bee of the ſame minde. The countrey (ſaith he) is at all times of the yeare moſt temperate, and no extremitie of weather, ſo that diſeaſes be rare, and therefore leſſe uſe of Phyſick than elſewhere. And many men all abroad doe live a hundred and ten years, and ſome a hundred and twenty, yet he thinketh the aire for the moſt part to be cloudy and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which alſo is confirmed by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in the life of <hi>Iulius Agricola,</hi> ſaying: The ayre of Brittain is foule with often ſtormes and clouds, without extremitie of cold. But to reconcile theſe ſayings of ancient authors, I thinke that <hi>England</hi> may bee called temperate in heate in reſpect of Spaine, and temperate in cold in reſpect of <hi>Norwey,</hi> yet to be reckoned cold notwithſtanding &amp; moiſt, becauſe it declineth from the mids of the temperate Zone Northward. And this is the cauſe why Engliſhmen doe eate more, and digeſt faſter than the inhabitants of hotter countries (<hi>videlicet</hi>) the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of aire encloſing our bodies about. And therefore wee provide that our tables may be more plentifully furniſhed oftentimes, than theirs of other nations. Which proviſion, though it proceed chiefly of that plenty which our country yeeldeth, is yet notwithſtanding noted by forraine nations, as of <hi>Hadrianus Barlandus</hi> in a dialogue between the Inhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and the traveller, ſaying in this manner: <hi>Ego curavero ut Anglice, hoc eſt opulentiſſime pariter ac lautiſſime diſcumbant.</hi> Thus much touching the ſituation &amp; temperature of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</hi>

               </hi>) according to that ſaying of Terence, <hi>Id apprime in vita eſſe vtile, ut ni quid nimis.</hi> Every man therefore that hath a care of his health as much as hee may, muſt not onely uſe a meaſure in thoſe five things, that is to ſay, in labour, meate, drinke, ſleepe, and venus, but alſo muſt uſe them in ſuch order as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath propoſed them, that is, to beginne the preſervation of health with labour, after labour to take meat, after meat, drinke: after both ſleepe: and venus laſt of all. And not contrariwiſe, uſing <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> to begin with venus, and to end in labour, like as I have heard ſay of a gentleman who had beene a traveller in forraine countryes, and at his returne, that he might ſeeme ſingular, as it were deſpiſing the old order of England, would not begin his meale with pottage, but inſtead of cheeſe would eate pottage laſt. But wiſe Engliſh men I truſt will uſe the old Engliſh faſhion ſtill: and follow the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> approved by <hi>Galen,</hi> and by common experience in mens bodies found moſt wholeſome. Such as have written of the preſervation of health before mee, for the moſt part have followed the diviſion of <hi>Galen</hi> of things not naturall, which be ſix in number: Ayre, Meat, and Drinke, Sleepe and watch, Labour and reſt, Emptineſſe and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and affections of the minde. Which bee called things not naturall, becauſe they bee no portion of a naturall body, as they bee which bee called naturall things, but yet by the temperance of them the body being in health, ſo continueth by the diſtemperance of them, ſickeneſſe is induced, and the body diſſolved. This diviſion Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Eliot</hi> knight, no leſſe learned than worſhipfull, in his Caſtle of Health hath preciſely followed, and hath ſet forth every part right according to <hi>Galen,</hi> as plaine as may bee, in the Engliſh tongue. Yet (in my iudgement) this Aphoriſme of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which I purpoſe (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to declare, is more evident for the common capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men, and more convenient for the dyet of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Nation. For who is ſo dull of underſtanding that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:8894:9"/>
remember theſe five words, <hi>Labor, Cibus, Potio, Somnus, Venus,</hi> and in uſing them apply <hi>Omnia Mediocria.</hi> Yet I know that the diviſion aforeſaid being well ſcanned may be found in a manner wholly comprehended in this ſhort ſentence. For exerciſe is to be uſed in an wholeſome ayre, and affections of the mind do commonly follow the temperature of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is chiefely preſerved by the moderate uſe of thoſe five things. Then whether we follow in dyet <hi>Galens</hi> diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into ſix things not naturall, or this rule of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> comprehended in five words, there is no great difference, ſaving that in writing for the inſtruction of others, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode is to uſed which is moſt briefe and manifeſt. And this is the cauſe gentle Reader, why I have taken another order than ſuch as have written of this matter before me, even that order (as I thinke) which of all other is the beſt: Herein to give a watch word as it were, or occaſion to others that be better learned and more at leaſure to handle theſe points more perfectly. And in the meane time I truſt every well diſpoſed perſon will thankfully accept this my good intent, conſidering that none other cauſe hath moved mee hereto but onely the good will I beare firſt to the learned ſort, who have moſt need of wholeſome counſayles, and conſequently to all thoſe that loue to live in health. And as the words are placed in order, ſo ſhall in order proſecute them. Yet one thing I deſire of all them that ſhall reade this booke: If they finde whole ſentences taken out of Maſter <hi>Eliot</hi> his Caſtle of Health, or out of <hi>Schola Salerni,</hi> or any other author what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that they will not condemne me of vaine glory, by the old Proverbe (<hi>Calvus Comatus</hi>) as if I meant to ſet forth for mine owne workes that which other men have deviſed: for I confeſſe that I have taken <hi>Verbatim</hi> out of others wher it ſerved for my purpoſe, and eſpecially out of <hi>Schola Salerni</hi>: but I have ſo enterlaced it with mine owne, that (as I think) it may be the better perceived. And therefore ſeeing all my travaile tendeth to common commodity, I truſt every man man will interpret all to the beſt. <hi>Candide lector, etiam atque etiam vale.</hi>

And that fleſh might be more plentifull, and better cheap, two dayes in the weeke, that is Friday and Saturday, are ſpecially appointed to fiſh, and now of late yeares, by the providence of our prudent princeſſe <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Wedneſday alſo is in a manner reſtrained to the ſame order, not for any religion or holineſſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be in the eating of fiſh rather then of fleſh, but only for a civill policy as I have ſaid. That as God hath created both for mans uſe, ſo both being uſed or refrained at certaine ſeaſons, might by that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be more abundant. And no doubt if all daies appointed for that purpoſe were duely obſerved, but that fleſh and fiſh would be much more plentifull, and beare leſſe price then they doe. For accounting the Lent ſeaſon, and all faſting dayes in the yeare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Wedneſday, Friday and Saturday, you ſhal ſee that one halfe of the yeare is ordeyned to eat fiſh in.

But ſuch is the ſelfewill of ſome, and voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of many in this our owne licentious time, that without any reaſonable cauſe, or ſufficient authority, onely to ſatisfie their fleſhly luſt, they will eat fleſh at all times and ſeaſons, yea ſome in contempt of all good order, and as it were deſpiſing all kinds of fiſh, as though God had not created fiſh for our food as well as fleſh, wilfully miſorder themſelves in this behalfe. But this kind of people had need to ſaile to the Iſland <hi>Antycyra,</hi> according to the old proverbe, to have their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8894:90"/>
melancholy ſtrongly purged, leaſt in proceſſe of time they become ſtarke mad. But the reformation hereof I referre to the godly magiſtrates, and returne to my purpoſe. And this generally I ſay of fiſh, that if it bee compared to fleſh, it is of leſſe nouriſhment than fleſh, and the nouriſhment thereof is full of flegmatike ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, cold and moyſt. And of fiſh generally I ſay,<note place="margin">A compariſon betweene fleſh and fiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſea fiſh and river fiſh.</note> that ſea fiſh is of better nouriſhment, then freſh water fiſh of the ſame ſort, becauſe it is not ſo ſuperfluouſly moiſt, by reaſon of the ſaltwater which dryeth and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth. Yet I grant that freſh water fiſh is ſooner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted than ſea fiſh, and therfore better for ſicke folks, becauſe of their feeble digeſtion. And again of ſea fiſh that is beſt which ſwimmeth in a pure ſea, and is toſſed and hoyſed with windes and ſurges. And therfore the fiſh that is taken in the North ſea, which is more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and tempeſtuous, and ſwift in ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is better than the fiſh that is taken in the dead or ſouth ſea. Wherefore, the fiſh that is taken about this our country of Britaine, muſt needes bee very wholeſome. And true it is, as <hi>Doctor Boord</hi> witneſſeth in his Dietary, who was a great traveller,<note place="margin">The felicity of Britaine for fiſh.</note> that no nation under the ſunne is better ſerved with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of fiſh, both of the ſea, and the freſh water than Britaine.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8894:105"/>
and ſtop up the barrell or glaſſe very cloſe with corke and clay, and ſet it ſo that the ſunne may have power upon it, but yet defended from the rayne, and let it ſtand ſo a moneth or ſix weekes or longer, and at the end of Sommer ſtraine the Vineger from the Roſes, and keepe it for your uſe. Or if you would have it ſtronger of the Roſes, ſtraine forth the old Roſes, and put in freſh oftentimes, or if you ſuffer the Roſe leaves to remaine all the yeare in the vineger, it is not amiſſe, for they will not putrifie. After the ſame manner you may make Vineger of Giloflowers,<note place="margin">Vineger of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loflowers.</note> which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before where I intreated of that flower.

               <p>IN <hi>Scho. Sal.</hi> is ſet forth a common ſauce, to be made with ſix things,<note place="margin">

               <p>THe ſecond thing that is to be conſidered in meats (as appeareth by my diviſion) is the quantity, which ought of all men greatly to bee regarded,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</note> for therein lyeth no ſmall occaſion of health or ſickneſſe, of life or death. For as want of meat conſumeth the very ſubſtance of our fleſh, ſo doth exceſſe and ſurfet extinguiſh and ſuffocate naturall heat wherein life conſiſteth. So that the word <hi>Mediocre</hi> which <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> applyeth to all thoſe five things, ſpoken of in this booke, muſt eſpecially bee applyed to meats, that is to ſay, that the quantity of meate be ſuch, as may be well digeſted in the ſtomacke. That it be according to the nature of him that eateth, and not alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appetite. For the temperate ſtomacke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (which is rare to bee found) deſireth ſo much as it may conveniently digeſt.<note place="margin">Three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes.</note> Contrariwiſe the hot ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke doth not deſire ſo much as it may digeſt.

For ſuch is our cuſtome by reaſon of plenty (as I thinke) that they which bee of hability, are ſerved with ſundry ſorts of meat at one meale.

Which is not ſo to bee taken, as the words doe ſeeme to import, that one ought to beginne his Supper or meale with drinke, though I have knowne ſome to uſe that order, drinking a draught of Wine before they eat thereby the better to ſtirre up appetite, and to fortifie concoction. And as good drinkers uſe to ſay,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8894:119"/>
it is great cleanlineſſe to waſh the pot before wee put in meat to bee boyled. But the true meaning of the verſe is, (as <hi>Arnoldus</hi> expoundeth it in the ſame place) that we ſhould beginne our Supper with meats moiſt and eaſie of digeſtion, as Pottage, Broths, and ſuch like; which interpretation, whoſoever ſhall thinke ſtrange, hee may reade the like in <hi>Galen</hi> upon <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> where he ſaith; <hi>Facilius eſt impleri potu quam ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis.</hi> And when Supper is ended,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Apho.</hi> 11.</note> wee muſt not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with goe to bed, but according to the old Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, after Supper walke a mile: or at the leaſt wiſe, refraine from ſleepe two or three houres,<note place="margin">What time the ſtomacke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth for concoction.</note> and if wee make a great Supper, then foure houres is but a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time for the conſuming of the vapours which aſcend from ſuch meat as hath beene plentifully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for,<note place="margin">

omnino tolli non poſſunt.</hi> And commonly ſo it falleth out, that they which lead a diſordered life, either live not untill they be old, or if they come to age, they are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with ſundry diſeaſes, as gowt, ſtone, dropſie, leproſie, fevers and ſuch like. Wherefore it is better to preſerve health by ſobriety, and temperance, than by ſurfet and miſorder, to make the body weake and ſickly, and odious both to God and the world. Yet I thinke it not convenient for a man in perfect health to obſerve a preciſe rule in dyet. But yet where the ſtomacke is feeble, as is of the more part of citizens, and well nigh of all them that be ſtudious in learning, or weighty affaires, there ought to bee more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, that the meate may be ſuch, as that either in ſubſtance, or in quality, or quantity, or time, or order, nature being but feeble, be not rebuked or too much oppreſſed. And the due order in receiving of meats is thus,<note place="margin">The due order of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of meats.</note> that ſuch things as bee of light digeſtion, bee taken before thoſe things that bee hardly digeſted. Alſo that ſuch things as mollifie and looſe the belly be taken before other meates, as pottage, brothes, milke, rere egges, butter, and ſuch like, before fleſh, and boyled fleſh before roſted. And cheeſe and fruits, which be ſtipticke and binding, as Quinces, Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Peares, ſhould be eaten laſt after all other things. And this is the due order in eating, and moſt whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all men, (in my judgement,) which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome men following their owne appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, doe pervert, as I have knowne an honourable perſon, who upon fiſh dayes, would eat Egges laſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cheeſe: and one worſhipfull that would eat milk laſt, which is a common uſe in Lancaſhire: for there the ſervants thinke they have not well dyned or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8894:124"/>
unleſſe they have a ſope of colde milke after all, as they uſe to ſpeake. And the Flemings uſe to eate Butter laſt after other meates. So that almoſt a man may ſay: as divers men deſire divers meates, ſo uſe they divers orders in eating. But here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland where we feed on divers ſorts of meates at one meale, the order commonly is thus: that firſt wee eate pottage or brothes, then boyled meates, after that roſted or baked,<note place="margin">Whether fine meate or groſſe ſhould be eaten firſt.</note> and in the end cheeſe and fruits. But here riſeth a queſtion, which I have heard oftentimes moved at the table: that it were better to eate fine meates firſt, and groſſer meates after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if perchance any corner were left unfilled. For now wee fill our ſelves before with groſſe meates, ſo that when fine meats and the beſt meats indeed come to the boord, we can eate little or nothing for want of appetite, but not for want of will, as I thinke. Wherefore it were better (ſay they) to beginne our meale where we make an end. And if wee leave any for the Servitors, to leave of the worſt meates, and not of the beſt. This is a ſtrong argument in ſome mens opinions, and greatly grieveth thoſe that bee diſciples of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> But this queſtion in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be very well anſwered in this manner. Firſt I ſay that one manner of meat agreeable with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that eateth it, were the moſt ſure dyet for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry complexion. And next I ſay, that for as much as our ſtomacks in England moſt commonly be hot and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke,<note place="margin">The Engliſh cuſtome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, to eat groſſe meates firſt, and fine after.</note> that groſſe meats be moſt convenient to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten firſt, for in a hot ſtomacke fine meats if they were firſt taken, would be burned before the groſſe meates were digeſted. Contrariwiſe in a cold ſtomack the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heat is ſuffocate with groſſe meate, and fine meate
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:8894:125"/>
left raw for lacke of concoction: whereas, if the fine meat be firſt taken moderately, it ſtirreth up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth naturall heat, and maketh it more able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct groſſe meats, if they be eaten afterward, ſo that it be in ſmall quantity. And this is the beſt reaſon that I can yeeld of our Engliſh cuſtome, to beginne our meales with groſſe meats, and to end with fine. And ſo I end my treatiſe of meats.</p>

But withall take good heed that malt bee not above wheat before you part. For it is worſe to be drunke of ale than wine, and the drunkenneſſe indureth longer: by reaſon that the fumes and vapours of ale that aſcend to the head, are
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8894:135"/>
more groſſe, and therefore cannot bee ſo ſoone reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as thoſe that riſe up of wine.<note place="margin">Whether ale or beere be better.</note> If you aske me the queſtion whether ale or beere bee more wholeſome, I ſay that ale generally is better, namely the ſmall ale, which is uſed as well in ſickeneſſe as in health, and that for good cauſe, conſidering that barley, whereof it is made, is commended and uſed in medicine in all parts of the world, and accounted to bee of a ſingular efficacy in reducing the body to good temper, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally which is in a diſtemperance of heat. And for this purpoſe that kinde of ale which at Oxford is called ſixteenes, is principall,<note place="margin">Sixteenes.</note> as by common experience is proved both in hot ſeaſons of the yeare and in hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. But beare for the heat thereof by reaſon of the hops, is not ſo commendable in ſickeneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generally not ſo wholſome. Howbeit in health it is a very profitable drinke (ſo it be not ſtrong) for ſuch as bee chollericke and have hot ſtomacks. For beſide the vertue of nouriſhing, which it hath of the corne whereof it is made, it hath alſo a medicinable property of the hoppes, whereby it provoketh urine,<note place="margin">The vertue of beere.</note> and expelleth ſome choller by ſiege. Wherefore in them that uſe it moderately, it increaſeth ſtrength, as appeareth plainely by the view of thoſe nations that uſe it moſt, for they be ſtrongeſt and faireſt. Beſide that it doth not ſo ſoone hurt the ſinewes, nor cauſe ake of the joynts as wine doth.

               <p>THis much I finde written both touching the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and touching the vertues of <hi>D. Stevens</hi> water. But how true it is I referre to every mans owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. I for my part having made it right according to the preſcription, found the water ſo weake of the wine, ſo ſtrong of the herbs, ſo unpleaſant in taſte, that I was faine to diſtill it againe, and to make it after an other manner. So taking double the ſpices aforeſaid, that is of every ſort a quarter of an ounce, and of every kinde of herbe but halfe a handfull, and not Caſcoyne wine but Sack or very ſtrong Ale, I made a water very ſtrong in taſte, and as I ſuppoſe of great vertue in all the properties aforeſaid. This who ſo liſt to trie ſhall finde true, and let no man condemne me untill he have proved.</p>

But to lie upright upon the backe, or groveling upon the belly is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome. And it is moſt wholeſome to ſleepe firſt on the right ſide, that the meat may the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the bottome of the ſtomacke, and be nearer to the liver. Which is to the ſtomacke as fire to the pot, and after to turne to the left ſide. For this change doth greatly eaſe the body, and helpeth concoction. But to lie upon the backe, cauſeth flegme and other humours to fall into the hinder part of the head, where is the originall of the ſinewes, and by that meane the ſpirits being ſtopped, the nightmare (as they call it) and palſie, and ſuch like maladies be engendred. Again to lie on the belly, draweth the humours to the eyes, and ſo hurteth the ſight. Yet it helpeth them that have feeble digeſtion. And we muſt not onely regard that wee lie on the tone ſide, but alſo that wee lie with our heads ſomewhat high, well bolſtered up, having ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient clothes upon us, leaſt that while naturall heate is within about digeſtion, the outward parts be grieved with cold. It is good alſo to weare a kerchiffe, or ſome ſuch like thing in the night on our heads. But to have the feet covered with ſhoes or otherwiſe, is

For ſuch as bee healthy and ſtrong, need leſſe ſleepe than they that bee ſickely and weake. Children and old folkes need more ſleep than youth and middle age. In winter longer ſleepe is requiſite than in ſommer. Cholericke perſons need leſſe ſleep than flegmaticke, yet in health for the moſt part, 7.8. or 9. houres at the moſt is a ſufficient time for the continuance of ſleepe, as it may be gathered by <hi>Galen.</hi>

Here the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt uttereth that ſome by nature are impotent and unable to fulfill the duty of marriage; others by Art (as by gelding, or ſo) are made unable; and the third ſort is of them which have the gift of continency, and uſe it to ſerve God with more free libertie; which gift notwithſtanding is not common to all men, but is very rare and given to few; whereupon I gather, that ſome may and do live honeſtly unmaried; and ſo I judge of Prieſts, Students, and all other degrees of men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whatſoever.

And in London and in the ſuburbes, there dyed in the ſame diſeaſe in manner within ſixe daies ſpace, in the fifth yeare of Edward the ſixth, eight hundred perſons, and moſt of them men in their beſt yeares. The manner of this diſeaſe was ſuch, that if men did take cold outwardly, it ſtrooke the ſweat in, and immediatly killed them. If they were kept very cloſe and with many clothes, it ſtifeled them and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved nature. If they were ſuffered to ſleepe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they ſwooned in their ſleepe, and ſo departed, or elſe immediately upon their waking. But at length by the ſtudy of phyſicians, and experience of the people, driven thereto by dreadfull neceſſity, there was a remedy invented after this manner. If a man on the day time were taken with the ſweate,<note place="margin">Hall in his Chronicle.</note> then he ſhould ſtreight lye downe with all his clothes, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">The cure of the ſweating ſickneſſe.</note> and lie ſtill the whole 24 houres.

on him that he might in no wiſe provoke the ſweate, but ſo lye temperately, that the ſweat might diſtll out ſoftly of it owne accord, and to abſteine from all meat, if he might ſo long ſuſteine and ſuffer hunger, and to take lukewarme drinke, no more then would delay thirſt, and withall to put forth neither hand nor foot out of the bed, but to avoid cold in every part of the body, and ſo continuing without ſleep in a moderate ſweat for 24. houres; after that time to ſleepe and eat at pleaſure, yet meaſurably for feare of relaps, for ſome were taken thriſe with this diſeaſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the third time dyed of the ſame. Which relaps happeneth likewiſe in the common Plague: for as <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> writeth of his owne knowledge,<note place="margin">

But ſome man will ſay, it is needleſſe now to write of the ſweating ſickeneſſe, becauſe it neither is nor hath beene of long time. Whereto I anſwer, that although it be not at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (God bee thanked therefore) and God defend us from it alwayes) yet by the judgement of ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomers, namely <hi>Francis Keete</hi> a man very well learned in that art, in his Almanacke for the yeare of our Lord God 1575, it was very like to have renued in this our Realme, for as much as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens then were in like order in a manner, as they were at thoſe times before, when that kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſo cruelly raged.
