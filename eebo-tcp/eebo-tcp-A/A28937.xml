            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

About the
EXPERIMENTS
AND
NOTES
Relating to CHYMICAL
Qualities.</head>
            <p>WHen, after I had gone through
the common Operations of
Chymiſtry, I began to make ſome
ſerious Reflections on them, I
thought 'twas pity, that Inſtruments
that might prove ſo ſerviceable to
the advancement of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
ſhould not be more ſtudiouſly
and skilfully made uſe of to ſo good
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109769:2"/>
a purpoſe. I ſaw indeed, that divers
of the Chymiſts had by a diligent
and laudable employment of their
pains and induſtry, obtain'd divers
Productions, and lighted on ſeveral
Phaenomena conſiderable in thier
kind, and indeed more numerous,
than, the narrowneſs and ſterility of
their Principles conſider'd, could
well be expected. But I obſerved
too, that the generality of thoſe that
buſie themſelves about Chymical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations;
ſome becauſe they pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
Phyſick; and others becauſe
they either much wanted, or gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
coveted money, aimed in their
Trials but at the Preparation of
good Medicines for the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or to diſcover the ways of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Diſeaſes or Imperfections of
Metals, without referring their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
to the advancement of Natural
Philoſophy in general; of which
moſt of the Alchymiſts ſeem to have
been ſo incurious, that not onely
they did not inſtitute Experiments
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109769:2"/>
for that purpoſe, but overlookt and
deſpis'd thoſe undeſign'd ones that
occurr'd to them whilſt they were
proſecuting a preparation of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
or a Tranſmutation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.
The ſenſe I had of this too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
omiſſion of the Chymiſts, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
me ſometimes to try, whether
I could do any thing towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of it by handling Chymiſtry,
not as a Phyſician or an Alchymiſt,
but as a meer Naturaliſt, and ſo by
applying Chymical Operations to
Philoſophical purpoſes. And in
purſuance of theſe thoughts, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
I drew up a Scheme of what
I ventur'd to call a <hi>Chymia Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phica,</hi>
not out of any affectation of
a ſplendid Title, but to intimate,
that the Chymical Operations, there
treated of, were not directed to the
uſual ſcopes of Phyſicians, or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muters
of Metals, but partly to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate
or confirm ſome Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Theories by ſuch Operations;
and partly to explicate thoſe Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109769:3"/>
by the help of ſuch Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>But before I had made any great
progreſs in the purſuit of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
the fatal Peſtilence that raged
in <hi>London,</hi> and in many other parts of
<hi>England,</hi> in the years 1664 and 65,
obliging me among the reſt to make
ſeveral removes; which put me upon
taking new meaſures, and engaging
me in other employments of my
time, made me ſo long neglect the
Papers I had drawn up, that at laſt I
knew not where to finde them,
(though I hope they are not yet
miſlaid beyond recovery,) which I
was the leſs troubled at, becauſe the
great difficulties, to be met with in
ſuch an undertaking, did not a little
diſcourage me, ſuch a Task requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as well as deſerving a Perſon
better furniſhed, than I had reaſon
to think my ſelf, with Abilities, Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
Chymical Experiments, and
Conveniences, to try as many more
as ſhould appear needful. But yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109769:3"/>
to break the Ice for any that may
hereafter think fit to ſet upon ſuch a
Work, or to ſhorten my own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
if I ſhould ſee cauſe to reſume
it my ſelf, I was content to throw in
among my Notes about other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Qualities, ſome Experiments
and Obſervations about ſome of
thoſe, that I have elſewhere call'd
<hi>Chymical Qualities,</hi> becauſe 'tis chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Operations of Chymiſts,
that men have been induced to take
ſpecial notice of them. Of theſe
Notes I have aſſigned to ſome Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
more, and to ſome fewer, as
either the nature or importance of
the Subject ſeemed to require, or
my Leiſure and other Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would permit. And though I
have not here handled the Subjects
they belonged to, as if I intended
ſuch a <hi>Chymia Philoſophica</hi> as I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned, becauſe my deſign
did not make it neceſſary, but did
perhaps make it impertinent for me
to do ſo, yet in ſome of the larger
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109769:4"/>
Notes about <hi>Volatility</hi> and <hi>Fixtneſs,</hi>
and eſpecially about <hi>Precipitation,</hi> I
have given ſome little <hi>Specimens</hi> of
the Theorical part of a Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Account of thoſe Qualities or
Operations, that I hope will not be
wholly uſeleſs. I know, it may be
objected, that I ſhould have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Inſtances ſome more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Experiments, if not <hi>Arcana;</hi>
but though poſſibly I am not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unfurniſhed with ſuch, yet
aiming rather to promote Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
than appear a Poſſeſſor of ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
Proceſſes, I declined ſeveral
Experiments that required either
more skill, or more time, or more
expence than could be well expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from moſt Readers, and choſe
rather to employ ſuch Experiments
as may be more eaſily or cheaply
tried, and, which is mainly to be
conſider'd, being more ſimple, are
more clearly intelligible, and more fit
to have Notions and Theories built
upon them; eſpecially conſidering,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109769:4"/>
that the Doctrine of Qualities being
it ſelf converſant about ſome of the
Rudimental parts, if I may ſo call
them, of Natural Philoſophy, it
ſeemed unfit to employ intricate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
and whoſe Cauſes were
liable to many diſputes, to ſettle a
Theory of them. In ſhort, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
being to hold a Taper not ſo
much to Chymiſts as to the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts,
'twas fit I ſhould be leſs ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
to gratifie the former than to
inform the later.</p>
