            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And that same <hi>Baptism,</hi> as it still gives you a <hi>Rejoycing in Christ Jesus our Lord;</hi> so it bids you, by <hi>That rejoycing to die daily,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 31. And indeed you are not <hi>fit</hi> to <hi>live,</hi> till you
<pb facs="tcp:33097:2"/>
are <hi>prepared</hi> to <hi>die.</hi> You are not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>fit</hi> to <hi>live,</hi> unless you <hi>live</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> and if you <hi>live</hi> unto him, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unprepared to <hi>die</hi> unto him. The <hi>Man</hi> lives to himself, and <hi>dies,</hi> as he lives, to his own <hi>corruption;</hi> but the <hi>Christian</hi> lives to his <hi>Saviour,</hi> and accordingly dies to his glorious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord; And whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lords, Rom.</hi> 14. 7, 8. It is a great <hi>priviledge</hi> to <hi>live</hi> to <hi>Christ;</hi> but a far greater priviledge to <hi>die</hi> to him. By living to <hi>Christ</hi> you get the <hi>victory</hi> over your <hi>enemies,</hi> and the terrours of their insolency; but by dying to him, you get the <hi>victory</hi> over your <hi>self,</hi> and the terrours of your own <hi>conscience:</hi> By living to <hi>Christ</hi> you get the conquest over <hi>life;</hi> but by dying to him, you get the conquest over <hi>death:</hi> Neither shall the <hi>world</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:33097:3"/>
be able to make you live <hi>unquietly;</hi> nor the <hi>Devil</hi> be able to make you die <hi>uncomfortably.</hi> So that if you do not want the <hi>preparation</hi> for <hi>death,</hi> you cannot want the <hi>consolation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>death:</hi> And in this respect it were much to be wished, <hi>That all the Lords people were Prophets,</hi> or if they had rather, <hi>Preachers,</hi> to reason with themselves, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> reasoned with <hi>Faelix, of Righteousness, Temperance, &amp; Judgement to come, Act.</hi> 24. 25. That all their <hi>Trembling</hi> or <hi>Quaking,</hi> might begin and end <hi>here,</hi> and none remain till <hi>hereafter:</hi> The <hi>reasoning</hi> about <hi>Righteousness,</hi> how it would confound our misdemeanours against our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi> The <hi>reasoning</hi> about <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> how it would confound our misdemeanours against our <hi>selves?</hi> The <hi>reasoning</hi> about <hi>Judgement</hi> to come, how it would confound our misdemeanours, or rather outrages against our <hi>God?</hi> All these would be speedily confounded by such kind of
<pb facs="tcp:33097:3"/>
                     <hi>reasonings,</hi> though all have been such as have affrighted <hi>Earth,</hi> and amazed <hi>Heaven.</hi> And truly much better were it, that our reasonings should confound our misdemeanours, then that our misdemeanours should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found us; and make us even ashamed, with <hi>Josephs</hi> Brethren, to see the face of our own Brother in this world, and much more afraid, with <hi>Israels</hi> enemies, to see the face of <hi>God</hi> our <hi>Father,</hi> in the world to come. However, whether we will thus turn <hi>preachers</hi> or not unto our selves, yet it is not to be denyed but there are some men who are bound to <hi>preach,</hi> not only to themselves, but also to others; according to that charge committed to them, and that trust reposed in them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 32. <hi>Et tu conversus, confirma Fratres: And when thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren;</hi> For that <hi>Minister</hi> is not truly thankful to <hi>God</hi> for his own <hi>conversion</hi> and <hi>confirmation,</hi> who

Wherefore the true Believer looks upon God in Christ, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.

their Habitation with you, as that they also have Dominion over you. And in this respect doth our blessed Saviour say to the Jews, <hi>ye shall dye in your sins,</hi> That is, in the Guilt, and under the Bondage of your sins, unless by faith in Christ you get out of that Guilt, out of that Bondage; for so it is said, <hi>If ye believe not that 'I am he, ye shall dye in your sins,</hi> John 8. 24. To live out of Christ, is to live in sin: and to live in sin, is the way to die in sin: and to die in sin, is to die eternally: For he that dies in sin, is an eternal sinner, and is therefore justly punished with eternal death. <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit in suo aeterno,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Greg.</hi> He sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his eternity, and yet his whole life was but a span-long. The reason is, <hi>He that sins impenitently, would sin eternally, if he might live eternally.</hi> He sins eternally in his Resolution, though not in his Action, and shews whose child he is, by doing the works of his Father, and wilfully doing them, <hi>The works of your Father ye will do.</hi> A man may do the lusts of the Devil, and yet be the child of God: but he cannot wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do them, and continue in that wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but he must be the child of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: He alone hath Right in him, and he will claim his Right: He will claim him as a

Father claims his child. <hi>For this is the specifical difference betwixt the Regenerate and the Unregenerate; Both are sinners, but the one sinneth eagerly with desire, and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with delight; the other desireth not to sin, and delighteth not in sinning.</hi> Though he may sometimes do the work of the Devil, yet it is against his will, for he Desires and delights to do the work of God. And thats the reason our Blessed Saviour hath taught such a man to call God his Father, and he would not have taught him to call God so, were he indeed not so: For truth teacheth no man to tell a lye, much less in his Prayers: wherefore in that we are taught to say Our Father, it is evident that we are bound to be in the state of Regeneration, or we have no right to say our Prayers. For we are not taught to say Our Father in respect of our corporal Creation, (for so God is the Father of the wicked as well as of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous) but of our spiritual Regeneration: That God is Our Father by spiritual Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, for that according to his Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy <hi>he hath begotten us again, to lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. <hi>For of his own will begat he us with the word of truth,</hi> Jam. 1. 18.

Generation, then are we also his sons by Adoption, and can rightly and truly say Our Father, and all the Petitions after it, without giving the Lie to our own Consciences. Whereas <hi>a man that is in the state of sin, cannot truly say any one Petition of the Lords most Holy Prayer.</hi> He cannot say, Our Father, for he will not be the son of God: He cannot say, Hallowed be thy name, for he delights to profane it: He cannot say, Thy Kingdom come, for he fears nothing more then its coming: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, Thy Will be done, for he resolves against the doing it: Wherefore if you ask me how shall sinners not yet converted say to God, Our Father: I Answer, if they truly desire to be converted, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his children, they may say so, as the Prodigal son resolving to arise and go to his Father, though he were not yet come unto him, had a right of calling him Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18. For an unfained desire of conversion shews a true convert, God accepting the will for the deed, As <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us to will, no less then to do, of his own good pleasure.</hi> And the best man that is, will meet with inextricable Difficulties, if he Ground the Truth of his conversion upon the Ability of his Performance, and

                        <hi>that Acted his part upon the Cross.</hi> And he gives this Reason for it, Because the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Cross was so Covertly foretold, that the Heathen could not understand it. And indeed we do not find in all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Bible so much as the direct name o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> suppose, that if the Heathen had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Prophesies concerning Crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of God, yet they would have thought such a Disgrace not fit to have been Fastened upon any of the sons of their Idol gods; And therefore would rather not have any such Narrative, then have the reproach and shame that accompanied it. But we Christians see the only Son of the only true God, being found <hi>in fashi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap> as a man, humbling himself, and become Obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.</hi> And that for this Reason, That all they should follow the example of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, who do hope to be partakers of his Resurrection: For so himself hath said, <hi>He that taketh not his Cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 10. 38. <gap reason="foreign">

without anothers proferring: He that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it not as a thing belonging to him, but rather as a burden imposed upon him: He that taketh it not where he finds it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is offered him; For that is the proper signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to take a thing of your own Accord, whereas <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is properly to take a thing from anothers hand: And it is observable that our Saviour here saith, <hi>His Cross,</hi> not My Cross, to shew it belongs to us, no less then it did to him: And without doubt he requires every Christian to take up the Cross so willingly, as if it were a matter of choice, not of necessity: such a Treasure as he would take up of himself if it lay in his way, and not tarry till another should bring it him. So desirable a thing is Christs Cross in it self, (though not so to flesh and blood,) were it only for this Reason, that it makes us conformable to himself: It makes a man here on eatth conformable unto him who is the very beauty of heaven; Insomuch that my zeal to the truth bids me say, whiles the Conscience of mine infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity makes me afraid to say it, <hi>I had rather with the Martyrs and Confessors have my Saviours Cross, then with their Persecutors, the Worlds Crown:</hi> And though I much

                        </gap> not disclaim so holy a burden; And indeed if I would adore any Reliques, it should be a piece of that shoulder, which did first help bear my Saviours Cross, for that of all others was certainly most like him, and therefore most worthy of Adoration. But if conformity with Christ in Affliction be not, yet surely conformity with Christ in Glory is exceeding comfortable: And that is yet a third comfort of the Soul in the sickness of the Body whiles it Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the flesh, because Affliction is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary condition of our own Salvation: so saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. For in that we are Joint-heirs with Christ, we must look to come the same way that he did to this Inheritance: That is, we must look to suffer with him, that we may be glorified with him. This consideration alone, That Affliction was so necessary a condition of Salvation, troubled the most Reverend, and most Religious, and most Learned Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi> upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: A man of singular Uprightness and Integrity, and of so exemplary Godliness, that thereby he truly honoured God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted Angels, and converted many men: yet this man upon his Death-bed

having no sin to trouble his Conscience, had this Text to trouble it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.</hi> For not being able on the suddain to Recount his own chastenings, he had some short doubtings in himself concerning Gods love towards him: He thought he had not drank of his Saviours cup; and therefore could not see how he should sit with him in his Kingdom. And yet surely our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words, <hi>ye shall indeed drink of my cup,</hi> Mat. 20. 23. were verified concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saint <hi>John,</hi> no less then concerning S. <hi>James,</hi> though but the one was murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Herod,</hi> the other dyed peaceably in his bed: For even he also was a Martyr in the Preparation of his Soul, (as appeared by his Banishment,) nay indeed he was also a Martyr in the Affliction of his body, though not by a corporal Martyrdom in shedding his blood, yet by a Spiritual Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom in crucifying his flesh, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a continual Death by a daily Mortification: <hi>Martyrium horrore qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem mitius, sed diuturnitate molestius,</hi> as saith Saint Bernard: <hi>Which kinde of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, though it hath less of the Horror, yet hath it more of the Trouble.</hi> For the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coals were not the less hot, because

By Reason; for the understanding in the exercise of its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, needs not the body, but only for some phantasms or representations; but it is manifest that the divine essence is not to be seen by the help of any phantasm or representation: Wherefore since the immediate bliss of the soul consists in the Vision of the divine essence, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depend upon the body, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the soul without the body may be, and is undoubtedly blessed.

From the first the body of Christ was not exempted; from the second our bodies cannot be exempt: The body of Christ which knew no sin was subject to the first degree of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But our bodies that have been all over infected with sin, and defiled by that infection, are also subject to the other two degrees of it. Christ tasted of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. But we must swallow it down; He fed on death, for he tasted it at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Death feeds on us, for we must tast it against our wills; and not only tast it, but also eat it down: Corruption first seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our souls, and from thence pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to our bodies; It was to our greatest disadvantage that it seized upon our souls; But it is to our greatest advantage that it seizeth upon our bodies: For unless they should be quite destroyed, sin which first caused mortality, would in the corrupt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders and Reliques of our bodies, it

self have a kind of immortality, whereas Righteousness alone is, and ought to be immortal: And therefore it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that those who shall be found alive at the last day, (of whom the Apostle hath said, <hi>We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51.) shall have a change, not only Equivalent to a Death, but also to a Total Destruction; For sin must totally be destroyed: And therefore also our bodies that have lodged it, and have been defiled by it; That there may not be left the least monument of sin in the New World, wherein shall dwell nothing but Righteousness, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. And now me thinks I can find a Paradise in Golgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, ever since my Saviour hath been there; and bid hearty welcom to those worms which shall destroy that flesh which would have destroyed me; For I can now safely conclude, that neither in regard of my soul nor of my body ought I to fear Death; which certainly is not so formidable in it self, as it is generally in the worlds opinion: For if the Rule be true, <hi>Nomen quasi Novimen:</hi> The name of every thing is that whereby it is best known and discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then by the name of death we may best know and discern the nature of it: And

these are the chief Names whereby the Scripture expresseth it, <hi>A Sleep; A Change, A Departure, A Dissolution;</hi> and none of all these Names is terrible; and why then should the thing it self be so?

Thus if we do, we shall not

be guilty of any inordinate work, and consequently we shall not fear any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is but the act of some vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or offended Order, Vindicating and Revenging it self: I say, if we live sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and righteously, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world, we shall not need live, and much less die in fear, lest any of those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, under which God hath placed us, should rise up against us to punish and to depress us: But whiles we are under guilt, we cannot possibly be above fear; for it is the property of all Order, to suppress the contrary Disorder, and consequently to punish it; and sin being a breach of these three Orders, the Order of Reason, the Order of Justice, and the Order of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is accordingly punished by them all; And therefore the sinner that hath not his sin forgiven him, cannot be exempted from the fear of all these three punishments; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the fear of internal punishment by the remorse of his own conscience, which proceeds wholly from the Order of Reason, (for it is from Reason that a man hath a conscience, first to admonish him, and at last to torment him, because he would not be admonished) nor from the fear of external punishment by the hand of

outward Government, which will never leave stretching it self out, till it hath reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Malefactor, and brought him to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer according to his doings: nor from the fear of eternal punishment, proceeding from the wrath of God: So nearly doth it concern us to ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Herein a man must exercise by himself, that will exercise himself; for in such depravations and distempers of the world, what he gets of the company, he may chance lose of the exercise: and indeed, since the exercise wholly concerns the conscience, it is most fit that every man exercise both himself and by himself, and accordingly Catechize his own soul, how far he hath had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science void of offence toward God, and consequently in that regard toward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

Therefore still give him, (that is, your blessed Saviour) thanks, whiles your breath is in your body, that he was pleased to die for you; place all your confidence in his death; commit your self wholly to it, involve your self wholly in it, cover your self wholly with it: And if God go about to Judge thee, say unto him, <hi>Lord, I object the death of my Saviour Jesus Christ, between me, and thee, and thy Judgement;</hi> If he say, That thou hast deserved damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then say unto him, Lord, I object the death of my Jesus between me and my evil deservings; And I bring with me the merit of his most worthy Passion, instead of the merits which I should have had, but alas I have not: Then let the sick man say thrice, <hi>Into thy hands Lord I commend my spirit;</hi> and let those that stand by, say so with him; and let him die securely, for he shall never see the Eternal Death.</p>

(for by faith he hath his Saviours worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to make him confident) or out of fear, because of Gods unplacableness, for by hope he hath a cause to rejoyce, not to fear; therefore it is said, <hi>The rejoycing of our hope:</hi> And the same Apostle moreover, gives the reason of this saying, Chap. 4. v. 15, 16. <hi>For we have not an high-Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin; Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need:</hi> What is the hope that we can rejoyce in, but the hope of Eternal Life? And we have this hope, because we have a great high-Priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, <hi>v.</hi> 14. He is passed in before us, to make way for us to follow after him; Nor ought we to be dismayed at our infirmities, since he is touched with the feeling of them; for himself was tempted, to strengthen us in our temptations; that in his strength we should encounter them, and by his strength should overcome them: <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come boldly to the Throne of Grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Wherein we have set forth the manner
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:33097:106"/>
and the reason of our going unto God; The manner, it must be with a holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the righteousness of our high-Priest, <hi>[Let us come boldly]</hi> The reason is two-fold, the first concerns our God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath erected a Throne of Grace to pardon us, not of Judgement to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us <hi>[unto the Throne of grace.]</hi> The second concerns our selves, <hi>That we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy and find grace, to help us in time of need:</hi> What help so welcome, as that which helps in time of need? What time of need so much wants help, as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we can neither help our selves, nor have any else to help us, the Hour of Death, and the Day of Judgement? In this time of need it is, that our high-Priest doth chiefly help us; he will make intercession for us, when we shall not be able to speak for our selves, at the hour of death; he will make answer for us, when we shall not be able to answer for our selves, at the day of Judgement: What though the Devils will then busily accuse me, as long as his righteousness shall be interposed in answer for me? what if my conscience doth condemn me, as long as his satisfaction doth acquit me? Why should not my soul joyfully say, <hi>I will go forth,</hi> (even out of

The third is, That the House whither they are to go, is wholly disposed and ordered by their high Priest, who both guides them in the way, and is ready to receive them at their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, <hi>[Having an high-Priest over the House of God]</hi> These being the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, That the door is open, and we have a right to enter; that the way is both safe and plain; that the House whither we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to go, is wholly ordered by our own high-Priest, who guides us thither, and is ready to receive us there; what else can be the conclusion but comfort and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? what have we else to do, but <hi>to draw near with a true heart, in full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith? A true heart,</hi> that is true to its Saviour, by believing in full assurance of faith; that is true to it self, by drawing near according to that belief: And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Apostles invitation is as urgent for us to draw near to the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, as to the Church Militant, because all power is given to our Saviour Christ, as well in heaven as in earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:33097:107"/>
He hath power over the House of God in heaven, as well as over the House of God in earth: And where he hath power of the House, we need not be afraid to enter: For as he hath made the passage for us, to pass from the bondage of sin and Satan, to come into his Kingdom of Grace: So much more hath he made the passage for us, to pass from his Kingdom of Grace, to come to his Kingdom of Glory: And if we have already passed from Death to Life, much more shall we pass from Life to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life: If we have already passed from Nature to Grace, much more shall we pass from Grace to Glory: For the distance betwixt Nature and Grace is much greater, and harder to be passed, then the distance betwixt Grace and Glory; for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture scarce affords a capacity of Grace, but grace is the very Inchoation of Glory.</p>

Profitable; If thou wilt not help us for our miseries which we have deserved, yet help us for thy mercies which thou hast promised; For thy Goodness is more willing to forgive, then thy power is to punish: And thy blood cryeth much lowder for pardon and forgiveness, then our sins can cry for punishment: Thou hast not yet forgiven so much as thou hast promised; and thou hast not promised so much as thou hast purchased: One drop of thy blood had been a full and sufficient satisfaction for the sins of the whole world, but thou wast pleased to shed many drops of it, to shew that there was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction still left for the sins of many worlds: Lord, hath thy blood satisfied for more sins then we can commit, and shall it not satisfie for those sins that we have forsaken and do detest? Hast thou purchased mercy for more then do repent, and wilt thou not shew mercy on those to whom thou hast given Repentance? Hast thou been so long calling us, that thou shouldst at last reject us? Hast thou so long promised salvation, that thou shouldst at last deny it? Thou hast purchased Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption for us by thy blood, thou hast promised it in thy Word; Thou hast pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:33097:108"/>
more then thou hast promised, and hast thou promised less then thou wilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? I am thy Debtor for the Purchase, and I owe thee more then I am able, if not more then I am willing to pay: But thou art my Debtor for the promise; I could not oblige thee by my desert, but thou hast obliged thy self by thy Word, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is much the stronger for being of thy making, then if it had been of mine. This is the Obligation that I trust to, the Obligation whereby thou art obliged to thy self, to thine own blood, to thine own truth, <hi>Help thy servant whom thou hast Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with thy precious blood,</hi> and to whom thou hast promised the benefit of this Redemption in thy Word: Thou wilt Judge me for those sins for which thou thy self hast satisfied, and is it possible that the sentence of thy Judgement should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annual the merit of thy satisfaction? How comfortable are those words of thine to my guilty soul, <hi>The Father Judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judgement to the Son, John</hi> 5. 22. For when I look upon the Father, I must needs say of him, <hi>Our God is a consuming fire, Heb.</hi> 12. 29. He is as fire, and I am as stubble, easily consumed; my sins have made my soul combustible,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:33097:109"/>
which his goodness had made impassible; Have so much fewel about me and within me, that I cannot but dread the fire: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do most exceedingly rejoyce, that the Father will not Judge me, but hath committed all Judgement to the Son; For in the Son I cannot but see Flesh of my Flesh, and Bone of my Bone; And since <hi>no man yet ever hated his own Flesh, Ephes.</hi> 5. 29. I will not think that the Saviour of man, will be the first to hate that Flesh in me, which he hath in himself; I will then no longer stagger at those words of the Apostle, That <hi>the Lord the righteous Judge hath laid up a Crown of righteousness for them,</hi> and will give it to them, and to them only <hi>that love his appearing,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. For now I my self cannot but love it; I cannot but love his appearing as my Judge, when my soul doth magnifie him as my Lord, and my spirit doth rejoyce in him as God my Saviour: For to me, being thus prepared and disposed as I ought, it is all one to look for that blessed hope, and to look for the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ, <hi>who gave himself for us, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from all iniquity, Tit.</hi> 2. 13. He gave himself for us, that he might redeem
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:33097:109"/>
us from all iniquity; and therefore it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but looking for that blessed hope, to look for his appearing to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of our Redemption. Divines tell us of a three-fold Advent or Coming of Christ to Holy and Religious men; <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ad Redemptionem, Consolationem, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerationem;</hi> his coming to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, to their Comfort, and to their Reward: His first coming was in the Flesh, when he took on him their Nature; His second coming was in the Spirit, when he imparted unto them of his grace: His third coming will be in Power, when he will impart unto them his Glory. His first coming was to Redeem them, his second coming to Comfort them, and therefore his third coming cannot be so much to Judge as to Reward them: Himself hath said no less, <hi>John</hi> 6. 40. <hi>This is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life:</hi> Lord, thou hast opened mine eyes to see thee here by Faith, and wilt thou not hereafter open thy self, that I may see thee by clear Vision? And what priviledge is it, that I may have everlasting life here, where it is not, if I may not have it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, where it is? And yet for strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:33097:110"/>
my faith, thou hast said much more, to shew that I cannot believe enough of thy goodness, <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting life.</hi> And again, <hi>John</hi> 5. 24. <hi>He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life,</hi> (it is as sure as if he had it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) <hi>and shall not come into condemnation,</hi> (though he shall be Judged, yet he shall not be condemned in Judgement) <hi>but is passed from death to life.</hi> He is already passed from the Death of sin to the Life of Grace, and shall assuredly pass from the life of Grace to the life of Glory: And indeed, what is the summe of the whole Gospel, but the Promise of Eternal life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of Faith in Christ? <hi>This is the Record, that God hath given to us Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and this life is in his Son, he that hath the Son hath life,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 11, 12. Have I life, in having thee my Saviour, and can I lose it in having thee my Judge? O the immortal comfort that my soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes, to think, that though I have been to my Master in heaven, a far worse servant then <hi>Onesimus</hi> was to <hi>Philemon,</hi> not only to run away from him, but also to rob him, yet upon my true Repentance, my Saviour will say to his Father on my behalf, as
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:33097:110"/>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did to his friend, <hi>If thou count me a Partner,</hi> (and truly, he is his Partner in the same God-head) <hi>receive him as my self,</hi> (now he is invested with my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness) <hi>if he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account:</hi> (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon, v.</hi> 17, 18.) O Lord, I owe thee so much, that I can never say suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, and much less may leave off say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Forgive us our debts;</hi> yet since thou hast already put my debts upon thy Sons account, how wilt thou let them lie still on mine? Didst thou not punish thy Son, that thou mightest spare thy servant? Or canst thou in Justice punish the same sin twice, once in my Surety, another time in me? It was the great necessity of thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Justice to punish the sin; and is it not as great a necessity of thy satisfied Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, to spare the sinner? I will not then say, He is to be my Judge, whose Majesty I have honoured, whose mercy I have embraced, whose glory I have promoted, whose good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I have proclaimed, whose presence I have desired, for if I have done any of these, yet twas not I, but <hi>the grace of God which was with me,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. And yet for that very cause alone I must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that those are thrice happy, who have
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:33097:111"/>
so far been assisted by Gods grace, that they can, not Pharisaically, but Truly say this; for though it was his meer mercy to give the grace, yet it is in some sort his Justice, both to continue, and to regard his own gift; So saith Saint <hi>Paul, God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, or unjust, to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed towards his Name, Heb.</hi> 6. 10. where this is in effect his argument; He that desists from a just work, justly begun, is unjust; But God is not unjust; therefore he will not desist from those good works he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in you, so far as not to perfect them, and much less so far as not to reward them, But I am contented to pretend to no such happiness. This is the immortal comfort of the Righteous; Let my soul look after the comforts of the sinner, wherein I am not like to have the less remedy, because I am sure to have the more company: I will say then, He is to be my Judge, whose Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty I have contemned, whose mercy I have neglected, whose glory I have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whose goodness I have denyed, whose presence I have shunned: But withall, he is to be my Judge for those sins for which I have already Judged and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned my self; and will he for these,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:33097:111"/>
Judge and condemn me the second time? This is scarce agreeable with his Justice, much less is it agreeable with his mercy; For the Apostle saith, <hi>If we would Judge our selves, we should not be Judged,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. I ask, how should we not be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? not temporally? that were not to be loved; For <hi>whom he loveth he chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Heb.</hi> 12. 6. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>That Judgement must begin at the House of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17. and sure we are, that his love begins there, and comes down to particular men but as they are parts of his Family or Houshold; we must therefore say, That if we would Judge our selves, we should not be Judged Eternally; For most universally true, is that Rule of the Civil Law, <hi>Favores sunt Ampliandi,</hi> all matters of Favour are to be enlarged: Gods mercies if they could be with Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they could scarce be without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and what a cruel mercy were this, not to Judge Temporally, that he might Judge Eternally? I say then, I have Judged my self for all my sins, and therefore believe that I shall not be Judged of the Lord; that is, not so Judged as to be condemned in the Judgement: For sin, as it must be Judged, so it can be Judged but once: If I
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:33097:112"/>
have Judged my self for it, I shall not be Judged of the Lord: I shall then be enabled to pray in Faith unto my Saviour, <hi>Enter not into Judgement with thy servant, Psal.</hi> 143. 2. And I am sure, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus in Faith, I shall find him my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and not my Judge. Why should I then be dismayed for fear of that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he is to be the Judge, who at first suffered for me as my Surety, that he might satisfie his Fathers Justice, and my debts: Hath ever since prayed for me as my Intercessor, and will at last Plead for me as my Advocate?</p>

                     <p>THere is none that is guilty, but the Law will; none that is innocent, but the Judge may condemn him: what then can be the comfort of a Malefactor, but that he shall have his Tryal by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Law, and by a more favourable Judge? And this is my comfort against the Judgement to come, That my Judge will proceed to a favourable Trial with me, because according to that Law which will not easily condemn me, and with that mind which will readily acquit me: For I have confessed my sins, and therefore may not doubt but that <hi>He is faithful and just to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me my sins, and to cleanse me from all unrighteousness,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. He is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to forgive my sins, because himself hath promised forgiveness; He is just to forgive my sins, because his Son hath purchased forgiveness; And how shall he then not cleanse me from all unrighteousness by his Holy Spirit, and seal unto me the assurance
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:33097:113"/>
of that forgiveness? And if I be cleansed from all unrighteousness, why should I not be rid of all my fears? How can I look upon him as an angry Judge, when I have found him a most merciful Father? <hi>If God will not withdraw his Anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him, Job</hi> 9. 13. That is, the Angels (saith <hi>Jarhci)</hi> that are the Helpers of Egypt; for he there takes <hi>Rahab</hi> for Egypt, (as indeed it may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,) which we interpret Proud; And proves out of <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 13. That particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nations have particular Angels, as it were their Patrons in heaven, ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede on their behalf: Some late Divines have unadvisedly enlarged those Patrons, finding out amongst men some tutelarie Saints, which having righteousness over and above to serve their own turn, are able to spare enough to help others: Hence that strange kind of Invocation, <hi>O Thomas Didyme succurre nobis miseris, ne damnemur cum impiis, in adventu Judicis:</hi> O good Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> help us, that we be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the last Judgement; when alas, the Saints will have enough to do to help themselves; and the best of them all may say to his Petitioner, If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:33097:113"/>
2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 27. But be it so, that there may be Phansied such lofty and puissant Helpers, for they can never be Proved; yet sure we are, that if God withdraw not his anger, even those Helpers must stoop under him; as it is said, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Behold he put no trust in his servants;</hi> that is, his Saints, his best servants; for the Text makes it an universal Negative, admitting of no exception; and we may not doubt it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any man, when we cannot deny it concerning any Angel, as it follows, <hi>And his Angels he charged with folly:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if these mighty Helpers cannot in this day of anger help themselves, much less can they help me: If God withdraw not his anger, they must stoop; and if they must stoop, all that lean and rely upon them, must needs fall. I will then look after such an Helper as may be able to stand himself, and to support me; for else it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be worth my while, and much less worth my Devotion to pray to him for help; and truly I can find none but the Eternal Son of God, who is able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the anger of his Father, because he was able to satisfie his Justice; and yet having him my Helper, it will not be safe for me to argue and dispute, but only to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33097:114"/>
pray and deprecate, as it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Whom though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my Judge:</hi> And what is the supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I would make unto him? Even that which his own holy Spirit hath taught me to make, and will cause him to hear, <hi>That he will not be extream to mark what is done amiss, Psal.</hi> 130. 2. <hi>Lord hear the voice of my supplications;</hi> for what? even for this, that thou shouldst not mark ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; as it follows, <hi>If thou Lord shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou maist be feared.</hi> This is the favourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding by which I hope to be acquitted; for why hast thou taught me to believe the forgiveness of sins, unless I may attain what I do believe? And if I may attain forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my sins here, how shall I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or punished for them hereafter? since that is no forgiveness, which either holds guilty to condemn, or holds as guilty to punish and torment: I do then believè that God will proceed in Judging me, not according to the Law which requires an absolute obedience without sin, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Gospel which admits of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the forgiveness of sins: Thus
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:33097:114"/>
hath the Doctor of the Gentiles long since determined, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>In the day when God shall Judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel;</hi> Not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law which will condemn all that have been guilty of any sin, but according to the Gospel which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn none but the unbelieving and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinners: For the Gospel pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth sentence of Absolution to all that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; So <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned;</hi> Where damnation is denounced, not for breaking the Law, but for rejecting the Gospel: And again, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> The words speak four such truths as the Angels desire to look into, and men can never enough look upon, yet four Miracles rather then Truths. 1. That God who was provoked to inflict Death, should offer Life, and that Everlasting Life. 2. That he should offer it to the world which had so provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him. 3. That he should offer it, by sending his only begotten Son away from himself into the world. 4. That he should
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:33097:115"/>
so send this Son as to give him, giving his only Son, the Son of his love, to give life to those that hated him, and more deserved his hatred; <hi>That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> Since then I know that I believe, why should I fear that I shall perish? Why should I think that I shall not have this everlasting life, which the Father hath promised, the Son hath purchased, and the Holy-Spirit hath sealed; for I can say, with a thankful heart and a chearful voice, <hi>In Te Domine speravi, ne confundar in aeternum,</hi> Psal. 71. 1. <hi>In thee O Lord have I put my trust, let me never be put to confusion, deliver me in thy righteousness:</hi> I pray not to be delivered in mine own righteousness, but in thine; Deliver me in thy Righteousness O God the Father of heaven, for thou hast promised deliverance; Deliver me in thy Righteousness O God the Son Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the world, for thou hast pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased deliverance; Deliver me in thy Righteousness O God the Holy-Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, for thou hast sealed both the Promise and the purchase of deliverance; Deliver me in thy Righteousness, O Holy, Blessed and Glorious Trinity, three Persons and one
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33097:115"/>
God, for I trust on thy Promise, on thy Purchase, on thy Seal for deliverance: <hi>For with thee is the Fountain of life, in thy light shall we see light, (Psal.</hi> 36. 9.) My soul desires nothing but Life and Light; for as a Spirit she was made for Life; as an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual or Rational spirit she was made for Light: And she must go to God for both; She must go to him for Life, <hi>for with thee is the Fountain of Life;</hi> and she must go to him for Light, for in thy Light shall we see Light: And the Life is before the Light, even as Living is before Seeing: The soul cannot work before she sees, and she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see before she lives, so that Life is in truth given before the work, and cannot possibly be given for it: And will you know who gives both Life and Light? Saint <hi>John</hi> will tell you, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. <hi>In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men;</hi> Life and Light both proceed from the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God; and Life before Light; I had Life in him, before I had Light from him; He purchased the Life, before he gave the Light, and therefore sure he hath not given the Light to take away the Life. I know it is said, <hi>That we must all appear before the Judgement-seat of Christ, that every one may bear the things done in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33097:116"/>
according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I have done very bad things in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but since my Saviour hath already born them for me, must I still fear to bear them for my self? Christ is called The Mediator of the New-Testament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. It is not said, The Mediator of the New-Covenant, (as in other places) but of the New-Testament; for a Covenant doth wholly depend upon mutual conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which if either partie fail, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is broken, and made of none effect; But a Testament is a thing meerly of Grace and Liberality, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and so may be fulfilled, meerly out of the goodness of the Testator: And this goodness is the support and comfort of my soul; I am afraid of the Covenant, and I flie to the Testament, even to that Testament by which I am made a child, an heir, even an <hi>heir of God, and joint heir with Christ, Rom.</hi> 8. 17. Wherefore I cannot but hope that he will Judge to me the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which he hath already given me by his own Will and Testament: For I look for him to <hi>appear the second time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin unto salvation, Heb.</hi> 9. 28. not only without sin in himself, for he never had
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:33097:116"/>
any, but also without sin in me and all his members, from whom he hath taken away all: For the death of Christ is doubly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to all true Believers; First in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his Priest-hood, that he hath expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated their sin. Secondly in respect of his Testament, That he hath given them an Inheritance; I dare not deny the first, the benefit of his Priest-hood; for he is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world; And why should I doubt the second, the benefit of his Testament, since he did therefore take away the sin, that he might give the Inheritance?</p>
                     <p>I confess, that the <hi>unrighteous shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. whether Fornicators, or Idolaters, or Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, or Thieves, or Covetous, or Drunkards, or Revilers, or Extortioners, or guilty of any other kind of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness like to these; but my belief is, That I having repented of my unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and forsaken it, shall no longer be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as unrighteous: For so it follows, <hi>such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus; and by the Spirit of our God;</hi> In that it is said, ye were such before ye were washed, and justified
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33097:117"/>
in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Spirit of our God, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that after your Justification and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification you are not such. Be it then taken for granted, which cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for truth himself hath said it, <hi>That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof at the day of Judgement, Mat.</hi> 12. 36. yet sure, not if they have given an account of it already; or rather, Christ hath given an account for them, in that they have by a lively faith embraced his All-sufficient satisfaction, and by an earnest Repentance are admitted to it and instated in it: Their sins shall be laid open before the face of men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as <hi>Davids,</hi> or as Saint <hi>Peters,</hi> to the glory of Gods Justice in acquitting them; not as <hi>Sauls</hi> or <hi>Judas's,</hi> to the glory of Gods Justice in condemning them.</p>
                     <p>If it shall be Recorded, (for it is a Problem of Divinity, that the Text hath not so positively determined, but that learned men think they may abound in their own sense concerning it) I say, if it shall be Recorded how <hi>David</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sinned, it shall also be Recorded how they repented: If it shall be declared th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33097:117"/>
loved this present world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. it shall also be declared, that the same <hi>Demas</hi> did afterwards repent and turn back again to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whiles he was still a Prisoner of Jesus Christ, and then became his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer, Epist. to <hi>Philemon, v.</hi> 24. For without doubt, as much as they shall be terrified at the sight of their sins, so much they shall be comforted at the sight of their faith and repentance. <hi>In Christo simul summum Gaudium &amp; summa Tristitia,</hi> saith <hi>Gabr. in</hi> 3. <hi>sent. dist.</hi> 15. In Christ there was the greatest Joy and the greatest Sadness at the same time, though not in the same respect; his Joy was from his union with God; his Sadness was from his union with man, and the imputation of our sins: And possibly (think some) it may be so with the best Christians, in that great and dreadful day, when their bodies shall be re-united with their souls, and all their sins represented, whether of Body or of Soul: They may have the greatest sorrow (say they) in regard of themselves and of their own sins; and yet have the greatest Joy in regard of their Saviour, and of his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for <hi>Onesiphorus, That he may find mercy of the Lord in that day,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18. Therefore it is probable
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:33097:118"/>
he shall need mercy in that day, though he shall not need so much as he shall find: And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of <hi>blotting out sins in the times of Refreshing and Restitution of all things, Acts</hi> 3. 19, 21. that is, at Christs second coming; for till then there will not be a restitution of all things: And this consideration, though it is not cause enough why the living should pray for the dead, (and yet without doubt, it is one of the best causes that can be alledged) yet sure it is cause more then enough why the living should pray for themselves, even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Justification, and still say, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our trespasses:</hi> For it seems there is some kind of forgiveness, at least a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Absolution, reserved until the day of Judgement. What is it then? will there be the same terrour to the just and to the unjust? No doubtless: And this may appear from the very Titles which are given by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. And they are three, <hi>A day of Wrath, A day of Revelation, and A day of Righteous Judgement.</hi> The day of Righteous Judgement doth equally concern all sinners, whether they have been Penitent or Impenitent; but the day of Wrath concerns only the Impenitent
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:33097:118"/>
sinners; and the day of Revelation doth likewise chiefly, if not only, concern them: I say, the day of wrath concerns only the Impenitent sinners, such as after their hardness and impenitent hearts, have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured up unto themselves wrath against the day of wrath: But to those that have faithfully and penitently served God (for true Faith never yet went without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) it will be a day of Exultation and Redemption; he hath called it so, that hath made it so, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 27, 28. <hi>Then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory, sc.</hi> to Judge the world: But what then? must ye therefore (that have been his Disciples and Followers) be terrified, as if he were coming to take Vengeance of you? No, you must then look up, and lift up your heads, for your Redemption draweth nigh: This same day, that is to them a day of Vengeance and a day of Wrath, is to you a day of Redemption, to lift up your heads, and much more a day of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulcation to lift up your hearts: And so also the day of Revelation, doth chiefly, if not only, concern those who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the day of wrath; for, as for the Believers and the Penitent, if there
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33097:119"/>
shall be any Revelation of their sins (for some do doubt it) it shall be so in order to Gods Justice, as not to their punishment: For the Text plainly saith of them, <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more, Jer.</hi> 31. 34. And so again, <hi>All his transgressions that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, shall not be mentioned unto him;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall be done concerning the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his sins, shall be done only that Gods Justice may be cleared in his Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not that his soul may be terrified by the Representation. What then, though I shall see, with <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> a hand sent unto me with a Roul, a dismal Roul, written within and without full of all the sins that ever I committed in Thought, Word and Deed, as long as I shall not see written therein, Lamentations, and Mourning, and Wo unto the sinner? For Christ Jesus that came into this world to save sinners, will assuredly in the next world compleat that salvation: I will then willingly say with Saint <hi>Paul, Quorum primus Ego, Of whom I am chief,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. Or with the antient <hi>Missal. (Dominica secunda post Epiph. feria quarta) Quorum primus Ego Ego sum, Of whom I, I am chief.</hi> The earnestness of my Repentance, shall bring
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33097:119"/>
me to an often Repetition of my sins; I will rather add to their number in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of them, then diminish from it; I will rather say, That I am a double sinner, then that I am no sinner: For being a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner, that is, one of those sinners that Christ came to save, as I have been chief in the sin, so I shall be chief in the salvation: The more I have seen mine own sins, the more I shall see the salvation of my God: It is a most comfortable observation of Divines, That our Saviour Christ is now here in all the Bible called invisible; And therefore that Doxologie in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Now unto the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever, Amen;</hi> is to be expounded of God the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Word invisible is in it; and our Saviour Christ is now here in all the Bible called invisible: And truly, blessed be his mercy, I have hitherto found it so; for when I have most seen my sins to trouble me, I have most seen his salvation to relieve me: And sure I am, that though my sins should be never so visible at the last day, yet they shall not be half so visible as my Saviour: For I shall then certainly with Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> see Jesus standing on the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33097:120"/>
right hand of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 55. I shall see him standing up, as ready to give sentence; but surely that sentence will be for me, not against me; For he is not willing to give sentence against me; but sure he cannot give sentence against himself, that is, against his Word; For a sentence against his Word, is against himself: His Word therefore being the truth, because it is his Word, who is the truth: Therefore the sentence that shall be given at the last day, can be no other then what is given already, in Gods Word and in mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; His Word hath pronounced a merciful sentence, and I must never leave Rectifying my conscience, till that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce sentence according to his Word.</p>

                     <p>A Sentence that is resolved on before the hearing of the cause (though not pronounced till after it) must needs be the sentence of an unrighteous Judge, and is most like to be the sentence of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteons Judgement; <hi>But shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

I answer, The cause is heard here, and the sentence is pronounced here, though many men will not take notice of it; And that which shall be pronounced hereafter, shall not be a new sentence, but a Publication of the old; which may not unfitly be called an old sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, since it hath been twice pronounced here already, once in Gods Word, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time in our own consciences; For the

Spirit of God doth here Judge us in Gods Word; And the Son of God will not thwart or contradict the Judgement of Gods Spirit, but only ratifie and confirm it: <hi>The word that I have spoken, the same shall Judge him at the last day; John</hi> 12. 48. that is, the sentence at the last day shall be but a declaration and confirmation of the sentence that is already spoken in the Word: And haply in this respect it is said, That the Apostles shall Judge the world, not only in regard of their persons, as all other Saints shall Judge it, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the sentence of the righteous Judge; but also in regard of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which shall be the rule of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Wherefore if we can have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from the sentence that is already passed upon us by the Apostles, we may have also comfort from the sentence that will be passed upon us by their Master: And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we be not Hypocrites or Apostates, but true and constant Christians, we may have very great comfort from the sentence that is already passed upon us by the Apostles: A comfort which no partial Judge here can give us, though he resolve to come with <hi>omnia bene,</hi> and to admit of none but of white suffrages: for in vain doth

Christian Consolation: For God himself hath said, <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, Isa.</hi> 40. 1. They that are Gods people, may not be deprived of Gods comforts: And what are his comforts? but (as it follows) that our warfare is accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our iniquity is pardoned: The beginning of the pardon, is the end of the war; her warfare is accomplished, and her iniquity is pardoned, do both speak one and the same comfort unto the soul, do both signifie one and the same peace: <hi>Completa est malitia ejus,</hi> saith the Vulgar translation, for <hi>militia,</hi> by a small mistake of the letter, as we may suppose, but none of the sense; For our <hi>malitia</hi> is our <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> our iniquity is our warfare; The Hebrew word here used, signifies not only the work, but also the time of war: And <hi>Rabbi David</hi> saith, the Prophet here means The time that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was to pass in Banishment or Captivity: So that if we joyn the Text and the gloss together, we shall find, that sin is a time of war, of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and of captivity: Of war with God; of banishment from God: And of captivity, not under God, for he can be no Tyrant, but under the Devil: A sad time certainly, as full of fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:33097:123"/>
as empty of joyes and comforts; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> pardoned: To say this, is to speak truly to the heart, which is the Hebrew expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for speaking comfortably: All other comforts go no farther then the ear then the outward man, that his stock is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, his request granted, his cause ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; it is only this comfort that enters into the heart, and revives the inner man, that the time of his warfare, banishment, and captivity are at an end, because his sin is pardoned: And this is the comfortable sentence that is already pronounced in Gods Word, <hi>That he pardoneth and absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all them which truly repent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly believe his holy Gospel:</hi> All our labour must be to get this same sentence derived from Gods Word into our own consciences; And then surely, in the mouth of two such witnesses (the least whereof is no less then a thousand) it is no doubt but the testimony will be fully and firmly established: For as the word doth witness the thing infallibly true in it self; so will the conscience witness it insallibly true to us: The use of a witness is either
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:33097:123"/>
for information in defect of evidence, or for confirmation in defect of assurance; and an infallible witness is both these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; For he gives evidence from his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, and assurance from his infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Such an infallible witness is a good conscience, that is grounded and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Word of God, and thence collecteth this comfortable sentence; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever truly believeth and heartily repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, shall not come into condemnation; But I do truly believe, and heartily repent; therefore I shall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The major proposition is clear by the testimony of Gods Word; the minor is clear by the testimony of our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, which can certainly tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be hypocrites or true Believers; whether we be Sheep to hear the voice of Christ, and to follow him, that he may give us eternal life, <hi>John</hi> 10. 27, 28. or whether we be Goats to follow our own hearts lusts, so to persist and perish in our sins: and the conclusion cannot but follow the premises. Read over the sentence that is set down, <hi>Matthew</hi> 25. and thou wilt easily, by comparing thine own actions with that sentence, see whether at the last Judgement thou art to be set on Christs
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:33097:124"/>
right hand or on his left: Thou wilt easily see which part of that sentence concerns thee; And that part which thine own conscience pronounceth of thee here, thy Judge will both pronounce and confirm hereafter: I hope that with <hi>Mary</hi> thou hast chosen that good part, and if so, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but assure thee, it shall never be taken from thee, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. For Christ will never reject any man that hath sate at his feet to exercise his humility and patience; and heard his Word, to exercise his Piety and Obedience: He will never say, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, to those who here did love his company, and enjoy his communion: And what is their work who are of his communion, but to know, and love, and praise him? And they that are thus of his communion on earth, can you think he will excommunicate in heaven? Saint <hi>John</hi> sets forth this Judgement of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science very fully in few words, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 19, 20, 21. saying, <hi>v.</hi> 19. And <hi>hereby,</hi> (that is, by loving in deed and in truth, not in word or in tongue, as appears from the former verse,) <hi>we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him;</hi> That is, we know that we truly love him, and therefore may be well assured of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33097:124"/>
his love; For he that loves is assured of love; for which cause <hi>Beza</hi> thus renders Saint <hi>James</hi> his words, <hi>Mercy rejoyceth against damnation, James</hi> 2. 13. For he that is truly merciful, hath a special promise to assure him of mercy, that he shall not be condemned in the last Judgement; and this hard-hearted Age of ours would doubtless much more incline to mercy, if we did seriously consider, that the sentence of condemnation <hi>(Mat.</hi> 25.) is denounced against the unmerciful; not against the unjust for taking away, but against the unmerciful for not giving; but yet if against the unmerciful, much more against the unjust; for as justice is before mercy in order of nature, so is also injustice before unmercifulness; wherefore though we discourse of assuring our hearts before God more then any others, yet we must needs have a much less assurance of his love, because we our selves know that we do love only in word and in tongue, not in deed and in truth; as it follows <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can and will condemn us much more then our heart; for this is the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words, not (as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

explained) That we ought to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the greatness of Gods mercy being ready to acquit us, against the sentence of our own heart that is ready to condemn us; For indeed the words are not spoken to comfort a distressed, but to terrifie a guilty conscience: It being the Apostles intent to perswade us above all things both to get and to keep a good conscience, that we may not condemn our selves, and then we may be assured that our God will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us; as it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>For if our heart condemn us not, then have we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards God, sc.</hi> that he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us; For the whole argument in brief is this; If our conscience now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, God will also condemn us at the last day: But if our conscience acquit us, God will also then acquit us; the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acting Gods part before hand, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the guilty, and acquiting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; whether they have the first Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that of Righteousness; or the second Innocency, that of Faith and Repentance: and the same Doctrine is again re-inforced, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 17, 18. <hi>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of Judgement, because as he is, so are we in this world:</hi> Here is both the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:33097:125"/>
and the ground of it, the good Conscience: The confidence is, <hi>That we may have boldness in the day of Judgement;</hi> The ground of that confidence is this good conscience, <hi>Because as he is, so are we in this world;</hi> for this is in effect the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism: Whosoever is here like him in Piety, shall hereafter be like him in Glory: but we that truly believe in him, are here like him in Piety, therefore we shall also be like him in Glory: He that hath that Good confidence, upon this Good conscience, as he may not be ashamed of his hope, so he shall not be disappointed of it; for he is sure to stand in the last Judgement, because he hath the Eternal Son of God to support him; on the one side with his All-sufficient merits, on the other side, with his All-sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercies: Two such supporters, to which he cannot trust too much, for which he cannot glorifie Christ enough, though he glorifie him world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Who shall declare his Generation?</hi> For he was begotten of his Father before all worlds; But who shall declare my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? for I was corrupted when I was begotten by my Father, before I came into the world: He was taken away by death, but he was taken away from a mortal, a miserable, and a contemptible life; so let me be taken away (good Lord) from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, misery and contempt, to Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Blessedness and Glory.</p>
                     <p>My life hath not left much for my death to take away from me; Lord let my death take from me all that is left but my Saviour, and let it fully give me him.</p>
                     <p>He was brought to prison that he might be Judged, and he was brought to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he might be condemned; and his
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:33097:128"/>
death was his Release, both from Prison and from Judgement: Lord make my death so to me: make my death my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease from prison; for whiles I am in the body, I am imprisoned, fettered with the bonds of sin and corruption: But <hi>bring my soul out of this prison, that I may praise thy name; then the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me; (Psal.</hi> 142. 7.) A most happy <hi>Goal-Delivery</hi> for my soul, for then the Righteous shall compass me about, and not sinners; nay more, then I shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed about with Rightousness, who now am compassed about with sins, and that not so much with other mens, as with mine own sins: Thus make my death my Release from Prison, and make it also my Release from Judgement: For thy Son hath been Judged and condemned for me, that I might escape the Judgement of thy condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Lord I ask not that thou wouldest not Judge me (for <hi>after death comes Judgement, Heb.</hi> 9. 27.) I ask only that thou wilt not condemn me when I shall be Judged: And this is agreeable with thy very Justice (though I wholly appeal unto thy Mercy) not to condemn and punish the same sin twice: Thou hast already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:33097:128"/>
and punished my sins in my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; O then let me escape thy condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and thy punishment: He was Judged for mine Unrighteousness; O let me stand in the Judgement for his Righteousness. <hi>For the transgression of my people was he stricken:</hi> Lord thou hast placed me among thy people, and therefore I must believe that he was stricken for my transgressions; Nay, thou hast brought me nearer to thee, and made me one of thine own Family, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving admitted me thy servant: Nay, thou hast brought me yet nearer to thee, and made me one of thine own Inheritance, having adopted me thy child. I deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to be among thy people, and I am placed among thy servants; I deserved not to be among thy servants, and I am accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among thy children. O then correct me good Lord, as a Father in thy Pitty, to amend me, not as a Judge in thy Fury to confound me: Thou didst redeem me with thine own most precious blood, that thou mightest convert me: And how then wilt thou Judge me, being redeemed with that blood, that thou maist condemn me? Well may my sins be condemned of thee who art the Righteous Judge; for I who have been the sinner, and who still am an
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:33097:129"/>
unrighteous man, cannot but condemn them, and my self for them: But surely thy precious blood can never come under condemnation; nor my soul, whiles thou lookest upon it as washed with that blood.</p>
                     <p>Thus thou hast given me a pledge of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering my soul from the terrours of my death by conquering them; and from the severity of Gods Justice, by satisfying it; And thou hast also prepared a deliverance for my body: for in that thou madest thy <hi>grave with the wicked</hi> in thy death, thou hast sanctified the grave as a Repository for my dead body, till my flesh shall be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wasted therein, and with my flesh, all the sin and wickedness which hath so long dwelt in it, and cannot be destroyed before it: And thou wilt at last raise me from thence after thine own likeness, that I may come from the grave, as thou didst go to it, not having violence in mine hand, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt in my mouth, nor wickedness in mine heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lord let it be thy pleasure thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me; Make hast O Lord to help me:</hi> Take away all my sin from my soul, and then (as soon as thou pleasest) take away my
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:33097:129"/>
soul from my body: That having no unrepented sin in my life, I may have no unsufferable sorrow in my death; but may find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it, deliverance by it, and glory after it.</p>

And if I look up to heaven, I shall soon spie there a bright cloud, even <hi>a cloud of witnesses,</hi> to enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me, that I stumble not in my waies for any darkness of my understanding: And if I look up yet higher through that cloud, I shall behold a far greater light, even the

Sun of righteousness to enflame me and to quicken me, lest I should sit still, when I am bound to be walking, for the dulness of my will, and the deadness of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for above that cloud dwelleth he who is the <hi>brightness of Gods glory, and the express Image of his person,</hi> Heb. 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore my sight may not be termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated or bounded by this cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: But through it I must be looking unto <hi>Jesus the Author and Finisher of my Faith,</hi> if I desire the comfort of my faith when I most want it, even in the day of my visitation, and at the hour of my dissolution.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, where should a good Christian fix either his eye or his heart, but only on Christ? And I may here see Christ in his Mystical body, that is, in his Church, the <hi>cloud of witnesses;</hi> And Christ in his natural body, that is, in himself, Jesus <hi>the Author and Finisher of our Faith:</hi> And the same Christ in either body, <hi>destitute, afflicted, tormented.</hi>

                     <p>O Lord, how many arguments are here alledged to perswade me to behave my self with great constancy, humility and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in those conflicts and agonies which I
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:33097:130"/>
must expect as a Christian, unless I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce communion with Christ, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace an unwarrantable and an unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Christianity? I think there is a Lyon in the way (as said <hi>Solomons</hi> sluggard) ready to devour me; and I see nothing but briers and thorns in it, ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle my feet, and to tear my flesh; But God telleth me, it is the ready way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the <hi>Race</hi> that I must run if ever I hope to get thither; <hi>Let us run with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the race that is set before us:</hi> If it be my race, then I must run it; if it be set, then I cannot remove it; if it be set before me, then I cannot decline it.</p>
                     <p>And truly I cannot deny but it is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me by the dispensation of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the indispensable Duty of my Christian vocation: And therefore I give him hearty thanks, that he hath so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed unto me the manner of running this race, and the reasons that I have to run it.</p>
                     <p>The manner of running this race is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                     <p>First, I must forsake my self, and all my selfishness; that is, all those things to which I have naturally an immoderate desire, and in which I have naturally an immoderate
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:33097:131"/>
delight; <hi>let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us:</hi> For what am I, or what is my flesh but a weight that doth beset me, rather then befriend me, even an unprofitable, and an unsufferable burthen? And what else com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from me, or cleaveth to me, but only sin? Which living in me, cannot but work with me, <hi>(Operari sequitur esse,)</hi> and working with me, cannot but defile my purest and my best works.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I must fix mine eyes and mine heart only upon my blessed Saviour, <hi>looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith:</hi> Looking to and on nothing else, either within me or without me, but only Christ, whether in the way of my san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, for he is the Author of my faith, whereby alone my heart is purified and sanctified; Or in the way of my salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he is the Finisher of my Faith, whereby alone my soul is saved.</p>
                     <p>It is he that hath brought my soul from Infidelity to Faith, whereby I now see through a glass darkly; It is he that will bring my faith to a clear vision, whereby I shall see him face to face.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons I have to run this race, are drawn from that grand Topick which works
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:33097:131"/>
so much upon all the world, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> thought thereby to shift off Original sin from mans nature, and to put it only on his imitation; This Topick is the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of example.</p>
                     <p>And first, I have the examples of all those holy men that were before Christ, who through their faith in Gods promises, and constancy in their faith, possessed their souls in great patience whiles they lived, and resigned their souls in great comfort and contentment when they dyed: This innumerable company of Saints, is here called a cloud of witnesses; and it is such a cloud as must needs at some time or other drop down many cool showers, able to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, if not to extinguish, the flames of my greatest fiery tryals.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I have the example of Christ himself; he is the Author of my faith, he is the Captain of my salvation, that marcheth before me to this battle, instructing me by his Word, encouraging me by his Promises, supporting me by his Assistance, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rejoycing me by his Communion: And this example of our Saviour Christ, is recommended to me in three respects: First, because of its powerful efficacy in working; for he is <hi>the Author and Finisher</hi>
                        <pb n="256" facs="tcp:33097:132"/>
                        <hi>of my Faith:</hi> And he that worketh my Faith, will also make my Faith work this patience: Secondly, from its exact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with my present condition, in that no misery hath befallen me, which did not first befall him who made and redeemed me: Nay his Cross was much heavyer, his shame was much greater then mine can be: yet he <hi>endured the Cross patiently, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fpised the shame couragiously,</hi> and by this patience and courage, <hi>is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God:</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from its unavoidable necessity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my present Obligation: For it is not left to mine own choice, whether I will consider this or no, but I must needs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the example of Christ, or I cannot be a good Christian.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 3. <hi>For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</hi> What though mine own heart be given to contradict this rigid way of suffering? yet he that is greater then mine heart, hath gone before me in the very same way, and hath passed through far greater contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He looked on the Joy that was set before him,</hi> not on the contradictions that were
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:33097:132"/>
round about him, and he now lives and reigns in his glory, and hath promised that if I do <hi>suffer with him, I shall also raign with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. He is at the beginning of my sufferings, either to inhibit and stop them, that they shall not invade me: or to proportion and stint them, that they shall not overwhelm me: if he shew me not a way to avoid them, he will give me a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to encounter them: nay moreover, strength to conquer them: and an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, though he may be more securely avoided, yet he is more gloriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered: He is also at the middle of my sufferings, to encourage and support me in my conflict, lest I should be wearied and saint in my mind, as I cannot but be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and faint in my body: he had but a weak <hi>Cyrenian</hi> to help him bear his Cross, but he himself doth help me bear mine: He had but an Angel to strengthen him, but he sends the Holy-Ghost to strengthen me.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, he will be at the end of my suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to reward me: nay he himself, who is now my shield to succour me, will at last be my exceeding great reward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me: my exceeding great reward in all respects, for exceeding my best abilitie
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:33097:133"/>
to deserve him: exceeding my best capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to receive him: exceeding my best activity to enjoy him as he is in his own greatness: Be it then that my affliction is very great, yet sure I am my reward will be infinitely greater: but indeed my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction cannot be great in it self, it is so on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my opinion: The spirit of truth saith, it is but <hi>light and momentary; For our light affliction which is but for a moment,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. It is light, and therefore not great in quantity; It is but for a moment, and therefore not great in continuance: And well may this light and momentary affliction work patience in me, since it doth work glory for me: Nay a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory: Though it be light and momentary in it self, yet it is weighty and eternal in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: <hi>For our light afliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory; whiles we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal,</hi> (and so is also the smart and misery which is felt) <hi>but the things which are not seen are eternal;</hi> (and so is also the glory which shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed:) These are Reasons sufficient
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:33097:133"/>
why I should gladly follow the Apostles advice, <hi>consider him that endured such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of sinners;</hi> for so shall I not be enforced to endure the contradictions of mine own sins, whiles impatience suggests one temptation to me, and infidelity ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For though these two sins are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable companions, because there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be impatience without some kind of infidelity, yet are they such twins as were <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah, (Gen.</hi> 38.) They cannot come into my soul, but they will make a breach betwixt themselves; (one drawing this, the other that way) nor can they tarry in my soul, but they will make a breach betwixt my God and me.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the holy Apostle in this case appealeth to mine own conscience, saying, <hi>Verse</hi> 4. <hi>ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin:</hi> thereby calling me to witness against my self, that I am yet far short of my duty in my strivings against sin, because I have not resisted unto blood; whereas flesh and blood are to be resisted in the first place, as being that weight which doth so easily beset me, and must therefore be soonest laid aside.</p>
                     <p>I ought then in this quarrel to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a double strife; A strife against my
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:33097:134"/>
self, and a strife against my sins: for whiles I strive against my sins, my flesh and blood will strive against me: And if I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist so far as to thrust away my flesh and blood, how shall I thrust away my sins? If I do not lay aside my self, how shall I do to lay aside my greatest weight?</p>
                     <p>But least I should not regard this appeal, (for Appeals to the conscience are often made, but seldom regarded) in the next place, he appeals to Gods most holy Word; plainly shewing, how earnestly that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon me to be patient under Gods hand, and zealously enforceth many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for my patience.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 5. <hi>And ye have forgotten the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation which speaketh unto you as unto children:</hi> I am called upon to be patient, not as a servant for fear, but as a child for love: He is pleased to invite me by way of exhortation, he might have enforced me by way of command; yet I may not forget his exhortation, unless I would have him forget my supplication; for if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not his speaking to me as unto a child, how shall he regard my speaking to him as unto a Father? Wherefore if I desire with joy and comfort to say Our Father; I must be attentive and obedient as a child;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:33097:134"/>
nor can I forsake the temper of my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but I must forfeit the benefit of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>iety; and consequently lose all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>orts of my Devotions, which yet alone, in these times of rapine, are left me for my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>nsequestrable comforters.</p>
                     <p>I may not then neglect to hear this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, which calls upon me to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; much less may I neglect those Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which are alledged for my patience; and powerful Reasons they are.</p>
                     <p>First, because chaistisement is an effect of Gods love; for <hi>Verse</hi> 6. <hi>whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.</hi> Was ever yet any man angry with God for loving him? and why then should I be angry and offended at the effects and tokens of his love? <hi>For thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindness is better then the life it self, Psal.</hi> 63. 3. What then, though thou take away my life by thy chastisement, if so be thou give me thy loving-kindness which is far better? What is my life in it self, without thy love? O then take away my life as it is in it self, and give it me as it is in thy love: I desire not to live in mine own life, but in thy loving-kindness.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, because chastisement is a proof of my adoption, <hi>Verse</hi> 7, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. <hi>For what son is he that the Father chasteneth not? But</hi>
                        <pb n="262" facs="tcp:33097:135"/>
                        <hi>if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye Bastards, not Sons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If I be not one of his Sons, what expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy can I have of his inheritance? And if I be not under his correction, how can I be assured I am one of his sons? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me rejoyce for being under the discipline of his chastisement, as for being under the care of his Fatherly protection: And let me be afraid of not being chastised on earth in this mortal life, as I would be afraid of being bastardized from heaven, and declared illegitimate as to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of immortality.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, because chastisement is a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my obedience <hi>Verse</hi> 9. <hi>We have had Fathers of our flesh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?</hi> Would I be accounted an obedient child? I must shew my self so, not only by my doing, but also by my suffering; For my active obedience may be very much for mine own sake, because I expect a Blessing; but surely my passive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is meerly for my Fathers sake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I know my duty.</p>
                     <p>If therefore I desire to be truly dutiful
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:33097:135"/>
to my Father in heaven, let me shew him reverence whiles he punishes me, and not only whiles he cherishes me: And let me consider him to be the <hi>Father of spirits,</hi> and I shall be sure to shew him this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for I shall never deny him the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of my spirit, and much less of my flesh; I shall be willing to trust him with my soul, and shall not desire that he would trust my soul too long with my body.</p>
                     <p>This the natural man looks on as the high-way to destruction, but the spiritual man knows it is the way to salvation; for thus did Christ himself pass to life, even by being <hi>obedient unto the death:</hi> Let me labour to follow his example, for I have no reason to hope to fare better then he did, and sure Iam, I cannot fare worse: Let me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly desire to kiss my Fathers hand then chiefly when it holds the rod wherewith he strikes me; or rather, let me desire to kiss his rod: for it is much better for me, that his scourging should testifie my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then extort it: And if my weak and sinful flesh, whiles it is yet wedded unto my soul, shall deal with me as <hi>Jobs</hi> wife did with him, and say, <hi>Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God and die;</hi> Let me
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:33097:136"/>
be sure to give her the same answer as he did his wife, <hi>Thou speakest as one of the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish women speaketh; what? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive evil? Job</hi> 2. 10. This is the true way, not to bless God and die, but to bless God and live: for so it is in the Hebrew, <hi>Bless God and die;</hi> And <hi>Jobs</hi> wife speaking in that holy language, had her tongue sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, though not her heart, in so much that she did not say, Curse God and die, though she meant it, but bless God and die: I say, this is the way not to bless God and die, but to bless God and live, and I may well say it again and again, for so saith the Apostle, <hi>Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of Spirits and live?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Because chastisement is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of my sanctification: <hi>Verse</hi> 10. <hi>For they verily for a few daies chastened us after their own pleasure, but he for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, that we might be partakers of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> Good Lord, can I not be partaker of thy holiness, until thou chasten me! then let thy hand spare me no longer; for in thus sparing, it will most severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish me, since there is no greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either in this world, or in the next,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:33097:136"/>
then not to be partaker of thy holiness: Our fathers on earth by chastening us after their own pleasure, and not for our profit, do often make us partakers of their sin, even of that impatience whereby they do either unduly or unmeasurably chasten us; But our Father in heaven is never peccant either in the manner or in the end of his chastening; not in the manner, for he takes no pleasure in scourging us, and therefore cannot do it either unduly, or unmeasurably: Not in the end, for he aims only at our profit in scourging, that he may brush away, or strike off some excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scencies of our flesh, or some adherencies to it, thereby to make us partakers of his holiness in a far greater proportion and measure, then otherwise we could have been.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Because chastisement is a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my salvation; <hi>Verse</hi> 11. <hi>Now no chastisement for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless afterwards i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto them which are exercised thereby.</hi> If I look no further then after mine own Joy, it is most evident that I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, much less desire chastisement; because that <hi>for the present is not joyous but</hi>
                        <pb n="266" facs="tcp:33097:137"/>
                        <hi>grievous;</hi> but if I look after my <hi>Masters joy,</hi> I must enter into it the same way that he entred; he entred into his joy by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and so must I. <hi>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? Luke</hi> 24. 26.</p>
                     <p>He suffered that he might enter into his own glory, which was undenyably his from all eternity; and shall I hope to enter into that glory without suffering? Ought Christ to have suffered, and ought not the Christian to expect suffering?</p>
                     <p>Surely, it hehoved Christ to suffer for these three Reasons,</p>
                     <l>Propter Remedium Peccatorum.</l>
                     <l>Propter exemplum Virtutum.</l>
                     <l>Propter complementum Scriptura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</l>
                     <l>For the expiation and redress of sin, by his Merit.</l>
                     <l>For the propagation of Righteousness by his Example.</l>
                     <l>For the fulfilling of the Scriptures by his Obedience.</l>
                     <p>As the Seraphical Doctor teacheth.</p>
                     <p>Now tell me which of these Reasons is not a fit and sufficient ground for my sufferings.</p>
                     <p>Have I not Brethren to be edified by my
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:33097:137"/>
example, who seeing my patience in the day of my visitation, may also glorifie God in the day of theirs?</p>
                     <p>Hath not my God a Word to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

me in my life; it is enough for the good of mine own soul, for thou hast made me sensible of, and thankful for thy miraculous preservation: And when can I better desire thee to take my soul, then now it actually hath this sense of thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserved Mercies, and this thankfulness for them? Yet <hi>Tremelius,</hi> seeking for the reason of this prayer out of the tenth verse, thus pithily enlargeth his Gloss; <hi>Abjectio Tui Foederis, Cultus Tui Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio, Prophetarum tuorum coedes, &amp; mei per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutio, faciunt ut mortem expetam:</hi> That the children of <hi>Israel</hi> have forsaken thy Covenant, thrown down thine Altars, slain thy Prophets with the sword, and seek my life to take it away; These things that have hitherto made me weary of life, do now make me even desirous of death: Nor may we think so Religious a Prophet would have carried with him the guilt of Impatience, much less of Uncharitableness to his grave: For it was the indispensable necessity of Gods Truth, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned zeal of Gods glory, that extorted from him this most grievous complaint; And indeed, when the true Religion and worship of God is in danger or in distress, though we our selves be in neither, yet is it

not fit for us to admit of the comforts of this world; then if any say, <hi>Fear not, for thou hast a Son,</hi> thou needest not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that the <hi>Philistims</hi> have gotten the conquest over <hi>Israel,</hi> for thou art in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition, thou hast a goodly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and a Son to inherit after thee; yet must thou not answer, neither regard it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less thou wouldest have a weak dying wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man rise up against thee in Judgement, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 20.

                     <p>And as his Resignation was opportune and seasonable, so it was also full and ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; <hi>In manus tuas; Into thy hands:</hi> as if he had said, I desire to reserve nothing in mine own hands, but do resign all into thine: The Common-Law is very careful that a Resignation be whole and entire, without any reservation: And <hi>Navarr</hi> tells us, that he that hath anothers Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, must be very cautelous in allowing him any thing out of his living, for fear there may be a suspition of a Simonaical contract: <hi>(Potest quotannis Resignanti quid Donare, si id faciat ob Amorem Dei principaliter coram Deo, absque tamen ullo pacto:</hi> And again, <hi>Gratitudinem erga Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signantem Caute exercere debet, ne praesuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur id facere ob Confidentiam;)</hi> Will not ehe Law be satisfied without a full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, and do we think God will be satisfied without it? Or what were it for him to accept of part of thy soul, but to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:33097:186"/>

Thou must therefore either Resign all to him, or keep all to thy self: For thou canst not divide the Sacrifice, unless thou wilt divide the Deity: And since thy All to him is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, thou canst not give him less then All, but thou must profess him worthy of less then nothing: He hath required All thy soul, and All thy might, and All thy strength; and it is a most abominable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifulness, and a more abominable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness, not to give him what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, since thou canst not give him what he deserves; Therefore it must be a full Resignation, <hi>Resignatio Plena;</hi> that is the second.</p>
                     <p>And indeed it will be full, if it be free; it will be Plenary if it be Voluntary, which is the third condition, <hi>Resignatio Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> it must be a free and a voluntary Resignation; <hi>[I commit my spirit,]</hi> If I would reserve any thing to my self, it should be my spirit; the innermost part of my self, but I also commit that; and as I commit it into thy hands to dispose as thou pleasest, so I freely commit and commend it to thy disposal: A man may renounce his property upon Compulsion, but he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs it properly upon Choice or Election.

And so do good men give up their souls to God, freely and willingly, whereas wicked and ungodly men do it against their wills; <hi>Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, Luke</hi> 12. 20.

                     </p>
                     <p>First, the fulness of the Redemption; for
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:33097:189"/>
it had a threefold fulness; a fulness of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, a fulness of Appearance, a fulness of Redundancy; which is <hi>Bonaventures</hi> distinction concerning our blessed Saviour, <hi>(lib.</hi> 3. <hi>sent. dist.</hi> 13.) <hi>Quod est loqui de Plenitudine secundum Excellentiam, &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum Apparentiam, &amp; secundum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundantiam:</hi> We may speak of the fulness of Christ according to its Excellency, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Appearance, and according to its Redundancy; for Christ had a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Excellency from his first concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And he had a fulness of Appearance from the discent of the Holy-Ghost upon him; for then his excellent holiness was made apparent to all the world, by the testimony of the Father and of the Holy Spirit: And he had a fulness of Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy from the time that he sanctified his disciples and servants, by the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and participation of his holiness: And this same threefold fulness is in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; A fulness of Excellency or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the nature of it; <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:33097:190"/>
of Excellency or Perfection in this Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from the nature of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Thou hast Redeemed; So saith the Master of Greek Criticisms, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. This word is properly used concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Captives, that are Redeemed with a price: For they that are otherwise delivered then by a price, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, are said rather to be Rescued then to be Redeemed: <hi>(Eustath. in Iliad. a.)</hi> Here is then a Redemption as excellent as the price that was paid for the Captives, and that was the blood of the Eternal Son of God: A price that was infinitely more worth then all the whole Creation both in heaven and in earth, which hath in truth no other preciousness but what it hath from this price; is no farther precious then as it is sprinkled with this blood.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A fulness of appearance or manifestation in this Redemption from the Author of it. <hi>Thou, thou hast Redeemed;</hi> Thou <hi>whom God hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds, and who art the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, Heb.</hi> 1. 2, 3. This heir of all things came to make us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his inheritance: The same God
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:33097:190"/>
that made the world by his Power, and governed it by his Wisdom, Redeemed it by his Mercy: He that was the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>of the glory of God, and the express image of his person,</hi> was pleased to make himself of no reputation, and <hi>took upon him the form of a servant, and being found in fashion as a man to humble himself, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obedient unto death, (Phil.</hi> 2. 7.) That by his death he might destroy death, and by his rising to life again, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store to us everlasting life: But that's the third fulness in this Redemption; A ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Redundancy, from the subject of it; Me, Thou hast Redeemed Me; Thou, Me: Heaven and Earth are meet together in the Mysterie; But Heaven and Hell are met together in the Mercy of this Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: God and Man in the Mysterie, but God and sinful Man in the Mercy of it: Me in my Nature was a great mysterie; but Me in my Sins was a far greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Thy love did seek me when I did not deserve it; Thy care did keep me when I did not observe it; O let neither Love nor Care forsake me now I do desire it: And indeed thou hast promised not to forsake us; And that is the second Reason we are so willing to Resign our selves to thee, the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:33097:191"/>
faithfulness of our Redeemer, O God thou God of Truth: Thou art power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in thy performances as God, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in thy Promises as the God of Truth: As none can resist thy power in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so none may distrust thy truth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising: It was thy Mercy that made thee promise, but it is thy Truth that maketh thee keep thy promises: Mercy and Truth are together in God, as Cruelty and False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness go together in man; Though I have no right to thy Mercy from it self, yet I have a right to thy Mercy from thy Truth; And thine own Holy Spirit hath taught me to claim this Right, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>For he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee;</hi> He said it to <hi>Joshua,</hi> yet will have me believe, he said it to me; for though that promise in its occasion was particular, and concerned only <hi>Joshua</hi> and those with him, <hi>Josh.</hi> 1. 5. yet in its document it was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, and concerned all the faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God that should be to the end of the world; for that promise was made to <hi>Joshua</hi> as Leader of the people, and therefore belonged in common to him and to them, even to the whole Church of the Jews: And by the same reason belongs to us now as it did to them, even to the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:33097:191"/>
whole Church of the Gentiles; <hi>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek, or Gentile; For the same Lord over All, is rich unto all that call upon him, Rom.</hi> 10. 12. If we call upon him as <hi>Joshua</hi> and the Israelites did, we have the same interest in his promises as <hi>Joshua</hi> and the Israelites had; He will be as rich in Mercy to us, as he was to him and to them; or else in vain hath his Apostle said, <hi>For whatsoever things were written afore-time, were written for our learning, that we through patience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Scriptures, might have hope, Rom.</hi> 15. 4. Where is the comfort of the Scriptures if it be not in the Promises? or what promise can be the ground of our hope like this, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forsake thee?</hi> A promise which he made in Mercy, as Lord over All, and therefore rich in mercy to All that call upon him; But a promise that he keepeth in truth, as being <hi>the same Lord over All;</hi> That is, one and the same constantly in himself, and therefore not diverse in his Word, nor in his Promises: <hi>O God thou God of truth:</hi> As God, thou art a Creditor to All by thy Mercy, All borrow of it, All depend on it, All are obliged to it: But as a God of Truth thou art a Debtor to All, that is,

to All that call upon thee; for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, though it be universal, yet it is condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. Thou art a Debtor to All by thy Truth: they have an Interest in thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, claim it as their Right, look to it as their Treasure, look on it as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: <hi>Debitor fidelitatis, non Justitiae,</hi> God is to man a Debtor of faithfulness, though not a Debtor of Justice: A Debtor of faithfulness, because of his own Word, though he cannot be a Debtor of Justice, because of mans Merit: As he is God, he hath provided Mercy, (for as is his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, so is his Mercy) But as he is the God of truth, so he hath moreover assured it: In this assurance did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> comfort himself, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>For I know whom I have believed, and I am perswaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him against that day;</hi>

nothing else to him as to my Deposita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Trustee, but only my soul, which alone can remain and a bide till that day: And if I commit my soul unto him against that day, he will see it then forth-coming as safe as I can desire, and more safe then I can deserve: This is the <gap reason="foreign">
