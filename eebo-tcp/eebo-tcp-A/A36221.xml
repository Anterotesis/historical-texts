         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Old M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> DOD's Sayings.</head>
            <p>I. NOthing can hurt us but Sin; and that ſhall not hurt us, if we can
repent of it. And nothing can do us good but the Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God in Chriſt; and that we ſhall have if we ſeek it.</p>
            <p>II. No man is in a ſad condition, but he that hath a hard
heart, and cannot pray.</p>
            <p>III. So much Sin, ſo much Sorrow; ſo much Holineſs, ſo much Happineſs.</p>
            <p>IV. Make thy Sin thy greateſt Sorrow; ſo ſhall thy Sorrow never hurt thee.
Make Jeſus Chriſt thy greateſt Joy, ſo ſhalt thou never want Joy.</p>
            <p>V. A man that hath the Spirit of Prayer, hath more than if he had all the
World.</p>
            <p>VI. Two things he commended to a Married Couple, Cares and Strifes: For
the firſt, Let your Cares be, Which ſhall pleaſe God moſt: For your Strifes, let
them be, which ſhall love one another beſt: So will your Cares and Strifes be to
purpoſe; ſo will all needleſs Cares and Strifes vaniſh.</p>
            <p>VI. If you be in a Married Eſtate know and believe it, Though you might have
had a better or richer Wife or Husband, yet ſure enough you could never have
had a fitter, Becauſe it was ſo appointed by God in Heaven, before it could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
here on Earth; and therefore, though mutual Love be not performed
to thee, yet do thou thy part in obedience to God, and thou ſhalt be ſure to have
comfort in the end, though God exerciſe thee with Chaſtiſements for a time.</p>
            <p>VIII. There can no Afflictions and Miſeries befall us, but by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and cannot hurt us, but muſt needs do us good, if we be Gods Children.
But <hi>firſt,</hi> Be ſure you mix not ſin with them, for that only makes them bitter.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> Look not at the Rod, but at him that ſmiteth; for that cauſeth fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and fainting both.</p>
            <p>IX. If thot deſireſt to be aſſured thy Sins be forgiven thee, Labour to forgive
Injuries and Offences done unto thee, according to that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 14, 15. Four
things conſider to this end; 1. Chriſts Example, who forgave and pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d for his
Enemies. 2. Chriſts Command, <hi>When ye pray, forgive, if ye have ought againſt any
man.</hi> 3. Chriſts Promiſe, <hi>If ye forgive, ye ſhall be forgiven.</hi> 4. Chriſts Threatning,
<hi>If ye forgive not, ye ſhall not be forgiven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>X. In all Miſeries and Diſtreſſes, 'tis beſt wiſdom to go to that Friend that
is moſt near, moſt willing, and moſt able to help; ſuch a Friend is God.</p>
            <p>XI. He would often ſay, He had no reaſon to complain of his Croſſes, being
they were but the bitter fruit of his Sins.</p>
            <p>XII. Where Sins lye heavy, Croſſes lye light: and contrary, Where Croſſes
lye heavy, Sins lye light.</p>
            <p>XIII. Either Prayer will make a man give over ſinning, or Sin will make a
man give over praying.</p>
            <p>XIV. Four things we may learn from Children. 1. They take no unneceſſary
care. 2. They ſleep without malice. 3. They are content with their condition.
4. They are humble; the child of a King will play with the child of a Beggar.</p>
            <p>XV. There is no Affliction ſo ſmall, but we ſhould ſink under it, if God upheld
not; and there is no Sin ſo great, but we ſhould commit it, if God reſtrained
not.</p>
            <p>XVI. If we be railed on, or reviled, or injuriouſly dealt withall by friend or
foe, we ſhould be more troubled for the ſin againſt God, than for the offence
done to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>XVII. A Godly man is like a Sheep, every place is the better for him where
he comes. A wicked Man is like a Goat, every place is the worſe for him; He
leaves a ſtinking ſavour behind him.</p>
            <p>XVIII. Sanctified Afflictions are ſpiritual Promotions, and are far better for a
Chriſtian, than all the Silver and Gold in the world; being that the tryal of our
Faith is much more precious than of Gold that periſheth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>XIX. Directions for the Lords day. Make the Sabbath the Market-day for thy
Soul. Loſe not one hour, but be either Praying, Conferring, or Meditating; think
not thy own thoughts; let every day have its duties; turn the Sermon heard,
into matter of Prayer: Inſtruction into Petition, Reproof into Confeſſion,
Conſolation into Thanksgiving: Think much of the Sermon heard, and make
ſomething of it all the week long.</p>
            <p>XX. Directions for every day. Firſt, For morning. Every morning preſuppoſe,
1. I muſt dye. 2. I may dye ere night. 3. Whither will my Soul go, to Heaven
or to Hell? Secondly, For Night. Every Night ask thy Soul theſe Queſtions.
1. Have I twice this day humbled my ſelf before God in private? 2. How did I
pray? in Faith and Love? 3. What have my thoughts been this day? 4. What have
I been in my place and calling? 5. What have I been in company? Did I ſpeak of
good things? or did I hear, and with <hi>Mary</hi> lay up? 6. If God with the morning
renewed Mercies, was I thankful? 7. If the day afforded me matter of ſorrow, did
I fret? or did I lye in the duſt before God? 8. When you have done, where you
have been failing, confeſs it with ſorrow; the leſs work you will have to do
when death comes. Thus every night reckon right with thy God. This hath
been my daily courſe, and ſhall be my practice till I dye.</p>
            <p>XXI. What we win by Prayer, we ſhall wear with comfort.</p>
            <p>XXII. There is a twofold Aſſurance: 1. A Sun-ſhine. 2. A Moon-ſhine Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
The firſt is that full Aſſurance in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. The Moon-ſhine is that of
the Word, <hi>to the which we do well that we take heed, 1 Theſſ. 1. 5. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 18. The
firſt is given but to few, and that but ſeldom; and that either upon ſome great
duty to be performed, or ſome new condition of life to be entred into, or upon
ſome great Sufferings to be undergone, of which one ſaith, <hi>The hours it comes is
but ſeldom, and the ſtay of it is ſhort.</hi> The ſecond is that we muſt truſt to, A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
upon the ſure Word of God, by the Faith of Adherence, when we want
the other, the Spirit of full Aſſurance.</p>
            <p>XXIII. For the comfort of Gods people, he obſerved out of the 129 Pſalm,
That though the wicked were the Plowers of the righteous, and would plow
deep, make long furrows, and even plow their hearts out, if they could; yet the
righteous Lord that ſits in Heaven, laughs at them, and cuts their Cords, and
they then can plow no more.</p>
            <p>XXIV. In caſe of Perſecutions, and other Sufferings, Gods people ſhould
ſeriouſly conſider theſe four things: 1. God wills them and ſends them: Now
God's will is a perfect Rule of Righteouſneſs, and what God doth, is ſo well
done, that it could not be better done. 2. There is need of them, or elſe we
ſhould not have them. 3. Their number, meaſure and continuance, is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by God, they are but for a moment, and laſt but for a few days, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.
10. not too heavy, too many, or too long, as the Devil would have them; nor
too few, too ſhort, or too light, as our corrupt Natures would have them.
4. Their end is a <hi>weight of Glory,</hi> and the Crown that attends them, everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>XXV. Three things make a man count himſelf happy here below: 1. To
have a good Eſtate. 2. To have it in a good Place. 3. By good Neighbours.
Now theſe Three, they that die in the Lord, eminently enjoy. 1. Their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Inheritance is Great; <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard the like, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 9.
2. 'Tis in a good Place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. Heaven, which is a Houſe made for them,
and made by God, and therefore muſt needs be good. 3. By good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
God, Chriſt, the Spirit, Angels, and Saints. <hi>Adam</hi> had a good Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and in a good Place; but he had an evil Neighbour of the Devil, that
troubled him, and marred all: But there's no ill Neighbours in Heaven.</p>
            <p>XXVI. The Paſſions of God's People do not hinder the ſucceſs of their
Prayers; <hi>Elias</hi> was a man ſubject to like Paſſions as we are, and he prayed, and
was heard, <hi>James</hi> 5. 17.</p>
            <p>XXVII. Three things do concurr to the making up of the Sin againſt the Holy
Ghoſt. 1. Light in the Mind. 2. Malice in the Heart. 3. The Inſenſibleneſs
of the ſin. He that fears he hath committed it, hath not committed it.</p>
            <p>XXVIII. The reaſon why many are not wrought upon, that live under pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
Means of Grace, when many that live at a great diſtance, and come ſeldom
under a powerful Preacher, are wrought upon by it; He uſed to give by this ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude:
As in a Market-Town, the Towns-people matter not ſo much for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-wares,
as they that live in the Country, they come to buy, and muſt and
will have what they want, what ever they pay for it; whereas they that live
in the Town, think they may buy at any time, and ſo neglect buying at preſent;
and at the laſt, oftentimes they are diſappointed.</p>
            <p>XXIX. To perſwade us not to return railing for railing, he would ſay, That
if a Dog barked at a Sheep, a Sheep will not bark at a Dog.</p>
            <p>XXX. Four Arguments againſt immoderate Cares for earthly things, that we
might not diſhonour or deny God, he obſerved out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 1. 'Tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
2. 'Tis Brutiſh. 3. 'Tis Bootleſs. 4. 'Tis Heatheniſh. 1. Needleſs,
What need we care, and God too? <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30, 31, 32. <hi>Our heavenly Father knows
we have need of theſe things,</hi> and he bids us <hi>be careful for nothing, but caſt our cares
on him who careth for us.</hi> 2. 'Tis Brutiſh, nay more than Brutiſh, <hi>v. 26. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the fowls of the air, and ravens that he feeds, they toyl not.</hi> 3. It is Bootleſs,
and to no purpoſe: <hi>v. 27. Which of you by taking thought, can add one cubit to his
ſtature, or peny to his eſtate?</hi> 4. It is Heatheniſh; <hi>After all theſe things the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
ſeek,</hi> v. 32.</p>
            <p>XXXI. Many in the world take their Saintſhip upon truſt, and trade in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Religion, with the credit they have gained from others Opinions: They
believe themſelves to be Chriſtians, becauſe others hope them to be ſuch; and ſo
zealouſly trade in duties that lie outmoſt, to keep their Credit; but never look
for a ſtock of ſolid Grace within; and this undoes many.</p>
            <p>XXXII. As we read of <hi>daily bread,</hi> ſo of a <hi>daily croſs, Luk.</hi> 9. 23. which we
are bid to <hi>take,</hi> not to <hi>make:</hi> We need not make Croſſes for our ſelves, as we are
too prone to do; but let God make them for us: Croſſes being made in Heaven
beſt fit the Saints backs; and we muſt not lay them down, till they and we lie
down together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XXXIII. It was a notable ſaying of a holy man,</hi> Quench Hell, and burn Heaven,
yet I will love and fear my God.</p>
            <p>XXXIV. It is not crying out upon the Devil, nor declaiming againſt Sin in
Prayer or Diſcourſe, but fighting with the Devil, and mortifyings our Luſts,
that God chiefly looks upon.</p>
            <p>XXXV. The empty Profeſſor diſappoints Two at once. 1. The World, who
ſeeing his Leaves, expects Fruit, but finds none. 2. Himſelf, who thinks to reach
Heaven, but falls ſhort of it.</p>
            <p>XXXVI. The only way for a diſtreſſed Soul that cannot faſten on former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
by reaſon of future Backſhdings, and ſo queſtions all his former evidences,
is, To renew his Repentance, as if he had never believed.</p>
            <p>XXXVII. Some are apt to think, if they are in ſuch a Family, under ſuch a
Miniſter, out of ſuch Temptations, the Devil would not meddle with them as
he doth: But ſuch ſhould know, That ſo long as his old Friend is alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
He will be knocking at the door without.</p>
            <p>XXXVIII. The ſeeds were ſown ſo deep in the Nature of the Devil, and the
Saint, that they will never be rooted out, till the Devil ceaſe to be Devil, and Sin
to be Sin, and the Saint to be a Saint.</p>
            <p>XXXIX. The Sinner is the Devil's Miller, always grinding; and the Devil
is always filling the Hopper, that the Mill may not ſtand ſtill.</p>
            <p>XL. There be ſome ſins that an ignorant perſon cannot commit; but there
are far more that an ignorant perſon cannot but commit.</p>
            <p>XLI. There be five tyes by which the God of Heaven hath bound himſelf to
be the Saints Life-Guard againſt the Powers of Darkneſs. 1. His relation to
them as a Father. 2. His Love to them, in reſpect as they being the Birth of his
Everlaſting Council, as partakers of his own Likeneſs. 3. The price of his Sons
Blood, and his Covenant with them. 4. Their Dependance upon him, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
from him, in all their ſtraits. Now the <hi>Expectation of the poor ſhall not
periſh,</hi> Pſal. 9. 18. 5. Chriſt's preſent Employment in Heaven, is to ſee all things
carried fairly between God and them.</p>
            <p>XLII. Brown-bread with the Goſpel is good Fare.</p>
