            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas diverſe Complaints have beene made of ſeverall abuſes and miſdemeanours,
committed by ſeveral Souldiers of the Army both Horſe and Foot, <hi>viz.</hi> That they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably
impreſſe and violently take Horſes for their owne uſes, from ſeverall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
pretending the ſame to be for the uſe of the State; And alſo force perſons where they
quarter, to pay them unreaſonable ſummes of money, in lieu of quarter, (notwithſtanding they
are provided for at their ſeverall quarters) and to give them monies at their removing for their
future expences, having no manner of colour for the ſame, tending not onely to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and wrong to the perſons injured, but alſo to the ſcandall and diſhonour of the Army,
and contrary to the Lawes and Ordinances of VVar in that caſe made and provided.</p>
            <p>For prevention whereof, and of all other the like diſorders and abuſes whatſoever, I doe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſtrictly charge and require all Souldiers of the Army, both Horſe and Foot, (after Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
hereof duly made) to forbeare, either by themſelves or others, to impreſſe, or by force
take, any Horſes or Mares, from any perſon or perſons whomſoever, to their owne, or any others
uſe, upon any pretence whatſoever, unleſſe it be by ſufficient warrant under the hand of the
Captaine or other Officer lawfully authorized thereunto: And that they doe likewiſe forthwith
forbeare to demand, take, or compell any perſon, where they quarter, to give them any money,
upon any pretence whatſoever, either whilſt they remaine at their ſeverall quarters, or at their
removals, upon ſuch penalty and ſeverall puniſhment as may be inflicted upon every ſuch as ſhall
be found offenders therein, by a Councel of VVar. And I doe hereby require all Officers of
the Army, in their ſeveral places, to uſe all poſsible care and diligence, to prevent the Souldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their reſpective Commands, from committing the aforeſaid or any other the like miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
And upon diſcovery of ſuch as ſhall be found offenders therein, to bring them to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of VVar in the Regiment to which they belong reſpectively, according to a Commiſsion to
that purpoſe granted, to the end they may be brought to condigne puniſhment for the ſame. And
if any Office ſhall wilfully neglect his duty herein, ſuch Officer ſhall be reſponſible for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors
of his reſpective Soldiers.</p>
