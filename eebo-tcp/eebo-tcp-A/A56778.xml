         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the praise of a DVNCE.</head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I undertook this subject and seriously bethought me of
the Title, (as <hi>Plinies</hi> advice to every Author) <hi>The praise of
a Dunce,</hi> I considered whether I were my selfe a <hi>Dunce</hi>
or no, then it had beene true, <hi>proprio laus sordet in ore.</hi>
Againe, <hi>Qui alterum incusare vol<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

But when I saw that I had spent no small a time in the
Vniversity, published some usefull Bookes (as well in Latine as English)
to the Common-wealth, which have taken in the world, and I could never
get any thereby, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> calls them, silken words, I
concluded I was no <hi>Dunce;</hi> But the greatest reason of all that perswaded
me was, that for all my paines I could never get any preferment, had I bin
<hi>Dunce,</hi> without question, I had long ere this, perhaps bin double or tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
benefic'd, bin a lasie Prebend, or Deane of some Cathedrall my selfe, or
kept a fellowship with a good Living to boote in some Colledge or other, as
long as I had lived. But to our purpose. There is no question, but a <hi>Dunce</hi>
deriveth his name from <hi>Duns Scotus,</hi> who was a tolerable writer in his
time; and no doubt but they deserve to be commended, for that they are
pretenders to his knowledge and learning, and though they cannot attaine
to the same, yet in <hi>rebus magnis est vol<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isse satis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They commonly keepe good houses, and give entertainement to Learned
men, and so they do (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> saith) <hi>sarcire officium Hospitalitate.</hi> Yea
while they are in the Vniversitie; they are very beneficiall by bestowing Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Break-Fasts, (besides their liberality in Money) upon such learned
Schollers as make their Declamations and other exercises for them.</p>
            <p>They love and make much of their Wives above other (whom they
choose commonly the handsomest in the whole Country) keeping them
in their Coaches, their Taffata, or Plush Gownes, themselves clad in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske,
with their broad Beavers, Hats turnd up, or crushd close before like
a Court dripping-pan. They make good sport in their exercises, by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of false Latine, making absurd arguments, to the exceeding recreation
of others. And since Taciturnitie, or silence is a vertue, they are to
bee commended for their silence, for in learned company where mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of knowledge or Learned discourse is offered, hee alwayes holds
his peace. I remember in a Christmasse time as I was at Dinner in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64787:3"/>
the company of one who was a Doctor, and had some 800l. by the yeare in
spirituall living, when a learned friend of mine a Doctor of the Civill Law,
told him that I was a stranger lately come from beyond the Seas, and could
speake little or no Latine, and desired to speake to him in Latine, which I
did, the Doctor by an interpreter, answered me, it was not the Custome of
<hi>England</hi> to speak Latine in a Christmasse time, and so drinking to me wee
had no more discourse.</p>
            <p>He can in his preaching please both Country and Citie, and give them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
In the Countrie he will never stand above three quarters of an houre,
whereby young men of the parish have leasure enough in the afternoone to
recreate themselves at any exercise they please: in the Citie he will not stick
to preach (such as they are) three or foure Sermons in a day. Learned B.
<hi>Andrewes</hi> when he was Vicar of St. <hi>Giles</hi> without <hi>Criple-gate</hi> would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
say, that if he preached twice in one day, his second Sermon was rather
a prating than a preaching, for indeed every Sermon hee made was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
studied, and fraught with abundance of reading and learning.</p>
            <p>The best Schollers commonly are slovens in respect of one of them, they
goe spruce and so neate, and whatsoever their Doctrine or divisions be, if
they be handsom men and weare pontificall Beards, they are much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the Faeminine Auditory, for saith <hi>Erasmus</hi> merily, <hi>In Far. Ep.
Foemina laudant concionem a vultu Concionatoris,</hi> Women commend a
Sermon from the Preachers countenance.</p>
            <p>They never make any quarrell betweene our Church and the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> neither meddle th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y with controversie, or ever write against <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Suarez,</hi> and the rest. He will hardly suffer any Living to fall
into the lapse, which rather than it should he will engrosse three or foure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own hands. He seldom falleth out or quarrelleth with any man, now
and then he will break <hi>Priscians</hi> head till the bloud runs about his eares.</p>
            <p>Againe though he be no Scholler himselfe, he will provide of some more able
than himselfe to preach, which as a foile sets him off the better.</p>
            <p>Sometimes if he bee ambitious of popular applause, hee will turne Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke
in some kind or other sowing his Tares and Cockle, in woods and
corners, to the hazard of his eares; This proceedeth both from want of
learning, and want of wit, wherein hee is to bee pitied <hi>veritas non quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
angulos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Dunce</hi> also makes us good sport with any of his works that he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
himself, or that is published by another, witnesse, <hi>Epistolae obscurorum
virorum,</hi> where you shall see Duncery to the life, that if a man be extremely
Melancholique, let him read that book, and I will warrant it to cure him.</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Dunce</hi> falls into a Schollers company in travell upon the way, or meet
at an Inne at night, he is the most boone companion of the world, he will
call for Wine, and the best meate in the house (for observe it, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64787:3"/>
the sons of wealthy men and left exceeding rich, which indeed mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them <hi>Dunces</hi>) and in the end pay for all, which, who can deny but to
bee a most honest and a generous part. Hee commonly playeth well at
Bowles, and is so valiant that hee scornes to give ground to any man. Hee
hath an especiall care of the burning of Pigges upon the spit, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baking
of Pies in the Oven, therefore by his good will, hee will make short
work upon a Sunday, and he thinks an Homily well read to be sufficient.</p>
            <p>If he bee a Separatist (as many of them affecting singularity above the<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
fellowes prove,) he puts his Auditors to little or no charge at al for his Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
a Velvet Cushion for his Deske, or so rich a Pulpit Cloth as they have at
St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields, nor ever troubles he his officious Clerke to waite
at his opened Pulpit dore for his comming in, for in plaine truth his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
place or Pulpit, is either a two-eard Bucking-tub, or at the best the one
halfe of a Vinteners Caske, without any dore at all. The Bishop of his
Diocesse commonly beares with him and much delighteth in his company at
publike entertainements and meetings. For many of them though they
want learning, yet have they oft times good Naturall wits, and ripe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
upon any occasion. As one came before Bishop B. to bee examined
and posed of the Bishop for a Living (which was bestowed upon him) when
he came for his institution, and it fell out to be late at night, and at such a
time the B. was writing of a letter, Mr. B. quoth the Bishop, you have
picked out an ill time, for me to examine you in, neither am I at leasure to
aske you many questions, come one quoth the Bishop; what is latine for this
Candlesticke, and if it please your Lordship quoth the other, the Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke
is latine of it selfe, so it was, indeed a latine Candlesticke, the B. not
knowing whether he spoke it out of simplicity, or in way of jest, gave him
his institution, without further questioning.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Dunce</hi> commonly will tell the people of their faults truly and roundly,
or if they heare of any misbehaviour or abuse in a Parish they will not stick
(though he leaves his Text altogether) to correct and <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ea<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e it downe, and
many times will tell such as are guiltie to their faces of such and such faults
they have committed. One preached at <hi>Barkeway,</hi> and after he had read his
Text told the people their Towne consisted of many Lordships, and how
he was informed of one notable abuse amongst them in that Parish, which
was, if a Cow or Oxe of another mans were strayed away and hapned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any of their grounds, they would with a Rie loafe hot out of the Oven
bend his hornes which way they listed, so that when the owner came to
challenge his owne Cow he knew not whether that were shee or no, for
quoth hee my Cowes hornes stood backward, these stand before and hang
downe her forehead, surely this is not she; and thus men were cozened of
their Cattell, but the truth was, none in the Town knew this trick before,
but after he had preached it amongst them, presently after they began to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64787:4"/>
Another came by chance as a stranger unto a shire Towne that shall bee
namelesse, some day or two before a Visitation in the same Town he sent to
the Arch-Deacon residing then in the Towne, that he might have leave to
preach, which (to gratifie him being a stranger and very formall in his habit)
was granted: upon the day, before the whole Clergie, the Arch-Deacon,
Chancellor, and most of the officers of the spirituall Court, hee went into
the Pulpit, after he had made his prayer, he read his Text, <hi>Come and See.</hi>
My Text divideth it selfe (quoth he) most naturally into two parts, the one
is <hi>Come,</hi> the other <hi>See, Come</hi> I apply to our selves of the Clergie, and <hi>See</hi>
to the Laitie: for the first, <hi>Come</hi> I divide it into three parts, whither wee
<hi>Come,</hi> then who they be that <hi>Come,</hi> then how they <hi>Come:</hi> we <hi>Come</hi> hither
to a Visitation, which is derived from an old Latine Verbe of the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation

Arch-Deacon, and to visite is a Metaphor borrowed from the visiting of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
by the Physitian, for they visit them to see whether they bee sicke or
sound in the Body, &amp; these Visitations to see whether the Countrey men be
sick or sound in the purse or no, &amp;c. who they be that <hi>Come,</hi> (for (quoth he)

and had heard me better: and I see a great fault in you Inne-keepers of
this ancient Citie or Town, who lodge a foot-man who hath travailed hard
all day upon a Mattris or a flock-bed at the best, if an horse man comes to
your houses, riding upon an ambling Nagge, or an easie trotting Gelding
you lay him upon the best feather bed you have, and sometimes <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

with this fault amended, the poore footeman hath more need of a feather
bed than the other, after this manner he proceeded, till the glasse was run
out, when he had made an end, and was come downe, the Proctors, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,

but the Arch-Deacon and Chancellor would not suffer them, but cited him

next morning to come before them, but after dinner he had taken his horse
and was never heard of after. Notable are the absurdities of Dunsticall
Schoole-Masters, as one at Dunstable was so precise, that hee would not
teach his Schollers to say <hi>Amo</hi> I love, but <hi>Amo</hi> I am in Charitie, quoth a
Boy wiser than him, then Master I must construe, <hi>Cum amarem eram mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,</hi>

            <p>I had my selfe a Schoole-Master who is yet living, who I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

            <p>Your very <hi>Dunce</hi> is commonly like <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> an excellent Sollicitor

            <p>One, a <hi>Dunce</hi> in Graine after hee had read his Text, fell a rayling against
Church Government, for which his Sermon he was cited before Bish. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
whom upon his horse backe he met comming out of Gate at <hi>Buckden</hi>
house, he riding upon a white Gelding with a redde Saddle and a yellow
Saddle Cloth, how now Mr. <hi>G.</hi> quoth the Bishop, is this Canonicall, a
Red Saddle, and a yellow Saddle Cloth for a Minister? My <hi>L.</hi> quoth the
Parson, though you have Canons for me, you have none for my horse.</p>
            <p>And the common reason why most of our <hi>Dunces</hi> care not for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is because say they, <hi>Scientia inflat,</hi> knowledge puffeth up: and in very
truth as our Times are, the matter is not great whither a man be learned or
a <hi>Dunce,</hi> for he may come to preferment as soone by the one as the other,
though he were but a Tradesman, or a Mechanike.</p>
