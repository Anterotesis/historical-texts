         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny are the Enemies which are and have been in all
Ages of Gods Truth and people; And many have
been the Lies, Slanders, and falſe Accuſations which
hath followed the Lords Appearance in all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
for it hath been the work of falſe Prophets and Anti-Chriſts
Prieſts, to ſpeak all manner of evil falſly without a cauſe,
thinking thereby to cover their own Deceit and Hypocriſie,
with Revilings, and ſlandring of the Innocent, ſpeaking Lies
in hypocriſie; And Truth always ſuffered by that Generation
of Prieſts, under the name of <hi>Error;</hi> and the Profeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and the walkers therein, under the name of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> elſe
could they never have effected their ends, to have brought them
to the fire as they have done many of the precious ſervants of
the Lord, even in every age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And great hath been the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the appearance of God in this age (in his innocent
people) hath met withal, even from men of all Ranks and Sects;
but more eſpecially from the Pariſh Prieſts, as may largely be
made appear: As Inſtance, A Petition from them to the then
Parliament, Crying out againſt them as Hereticks and Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
and crying for help from them againſt this poor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
people, whoſe Doctrine and Principle was almoſt every
where ſpoken againſt, and but then a very few in number in
compariſon of the multitude of Prieſts and their followers,
which was then againſt them; yet they was not able to reſiſt
the Spirit by which they ſpake, becauſe they ſpake with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and not as the Scribes; therefore they cryed out to
the Magiſtrates to help them, though no hand was lifted up
againſt them, though many times they have been ſorely beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
ſtoned, ſtockt, whipped, ſcoffed, ſcorned, and impriſoned,
and that by the high Prieſts themſelves, who have ſet on their
rude people to do it; Nay, I may truly ſay, moſt of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
that this innocent people hath met withal in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

ſtirred up the Magiſtrates (as being the chief weapon that ever
they uſed) but alſo by their Lies, ſlanders, falſe Accuſations,
and Reproachful tearms, which they Pamphleted abroad, to
raiſe up the rude multitude againſt them, and alſo to beget a

Truth which theſe people walk in and hold forth, calling the
Light of Chriſt <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and ſaying they deny the
man Chriſt, his Death and Reſurrection; and that he is at the
right hand of his Father in the Heavens; and that they deny
his Ordinances and Scriptures; among whom I met with one
<hi>Francis Holdcraft</hi> as none of the leaſt of theſe Lyars and falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers,
being as a Bryer in a thorn hedge, or as the Viper which
came out of the fire and ſeized upon <hi>Pauls</hi> hand. But his Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of Lies, ſlanders, and falſe accuſations, the Lord God will
ſweep away with the Beſome of his deſtruction, by which he will
cleauſe the Land of evil doers, Lyers, ſlanderers and Backbiters,
and he will alſo clear the innocency of his own people, and the
Truth of their Doctrine; and they alſo wil ſhake off this Viper of
his as they have done many more; and the minds of the people
he hath deceived (will be changed) and inſtead of calling them
Error, they ſhall ſee them to be the Truth of God as it is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;
And this <hi>Francis Holdcraft</hi> ſhall then ſee and be confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if he do not ſpeedily repent, but it is greatly to be feared
that this <hi>Francis Holdcraft</hi> hath his heart hardened, and his
conſcience ſeared as with a hot Iron, and is accuſtomed to evil,
in that he hath ſo long continued oppoſing of the Truth of
God; and hath at laſt ſhewed himſelf in twelve parcels or
Pamphlets of Paper; wherein, though confuſedly, yet very
impudent wickedly, hath he belyed Gods ſervants, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what in him lay, to pervert the Right way of God, and to
turn the Truth into a lye; And hath reproachfully belyed the
dead, which is not here to anſwer for himſelf, as inſtance <hi>James
Naylor,</hi> in whoſe life time he nor none of his generation, was
able to withſtand (while he ſtood in the power of God) but was

covered the land of Egypt, or as the Locuſts which came out
of the bottomleſs pit, or as the ſmoke that darkeneth the Air,
this is one, That our Principles doth agree with the Jew and
the Turk; for ſaith he, Theſe deny Chriſt come in the fleſh,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Jew and the Turk; The Quakers, ſaith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they
firſt aroſe and ſpoke plainly, they made Chriſts birth and Death
but a figure, herein ſaith he, the Jew and the Turk and the
Quaker doth agree: Here is all of ſubſtance that I can find, ſo far
as I have read his Papers; the reſt &amp; this alſo, is a heap of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
Lies, ſlanders and falſe Reports, which he hath raked up
out of the unclean Channels of his corrupt heart, and gathered
from the mouths of that lying Spirit, which is entred into, and
hath its ſeat in that Sect, of which he is the head, more then
any other that I know of; for certainly he, with many more
which I might mention of his Brotherhood, makes it their work
to bely the Truth and people of God, that the Scripture might
be fulfilled, <hi>Becauſe I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the
world hates you; And all manner of evil ſhall they ſpeak of you without
a cauſe, becauſe they have not known the Father nor me:</hi> And now I
ſhall ſpeak ſomething in Anſwer to this falſe Accuſation.</p>
            <p>Wherein doth the Jew and Turk agree with us? Thou ſaiſt
they deny Chriſt come in the fleſh; We do not deny Chriſt
come in the fleſh (let all people witneſs for us that hath known
our Doctrine and manner of life) but do confeſs unto all the
world that he is come and coming, and every eye ſhall ſee him,
and he ſhall judge thy Lying, Reviling ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as an enemy unto
his appearance, in this the day of his glorious ariſing, in which
he is diſcovering the deceitful workings of Antichriſt, in thee
and thy followers, who confeſs him in words, but in life and
power, and practice, doth deny him; and are the greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
he hath in this Nation, like as the Scribes, Phariſees and
High Prieſts was in the days of his fleſh, who put him to death,
though they looked for a Meſſiah, and had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
Writings, which did declare of the coming of the juſt One,
yet by them they could not ſee nor believe in him, no more
then you now in this day of his ſecond coming, can believe and
receive him, though you have the Prophets and Apoſtles Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
for they only teſtifie of him, but could not give the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48173:4"/>
of him, neither faith to believe in him; for it is the Light
that ſhineth in heart that giveth the knowledge of the glory of
God in the face of Jeſus; and Faith is the gift of God, which
cannot be received by the reading of the Scripture, for it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by hearing, not by reading; And as for us, we believe and
confeſs unto all the world, that there is no ſalvation in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but in this Jeſus, who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and
was crucified without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and roſe again
the third day, and did talk with his Diſciples as they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Emaus,</hi> but they did not know him; and that he came
in amongſt them, the doors being ſhut; and that he ſaid to
<hi>Mary, touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my father;</hi> and the
ſame that Deſcended Aſcended unto the right hand of God in
the Heavens; and this alſo we believe, That he is come again,
and coming; for certainly we did not know him but as he was
revealed in us: And as for the Turk and Jews, I know not what
they believe, I ſhall leave them to anſwer for themſelves, only
this is my faith concerning them, That many of them is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the Kingdom of Heaven, then this man and ſuch as he, and
will ſooner enter into it; for Whoremongers and Adulterers
ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God before ſuch Phariſees and
Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>And again in the ſame Page he ſaith, The Turk and the Jew
and the Quaker doth agree, they diſallowing in principle of
that Stone which the Builders did refuſe, they deny that man
Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Emanuel, God with us,</hi> that is now at the right hand
of the Father in the Heavens; and preſently after in the ſame
Page he ſaith, The Jews and the Turks look not for ſalvation
in any other then in this Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> the ſon of man, The
Quakers therein agree with them in principle, they deny the
Rock, which is the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Oh heap of Confuſion and Nonſence! was there ever
ſuch Hodge podge committed to writing by any man that hath
his ſences? ſurely he that hath but half an eye may ſee from

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48173:4"/>
And as for the Rock which thou ſaiſt is the Perſon of Chriſt,
the Rock Chriſt we own, which was before he had a body, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Prophets and the holy men of God in the dayes
paſt was builded, and which followed Iſrael of old; for they
all did drink of the ſame ſpiritual Rock which followed them,
which Rock was Chriſt, as it is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. as for the
word Perſon, which thou ſo often uſes in thy Writings, it is thy
own imagination; for I find it not at all Recorded in the Sorip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and thou to lay thy own Imaginations for a foundation
is an abſurd thing, and manifeſts thy folly and ignorance; for
another foundation can no man lay, then that which is already
laid, which is Chriſt Jeſus, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
            <p>And as for thy Groanings and Confl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and quickened thy ſoul from death, as he hath done many in
this day of his glorious Appearance and Viſitation of the ſons
of men; but thou with many more would not have him to rule

the Lord alſo to plead for them, and had a witneſs in every
mans conſcience to plead their Innocency, and ſo is it at this
day by thoſe whom Chriſt hath raiſed up, who are bold and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
not fearing what man can do, neither dare they go down
unto <hi>Egypt</hi> for help, nor put their confidence in the arm of
fleſh, neither take thought what to ſay, but as the Lord gives
wiſdom and utterance ſo they ſpeak; and they have a Witneſs
in every mans conſcience, and their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> innocency pleads their
cauſe, ſo that the Lord God his appearance is much ſeen
amongſt them by their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> undaunted courage and meek behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and patient ſuffering all things, giving their backs to the
ſmiter, and their Cheeks to thoſe that have pulled off the hair;
And it is to be obſerved among this people, that their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
did never fall, neither were they ever put to flight, or in
the leaſt give way to any fear or deceipt whereby their enemies
could have any advantage againſt them; And it is further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
that in all theſe times of Tryal they have never remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their publick Meetings, neither changed the time, nor
place, but rather hath appeared more publick; and the Lord
God hath raiſed up a greater Zeal amongſt them, which their
perſecutors have taken great notice of, to their great diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement;
and the Innocency of this people is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
made known unto all people; yea unto their perſecutors,
which hath raiſed a love and pitty in their hearts towards them
many times, that they have ſaid, That what they have acted
againſt them was contrary to their minds, but that they were
forced to it; So that all that hath come to paſs concerning this
people, the Lord hath cauſed it to work for good unto them in
all their Tryals and Tribulations, and hath incouraged them
in all well doing, in their faithful and true Teſtimony which he
hath given them to bear, and hath to this day appeared for
them, in taking of their parts in all their Diſtreſſes, both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and mind; and hath ſo far brought his own purpoſe to
paſs in them, that they fear not what man can do unto them,
neither in body or Eſtate, neither do they love their lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48173:5"/>
the Death; That they may finiſh their Courſe with joy, and
run the race which is ſet before them with chearfulneſs having
the Mark of the high Calling of Jeſus always before them, and the
reward always in their Boſoms, ſo that they rejoyce that the
Lord hath raiſed them up, and counted them worthy to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to his living truth w<hi rend="sup">CH</hi> they have been eye-witneſſes of from
the beginning, by all which it doth evidently appear that they
are the People, and Saints, and Servants of the moſt high God, and
that they above all the families of the earth, he hath choſen to
place his name in; for they have both heard his voice and ſeen
his ſhape: Therefore the voice of a ſtranger they cannot follow,
neither bow to the likeneſs of any thing in heaven above, or the
earth beneath, but is made willing in this the day of his power to
forſake all and follow the Lamb through the great Tribulations,
that the ſufferings that is yet behind of the body his Church
might be filled up, and others ſeeing their faithfulneſs and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in their ſufferings, and their boldneſs and Zeal for the Lord
in this trying-day, is provoked thereby unto jealouſie; And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
by their good Converſation is won unto Chriſt, and glorifies
our Father which is in heaven, unto whom be all the glory, and
pure praiſes, and honour given and rendred by me and all his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
ſeed for evermore.</p>
            <p>Now it may be quaeried by many ſober minded people what is
the ground of the difference between this <hi>Francis Holdcraft</hi> and
theſe people called Quakers, ſeeing they are both ſufferers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and ſeparates from the Church of England; or what ſhould
move this <hi>Francis Holdcraft</hi> to write ſo many Papers againſt this
people, ſeeing they have ſo many enemies already, and are the
only people that is perſecuted, that bears the weight and burthen
(for all others) in the heat of the day, who alone are found faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in their tryals, and is upheld by the power of God in all the
violent tempeſts that to this day is come to try their foundation;
ſo that the eyes of many people is upon them, and the deſire of
thouſands is for them that they may ſtill be upheld in their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
that they that are yet afar of may be brought near, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are already brought near, may be made to partake
with them of their reward; for it is generally believed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and well known to ſome ſober minded people, that they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48173:6"/>
ſeek the good of all, and would do unto all men as they would
men ſhould do unto them,</p>
            <p>To this may be anſwered he that is born after the fleſh always
perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit; and this was firſt
ſeen in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> two of the firſt that did ſacrifice, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there was then that put a difference between their Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;
for it is ſaid the Lord had reſpect unto <hi>Abel</hi> and his Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
but not unto <hi>Cain</hi> and his Offering: And this is the very
ground of the matter between <hi>Francis Holdcraft</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and the people which is in ſcorn called Quakers, for God
hath reſpect unto them and their Offering, but not unto <hi>Francis
Holdcraft</hi> and his Offering; therefore is he riſen up in great
wrath againſt this people, but this that puts the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Offering and Offering many people are yet ſtrangers unto,
and it is very needful that it be known; for in vain doth people
offer ſacrifices while God hath no reſpect unto them, for what
is the Chaff to the Wheat, or what is the form where the power is
wanting, or what will it avail any though they give their goods
to the poor and their bodies to be burnt, if they want Charity.
Now I may ſpeak to inform the minds of the ſimp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, honeſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in few words: There is a ſeed which God hath ſowen in the
hearts of all people, and this is <hi>Abel</hi> or <hi>Jacob,</hi> and as this is felt
in the heart of any to offer unto the Lord; this is that which he
hath reſpect unto, and which his love is unto, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13.
For it is ſaid, <hi>Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated.</hi> Now this
is nothing to them that hold a particular Election of perſons, for
this is a ſeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the promiſe is not unto ſeeds as unto many, but
unto the ſeed which is Chriſt; for the Apoſtle ſpeaking of them
in the womb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> calls them two Nations or two Seeds: Now the
other ſeed which the enemy ſoweth, which is called <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Eſau</hi>
being the firſt-born, and that which is moſt forward to offer, this
is alſo in every mans heart (I mean in unregenerate men) and
this the Lord hath no reſpect unto, though it faſt and pray, and
preach never ſo much, for this is that which God hateth and is
reprobated, for I will put enmmity ſaith the Lord betwixt thy
ſeed and her ſeed: And theſe two can never bereconciled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
neither the people which are of theſe contrary ſeeds, for
Light and Darkneſs cannot agree, where Chriſt the Light the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48173:6"/>
ſeed of the Woman is felt in the heart to bear Rule; Darkneſs
and Enmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y is done away, and he is the one Offering which the
Father hath reſpect unto for in him only he is well-pleaſed, and
with them alone that hear and follow him, and is obedient unto
his appearance in them, and doth whatſoever he doth command
them.</p>
            <p>And all Dear people into whoſe hands this may come, wait to
feel this Seed in your hearts; for it is this that begets all the
breathings and deſires in your hearts after the Lord; I ſay, wait
that ye may become acquainted with it, for it is the Elect Seed
of bleſſing, and in it is all the promiſes of God, yea and Amen;
herein waiting will you make your Calling and Election ſure;
for in it ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed; And except
it had been for this bleſſed Seed we had all been like <hi>Sodom;</hi> but
bleſſed be the Lord who hath left us a Seed, and Called and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
many in it, and is yet calliug and electing many more:
for this is the Seed by which he wil repleniſh the earth, and them
that are joined to it, when he will Sweep the Land of evil doers:
But ſome may ſay how ſhall we know this Seed of bleſſing, this
Elect Seed? ye ſhall know it by its Meekneſs, Gentleneſs, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
long ſuffering, and its breathing after God always, and
cannot be ſatisfied in any thing below him, neither feed upon
that which dyes of it ſelf; but it is its meat and drink to do the
will of God; Oh wait to know ſuch a thing in your hearts, and
joyn your ſelves to it, that ye may be accepted in it, then will
ye be one in heart with all Gods people, and the ground of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and various offerings will be taken away, and the one
offering will be known, and the Sacrifice which the Father ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth,
and the Return from the Father will be felt in the hearts,
and bleſſings and peace will be your portion, with all the reſt of
the children of the Kingdom, who are ſet down with <hi>Abraham,
Iſaa</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the Manſion which Chriſt hath prepared; Oh
Dear people, this is the Pearl of great price, which all is to be
ſold for, even that which is called the leaſt of Seeds, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the greateſt of Plants in them that believe; for it is the
Lord alone that cauſeth it to proſper, aud ſhowers down his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
upon it, ſo it becomes as the Trees planted by the River
ſide, that brings forth its fruit in due ſeaſon, whoſe Leaf ſhall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48173:7"/>
never wither; but the Leaves of this Tree is for the healing of
the Nations; So bleſſed and happy are they in whoſe hearts this
is put forth and proſpereth; even ſo do thou ariſe, oh my God
for the gathering in of this ſcattered Seed; even ſo be it. <hi>Amen.</hi>
