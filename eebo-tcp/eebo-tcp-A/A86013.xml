         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He minde of man deſtitute of Gods Grace,
doth (like untilled ground) luxuriate into
wickedneſſe and vanitie, being very prone
to cloſe with the ſuggeſtions of the grand
adverſarie of his ſoule; yea, though he hath
had ſome taſte of the things that are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
yet ſuch is his courtefie, that he will be
ſeeking after novelties. Old truths (like the <hi>Manna</hi> to the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> after a conſtant and continued falling of it) become
nauſeous: the truth hereof hath beene found in all ages by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
experience, but eſpecially in theſe our dayes, which
have been as fruitfull of new opinions in matters of Religion,
as <hi>Africa</hi> it ſelfe of Monſters.</p>
            <p>Some (though few in compariſon) God is pleaſed to recall,
who have gone aſtray in this kinde, and to bring them to a
cleare ſight of their folly, of which number I (by Gods Grace
towards me) am one; I deſire to acknowledge him in it, and to
give him the praiſe of it, and think my ſelf bound in conſcience,
as a teſtimonie of my thankfulneſſe to God for my deliverance,
to declare it to the world, that ſo others may heare and feare,
and take warning by my example. They who have been lately
in the Northerne parts of <hi>England,</hi> cannot be ignorant how
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125945:3"/>
prevalent the impoſture of Quaking hath been for theſe nine or
ten Moneths laſt paſt, in which ſnare I my ſelfe (among many
poore deluded ſoules) was taken in <hi>May</hi> laſt 1653. though by
Gods goodneſſe towards me the ſnare is broaken, and I am
eſcaped; a true account whereof take as followeth.</p>
            <p>I being deſirous to aſſociate my ſelf with this Faction at their
Meeting, and to heare ſome of them ſpeake (to uſe their owne
expreſſion) acquainted one of their owne with it, <hi>viz. George
Bayley</hi> of <hi>Kendale,</hi> who gave me great incouragement herein
from his owne experience of much advantage received by him
in that way: Whereupon I went ſoone after to their Meeting
at <hi>Richard Newby's</hi> houſe, where I ſtaid about two houres <hi>(viz.</hi>
from eight till ten at night) where <hi>Christopher Atkinſon</hi> was
Speaker, whoſe driſt was to deny all Miniſterial teaching and
Ordinances, together with all notionall knowledge formerly
gained by uſe of ſuch meanes, to become as though wee had
never learned any thing thereby ſavingly, and to lay a new
ground worke, <hi>viz.</hi> to be taught of God within our ſelves by
waiting upon an inward light, which (as they aſſert) lies low
hidden under the earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the old man which is of the earth,
earthly. Hereupon I reſolved to cloſe with them, after which
time I was afraid to read any good Books, or heare any preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Miniſter, or call to remembrance any thing which I had
formerly learned out of Gods Word concerning God or Chriſt,
or mine owne eſtate, or any other ſubject contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for I was perſwaded by their teaching, that whatſoever I
had learned out of Gods Word by hearing, reading, catechizing,
&amp;c. was but notionall carnall, and hanging upon the Tree of
Knowledge; in which condition whilſt I abode, they affirmed
me to be under the Curſe, applying this expreſſion though very
impertinently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on the Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, going a ſecond time to one of their Meetings at
<hi>Edmond Newby's,</hi> I had ſome conference by the way with ſome
of themſelves which went with me; amongſt other blaſphemies
one <hi>Robert Colliſon</hi> affirmed, that Chriſt was as man, had his
failings, for he diſtruſted God (quoth he) upon the Croſſe, when
he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> to whom
I anſwered, that then he ſuffered as an evill doer, and ſo could
not purchaſe Redemption for us; after this comming home, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125945:3"/>
who then was Speaker, urged us to take up the Croſſe daily, and
to abide under it: ſaying, <hi>Carry the Croſſe all day, and it will keepe
thee at night;</hi> that this would keep us low and humble, and kill
and make alive: further he endeavoured to perſwade his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to hearken to a voice within them, teaching that Gods
voice was a ſtill voice; after which I reſolved in my thoughts to
waite for the manifeſtation of theſe things within my ſelf.</p>
            <p>After a while, going a third time to their Meeting, as I went
I was ſomewhat troubled in my thoughts at the remembrance of
that hideous blaſphemy uttered by the partie before named,
whereupon I ſpake publickly to them at their Meeting concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, telling them that I would not any further joyne with
them if they were all of that mind, to which ſome of them (after
much whiſpering) anſwered negatively, wiſhing me not to let
it trouble me; for he which ſpake ſo to me was not rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
with which anſwer I was at preſent ſatisfied, and did adhere
to my former reſolution. Not long after I went to another
Meeting upon a Lords Day at <hi>Robert Colliſons</hi> houſe in <hi>Kendale,</hi>
where the aforeſaid <hi>Atkinſon</hi> was Speaker, who beginning about
nine a clock in the forenoone, continued till three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,
in which time he ſpake much (according to his uſuall
manner) of the great experience which he had of God from the
light within him, which light I not finding to be in my ſelfe
was very much troubled, apprehending my condition to be verie
bad, finding nothing but blindneſſe and hardneſſe, yet I ſtill
expected the appearance of that light within me, and earneſtly
deſired that I might fall into quaking and trembling, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that I ſhould thereby attaine to the immediate diſcoveries
of God unto me. Upon my departure from thence, I peruſed
a Pamphlet ſet forth by ſome of the ſame Faction being in <hi>York.</hi>
Caſtle, the maine ſcope of it was againſt the Miniſtry; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after walking in my Bed-chamber, I began (as I have
formerly deſired) to tremble and quake ſo extreamly, that I
could dot ſtand upon my feet, but was conſtrained to fall down
upon my Bed, where I howled and cryed (as it is uſuall with
them) in a terrible &amp; hideous manner, to the great aſtoniſhment
of my family: Nevertheleſſe I my ſelf was not at all affected with
feare, becauſe it was a ſatisfaction to my former deſires, and I
looked upon it as the beginning of the pangs of the new birth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125945:4"/>
and expected that the iſſue of it would be good; when I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
about halfe an houre in that condition, I ceaſed from
howling and crying gradually; after which I aroſe up againſt
beginning to rejoyce, thinking with my ſelfe that now I could
beare witneſſe againſt the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> as falſe Prophets
and Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> becauſe I never found ſuch effects and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
upon me by ſo long continuance under their Miniſterie;
After this going to bed, I was much troubled all that night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in my ſleep with dreames concerning my condition, and
had a diſcoverie of my ſinnes in particular, eſpecially of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe,
the Devill working ſtrongly upon my imagination;
I apprehended that all ſinne. was about to be hewed downe, and
rooted up in me, and (to my apprehenſion) the ſinne of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe
had great long rootes which did viſibly appeare to
me when it was rooted up: Afterwards lying awake, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the dreames and viſions I had formerly been troubled
with, I ſenſibly perceived ſomething (as I imagined) lighting
upon my neck, giving me a great ſtroke which cauſed much
paine to me, and after that another which was leſſe then the
firſt, and ſo a third and fourth, each ſtroke being leſſe then the
former, and each ſtroke deſcending lower down, till it came to
the middle of my back, and then I thought ſomething entered
into my body, which I perſwaded my ſelfe (from Satans inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to be the Spirit of God deſcending upon me like a Dove
and entring into me, whereupon I heard (in my conceit) a voice
within me ſaying, <hi>It is day;</hi> whereupon looking up and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be light, I anſwered <hi>Yes;</hi> the voice replyed twice over
to me, and ſaid, <hi>as certaine as it is light, ſo certainly ſhall Chriſt give
thee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this I continued two or three daies waiting for further
diſcoveries of light within me, being rapt up into an extaſie of
exceſſive joy, and ſometimes againe exceedingly dejected with
feares and doubts of my condition, whether it were really good,
or I were under Satans deluſions; yet ſtill I waited for further
manifeſtations, and walking into the Garden, lying down upon
the ground with my face towards the earth, my right hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
extreamly to ſhake, ſo as I could not hold it ſtill, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof whilſt I was wondering what it ſhould be, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
my ſelfe as being ſhaken by the hand, I was brought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125945:4"/>
into another rapture of great joy, imagining it to be a figure of
my ſpirituall Marriage and Union with Chriſt. Then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I was by the power within me raiſed, and ſet upon my feet,
and by the ſame power turned and laid upon my back, with my
face cowards the skie; at which time all my ſinnes particularly
were againſt brought into my memorie, and at the remembrance
of everie ſin, my hand was carried round about with giving a
little pat upon the ground, and then I imagined I heard a voice
ſaying, <hi>now ſuch a ſinne is mortified;</hi> after which I being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
by it, that all my ſinnes were mortified by it one by one;
the power that <hi>I</hi> was then acted by, permitted me to ariſe up
againe of my ſelfe, ſaying unto me, <hi>Aske whatſoever thou wilt of
the Father in my name, and he will give it thee:</hi> I replied, I know
not what to aske, and therefore deſired that power to teach me
what I ſhould aske; he anſwered me againe, and bid me aske
<hi>Wiſdome in the firſt place;</hi> whereupon I deſired alſo that God
would give me ſuch things as were moſt for his glorie and the
good of others; whereunto the power anſwered, <hi>that my request
was granted, and that I ſhould alſo be indewed with the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
and ſinging praiſes to God;</hi> wherewith being ſatisfied, I
went to another Meeting within an houre after, at <hi>William
Doddings</hi> houſe in <hi>Kendale,</hi> which was the fifth and laſt Meeting
that I was at with them, where <hi>Chriſtopher Atkinſon</hi> being Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
I was much more affected with what he ſpake then formerly,
as being able more inwardly to witnes in part to what he ſpoke.
After he had done, and a little pauſe had, the companie roſe up,
as if they had been readie to depart; I my ſelfe was readie to
go away with the firſt, but the Wife of the houſe <hi>(Iſa: Dodding)</hi>
tooke me by the hand, and wringing it very hard, bade me ſit
downe againe, which I did, and preſently after one <hi>John A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſtood up, and began to ſpeake, ſaying, <hi>cannot you watch one
houre?</hi> and ſo proceeded after the uſuall manner. In the time
of his ſpeaking I was by the power within me drawne from the
chaire upon which I ſat, and throwne upon the ground in the
middeſt of the companie, where I lay all night; all which time
my bodie and all the members of it were ſtill in motion, I being
turned from my back to my belly, and ſo back againe ſeverall
times, and making croſſes continually with my legges one over
the other; my hands alſo were carried to and fro upon the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125945:5"/>
ground by a compulſive power, as if I had been writing upon
the ground; in all which actions and motions, I acted not in
the leaſt meaſure by a naturall power of mine owne, neither did
I reſiſt or could I reſiſt that power which acted me, but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
paſſive, I was perſwaded that it was the immediate
power of Chriſt, and heard to my thinking a voice ſpeaking
to me and ſaying, <hi>that that writing with my hand upon the ground
did ſignifie the writing of the Law within my heart.</hi> Having laine
all night upon the ground in the manner aforeſaid, the power
(as before in other actions) moved my hands to my head, and
laid them upon the top thereof faſt cloſed together, whereupon
I heard a voice ſaying, <hi>Chriſt in God, and God in Christ, and Chriſt
in thee;</hi> which words I was compelled to ſing forth before the
companie in a ſtrange manner, and with ſuch a voice as was not
naturally mine owne: I ſung alſo divers phraſes of Scripture,
which were given into me; after which I was raiſed from the
ground, and ſet upon my feet by the power within me, which
bade me be humble, and brought me downe againe upon my
knees, and with a whiſpering voice ſaid to me, <hi>ſtoope low, low;</hi>
and having ſtooped neere the ground with my face, it ſaid
to me, <hi>take up thy Croſſe and follow me;</hi> whereupon ariſing I
was led out of the houſe (by the back doore) downe to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and back againe from thence into the Towne another way,
where I was ſenſibly drawn down the ſtreet, and cauſed ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to turne aſide to a doore of an houſe (my ſelfe not knowing
who lived in it) two of the ſaid companie following me all
the time, <hi>(viz.) William Dodding</hi> and <hi>Jehn Awdland,</hi> and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to go to that doore ſaid, <hi>whether wilt thou go? this is the
fidlers houſe;</hi> I anſwered, <hi>whoſe houſe ſoever it be Chriſt leades me
hither, and hither I must go,</hi> whereupon my hand was carried to
knock at the doore, and commanded by a voice to ſay, <hi>Behold,
Chriſt ſtands at the doore and knockes;</hi> after a while the Fidler
opened, and I was led into the houſe not ſpeaking any thing
unto him; where my hand was carried to a Bace-violl hanging
up in the houſe; I tooke it downe and began to plaie upon it
with my fingers, and was immediately compelled to fall a
dancing, which I ſeldome or never in all my life did before;
hereupon I queſtioned what power it ſhould be that carried me
forth to ſuch actions, to which the voice within me replied;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125945:5"/>
               <hi>This is not becauſe I love muſick, for I hate it, but to ſignifie unto
thee what joy there is in heaven at thy converſion; as alſo what ſpirituall
melodie thou ſhalt have hereafter:</hi> then I was led out of the houſe
into the ſtreet, and ſo carried along through the Towne, being
moved to proclame as I went, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life,</hi>
with other expreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to like purpoſe; after which I was brought
to mine owne houſe, the aforeſaid <hi>William Dodding</hi> going along
with me, acknowledged that he had no power to leave me all
this time; being come home, the ſame power would not ſuffer
me to reſt, but caſt me upon the ground, and cauſed me to make
circles round about the houſe with my hand, with many the
like actions, telling me, <hi>that I was putting off the oldman;</hi> my
hand alſo was carried to take up a ſtone which lay upon the
floore (which in my apprehenſion was in the forme of a mans
heart) the voice within me telling me, <hi>that Christ had taken that
ſtone out of my heart, and given me an heart of fleſh,</hi> and my hand
was moved to hold it forth to the ſpectators, and my tongue to
utter this ſentence, <hi>except you ſee ſignes and wonders you will not
beleeve;</hi> and throwing the aforeſaid ſtone amongſt them I ſaid,
<hi>Loe, here is my heart of ſtone;</hi> afterwards being caſt upon the
ground upon my back, the voice ſpake to me, ſaying, <hi>thou ſhalt
have two angels to keep thee,</hi> whereupon imediatly two Swallows
deſcended downe the Chimney, and ſat upon a ſhelfe over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the place where I lay: this others in the houſe beſides my
ſelfe beheld, and I cried to them, <hi>my angels, my angels,</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that they were angels from heaven, and that it was a
fulfilling the promiſe; I held out my hand towards them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
they ſhould have come to me, but they did not, but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
up the Chimney, though both the doore and the window
were open.</p>
            <p>I was alſo by the ſame power carried out of doores upon my
hands and knees into the ſtreet, which my Wife and others ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
endeavoured to hinder me, but I told them I would not be
hindred, but leave Wife, Children, and all to follow Chriſt: in
this manner I went up the ſtreet, thinking that I bore a Croſſe
upon my neck, and continued in this motion till ſome pulled me
out of the mire and durt, and by force carried me into the
houſe againe; whereupon I was moved to point to one of them
which brought me in, and to ſay to her, <hi>Cbriſt points at thee, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

the voice asked me where my Croſſe was, telling me I had ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
it, whereupon I was moved to make a Croſſe with my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
upon the floore, and forced to ſet my head upon it, playing
topſie turvie, or bull necks, thinking then I had retaken up my
Croſſe: in theſe actions I was kept a long while, having many
Scripture expreſſions given in, to the admiration of all that
heard me; ſometimes I was forced to leap and dance, this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
being given in to me, <hi>now I have finiſhed the worke which

                  </gap>e,</hi> thinking my Redemption then fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed;
but my joy continued not, for I was caſt downe
againe, and the voice told me, <hi>I had offended God in attributing
that to my ſelfe which was proper to Chriſt;</hi> whereupon I was caſt
upon the ground, and lying upon my belly, I was forced to
lick the duſt, and my hand carried to ſtrike extraordinarily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my head, having a voice given me, <hi>that no ſinne muſt go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed;</hi>
ſo creeping up and downe the houſe, I heard a voice
ſaying, <hi>where is thy Croſs?</hi> upon which looking aſide, I thought
I ſaw a viſible Croſſe hanging in a thread, which with my hand
I put behind my neck; I was kept in theſe poſtures all that day
till evening, when many Quakers came in to me, who ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thus, <hi>Be lowly, mind thy condition, and hearken to the voice
within;</hi> not giving any words of comfort or reproofe, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up any Petition at all for me, but departed, leaving me in
this condition; my ſtrength being almoſt ſpent, and my bodie
much conſumed by continuall reſtleſſeneſſe: Two of them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to watch with me that night, but I refuſed, telling them
I was well, whereupon they departed. After this my Wife and
Family being gone to bed, I being alone in the houſe, began to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>collect my ſelfe, and to queſtion whether that power by which
<hi>I</hi> had been ſo ſtrangly acted, were Divine or Diabolicall? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>I</hi> was immediately ſtruck with a pannick feare, and my
hand was carried to take up a Knife which lay upon the Table,
which being done, my hand was carried with it towards my
throat, and the voice ſaid to me, <hi>open a hole there, and I will give
thee the words of eternall life;</hi> whereupon <hi>I</hi> anſwered, <hi>what, with a
Knife?</hi> and ſo threw the Knife away, being conſident it was a
temptation, from which <hi>I</hi> deſire God to deliver me: My Wife
being in bed in the next roome, and hearing me ſpeake when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:125945:6"/>
none was with me, came out, and deſired me to go to bed, which
<hi>I</hi> did at her entreatie: all the night following <hi>I</hi> was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that it was the Devils power that had acted me all along
formerly, and was perſwaded that <hi>I</hi> was really poſſeſt with a
Devil, which muſt be ejected; &amp; in the morning <hi>I</hi> verily thought
that a Devill went out of me, at which inſtant <hi>I</hi> roared very
hideouſly, crying, <hi>now is the Devill gone out of me,</hi> at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
I and my family heard it thunder, (though none in the
Towne beſides heard it) which made me thinke it was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
<hi>he being the Prince of the power of the aire;</hi> ſoone after the
ſame power came under another notion and told me, <hi>that it was
Satan that had poſſeſt and led me heretofore, but now Chriſt was come,
and be by his power had east out Satan, and convinced me, that what
ever I had done the day before was in obedience to Satan, and that as I
had ſerved the Devill all the day before in my clothes, ſo that day I muſt
undo all that I had formerly done, onely in my ſhirt in Obedience to
Chriſt;</hi> which immediately <hi>I</hi> endeavoured, riſing out of my
bed, and going into the ſtreet with my ſhirt onely; but my wife
and others ſoone laid hold upon me, and ſtopt me; whereupon
the power within me told me, <hi>that I muſt be carried into the houſe
with foure women, as I had been the day before, or elſe I ſhould perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
ſtand there like a pillar of Salt, as</hi> Lots <hi>Wife did:</hi> So <hi>I</hi> was
borne in by foure women, who carried me againe into my bed,
which being done, <hi>I</hi> told them, <hi>I had been doing the Devils worke
the day before, but to day I must doe the work of Chriſt,</hi> and pointing
at a woman whom <hi>I</hi> had pointed at the day before, ſaid theſe
words, <hi>the devill told me yeſterday that you were a wicked woman, but
now Chriſi tels me that you are Gods Servant;</hi> the Woman being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
<hi>I</hi> fell to acting in my ſhirt onely, upon the bed, as <hi>I</hi> had
done formerly upon the houſe floore, playing topſie survie from
one bed to another, whereby <hi>I</hi> might have undone my ſelfe;
but the power which acted me, bid me not feare, <hi>for I will give
thee ſtrength.</hi> After this the power told me; <hi>that the devill had the
other day commanded me to beare my Croſs, but now Christ commands
thee to lay aſide thy Croſs, for Chriſt takes no pleaſure in Croſſes, nor
will he have me worſhip them as yeſterday I had done:</hi> Further the
power ſaid to me, <hi>the devill made thee yeſterday to lye all day upon
the ground, but now I bave provided a bed for thee,</hi> giving in this
Scripture to me, <hi>My yoke is eaſie;</hi> promiſing alſo, <hi>to give me bread
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:125945:7"/>
of life to eat, and water of life to drinke, and that out of my belly
ſhould flew Rivers of living water;</hi> whereupon my teeth were
cauſed to move, as if I had been eating; and I thought I felt in
my belly, a flowing up and downe as of waters, I was alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
that yeſterday the Devils Angells had waited on me, but
now Chriſts Angels ſhould guard me; whereupon I ſaw two
Butter flies in the window, to which my hand was carried, and
having taken one of them in my hand, I was moved by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
within me to put it into my mouth, and did ſwallow it down
into my bodie, which having done, I tooke the other in my
hand and was moved to put it to my throat, the power telling
me, <hi>it ſhould enter in there,</hi> ſaying, <hi>nothing is impoſſible to them that
beleeve.</hi> After this I was cauſed to make circles upon the bed, as
I had done formerly upon the ground; whereupon I began to
thinke that this was not of God, and ſo began to reſiſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by which I was acted, and thereupon fell into great feare and
doubting, crying out, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> but the
power told me, <hi>that it was too late to cry unto God, for ſentence was
already pronounced againſt me;</hi> whereupon I lay downe in my bed
nuch deſpairing, and was then convict, that it was the devill
which had againe deluded me; in which condition having laine
a ſhort ſpace, I was againe aſſaulted by a power the third time,
which told me, <hi>that it was a white devill that bad deceived me the
latter time, but new Chriſt was come ind<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed, and he would caſt him
out,</hi> whereupon I apprehended that Devill alſo to be ejected;
after which, as I lay in my bed, all the members of my bodie fell
a working as if the pangs of death had been upon me, the power
telling me, <hi>that it was the pangs of the new birth, and that Chriſt was
new borne in me,</hi> with which I was ſomewhat ſatisfied, lying in
that condition a whole day; in which time the power perſwaded
me <hi>that I ſhould worke wonders, and caſt out devils in his name:</hi> ſoon
after two Quakers came to me, <hi>viz. Geo. Bayley</hi> &amp; <hi>J. Braban,</hi> whom
I told that I had had two devils caſt out of me, but now Chriſt
was in me for a truth; then the power (pretending to be Chriſt)
ſaid theſe words, <hi>I was crowned with a crown of thornes, but I will
crown thee with a crown of glory,</hi> and bad me (as a figure thereof) <hi>to
ſet my fiſt upon my head and it ſhould appeare to the ſtanders by as a
glorious crown, though I ſaw nothing my ſelfe;</hi> which having done, I
ſpake to the ſtanders by, ſaying, <hi>what do you ſee?</hi> whereunto they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:125945:7"/>
gave me no anſwer (being Quakers) but turned their eies another
way, the power telling me, <hi>that they ſaw the crown upon my head;
but were ſo ſtrucken with admiration, that they could not expreſſe what
they ſaw;</hi> immediately the power bad me tell one of the Quakers
then preſent, <hi>that he had a devil in him, and that I ſhould have power
to cast him out;</hi> whereupon I ſaid to him, <hi>G. thou haſt a Devill in
thee,</hi> the power told me he ſhould <hi>quake and tremble,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
he did; the power bade me ſpeake to him <hi>to fall flat
upon the ground,</hi> which he did, and after a little ſpace roſe againe,
and <hi>I</hi> asked him <hi>whether the devil were gone out of him</hi> (having been
before perſwaded by the power that <hi>I</hi> ſhould caſt him out) to
which he gave me no anſwer, but the power told me <hi>that the
Devill warejected. I</hi> was told alſo by the ſame power who (of
thoſe that came to ſee me) <hi>bad devills, and who not; and that my
wife and my mother bad devills in them, but I had power given me to
caſt them out.</hi> After this, beginning againe to queſtion whether
this were Chriſt or not, <hi>I</hi> fell into great feare and doubting, as
formerly; whereupon the devil diſcovered himſelf to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and told me, <hi>that all this while I had been ſerving him, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
God, and that it was now too late to repent,</hi> whereupon <hi>I</hi> was
brought into deſpaire for a time, thinking every thing which <hi>I</hi>
either heard or ſaw, to be the Devil come to fetch me away: one
while <hi>I</hi> thought that <hi>I</hi> ſhould be taken away in a flame of fire, or
elſe that the earth would ſwallow me up quick; whereupon
<hi>I</hi> called my wife, and deſired her to bring up my children in the
feare of God, for the devill would fetch me away, my ſelfe ſtill
thinking that he was drawing me out of the bed; thus <hi>I</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
my ſelfe wholly under the power of the devil, and had no
power to recover my ſelfe out of that ſad condition. At laſt <hi>I</hi>
began (having been ſo long deluded) to deſiſt from hearkning to
the voice within me, and apply my ſelf unto God, in &amp; through
Chriſt, for deliverance from the power of Satan, knowing that
God was able to deliver me, though <hi>I</hi> were ſo farre involved in
the ſnare of the devill; thereupon my faith was in ſome meaſure
raiſed to beleeve that God would deliver me; whereupon <hi>I</hi> was
preſently in a great agonie, and did ſweat extreamly, in which
condition <hi>I</hi> continued all night, but was ſomewhat more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the morning, eſteeming my ſelfe in ſome meaſure reſcued
from the povver of the devill: yet having not reſolved, as yet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:125945:8"/>
finally to deſert that vvay, <hi>I</hi> vvas ſoone againe aſſaulted by the
ſame povver, telling me, <hi>that now the devil was finally caſt out of me,
and that the roome within me muſt not be left empty, but that Chriſt
must come and have the whole, &amp; ſole poſſeſſion, or elſe Satan would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and re-enter with ſeven other Devils worſe then himſelfe,</hi> telling
me vvithall, <hi>that he was Christ,</hi> and ſolliciting me to entertaine
and imbrace him as he had done formerly: <hi>I</hi> reſiſted the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this power for a time, having bin ſo often deluded; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
as a motive to perſwade me to entertain it, he repreſented
to my memorie all, or moſt of the remarkable paſſages of my life,
both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> told me how long <hi>I</hi> ſhould live,
<hi>viz.</hi> ten yeares, and where <hi>I</hi> ſhould die, <hi>viz</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and that
<hi>I</hi> had a weake bodie, but he would ſtrengthen it, and thereupon
cauſed me to rub my bodie all over with my hands, at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>I</hi> conceived my bodie to receive ſtrength, and the members
thereof to be more in ſubſtance then before; with divers other
paſſages, promiſing me proſperitie in the world, and ſpeaking
theſe words to me. <hi>John 4. 29. Behold, a man that hath told thee all
things that ever thou didſt, is not this Chriſt?</hi> whereupon <hi>I</hi> was at
laſt perſwaded to imbrace this power, thinking that it was Chriſt
indeed; whereupon <hi>I</hi> was preſently ſenſible of a working
throughout my whole bodie, which ſoone ceaſed, and then <hi>I</hi>
thought that my condition was good, and Chriſt to be really in
me: afterwards this power told me, that <hi>I</hi> had highly offended
God in all my former paſſages in giving way to Satan, and that
<hi>I</hi> was guiltie of all ſins except that againſt the holy Ghoſt, but
told me, that <hi>I</hi> did it ignorantly, and therefore he had pitty on
me; <hi>I</hi> was further perſwaded by the ſame power, that <hi>I</hi> ſhould lie
(ſeemingly) dead, which <hi>I</hi> did, not daring to ſtirre, til the power
moved me. Lying thus a while, the power began firſt to move one
of my legs, and then the other; after that my hands, and then my
head, and at laſt my whole bodie; cauſing me to ſit up in my bed;
and telling me, <hi>that thus ſhould my body be quickened and raiſed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
at the laſt day:</hi> then the power told me, <hi>that I muſt pull off my
ſhirt, and my cap, and the napkin which I had about my neck,</hi> ſaying,
<hi>that whatſoever was about me was polluted, and that he hated the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſpotted with the fleſh;</hi> whereupon I pull'd them off, &amp; threw
them on the ground, uttering theſe ſame words, <hi>that I hated the
garments ſpotted with the fleſh:</hi> the power alſo told me, <hi>that all my
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:125945:8"/>
bonds were broken, and my cords looſened, and that Chriſt had ſet me
free;</hi> vvhereupon calling for a clean ſhirt, &amp; other linnen, I aroſe,
concluding my ſelf to be in a good condition; yet finding my ſelf
being up no better, nor my bodie more ſtrengthened, but rathet
vveakened, I began to ſee that I had been deluded in this laſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
as formerly; vvhereupon I was ſtrucken with fear, &amp; walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Garden, I thought one while tbat the Devill would
pull me into the earth, and another while that he would pull me
into the aire, ſo that I was afraid to continue abroad, and came
againe into the houſe, and ſuſpected every thing that I heard to
be the Devil waiting to fetch me away; being in this perplexitie
of ſoule, I began to conſider hovv grievouſly I had offended God
in rejecting the uſe of all externall means; as reading, hearing,
prayer, &amp;c. in the uſe whereof God hath commanded us to vvait
upon him, and therefore that it vvas moſt juſt vvith him to leave
me to my ſelfe, and to give me over to ſtrong deluſion, that I
ſhould beleeve lies, vvhich vvas my condition for a time, by the
juſt judgement of God upon me, as for other provocations, ſo
eſpecially for rejecting the revealed vvill of God in his Word, &amp;
hearkning only to a voice vvithin me; becauſe vvhat vvas ſpoken
by it, vvas ſeconded by lying Wonders, of vvhich God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
notice in his Word that ſo his people might not give credit
to them, nor be deluded by them. I hope the Reader vvill ſo farre
give heed to vvhat <hi>I</hi> have related concerning my ſelfe, as to learn
thereby to take heed of being impoſed upon by the devil, though
he doth transforme himſelfe into an angell of light; vvhich ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
if any reape by it, <hi>I</hi> have my end: it hath been no ſmall
burthen to my conſcience (ſince Gods gracious deliverance of
me from this ſnare) that I ſhould ſo farre gratifie the grand Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie,
as not onely to liſten to his ſuggeſtions, and embrace his
voice for the voice of Chriſt, but alſo wholly to neglect thoſe
meanes, in the conſtant and conſcientious uſe whereof God hath
promiſed to reveale himſelf unto his people, and to give in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to them, which becauſe <hi>I</hi> found not (though through my
owne default) <hi>I</hi> did in effect ſay, <hi>why ſhould I waite for the Lord
any longer?</hi> and ſo turned unto lying vanities. Oh, that all who
affect novelties, would ſeriouſly conſider of it, and take warning
by it; for, <hi>Turpius eiicitur quam non admittitur.</hi> It is eaſier to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
