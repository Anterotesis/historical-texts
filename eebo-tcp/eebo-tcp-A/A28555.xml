            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT the Houſe of Commons now Elected, and within a very fews day to Sit, is one of the moſt Loyal that this Nation has ſeen at any time ſince the Death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is I ſuppoſe not doubted by any Man who has at all conſidered either who has Choſen them, or who has been Choſen.</p>
            <p>Whence then proceeds the inſufferable Inſolence and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> juſt at this time, and where may one gueſs the Deſign to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate?</p>
            <p>Liberty of Conſcience is no new Plea, it has fed the Preſs, yea and maintain'd many of its Patrons too almoſt ever ſince the Year 1660. For before that time, we had no great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the Doctrine, but only in relation to thoſe who had

imbroyl'd three Nations in Blood and Miſery; and yet all they could not find in their hearts to allow it to their own dear Brethren neither, for the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> oppoſed, and both wrote and Preached what they could againſt it, as has been proved beyond a poſſibility of Contradiction from their own Prints; and when they were reduced to ſo low a Condition, that they could neither grant nor deny it, <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> and the Independant Party would never grant this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, either to the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> or to the Members of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and which was more than Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, they would not ſuffer <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory, when under reſtraint by them, to have any one of his own Chaplains with him, which Extorted this bitter Complaint from him. <hi>To deny me the Ghoſtly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>

               <hi>of my Chaplains, ſeems a greater Rigour and Barbarity than is ever uſed by Chriſtians to the meaneſt Priſoners and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Malefactors, whom tho' the Juſtice of the Law deprived of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforts, yet the Mercy of Religion allows them the Benefit of their Clergy, as not aiming at once to deſtroy their Bodies and to damn their Souls. But my Agony muſt not be relieved with the Preſence of any one good Angel; for ſuch I account a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Godly, and Diſcreet Divine.</hi> And a little before this, he has this Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Solitude they have confin'd me unto, adds the Wilderneſs to my Temptations; for the Company they obtrude upon me, is more ſad than any Solitude can be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When after this they had inhumanly Murthered him and the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Hertford,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Lindſey,</hi> together with the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> had taken upon them the Care and Charge of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Murdered Maſter, and thereupon Petitioned with great Humility to have Liberty to Read the <hi>Liturgie</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that Purpoſe; it was denyed, and they forced to Depoſite him in Silence and Sorrow.</p>
            <p>How the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Puritans treated the Son after the Death of the Father, is very well known, but they of <hi>Scotland</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to oblige him, Call'd him in, and promiſed to Crown him. But did they allow him the Liberty of his Conſcience? No, he muſt take the <hi>Covenant</hi> firſt, and be converted. <hi>And one Evening walking in the Garden, a couple of Dapper</hi> Covenant-Levites

               <hi>the Lords Day by a Walk, tho' he had heard two Sermons, and been publickly at Morning and Evening Prayers that day, beſides other private Meditations he was much given to.</hi> This was all the Liberty of Conſcience they would allow their Prince in <hi>Scotland;</hi> whereas in <hi>England</hi> they ſought his Blood.</p>
            <p>How they treated the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> or <hi>Prelatical</hi> Party during the Rebellion is well enough remembred, and after the King was reſtored, and the Laws thereby return'd to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Force and Vigor, yet they pretended even then, to fear they had ſinn'd againſt the Lord, by ſuffering <hi>Popery</hi> (ſo they call'd the Service of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> to be ſet up; and did what they could to hinder it. Till an Act of Parliament brought them under. And ever ſince the Act of Uniformity paſſed, they have been Bauling for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length in the beginning of 1672, they by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> obtained an <hi>Indulgence</hi> of the Late King, what uſe did they make of it? Why, <hi>one of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Diſſenters ſuſpected the kindneſs, and made Queries upon the Declaration, wherein he repreſented it as a Stratagem to introduce Pope<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y and Arbitrary Government.</hi> And though there were others which defended it with that inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence annexed to it, till they were in a Capacity to do their own buſineſs without them; yet after they had ſet a foot the Popiſh Plot, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Affections of the Populace, then the Note was altered, and <hi>the Papiſts</hi> (was <note place="margin">Preface to the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, p. 25, 26.</note> declared) <hi>one whoſe Worſhip to us is Idolatry, and we cannot therefore allow them the Liberty of Publick Aſſembling, as others of the Separation.</hi> This very paſſage but five years before was Worded thus. <hi>But as for the Common Papiſt, who lives Innocently in his way, he is to us</hi> (the Diſſenters) <hi>as other Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts, and ſo comes under the like Toleration.</hi> So in 1675 it was lawful to tolerate the <hi>Popiſh Recuſants,</hi> becauſe they could not be Tolerated themſelves without their aſſiſtance: But in 1680. when they were in their Ruff, and had as they thought, brought all under their Feet, then it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful. And now again in 1685. it is not only become Lawful, but abſolutely neceſſary. Theſe are your Men of Conſcience!</p>

               <hi>they were ſuch as hardly knew how to Pray, but out of our Liturgy, that attempted to Exclude the Preſumptive Heir to the Crown, upon the ſcore of his Religion.</hi> Another follows the cry thus, <hi>Let him</hi> (the Anſwerer) <hi>be juſt, and he will find the Excluders almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sunday at their Pariſh Churches, and if three quarters of them were to pray for their Lives, it may be they could better read their Clergy, than ſay their Prayers without the Publick Liturgy.</hi> The other quarter tho' were gifted Brethren in this Gentleman's eſteem, whereas with the former they were all Church of <hi>England</hi> Men.</p>
            <p>Why the Author of <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> will tell you, the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers, with a brave and warm Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Preface.</note> 
               <hi>and a Proteſtant Prince, generouſly offered their Lives and Fortunes, and the laſt drop of Blood in defence of his Majeſty, and the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now Eſtabliſhed by Law, and by the ſame Lives and Fortunes and laſt drop of Blood, are promiſed over again to a Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour.

            </p>
            <p>The poor <hi>Levice</hi> was fain to rifle the <hi>Alcoran</hi> for a ſimile to repreſent this Contradiction by. Now, Gentlemen, were theſe Addreſſers Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, or Diſſenters? Was this Book cryed up by <hi>Whiggs</hi> or <hi>Tories?</hi> It is but five years ago ſince the Vote paſs'd, leſs ſince <hi>Julian</hi> was Printed; rub up your Memories, and try if you can poſſibly recollect who was

for the Excluſion, and who was againſt it. Who addreſſed to the <hi>Oxford</hi> Members, and who to the King, after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament, and then tell me, if your Fore-heads be not a little ſteel'd to talk at this rate; and whereabouts a Diſſenters Conſcience may be found, before we allow it Liberty.</p>
            <p>Well, but Liberty of Conſcience is the thing they want, and muſt have it if it be poſſible; but all the Craft is in the catching; now they know that the Law ſtands in the way, and how to get rid of that is the difficulty.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They accoſt the King, and impudently tell him, that they, good Men, never attempted to Exclude him, and the conſequence is, that he muſt grant them Liberty of Conſcience. Why, if they had never attempted it, this was but a Negative Obligation and goes no further, than if I ſhould accoſt a Great Man I never ſaw before, and beg a Favour, becauſe I never did him an Injury. But here the King knows the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that they did attempt to Exclude him, and had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed an Act to that purpoſe, if the late King had not, with the aſſiſtance of the Lords, and Loyal true Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, oppos'd and baffled them.</p>
            <p>Well, but ſuppoſe he would help them to the thing they want, there are eſtabliſhed Laws in his way, and he cannot repeal them, but by other Laws, and they muſt paſs in Parliament, and by the Conſent of the Lords and Commons, and time enough it had been to have made their Application to him and them in Parliament; but of what uſe are theſe numerous Pamphlets in the mean time, but to fire the Rabble, make them ungovernable?</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſe the King ſhould, to gratifie them, do it by his Prerogative, without Act of Parliament, as the late King did, what Reaſon hath he to expect any other return than his Brother found, and that is to be repreſented forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the Nation, as one that deſigned to introduce Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government and Popery, and ſo to have his Throne undermin'd, and his Government made unſafe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time have they not gone as far as they could, or durſt, ſince his Eſtabliſhment, to imbroyl his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to chuſe thoſe very Men into this Parliament, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98463:5"/>
to Exclude him in three laſt. And is there not now Arms bought, and Ships put to Sea, to the intent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his Dominions, by thoſe of this Party, that have fled for attempting to Murder him at the <hi>Rie,</hi> with his Brother the late King? And have they not endeavoured to recommend his Rival to the People here, tho' there was no body to back them. And after all this, is it reaſonable that he ſhould looſe the Reins, and give Liberty to ſuch enraged, falſe, perfidious Men as theſe are, who have done what they could to ruin him, in ſpite of all reſtraint? Believe me, they expect no ſuch thing from him, but make all the impudent applications to make him more odious to the Party, by his denial.</p>
            <p>Well, they ſeem to have little reaſon to expect any favour from the King, but what Friends may they expect in the States in this Parliament.</p>
            <p>As to the Church of <hi>England</hi> Lords and Commons, they have laid the Bill of Excluſion at their Doors, turn'd over all the Excluders to them, and waſhed their own hands of them, as <hi>Pilot</hi> did of our Saviour's Blood, <hi>with a See you to it, I am innocent:</hi> Now, as this is the moſt impudent falſhood that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſpoken by Men, ſo it is the baſeſt Reproach, the baſeſt diſhonour, and, I doubt not, but they will accordingly reſent it, when time ſhall ſerve.</p>
            <p>But many, I might ſay almoſt all the Commons, have been moſt baſely traduced by theſe Men, for ſticking to the King againſt the Excluders; many of them were excluded out of the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> Parliament for Papiſts, Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Favourers of Papiſts; or as the word was <hi>Adherents to the Papiſts;</hi> many of them have been ſent for up into Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <note place="margin">Vox Patriae.</note> turn'd out of the Houſe with Diſgrace, impriſon'd and put to great Charges for their Loyalty, all of them have been deſigned for Slaughter and Ruin, as <hi>MEN-WORTHY</hi> by the <hi>WORTHY-MEN.</hi> And after all this, can they expect they will throw up the Laws, and put themſelves into the power of theſe Furies? Is this the way to beſpeak their Pity, or obtain their Favour?</p>
            <p>As to the Biſhops, which make the other part of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Houſe, what Injury could the Wit of Man deviſe, which in the time of the late Popiſh Plot they did not heap upon them, to make them odious to the King, and to the People?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98463:5"/>
Did they not diſpute their Priviledges in Parliament, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make them appear guilty of the Plot, did they not traduce them as this Kings faſt Friends, and therefore Enemies to the Proteſtant Religion?</p>
            <p>And in all the late Pamphlets have they not repreſented them, as the worſt of Men, together with the reſt of the Loyal Clergy? <hi>Take off the thing that pinches, take off Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

               <hi>do but change the Saddles, and ſet them both aright, and ſee then whether the Church-men, or the Fanaticks and Catholicks will be moſt Governable.</hi> That is, perſecute the Church-men, and beſtow the Biſhoppricks, and Church Revenues amongſt the Catholicks and Phanaticks, and ſee which will be beſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, beſt pleaſed, moſt Humble, and moſt Dutiful Subjects.

            <p>Well, but when all other helps fails, they expect ſome aſſiſtance from the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> His Grace leads the Dance, and ſhews ſome kindneſs for Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>page</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> The Reply tells, <hi>One thing I muſt ſay,</hi> Roman Catholicks <hi>have been Loyal in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Holland, <hi>and</hi> Presbyterians <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>and the</hi> German <hi>Principalities,</hi> page 22.

And now, are not the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> bound to give him thanks for his great Civility to them, who have done worſe, both by them, and the great Man of their Communion, than barely to reflect on them, though they have done that ſufficiently too. Remember the <hi>Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> the Virulent <hi>Appeal to the City, Julian the Apoſtate,</hi> the Fanatick Plot, the uſe theſe Good Men made of the late <hi>Toleration,</hi> and tell me if theſe are not a ſort of Truſty Friends for <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to rely on.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs it is as little their intereſt to procure a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

for the Diſſenters, as it is that of the Church Men, as things now ſtand, and they are wiſe Men, and know it; and if the Liberty of Conſcience-Men were not Num-skulls, they would never have made theſe fulſome Applications at this time of the day.</p>
            <p>Well, but whatever the Diſſenters have been, there are three or four ſmall Pamphleteers will give the King their worſhipful words for their good behaviour for the Future, In good time. But ſuppoſe it proves otherwiſe, what then? Why he is deceived, they good Men will cry, who could have thought it? But I will anſwer this in the Words of the Noble Peer, the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> a ſpecial Friend of theirs. <hi>If a</hi> French <hi>Nobleman</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould come to dwell in my Houſe and Family, I ſhould think it concern'd me to a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But we are told, all the ill things they have done, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are Laws made againſt them, and they would be quiet, if they might have their minds. As to the firſt of theſe, <hi>ex malis Moribus bonae oriuntur Leges,</hi> there was ill and diſloyol Practices againſt the State, by <hi>Seditious Sectaries,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was any Law made againſt them. Look into the preamble of the 35 of <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. which was the firſt Law that was made againſt them, and ſee if be not ſo; and as for all the reſt, we can remember upon what occaſions they were made.</p>
            <p>And now, if they were ſo turbulent before there was any Law, and have been ſo unruly and ungovernable, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Laws have hung over their Heads, and have ſome times been ſeaſonably Executed upon them, what may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they will be, when the Laws, and, with them, all Fear and Aw is removed?</p>
            <p>Men of Wiſdom will try as few Concluſions in point of Government as is poſſible, becauſe they weaken Authority and ſtrengthen Factions. And I am fully perſwaded, theſe Gentlemen do no more hope to obtain a Toleration, than I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98463:6"/>
fear they will; they do neither Write nor Act as if they did: What then is the Deſign? Why it is hard to dive into the Secrets of Men, but yet a Man may conjecture at them with ſubmiſſion to wiſer Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, upon his now Majeſties coming to the Crown, the whole Party were Thunder-ſtruck, they knew how they had uſed him, and therefore expected he would treat them, tho' not as they deſerved, yet otherwiſe than they deſired, and fearing at once his Valour, Juſtice, Activity and Conſtancy, they ſat down in Silence and Sorrow, expecting the Event, and who would be in an Inſurrection.</p>
            <p>Hereupon all the <hi>Trimmers</hi> and <hi>Half-way</hi> Men began to tack about, to take the Sacrament, go to Church, Vote for Loyal Men, imagining the Game was loſt, and no hopes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Revolution. No room for Seditious prate, Cogging nor Flattery.</p>
            <p>In this Melancholly Mood his Grace found them when he Publiſhed his <hi>Eſſay,</hi> and it was a Work which no meaner Perſon durſt have began. But we ſee there is enough that will follow.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Parliament drawing on apace, they expect the Preſs will then be reſtrain'd, ſo that what they do, they muſt do quickly; for their Affairs are deſperate and meer deſperation, makes them Valiant, and if they cannot prevent the fatal Blow, they will yet try if they cannot Revenge it, and render the Church Party odious.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is very probable they have ſome encouragement from their Friends in <hi>Holland,</hi> and whilſt they are preparing for a deſcent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> this is a Stratagem to Alarm the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>England,</hi> and to let them ſee the Cauſe is not quite loſt yet; there are thoſe that will ſtick to it, and appear for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience, Hector the Church, and plead for a forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what ever is paſt, that they may be in a Capacity to react all their old Crimes over again.</p>
            <p>And if they meet with the leaſt encouragement either at home or abroad, the leaſt countenance or belief, I can eaſily foretel what the Event will be.</p>
            <p>But if they find neither to ſuite their deſires, and that the next Parliament prove what they fear it will, the People of the Whig Party muſt bear the ſmart, and the Pamphleteers have only loſt ſo much Paper and Time.</p>
