            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <stage>By <hi>Sancho,</hi> Riding upon his Ass.</stage>
                  <l>'MOngst our Fore-fathers, that pure Wit profest,</l>
                  <l>There's an old Proverb, <hi>That two Heads are best.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Dapple</hi> and I have therefore jogg'd this way,</l>
                  <l>Through sheer good Nature, to defend this Play:</l>
                  <l>Tho' I've no Friends, yet he (as proof may shew,)</l>
                  <l>May have Relations here, for ought I know.</l>
                  <l>For in a Crowd, where various Heads are addle,</l>
                  <l>May, many an Ass be, that ne'er wore a Saddle.</l>
                  <l>'Tis then for him that I this Speech intend,</l>
                  <l>Because I know he is the Poet's Friend;</l>
                  <l>And, as 'tis said, a parlous Ass once spoke,</l>
                  <l>When Crab-tree Cudgel did his Rage provoke;</l>
                  <l>So if you are not civil, 'sbud, I fear,</l>
                  <l>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'ll speak again,—</l>
                  <l>And tell the Ladies, every <hi>Dapple</hi> here.</l>
                  <l>Take good Advice then, and with kindness win him,</l>
                  <l>Tho' he looks simply, you don't know what's in him:</l>
                  <l>He has shrew'd Parts, and proper for his place,</l>
                  <l>And yet no Plotter, you may see by's Face;</l>
                  <l>He tells no Lyes, nor does Sedition vent,</l>
                  <l>Nor ever Brays against the Government:</l>
                  <l>Then for his Garb he's like the <hi>Spanish</hi> Nation,</l>
                  <l>Still the old Mode, he never changes Fashion;</l>
                  <l>His sober Carriage too you've seen to day,</l>
                  <l>But for's Religion, troth, I cannot say</l>
                  <l>Whether for <hi>Mason, Burgis, Muggleton,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>The House with Steeple, or the House with None;</l>
                  <l>I rather think he's of your Pagan Crew,</l>
                  <l>For he ne'er goes to Church—no more than you.</l>
                  <l>Some that would, by his Looks, guess his Opinion,</l>
                  <l>Say, he's a <hi>Papish</hi>; others, a <hi>Socinian</hi>:</l>
                  <l>But I believe him, if the truth were known;</l>
                  <l>As th'rest of the Town-Asses are, of none;</l>
                  <l>But for some other Gifts—mind what I say,</l>
                  <l>Never compare, each <hi>Dapple</hi> has his Day,</l>
                  <l>Nor anger him, but kindly use this Play;</l>
                  <l>For should you with him, conceal'd Parts disclose,</l>
                  <l>Lord! how like Ninneys, would look all the <hi>Beaus.</hi>

                           <p>We'll make him believe that all things are governed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment. The Inn-keeper has provided half a dozen merry Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, with Magicians and Devils Vizards, such as are used in <hi>Carnaval</hi> time, with other rare Anticks, and all to assist in the Frolick. He also has a rare Contrivance to carry him off, which is, a great wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cage, in which Two Eagles formerly were kept; the use of it, if you please to be present, you'll see with Satisfaction; and if you can laugh, you'll have cause I warrant you.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE good success, which both the Parts of Don <hi>Quixote</hi> have had, either from their Natural Merit, or the Indulgence of my Friends, or both, ought sufficiently to satisfie me, that I have no reason to value the little Malice of some weak Heads, that make it their business to be simply Criticizing.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore desist from any Answer in that kind, and wholly rely upon, and please my self, with the good Opinion and kind Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Iudicious, who unanimously declare, that I have not lessened my self in the great undertaking, of drawing two Plays out of that ingenious History, in which if I had flagg'd either in Stile or Character, it must have been very obvious to all Eyes; but on the contrary, I have had the honour to have it judg'd that I have done both Don <hi>Quixote</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> Iustice, making as good a Copy of the first as possible, and furnishing the last with newer and better Proveabs of my own than he before diverted ye with.</p>
                  <p>Besides, I think I have given some additional Diversion in the continuance of the Character of <hi>Marcella,</hi> which is wholly new in this Part, and my own Invention; the design finishing with more pleasure to the Audience by punishing that coy Creature by an extravagant Passion here, that was so inexorable and cruel in the first Part, and ending with a Song so incomparably well sung, and acted by Mrs. <hi>Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girdle,</hi> that the most envious do allow, as well as the most ingenious affirm, that 'tis the best of that kind ever done before.</p>
                  <p>Then I must tell my severe Censurers, who will be spitting their Venom against me tho to no purpose, that I deserve some acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for drawing the Character of <hi>Mary</hi> the Buxom, which was intirely my own, and which I was not obliged to the History at all for, there

                  <p>The rest of the Characters in both the Parts were likewise extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well performed, in which I had as much Iustice done me as I could expect, nor was the Musical Part less commendable, the Words every where being the best of mine in that kind, and if in the whole, they could draw such Audiences for so long time, in such violent hot Weather, I shall not despair, that when the Season is more temperate, to see at their next representation, a great deal of good Company.</p>
                  <p>I have Printed some Scenes both in the first and second part which were left out in the Acting— the Play and the Musick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too long; and I doubt not but they will divert in the reading, because very proper for the Connexion: And as I have in this, and in all my things, studied to promote the Pleasure and Satisfaction of my Friend; so I am very well satisfied, to find by my profit, that I have not lost my Labour.</p>

                  <p>Amongst all good Qualities that seem Praise-worthy in human Nature, the most proper and most reasonable is <hi>Gratitude</hi>; and amongst all persons, on whom for Benefits received there is a Duty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, I, Sir, am most obliged to own my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to you: for never had any one less Opportunity to deserve your Kindness, nor ever had any one more generous or hearty Proofs of it. And since 'tis decreed that my humble Fate will permit me to express my Gratitude no other way than by Expression, Thanks, and verbal Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That, Sir, whilst I live be pleased to believe

you shall hourly receive, large and unbounded as your Generous Intentions to me.</p>
                  <p>Amongst all your numerous Favours, be pleased, Sir, to let me own the first, (which shall eternally grow to my Heart and Memory,) which was your sending for me to introduce me to <hi>The late Adored Queen of ever Glorious Memory:</hi> Of all whose graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Smiles on me, enrich'd with Royal Bounty, you and <hi>your good Lady, my ever honoured Patroness,</hi> were the happy Causes. When Majesty, like the Sun, shone with a Heavenly Influenee, you took care to plant me in the View, and gave me the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of receiving the Grace that follow'd; nor did you stop there, but afterwards made me known and honoured me with your good Word to most of the principal Nobility, the true Patrons of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and their Art, by whom I have not since been forgot, and whose Favour is a certain Fortune to any Son of the Muses. And this most generous and uncommon Grace, Sir, when I cease to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or fail in point of Duty, you may certainly take it for granted, I am ceased to be at all.</p>
                  <p>And now Sir, That my Ambition may know its bounds, and soar no farther, let me beseech you to accept of this Dedication of my self and Duty; and likewise be pleased to receive this Trifle of a Play, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Well then, since you must have another Cup of Prate, I'll leave ye, and get me gone to <hi>Mary</hi>; the Girl must have some Colberteen Lace set upon her Wedding Smock: Bless me! what a do has there been about that Smock? Mother, she cries, are the Gussets big enough here? Is it sloped enough at top, and wide enough at bottom. I've had above a hundred Questions about that Smock: I warrant that Smock has been bleaching in her head above this two Months. <stage>Ex. Ter.</stage>

                           <p>So, now she's gone, Vather, let's dicourse a little more; for I've a huge Inckling to know a few more of <hi>Mary</hi>'s good qualities. By Conscience I look upon <hi>Mary</hi> to have a notable Understanding, Vather-in-Law.</p>

                           <p>Understanding; She can make a Pudding; that's as much Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding as a Wife has need of.</p>

                           <p>Now if she be but virtuous —against which she has one wicked sign, your Nose, Vather-in-Law, for, to quip you with a Proverb too, one may know by your Nose what <hi>Mutton</hi> you love— I say, if she be but virtuous, and has but an eye to her honour as Gentlefolks call it, then all's right.</p>

                           <p>Virtuous! Ay, I warrant her she's as virtuous as the Skin between her Brows; but you must not give your self so much to Jealousie nor Doubt, Son-in-Law: He that's afraid of every Grass, must not piss in a Meadow; if you fear, why will you go to't, why will you marry?</p>

                           <p>Why, by Conscience I don't know; I go to't as other folks do, I think, for ready Pudding: Besides, <hi>Mary</hi> has such a way with her, such a jigging crumptious whim with her Backside, that she's as full of Temptation as an Egg is full of Meat, she has a pure stroke with her, fackins— Then, to say the truth, <hi>Mary</hi>'s very well forehanded too.</p>

                           <p>Faith, yes; I like his Promise well enough: But to tell the Emperour her Father, that he should find her in Bed without her Smock, that methinks wanted a little Decency — He should have allowed her a little clean Linnen to be seen in.</p>
