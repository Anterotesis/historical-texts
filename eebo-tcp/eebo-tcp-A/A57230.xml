         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THou art seriously to consider, that the <hi>Reverend</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOUR
did not cite Scriptures by number, but weight:
He did not jumble Scriptures together fortuitously, (as
too many do, as <hi>Democritus</hi> did his atomes) but judiciously
selected out those which were most apposite. And surely, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more helpful to the right understanding of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
then comparing it with it selfe: do not therefore sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passe over his Scriptures, as if they were of no moment,
but diligently peruse them, and let it not be grievous to turne
to the places cited, for the marrow of this Book consists in
the Authours dexterous paralleling of Scriptures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

me a longer space of time for the perusal of them, which I was willing to accept, not
knowing what leisure I should have for them in regard of some present distractions; yet I
could not forbear to lay hold on all opportunities, to enjoy the view of them; which I much
thirsted after: which upon serious survey I found to be answerable to my pre-conceived expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of them, and well-worthy their Authour, containing in them many remarkable matters,
either not commonly taken notice of, or mistaken by the most. In the Computation of times,
your Lordship well knoweth, and much better then my self, that there are divers difficult
points much disputed and debated among the grand Masters of that part of learning, in which
being not so exactly versed in such Accounts, I dare not take upon me to determine ought. I
have drawn up here a short note of some things of no great moment, which meeting with, I stick
at, or have doubt of, that it may appear to your Lordship, that I have not slighted or laid it
by me, but have advisedly run it over: which having dispatched, I was the rather willing to
return it to your Lordship by the hands of my sonne <hi>Tayler,</hi> who was willing to take thereby
occasion to wait upon your Lordship, to present you with a sorry fruit of my fruitlesse labours,
which I shall intreat your Lordship to accept, and to look on with a favourable eye. This short
list of my work and undigested thoughts, your Lordship may be pleased, if you shall think
good, and deem them worthy of his consideration, to impart unto the Venerable Bishop,
with recommendation of my due respects, and sincere affection to him, whom I should be right
glad to be better acquainted withal, together with my humble request to him, that he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

much discovered. So with sincere acknowledgement of your Lordships manifold favours,

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first draught of these <hi>Observations</hi> was ready for the Presse before
the Great <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the Bible, printed in <hi>Anno</hi> 1651. did come
forth. Afterwards perusing them, I found some differences between
<hi>those Annotations,</hi> and <hi>these Observations;</hi> which did minister some
occasion of enlarging my first draught; chiefly by noting and insisting
upon these differences: yet rarely naming the said <hi>Annotations;</hi> but
leaving rather the full animadverting, comparing and judging of them, to the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reader. Thereafter I committed these to the Presse. And after a good progress
had been made by it, for <hi>some reasons,</hi> not so fit to trouble thee withal, I was again indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and over-ruled, to enlarge my self yet much more; and to descend to very many
Particulars, by way of Exposition and Explanation in some of the ensuing Books of
Scripture, much beyond what was my first Proposal and Intendment. Which thing, I
conceive, will dim the light and lustre of those choice places and <hi>Observations,</hi> which
primarily were my only aime. Yet, I hope, to the Candid Reader, These larger additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will not seem altogether impertinent, or improfitable; as to the speedier under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of Gods Holy Word. Neverthelesse I never undertook or intended to
meddle with, or mention all the difficult places of Sacred Scripture. For them, in
general, I refer thee to the said Great <hi>Annotations,</hi> as the best extant in that kinde.
Neither do I here touch upon the <hi>New Testament,</hi> save only when, and where, the
Text or the Old Testament doth crave for the quotation of it. In this Collection of
<hi>Observations</hi> and <hi>Explanations,</hi> I follow the Order of the Books and Chapters of the
Bible. And I heartily wish, that the holy Text were alwayes before their eyes, who
shall vouchsafe to read them; without which the life of them, or of many of them
will be lost. And the numerous quotations therein used will really appear, specially
to Divines, to be of good concernment to them, and who shall have occasion to use
them, and will take the paines to turne unto them. Be pleased not to think that I am
too curious, or thy self can be too ambitious, of knowing any truth revealed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
Thou canst not search them too much, nor can the Word of God dwell too
richly and plentifully in thee. Indeed the substantial and essential matters therein,
must first be known and cared for. Yet these may help to bring divers remarkable
Places and Passages of Scripture into more common knowledge, and familiar notion,
then I suppose yet they are. Such as they are, yet now at the last, though the Presse
much retarded them, if they may any wayes make for thy spiritual use and profit, that

               <p>
                  <hi>light day</hi>] Strictly and usually so taken; otherwise
called an Artificiall day, consisting of about twelve houres,
<hi>John</hi> 119 As the natural day consists of 24. houres. Both
there are mentioned, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. 12, 17.</p>
               <p>V. 5. <hi>And the evening, &amp;c.</hi>] The Evening, which is
the beginning of the Night; and the Morning, which is
the beginning of the Day, are called the first day; largely
taken, the Day natural of 24 houres. And here observe,
that as Darknesse was before Light, <hi>v</hi> 2, 3. so the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Night is made, and reckoned the beginning, and
first part of the natural day, or large day of 24. houres. And
accordingly the large Day is called an Evening Morning,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 8. 14, 26. And by <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a Night-Day,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25. And as <hi>Moses</hi> doth here, so God commanded
it, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> observed it, to reckon the beginning of
their large Day at the Evening, <hi>Lev. 23. 32. From evening
to evening you shall celebrate your Sabbath.</hi> And so for eating
unleavened bread at the Passeover. <hi>Exod. 12 18, In the first
moneth, on the fourteenth day of the moneth at even, ye shall
eat unleavened bread untill the twenty one day of the moneth
at even.</hi> And ye we finde in the dayes of our Saviour, the
reckoning altered, that they began their natural and large
Day in the Morning, as appeares in the Evangelists, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
the History of our Saviours Resurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi>
28. 1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 1, 2, 9. &amp; <hi>ch. 15. 42. Luke 24. 1 Joh.</hi> 20. 1, 19.
Which alteration might haply be occasioned by the
accompt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and complyance with them, who
then had the sovereignty and dominion over them.</p>
               <p>Now these two things well observed, may haply serve to
assoyle a doubt, and clear a difficulty. The case is this;
Our Saviour did eat the Passeover twenty foure houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Jewes</hi> did eat it. And this is clear out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels,
<hi>Matth. 26. 17, 18, 19, 20, 47. Mark</hi> 15. 42.
<hi>Luke 23. 54. Joh</hi> 18. 28. and 9. 14, 31, 42. That our
Saviour did not anticipate the day by reason of his future
Passion; But kept the right day appointed in the Law, we
are not to doubt of it; Considering the strictnesse of the
Command for the day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 10. And Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:49194:7"/>
to fulfil all righteousnesse, to keep the Law both Moral
and Levitical. And that he did so in this point and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
appears also, <hi>Matth. 26. 17. Marke</hi> 14. 12. Neither
do those words in <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 1, 2. disagree from it; The
words there mentioned, before the feast of the Passeover, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to be understood of two dayes before the Passeover,
<hi>Mat</hi> 26. 2. And being spoken on the Mount of Olives, <hi>Mat.</hi>
24. 3. And the Supper there mentioned, being to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the Supper in the night of the Passeover, which was
kept in <hi>Jerusalem, Mat.</hi> 26. 17. And those loavs of bread in the
Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 9, 10. could make and multiply the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Deluge, to rise to such an height; and that as
little by miracle, as the other way must needs imply.</p>
               <p>Now the right day was the fourteenth day of the first
moneth, <hi>Abib,</hi> or <hi>Nisan,</hi> in the evening, or betweene the
two evenings, <hi>Exod. 12. 6. i. e.</hi> betweene the two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the evening-tide, whereof the former belonged to
the end of the declining day the ending, which was the
thirteenth day, (not the fourteenth, as in the late learned
and large <hi>Annotations</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 17) the latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the beginning of the night, when the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is said to begin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5. which was the fourteenth
day, at the beginning and evening whereof the Passeover
was to be eaten, as appears, <hi>verse</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Now how it came to passe, that the Jews kept the wrong
day, and why so, is the question and difficulty remaining.
Some speak of a Jewish Tradition; That after the returne
from the Babylenian captivity, They ordered and altered
the time so, as the day of eating the Passeover might not fall
on the Munday, Wednesday, or Friday; but then they put
it off to the day following. The truth of this Tradition I
am ignorant of: much more, of any reason why they should
dare to have such a Tradition and Order. But finding in the
Gospels, The Accompt for the Beginning of the natural &amp;
large day of twenty four hours altered from the Evening to
the Morning, as was formerly observed; I rather conceive
that both our Saviour, and the Jewes may be said to eat
the Passeover on the same day, <hi>viz.</hi> both on the Friday,
and at the evening too; so it be understood according to
their own several mindes and meanings, reckonings and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countings:
Our Saviour rightly beginning and ending the
day, from evening to evening, and the Jews erroneously,
from morning to morning. The issue so, wil be this; That on
the thirteenth day, consisting of twelve hours, from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to evening, called an artificial day, the Disciples prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Passeover for our Saviour; which is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.
17, 18, 19. And when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ven was come, which was the
true Beginning of the fourteenth day, Jesus sate down with
the twelve to eate the Passeover, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 20. according
to the Law; The Morning after, and so on till the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
making an artificial day, which indeed was the true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the fourteenth natural day, our Saviour was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
condemned, and at last suffered. And that time is
called the Jewes Preparation, <hi>Luke 23. 54. John</hi> 19 31, 42.
the Preparation of their Passeover, <hi>John</hi> 19. 14. the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
before the Sabbath, <hi>Marke</hi> 15. 42. And the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
following, which was the later part of their fourteenth
day in their account, they did eat their Passeover. And the
day following, which was the Sabbath, is called the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Preparation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 62. And whereas, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
that pretended Jewish Tradition, for putting off
the eating of the Paschal Lamb from the Friday, to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,
which was their Sabbath-day, those words of <hi>John</hi> are
alledged, <hi>for that Sabbath was an high day,</hi> John 19. 31. I
answer, That it is called an <hi>high day,</hi> because it was the
Sabbath that fell within the compasse of that high and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Feast. But all this I propound and submit to the
judgement of the learned.</p>
               <p>And again, This Observation of the true Beginning of
the day at the Evening; Together with the Alteration of
it from the Evening to the Morning in the dayes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
may help to quiet that controversie which of late,
hath troubled too many, about the Beginning and Ending
of the Christian Sabbath, or Lords day rather. For, if we
will begin it as the Jewes began their Sabbath, by Gods
own appointment; and as the Beginning of the natural day
of twenty four hours was reckoned from the Creation, Then
sure we must begin it at the Evening. But if we will begin
it, according to that alledged Alteration we finde in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
time, Then we must Begin it in the Morning, which
later is favoured the more by our Saviours Resurrection ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
early in the morning, <hi>Matth. 28. 1, 6. Marke</hi> 16. 2, 6.
<hi>Luke 24. 1, 6. John</hi> 20. 1. To the memory and honour
of whose Resurrection as the day of Rest was changed, so
it accords well, and suitably seems to require the same change
for the beginning of that day; agreeing therin with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Alteration. However, the Point Material is, That it must
comprehend twenty four hours.</p>
               <p>V. 6. <hi>Firmament</hi>] By Firmament here generaly by all
is understood whatsoever is to be seene in that vast space a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the earth, from the surface of it, to the uppermost vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Orbs: As conceiving, and that justly, That the Aire,
or lowest region of it, betwixt the Earth and the Clouds,
were alone too smal a thing for the whole work of the second
day. In the midst of the waters, <hi>and let it divide the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the waters: the waters which are under the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from the waters which are above the firmament;</hi>] Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ancient and learned Fathers have conceived hereupon,
and upon the words of the <hi>Psalme</hi> 148. 4. That a great, or
the greatest part of those waters that covered the face of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>verse</hi> 2. were lifted up and spread as an Orbe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
above, and about the highest part of the starry heavens,
and so there remaine. And from those windowes of heaven
opened some would fetch the greatest part of those waters
in the Deluge, that covered all the high hills that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the whole heaven fifteene cubits upwards. Yet all this
seemes too weak a foundation whereon to build that Orbe
of supercelestial waters. For plaine it is, that the lowest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the aire is called heaven, and the firmament of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
even that wherein the winds, clouds, and fowles do
flie, <hi>verse 20. Jer. 51. 16. Dan.</hi> 7. 2, 13. And indeed as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part of the water is truly called water, so every part of
the heaven, and firmament may be, and is called heaven, as
well as the whole, or the highest parts of it the starry hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the third heaven, <hi>chap 1. verse 14, 15, 16, 17. Gen.</hi>
22. 17. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. And if such a division were meant, as
they pretend to, where then would be the division betweene
the waters of the seas, and the watery clouds; without which
division, and the use of it, the earth could not bring forth
sustenance for Man, or Beast? And as for the windowes of
heaven, they are understood of the region of the aire, as
<hi>Psal. 78. 23. Mal.</hi> 3. 10. And the same God who rained
down fire and brimstone on <hi>Sod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that man should want so needful a nourishment as flesh or
fish for so long a time, so many ages of the world; because
they were not haply so necessary for him in the time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency;
or not expressed by name for food at the time of his
Creation. But after the Fall, being killed for cloathing; and
offered in sacrifices to God, even by <hi>Abel</hi> himself; It is not
to be imagined but that they did eate of the flesh of them,
as in sacrifices was ever usual. And therefore also, for those
ends and uses the distinction of them, into cleane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
was made, even before the flood; And seven of the
Cleane reserved, for sacrifice, and food, whereas two sufficed,
as in the Uncleane, for preservation of Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 2. And

vaunting himself to his wives of his valour, to appease their
feare of him, lest hurt should come to him from others,

what heavy vengeance he would take of him that should set

slain a man, and was wounded himself, and thereupon his
wives afraid of his life, he seeks to appease them, but in a
fierce and insolent manner, as scorning their feare of his
danger, and thinking it a disparagement to him
and his valour, and upon this reason too; That he
had a juster cause for what he had done, then <hi>Cain</hi> had,
and therefore might be the more secure, that if <hi>Cains</hi> death

of the rest of the ten Patriarches in this chapter before
the flood; That they begat sons and daughters, as well
before as after the birth of those Patriarchs, by whom the
line of the Genealogy and Chronology is drawn. For it

And thus there are fifty seven dayes from the first moneth,

continuing from first to last, one yeare and ten dayes. The
Account whereof must no wise be cast, as in the said An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations
on this fourteenth verse: But thus, beginning
on the second moneth, seventeenth day, thence to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
moneth, seventeenth day, are one hundred and fifty
dayes, reckoning in them the fourty dayes of raine, as is
confessed on <hi>ch. 7. ver.</hi> 24, and as according to the truth it
must needs be. And the Ark then rested on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of <hi>Ararat.</hi> Thence to the tenth moneth, first day,
whereon the tops of the mountaines were seen, are seventy
three dayes. Thence fourty dayes, at the end whereof
<hi>Noah</hi> opened the window of the Ark. Thence twenty one
dayes of the sending out of the Raven and the Dove.
Thence twenty nine dayes reacheth to the first moneth,
first day, when the ground was dry. Thence fifty seven
dayes, to the second moneth, twenty seventh day, when
<hi>Noah</hi> came out of the Ark. The total summe of this reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
ariseth to three hundred and seventy. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the yeare, reckoning twelve moneths to the yeare,
and thirty days to the moneth, ariseth to three hundred
and sixty dayes. And the other ten dayes were those ten,
wherein he continued in the Ark more then one year.</p>

were not fit for meat and sustenance, yea, poisonous, yet
might serve for Physick or otherwise, for the maintenance
and preservation of the life of man</p>
               <p>V. 4. <hi>But flesh with the life thereof, the blood</hi>] The
blood of these creatures in called the life of them; and
their life is said to be their blood, and in their blood, <hi>Lev.</hi>
17. 11. 14. because the spirits, which are the most
lively parts of them, are produced of the purest part of the
blood, and with it diffused in arteries throughout the
whole body: without which <hi>vital</hi> spirits, though blood
be in the body, yet the body may be dead, as in things
strangled. Now with the blood, or in the blood, the
flesh was not to be eaten; but first it must be killed and
cleansed of the blood. A restraint, no doubt, to make them
the more fearful of shedding mans blood, as the words
following do declare. But yet thus the sense of the place
seemes not so full, as when the blood is forbidden, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the flesh in the veines, (for who desires so to eat
it) but also poured out by it self alone. And thus the
prohibition was given by <hi>Moses</hi> to the Jewes, who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at large the various manner of the use of blood, in
their several kindes of sacrifices; but inhibits the eating
of it, rather then, or at any other time. In their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
sometimes some of it was sprinkled upon the side of
the Altar, and the rest of the blood wrung out at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the Altar; as when turtle-Doves or Pigeons were
sacrificed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 15. and 5. 9. sometimes it was
sprinkled round about upon the Altar; as in the burnt-offerings,
and peace-offerings, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 5, 11. and, <hi>chap.</hi>
3. 2, 8, 13. sometimes with the finger dipped in it, some
of it was put upon the hornes of the Altar, and the rest
poured out at the bottome of the Altar; as in the sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Ruler, and for any one of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 25, 30, 34. sometimes with the finger dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in it. some of it was to be sprinkled seven times before
the Lord, before the vaile of the Sanctuary. And then
some of it to be put upon the hornes of the Altar of sweet
incense before the Lord, and the rest of the blood to be
poured out at the bottome of the Altar of the burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
as in the sin-offering of the Holy Priest, <hi>Levit</hi> 4.
<hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7. And of the whole Congregation, <hi>ch. 4. v.</hi> 16,
17, 18. Sometimes it was to be put upon the tip of the
right eare, and upon the thumb of the right hand, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the great toe of the right foot; and some of the blood
upon the Altar was to be sprinkled upon the garments, as
<hi>Moses</hi> did at the consecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 8. 23, 24, 30. all which was typical and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.
In summe, it was given upon the Altar, to make
an atonement for soules; for it is the blood that maketh an
atonement for the soule, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 11. and almost all
things are by the Law purged with blood, and without
shedding of blood is no remission, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. But with
them blood was never at any time, or upon any occasion to
be eaten, <hi>Lev. 7. 26, 27. 1 Sam.</hi> 14. 32, 33, 34. And the Apostles
make a decree for the forbearance of eating things stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
and blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 20. yet now the ceremonial
<pb facs="tcp:49194:11"/>

so clear and full, or, not reaching to all people in all ages;
out of the case of scandal, which occasioned the Apostles
necessary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. though temporary decree; I see
no necessity enforcing the contrary, but that Christians
may use their Christian liberty, knowing <hi>that to the pure all

were without any mention of the age of the Patriarchs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from him, when they begat their eldest sonnes,
or those by whom the holy line is drawn, and of whom
our Saviour descended. And if they had been passed over
so, the Chronology of the world had beed lost. But now
here they are resumed, and the chaine of Chronology
carefully continued. And as there were ten Patriarchs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the flood, counting in <hi>Noah,</hi> so there are ten after the
flood, from <hi>Shem</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> inclusively. The yeares of
the world, in the former ten to the six hundredth yeare of
<hi>Noah,</hi> when the flood came, amounted to the number of
1656. The years from the flood, which was in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
eighth yeare of <hi>Shems</hi> age, to the birth of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi>
the tenth Patriarch after the flood, came but to the
number of three hundred fifty two yeares: For mans age
was shortened about the half at the time of the flood. And
again shortened about the half in <hi>Pelegs</hi> time, at the
building of <hi>Babel.</hi> And yet the third time shortened
somewhat near the half in the time of <hi>Nahor,</hi> as may be

<hi>Cainan,</hi> as the sonne of <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> and father of <hi>Salah;
Luke</hi> 3. 35, 36. which would break the chaine of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology,
and leave unknown the age of the world. The
LXX-Translation hath here in <hi>Genesis</hi> put in that <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan.</hi>
And that Translation was much more known, &amp; much
more in use in publick Synagogues, in private Libraries

Hebrew Text was; yea, thereupon the Holy Writers of the
New Testament, in their quotations out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
do follow much the said Translation, even with
some variation from the Hebrew Text, though not in any
material thing, as the learned well know. This may seem
to occasion St. <hi>Luke</hi> in this of <hi>Cainan,</hi> to follow the LXX.
Translation, though he knew that this <hi>Cainan</hi> was never
in the world, condescending so to the times and weakness
<pb facs="tcp:49194:12"/>
of men therein, lest otherwise he might have given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

30, 31. All these are expressely threatened with, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to this punishment. And the meaning of the
phrase is most usually taken to signifie a cutting off by death,
and it is so expressed, <hi>Exod. 31. 14. Lev</hi> 17. 4 20. 2, 3, 4. 5.
And must needs be so understood when it is used against
grievous sins and crimes, as against idolatry, witchcraft,
incest, and sins done presumptuously, despising the Word
of the Lord, and reproaching him. This penalty is to be
inflicted by the Magistrates power no doubt: And in case
of his faile, God himself threatens and undertakes to do
it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 10, 20. 2, 3, 4. 5, 6. 23. 30. And for the lesser
offences mentioned, they being wittingly and wilfully
done in Gods Worship and service, and against his plaine
and peremptory command; I see not how they come short
of sins of presumption, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 30. which are doomed
to death in the judgement of the learned upon that place.
I conceive therefore that they fall short, that by this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
here, will understand no more, but that such an
offender is to be cast off, and held for no Jew, but as an
Heathen man. And they also that would apply this phrase
here, and in other places of the Old Testament, for the
maintenance of Ecclesiastical Excommunication among
the Jewes. The doubtfulnesse of the meaning of the
phrase hath made me the more inquisitive into it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
if not too tedious in it. However I leave all to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
judgements. And for my part like not in things dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be too definitive.</p>

               <p>Ver. 1. <hi>THen again</hi>] Whether in <hi>Sarahs</hi> life-time
cannot certainly be determined. The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
story mentions nothing of <hi>Keturab</hi> or her children,
till now after <hi>Sarahs</hi> death. And the words here seem to
give it to be after her death. And <hi>Sarah</hi> in her life-time
not enduring <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ishmael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> would hardly have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
another. And <hi>Isaac</hi> when offered is called his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
son. And yet on the other side, <hi>Keturab</hi> is called a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine,
implicitely, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and expresly, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 32
And though a Coucubine be called a wife, yet I finde not
that a legitimate wife, as she should be after <hi>Sarahs</hi> death,
or a second wife, is called a Concubine. And the words of
<hi>Abrahams</hi> servant seeking a wife for <hi>Isaac, ch.</hi> 24. 36. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. of this chapter, seem to reflect on <hi>Ketu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs</hi>
sonnes in <hi>Sarahs</hi> life-time. And which is most
of all, if <hi>Abraham</hi> did not take her to wife till after <hi>Sarahs</hi>
death, then he must be one hundred thirty eight, and
likely one hundred and fourty yeares old when he married
her, and after that begat six sonnes of her, whereas the
Apostle saith, that fourty yeares before that time, his body
was dead for begetting of children, <hi>Rom. 4. 19. Gen.</hi> 17.
17. 18. 12. If then it were after <hi>Sarahs</hi> death, it must
be said, that God did renew unto him that masculine
strength, and vigour of body, after fourty yeares, by an
extraordinary blessing, in a marvellous, if not miraculous
manner, and that to make good his Promise of multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, <hi>ch.</hi> 17. 5. in others also, though princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally

Though <hi>Esau</hi> was <hi>Jacobs</hi> brother, yet I loved <hi>Jacob</hi> and
hated <hi>Esau, Mal. 1. v.</hi> 2, 3. whence the Apostle gathereth
the doctrine of Gods free grace, in the election of some,
and reprobation of others, before the doing of good or
evil, <hi>Rom. 9. v.</hi> 10, 11 12, 13. Likely <hi>Isaac</hi> did not rightly
understand this Prediction; but <hi>Rebekah</hi> did, which made
the one seek so much to favour <hi>Esau,</hi> and the other
<hi>Jacob.</hi>

love him, and that he would prove the most able and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
the fittest for great emploiments, and the best and
stoutest stay and support of their family; yet all this was
but carnal, and not so suiting to the divine oracle, on the

in his extremity of fainting, after that mear which his
eye first pitched upon, (there being other meat, no doubt,
in his fathers house) and haply fancied too by him for the
colour sake, if there were not also some cordial in it, as
saffron or other like thing, which gave it that extream red
colour.</p>

                  <hi>called Edom</hi>] Or <hi>Aedom; Adam</hi> signifieth red, red-borne,
<hi>v.</hi> 25. and now so greedily desiring red broth, and
selling for it his birth-right, got him this nick-name, and
brand for it.</p>
               <p>V. 31. <hi>Sell me this day thy birth-right</hi>] The honour of
the first-borne was great. God in honour calls <hi>Israel</hi> his
sonne, his first-borne, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 22. and so <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi>
31. 9. as first chosen by him of all people to be his peculiar
people, <hi>Ex. 19. 4, 5. Deut. 32. 11, 12. Ps.</hi> 89. 27. yea, Christ
is called the first-borne among many brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
29. This birth-right advanced them to be highest in their
Parents affections, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. to be first in honour next
their Parents, <hi>ch.</hi> 49. 3. to be Governours of the family under
them, <hi>ch. 4. 7. 2 Chro.</hi> 21. 3. to the Peiesthood, after the fathers

are written in Heaven, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 23. They being peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consecrated to God in after-times, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 29. These
rights and priviledges, or the most of them, together with
the Oracle, <hi>v.</hi> 23. might move <hi>Jacob</hi> to catch at any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to gain the birth-right: and did move him too to
seek it, in a way not altogether so lawful, as to deny his
brother necessary relief in his extremity, except upon such
hard termes: upon such a pinch to drive him for such a
price to so unjust a bargain.</p>
               <p>V. 32. <hi>At the point to die</hi>] With this present hunger,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w</hi>] There is an Oath, a Vow, and
a devoting of a thing to God: of an Oath, see, <hi>Annot.</hi>
on <hi>ch.</hi> 24. 3. of the devoting any thing, See, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. 28, 29.
A Vow is a binding of the soule with a bond, by a sacred,
and solemne, a free and voluntary Promise made to God,
for the doing or more careful doing of things, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
by our duty and Gods Law we are bound to do,
or for the doing of certain things lawful in themselves, but
otherwise left indifferent to be done, or not to be done;
or for the abstaining from the use of some things, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
lawful to be used. And all this in way of thankfulness
to God for some extraordinary blessings received; or for
the obtaining of some special benefits, which we greatly
desire and stand in need of. And therefore Vowes are ever
joyned with Prayers, or Praises and Thanksgiving, or
both. And these Vowes once made must carefully be kept
and performed. Thus <hi>Jocob</hi> here vowed by way of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to God for this glorious Apparition, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Promises vouchsafed to him, and for further and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
blessings to be received from God, that God should be
his God, this should be a new engagement and obligation
upon him, that he would for ever serve and worship him;
and that that stone or pillar now erected by him, should be
Gods house, a place consecrated to his worship and service,
and that he would give the tenth of all he should have to
God, and for his special use in Sacrifices, Altars, sacred
buildings, and maintenance of his service. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi>
vowed, that if God would deliver her from the reproach of
barrennesse, and give her a man-child, she would give him to
the Lord all the dayes of his life, and no razour should
come upon his head, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 1. 11. Thus <hi>Bathsheba</hi> it seems
made a Vow for the obtaining of <hi>Solomon,</hi> whence she cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him the sonne of her Vowes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 2. Thus <hi>Jeph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thah</hi>
made a Vow to obtain victory against the children of
<hi>Ammon, Judg</hi> 11. 30, 39. And all <hi>Israel,</hi> to obtain victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
against King <hi>Arad</hi> the Canaanite and his people, <hi>Numb.</hi>
21. 1, 2. Thus <hi>David</hi> vowed unto the mighty God of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
forthwith to finde out a place for the habitation of the
Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 132. 2, 3. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> was under a Vow, <hi>Acts</hi>
18. 18. And again he and foure other men, <hi>Act.</hi> 21, 23, 24.
Yea, the Heathen Mariners, by the light of nature made vows
to the Lord, vowes of thankfulnesse for their deliverance
from shipwrack, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 16. In <hi>Moses</hi> time, the vow of
a Nazarite and Lawes for them are set down at large,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 6. as also the things to be vowed to the Lord, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
beasts, clean and unclean, houses, fields of inheritance,
and of purchase, whether vowed before the year of Jubile,
or after, and the several Lawes for the Redemption of
them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27. And in that Mosaical and Ceremonial
Law, God carefully provides that no unworthy thing shall
be vowed to him, no beast deformed, or that hath any
member superfluous, or lacking, or any way faulty, <hi>Lev.</hi>
22. 18, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. Much lesse the hire of a
whore, or price of a dog, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 18. any sinful thing
as those wicked men of <hi>Judah</hi> did, in their idolatrous ways,
both they and their wives which fled into the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
contrary to the Word of the Lord by <hi>Jeremie</hi> say, We will
<pb facs="tcp:49194:26"/>
surely perform our vowes which we have vowed, to burne
incense to the Queen of heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings
unto her, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 25. And least of all would he
have any sinful vow made unto him. Now to forbear to
vow is no sin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 22. at least, no such sin as if they
vow and pay not, as, <hi>John</hi> 9. 41. If ye were blinde, ye
should have no sin, no such sin as now remaineth on you,
for refusing the light. And the like, <hi>John</hi> 15. 22, 24. For
howsoever in the general, a vow is a kinde of a free-will-offering,
a service of God, <hi>Esay</hi> 19. 21. but an arbitrary
and voluntary service. Before men vow it is in their own
power and pleasure, as it is spoken in <hi>Ananias</hi> his case, <hi>Acts</hi>
5. 4. yet in some extraordinary cases of petition and
thanksgiving, vowes are requisite and necessary. And
however; yet being once made lawfully, after vowes to make
enquiry, undoubtedly it is sin. But after vowes to make
enquiry is a snare and sin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 25. For who vowes,
bindes his soule with a bond, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. 3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when a lawful vow is lawfully made, then God strictly
requires the same to be punctually performed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.
21, 23. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 6. And for that cause he gives Laws,
who have power to vow, and who may not vow, namely,
children and wives, who are not free of themselves, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power and command of others, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. <hi>David</hi>
therefore is mindful of his performance, <hi>Thy vowes are
upon me, O God, Psal</hi> 56. 12. and 66. 13, 14. And he
mindes others of it, <hi>Vow and pay unto the Lord your God,</hi>
Psal. 76. 11. And again, <hi>To thee shall the vow be paid,</hi> Ps.
65. 1, 2. And he saith unto God, <hi>Thou, O God, hast heard
my vowes. And so will I sing praise unto thy Name for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that I may daily performe my vowes,</hi> Ps 61. 5, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God will be with me</hi>] Prayer-wise, respecting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,

yet by his general words and ambiguous speech may be
suspected, not to intend faire and ingenuous dealing with
<hi>Jacob,</hi> as soon after appeared, <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>V. 20. <hi>Served seven yeares for Rachel</hi>] There are two
several opinions, and there can be no more, which must
guide and rule the Exposition of these words, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also which are in the ensuing passages of this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
One is, that <hi>Jacob</hi> married first at the end of his first
seven years service. And then having <hi>Leah</hi> fraudulently
put upon him in stead of <hi>Rachel.</hi> That he newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
the second time to have <hi>Rachel</hi> for other seven years
service; but marries her a week after he had taken <hi>Leah;</hi>
and performes that seven yeares service, for <hi>Rachel</hi> after he
had married her. And most Expositors are of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But I conceive there are two strong arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. One is, that they are thereby forced to hold,
that <hi>Jacobs</hi> twelve children were all borne within those
seven yeares, <hi>viz. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan,
Naphtali, Gad, Ashur, Issachar, Zebulun, Dinah, Joseph,
v.</hi> 25. <hi>ch.</hi> 31. 38, 41. You may say, this may well enough,
be by foure women, I confesse it; but considering the
plaine and pregnant passages of the sacred history, in the
times and manner of their births, I hold it impossible.
For it is plaine, that none of them at any time had twins.
Again, <hi>Leah</hi> had <hi>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,</hi> at several
births, which will take up three or foure of the seven
yeares, before <hi>Rachel</hi> complaines of barrennesse. Or put
case she complained sooner then the history mentions,
yet <hi>Bilhah</hi> must have <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Naphtali</hi> at several births,
before <hi>Zilpah</hi> had <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Ashvr</hi> at several births; and
these last foure sonnes will take up three or foure yeares;
<pb facs="tcp:49194:27"/>
and after all this, <hi>Leah</hi> having formerly left bearing when
<hi>Judah</hi> was borne, <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>ch</hi> 30. 9. And when <hi>Reuben</hi> her
eldest sonne was of age to finde mandrakes in the field;
then after her time of barrennesse, and after her maid <hi>Zil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahs</hi>
births, she then again conceiving beares <hi>Issachar,</hi> and
<hi>Zebulun,</hi> and <hi>Dinah</hi> at several births. And last of all <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi>
beares <hi>Joseth,</hi> all which must be done within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of one seven years according to that opinion. Which,
how it may stand with truth, and without offering vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
to the course of the history, and to many words of
the text, I confesse I cannot comprehend. And a second
argument against that opinion, is taken from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Judahs</hi> age, and the birth of <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul</hi> his
Grandchildren, when they with <hi>Jacob</hi> and all his posterity
went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> ch. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.] To, open this we must first
knew, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was seventy five yeares old when he came
down to <hi>Laban,</hi> which appeares thus; he was one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty years old when he stood before <hi>Pharaoh,
ch</hi> 47. 9. and then <hi>Joseph</hi> was fourty years old, <hi>viz.</hi> thirty
when he was taken out of pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on and advanced by <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh,
ch.</hi> 41. 46. After which passed seven years of plenty,
and three of famine when <hi>Jacob</hi> came down, <hi>Joseph</hi> then
being fourty yeares old; it appeares also that he was borne
in the fourteenth yeare after <hi>Jacobs</hi> coming to <hi>Laban, ch</hi>
30. 25. 31. 38, 41. Take then those fourteen yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Joseph</hi> was borne, and the fourty yeares of <hi>Josephs</hi> age,
when his father stood before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> out of his fathers age
at that time, he being then one hundred and thirty; and
it will so be clear, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was seventy five or seventy six
yeares old, when he first came to <hi>Laban.</hi> Now this being
so, <hi>Judah</hi> the fourth sonne of <hi>Jacob</hi> by <hi>Leah,</hi> must needs be
by their opinion but three or foure yeares elder then <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,
Jacob</hi> not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Leah,</hi> as they say, till after his
first seven yeares of service were ended. And so <hi>Judah</hi> must
be but fourty three or fourty foure yeares old at most,
when he and his Grandchildren <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul</hi> came
with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> To compasse this, they must cast
their reckonings thus, that <hi>Judah</hi> married at twelve yeares
old, and had <hi>Er</hi> at thirteen; that <hi>Er</hi> married at twelve
yeares old, and <hi>Onan</hi> his younger brother, <hi>ch.</hi> 38. 4. marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at twelve yeares old, that <hi>Tamar</hi> remained a widow, and
waited till <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lah</hi> was grown; and the dayes being multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<hi>Judahs</hi> wife died, and <hi>Tamar</hi> beares to <hi>Judah Pharez;</hi>
and all this within the compasse of three years. That <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>
married at twelve yeares old and begat <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul;</hi>
and supposing them to be twirs, that at a yeare old
they were carried into <hi>Egypt.</hi> For thus the reckoning
will rise to the fourty third or fourty fourth yeare of <hi>Judahs</hi>
age. But these supposed reckonings seem so harsh in that
age of the world, to the most learned favourers of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that they choose to ease or avoid this, to say ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul</hi> were not carried down into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> but were borne afterwards in <hi>Egypt,</hi> so the learned
late <hi>Annot.</hi> on <hi>ch.</hi> 46. 12. But this were to offer such plain
violence to that text; and to the drift of that whole chapter,
and giving way for others borne after in <hi>Egypt</hi> to be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in as well as they, for why not others as well as
they? and so the whole number to be altered, and the
intent of the Holy Ghost disappointed; that I think upon
due consideration had, not many will comply with that
conceit. And the same <hi>Annotators</hi> disclaim it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in their <hi>Annotations</hi> on <hi>ch.</hi> 38. 1. The other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
whereunto my resolution bends, is this; that <hi>Jacob</hi>
being seventy five yeares old, married both sisters at the
beginning of the fourteen yeares service, fulfilling a week
in keeping the feast at the marriage of the one, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
presently after at the marriage of the other. And
the enjoying not the want and hopeful expectation of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi>
made his seven years service for her seem unto him to
be bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a few dayes. This addition of seven yeares to the
former opinion gives faire way to the birth of all the
twelve children, in that order and sequence of time, as the
letter of the words, and context of the story do require, and
gives further scope, (which yet is little enough) for the
time of the birth of <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul,</hi> in the fiftieth year
of <hi>Judahs</hi> age, (as this opinion makes it) when he and they
went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> The only difficulty
here occuring is, the exposition of some words and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
seeming to favour the first opinion, which yet may
better receive a commodious interpretation, then involve
and intangle us in greater perplexities, and draw upon us
the fore-mentioned incongruities, if not impossibilities.
The text then here saith, <hi>That Jacob served seven yeares for
Rahel</hi>] that is, after he had married her. And so all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors
agree, that indeed he did so, though most of them
infer it upon their construction of the 27. and 28.
verses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>but a few dayes</hi>] If he had not enjoyed her by marriage
all those seven yeares of his service, they would have seemed

               <p>Verse 1. <hi>AT that time</hi>] Or in that time not of <hi>Josephs</hi>
selling into <hi>Egypt.</hi> For between that time
and <hi>Judahs</hi> going into <hi>Egypt</hi> with his father <hi>Jacob,</hi> were
but twenty two or twenty three yeares. <hi>Joseph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sold at seventeen yeares old; and all coming down
when he was fourty yeares old. And within the compasse
of those twenty two or twenty three years, <hi>Judabs</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with the daughter of <hi>Shuah,</hi> and the begetting of
<hi>Pharez</hi> upon <hi>Tamar</hi> his daughter-in-law, and <hi>Pharez</hi> his
begetting of <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul</hi> could not possibly be done.
<hi>Judah</hi>'s marriage then must needs precede the story of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
sale; and <hi>Er</hi> his eldest sonne must needs be about
ten yeares old at that time. Therest, and so the most of
the story in this chapter, fell out after the selling of <hi>Joseph</hi>
into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

though some reject not that opinion; but before <hi>Dinahs</hi>
ravishing, yea, speedily upon his first coming into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
They that make <hi>Judah</hi> to be born in the beginning of the
14th year of the latter seven of <hi>Jacobs</hi> service, &amp; so but three
or four years older then <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and but fourty three or fourty
foure when he came with his father into <hi>Egypt,</hi> they find
him by that account to be but ten yeares old when he
first came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and thereupon defer his marriage
till two or three yeares after, and so straiten the times for
the births of his off-spring before they all went into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
which howsoever the great <hi>Annotations</hi> miscast it upon
this place, must needs run thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Judah</hi> at twelve
or thirteen married the daughter of <hi>Shuah,</hi> two or three
yeares after his coming into <hi>Canaan;</hi> and in three yeares
after had <hi>Er, Onan</hi> and <hi>Shelah.</hi> That <hi>Er</hi> at twelve marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Tamar,</hi> that foure yeares were spent in the matters of
<hi>Onan</hi> and <hi>Shelah,</hi> and <hi>Judahs</hi> begetting <hi>Pharez,</hi> and
<hi>Zerah</hi> of <hi>Tamar,</hi> to the time of the birth of <hi>Pharez:</hi> that
<hi>Pharez</hi> at twelve married, and in two yeares had <hi>Ezrom</hi>
and <hi>Hamul.</hi> All which do make up but thirty three or thirty
four years, which is the ful time between the first coming of
them all into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and their going down into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
as clearly appears by the several periods of <hi>Josephs</hi> age; he
being six or seven yeares old when they all left <hi>Laban,</hi> and
fourty when they all came down unto him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> But
the other opinion which makes <hi>Judah</hi> to be borne in the
fourth yeare of the first seven of <hi>Jacobs</hi> service, and so to be
ten yeares older then <hi>Joseph,</hi> and fifty yeares old when he
with his father came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> doth give fairer way to
the course and times of the story thus, <hi>viz. Judah</hi> at six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
yeares old, comes into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and speedily marries
the daughter of <hi>Shuah.</hi> In the next yeare hath <hi>Er. Er</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

in the matters of <hi>Onan,</hi> of <hi>Shelah,</hi> and till the birth of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi>
begotten by <hi>Judah</hi> after the death of his wife, upon

those that belonged to his family, as <hi>Tamar</hi> did though

of his desire against her, if his meaning were, but
to have her carried before the Magistrate, and be so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
by burning, according to the Law of the countrey.
However, he was desirous to be rid of her, for his sonne
<hi>Shelahs</hi> sake: and bewrayes his own partiality in his owne
sinne, and inhumane cruelty in thus judging her to fire,
and the fruit in her wombe yet unborne, and that before
he heard what she could say for her self, never minding
how unjustly he had dealt with her, in not giving her
to <hi>Shelah</hi> to wise. Thus, 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 5, 7. Rom.</hi> 2. 1.</p>

their inheritance intermingled with that of <hi>Judah,</hi> out

so much for <hi>Simeons</hi> sake, as because <hi>Judah</hi> had too much.
So <hi>Simeon</hi> was but an Inmate to <hi>Judah,</hi> and under him.

most buried without embalming; some embalmed with
Aromatick spices put into their bodies, some only had
spices upon them and about them; some had sweet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
burnt at their burials, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 14. 21. 19.
<hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 5. some had their dead bodies themselves burnt,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 12. sundry other manners amongst Heathen.
Want of burial is a calamity bewailed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 79. 3. and

               <p>V. 13. <hi>And buried him in the cave which] Acts</hi> 7.
15, 16. saith <hi>Stephen,</hi> to <hi>Jacob</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and died, he and our fathers, and were carried over into
<hi>Sichem,</hi> and laid in the Sepulchre that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought
for a summe of money of the sons of <hi>Emor,</hi> the father of
<hi>Sichem.</hi> The case is clear, that the two places which
<hi>Abraham</hi> bought, <hi>ch.</hi> 23. and which <hi>Jacob</hi> bought, <hi>ch.</hi>
33. are not one and the same but divers; as appears by
the place or situation, by the name, use, price and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
buyers and sellers. And yet these two purchases
seem to be confounded in the speech of <hi>Stephen.</hi> Again,
<hi>Stephen</hi> might have a failer in memory, in his long and
sudden speech, as not being then infallibly guided as an
Inditer of Scripture, though full of the Holy Ghost,
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 5. 7. 55. For so it is said of the other Deacons,
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3. of <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 4. 8. of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9. 17. yet
<hi>Peter</hi> erred, <hi>Acts 10. 14. Gal. 2. 11, &amp;c.</hi> and all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
erred in the point of Christs Resurrection, and
of his Kingdome, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 6. and of the calling of the
Gentiles. And St. <hi>Luke</hi> might do right in recording it
as it came from <hi>Stephen.</hi> As the like is in <hi>ch.</hi> 27. 19, 24.
and, 1 <hi>Kings 13. 18. Josephs</hi> bones were buried in <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi>
the place his father bequeathed to him and his on
his death-bed, and likely the rest of his brethren, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to his example, would be buried there, have
their bones likewise carried thither; and this, though not
mentioned in Scripture, might by other Records or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
be made known to <hi>Stephen,</hi> as the names of
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>annes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> to <hi>Paul, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 8. the Prophecie of
<hi>Enoch</hi> to <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 14. the Genealogy to <hi>Luke, ch. 3. v.</hi> 23,
to 31. <hi>Jacob</hi> himself was certainly buried in <hi>Machpelah,</hi>
as is here recorded: and though he be joyned together
with his sonnes in a state of mortality, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 15.
yet the sixteenth verse of their burial may well be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to his sonnes as the next Antecedent without taking
him into the number. And that <hi>Jacob</hi> bought the field
of the sonnes of <hi>Emor</hi> or <hi>Hamor, Shechems</hi> father, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
certain. By <hi>Abraham</hi> then, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 16. we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<hi>Abrahams</hi> Grand-Child <hi>Jacob;</hi> And so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it, which is a very harsh Exposition, the whole
text considered, and could not be so apprehended by the
multitude of his hearers. Or rather we may say, that
<hi>Stephen</hi> mistook the story, and named <hi>Abraham</hi> in stead
of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which may be done without any great offence,
as hath been shewed, and so <hi>Luke</hi> relates what rightly he
should; for to lay an errour upon the sacred text, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jacob</hi> should be put in the text in stead of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and that <hi>Abraham</hi> came into it by the errour of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers,
mistaking the one name for the other, or whereas
neither was in the Original, and <hi>Abraham</hi> errour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put in the margin, that from the margin they put
it into the text, all this is not so likely, nor any way so
safe. That <hi>Emor</hi> or <hi>Hamor</hi> was father to <hi>Sichem,</hi> not
sonne to <hi>Sichem,</hi> appears, <hi>Josh. 24. 32. Gen.</hi> 33. 19.
and therefore it is so to be supplied in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 16. so is the
word mother supplied, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 10. out of <hi>Mar</hi> 15. 40.
That <hi>Zohar, Gen.</hi> 23. 8. was not otherwise called <hi>Hamor,</hi>
not had a sonne called <hi>Sechem,</hi> but called <hi>Ephron,</hi> the
Scripture-Story declares. And <hi>Sechem</hi> of <hi>Hamors</hi> sonnes
is only mentioned, because he was more honourable then
all the house of his father, and so it is most probable,
that in the sale of the ground to <hi>Jacob</hi> he had most to do,
and the rest consented to his transaction. They that
would make a reconciliation, by saying that the two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and sepulchres, that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought, and that which
<hi>Jacob</hi> bought were near one another, presuppose what is
not sound, for <hi>Hebron</hi> and <hi>Machpelah</hi> were in the tribe of
<hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Sechem</hi> or <hi>Sychar</hi> a city of <hi>Samaria</hi> in the
<pb facs="tcp:49194:39"/>
tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> above twenty miles distant. And if
granted, yet helps nothing to answer the other difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>of the field</hi>] Places for burials have been very various.
Fields as here. <hi>Moses</hi> in a valley, <hi>Deut. 34. 6. Uzziah</hi>
in the field of the burial which belonged to the Kings;
in the same field; but apart from the corpses of the
Kings, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 23. The Potters field was bought to
bury strangers in, <hi>Mat. 27. 7. Manasseh</hi> was buried in
the garden of his own house, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 18. Our
blessed Saviour in a garden, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 41. Among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
after they had peace from persecutions, and
Churches for devine service, they soone buried in the
Church yards, and afterwards came to bury in the
Churches themselves, which grew in time into a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
among many, and to be an annoyance to the
living through the commonnesse of it.</p>
               <p>V. 15. <hi>And will certainly require us</hi>] The unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse

               <p>
                  <hi>wept</hi>] As pitying their perplexity, and grieving at
their doubt of his good will.</p>
               <p>V. 18. <hi>Fall down before his face</hi>] Wittingly confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>V. 20. <hi>But God] Joseph</hi>] ascribes nothing to himself,

               <p>

one hundred thirty seven yeares, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 6. and so
out-lived <hi>Joseph</hi> some sixteen yeares. Therefore the oath
was taken of the children of <hi>Israel:</hi> and it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed

time the deliverance should be brought to passe, should
perform this oath.</p>

to the contentment of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and to the

and bones among them; and so to have them
there the more preserved for their good. And <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
bones were carried thence. And not kept as
reliques to be worshipped. but were buried at <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,
Josh. 24. 32. Jacobs</hi> purchase, and <hi>Josephs</hi> sonnes
heritage. And this, to testifie his owne, and confirme
his brethrens faith, in the belief of the Promises of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
and that as a type or pledge of the heavenly <hi>Cannan.</hi>
There were the other Patriarchs <hi>Jacobs</hi> sonnes and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi>
brethren also buried, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 16. Their bones
likely being carried with his bones.</p>
               <p>V. 26. <hi>An hundred and ten yeares old</hi>] Eighty yeares
after his advancement. At that age also died <hi>Joshua,</hi>
who was of his race, <hi>Josh. 24. 29. Joseph</hi> died in the two
thousand three hundred sixty nineth yeare of the world;
sixty yeares before the birth of <hi>Moses,</hi> and one hundred
and fourty yeares before the Israelites coming out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>

to be 400 years in <hi>Egypt;</hi> But rather is thus rightly understood; That
<hi>Abrahams Seed,</hi> that is, <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> should be strangers <hi>in a
Land that was not theirs;</hi> that is, in <hi>Canaan</hi> 190; years from the birth
of <hi>Isaac,</hi> to <hi>Jacobs</hi> going down into <hi>Egypt, XXV.</hi> 26. and <hi>XLVII.</hi> 9.
And <hi>Jacobs</hi> posterity were strangers in <hi>Egypt,</hi> from his going down
thither, till their bringing forth by <hi>Moses,</hi> 210 years; not 400 years
there: <hi>Moses</hi> himself being the sonne of <hi>Jochebed,</hi> the daughter of
<hi>Levi, Num. XXVI.</hi> 59. and grandchilde of <hi>Kohath;</hi> And <hi>Levi,</hi> and

promise mentioned. And the Samaritan Bible or Text here; and
the <hi>LXX.</hi> in <hi>Exod. XII.</hi> 40. do thus declare this point; though their

The particular assignations of their several Capacities are usually
made thus, <hi>viz:</hi> The <hi>Log</hi> to containe the quantity of six hen-eggs-shels
of <hi>Palestine,</hi> the same with <hi>Sextarium Romanum,</hi> and is about
our half pinte (yet some make it a pinte.) The <hi>Cab</hi> to contain four <hi>Logs,
i. e.</hi> a quart of our measure, or 24 egs-shels; (yet some say a pottle) The
<hi>Hin</hi> to containe six <hi>Logs, i. e.</hi> 36. egs-shels (some say 12 <hi>Logs,</hi> or 72.
egs-shels) or about three quarts. An Omer to containe one <hi>Cab</hi> and
an half, and a fifth part, about our three pintes and an half, or a pottle,
the tenth part of an Ephah. <hi>Seah</hi> to containe two <hi>Hins,</hi> or six <hi>Cabs,
i. e.</hi> a gallon and an half, or <hi>Modius Romanus,</hi> the third part of an
Ephah. Ephah to containe ten Omers or Pottles, <hi>i. e.</hi> four gallons
and an half; or about three Seahs; and to be <hi>Medimnus Atticus,</hi> (yet
some make it to containe eight gallons; and so four Ephahs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
our barrel; some to containe near ten gallons: or about the
measure of our bushel, or half a bushel and a pottle.) Bate or Bath
is of the same measure for liquid things, as Ephah is for dry things.
Lethec to containe five Ephahs, or fifteen Seahs, or <hi>Sata,</hi> or <hi>Modii,</hi>
that is, two bushels, six gallons, and one pottle; or half a Chomer.
Chomer, and Cor are both of the same measure, either equal; and
contains certainly, as was said, ten Bates or Ephahs apiece, or two
Lethecs. <hi>Cor</hi> is oft translated Measures. And thus uncertaine are
we for the grounds of these measures of Capacities.</p>

to imagine otherwise, that <hi>Hezron</hi> and <hi>Hamul</hi> were borne in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and did go down thither with <hi>Jacob</hi> onely <hi>virtually</hi> in the loines of
their father <hi>Pharez,</hi> it doth not onely contradict the Text, as was
said; but also doth overthrow the whole intent and drift of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
Catalogue, and Genealogy in that chapter; which is to shew
the small number that went down personally with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,
Deut. XXVI.</hi> 5. That thereby wonderful multiplication of their

<hi>Num.</hi> I. 45, 46. by Gods blessing might the more gloriously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
And if some; or any of those mentioned in the said Catalogue,
went down onely virtually in the loines of their parents; in that

This truth appears thus; From the death of <hi>Joseph,</hi>
to the birth of <hi>Moses</hi> were 60. years, and either 56.
or 65. or 72. or 80. And this assertion of 60. years is
thus gathered. The Israelites being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> from
the going down of <hi>Jacob</hi> thither, till <hi>Moses</hi> brought them out thence,
210 years; as hath been shewed on <hi>Gen.</hi> XV. 13. And <hi>Joseph</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
40 years old when his father <hi>Jacob</hi> came down; as being 30 when

came down. And <hi>Joseph</hi> living 110 years, <hi>Gen.</hi> L. 22. So
leaves 70 of his life to be spent in <hi>Egypt,</hi> after <hi>Jacobs</hi> coming down

70. and the said interval of 60, and <hi>Moses</hi> his 80. make up the
said summe of 210 years. Now to those 60 years before the Birth
of <hi>Moses,</hi> adde those 80 years of his age, <hi>Exod.</hi> VII. 7. And the time

in the next year, first moneth, first day, <hi>Exod.</hi> XL. 1. And so
the summe of 141 years, and few dayes doth arise; which containes
the whole History of <hi>Exodus.</hi> Whereof 140 years, within few dayes,

XXIII. 5. And so kept by our Saviour at <hi>Even, Matth.</hi> XXVI. 20.
Now the better to know the <hi>Even,</hi> and two <hi>Evenings,</hi> we must first
know, That the Artificial Day is divided, from Sunne-rising to Sun-setting,
into twelve hours, <hi>John</hi> XI. 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> XX. 6, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> II.
15. which hours are sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, as the
course of the Sunne measures them. And again, that day
seemes to have a division into three equal parts, allotting four
hours to each part. Or into four equal parts, allotting three hours
to each part. And so the first part is from their Sunne-rising, to our
ninth hour: the second from our ninth to our twelfth, or Noone, and
Mid-day: the third from that, to our three in the after-noone: the
fourth from that, to Sun-setting. And sometimes there is taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the first of these, the time from Day-light to Sun-rising: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the last of these, the time from Sun-setting to night and darknesse,
as <hi>Matth.</hi> XVI. 2. and XXVII. 57. <hi>John</hi> XX. 19. And both these
comprise the whole dayes Fasting, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> I. 12. Now the <hi>Even</hi> in
Scripture is most properly, and usually expressed, and defined strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Going down, or Setting of the Sunne. So in the purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Unclean, <hi>Levit.</hi> XXII. 6, 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> XXIII. 11. And so
in that case of the King of <hi>Ai, Iosh.</hi> VIII. 29. And of <hi>Ahab, 2 Chron.
XVIII.</hi> 34. And of those five Kings in the Cave of <hi>Makkedah, Iosh.</hi>
X. 26, 27. And so in <hi>Mark</hi> I. 32. And so it is expressely for the
Passeover it self, <hi>Deut.</hi> XVI. 6. To which acceptation of the <hi>Even</hi>
agrees that, <hi>Psal.</hi> CIV. 23. <hi>Mark XI. 11, 19. Luke XXIV. 29. Acts
IV.</hi> 3. and <hi>XXVIII.</hi> 23. Yet in Scripture the Evening is sometimes
taken in a larger extent and latitude, for the latter part of the Day,
beginning from the declining of the Sunne at Mid-day; or from the
abating of the heat and force of it, at our three in the after-noone:
As may be clearly gathered from <hi>Mat. XIV. v.</hi> 15,—23. <hi>Mark VI.</hi>
35, 47. <hi>Luke IX.</hi> 12. And as it is usual taken with us in our ordinary sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations.
Now at, or between the two Evenings, is mentioned, as
for the yearly Passeover; so for the daily Evening Sacrifice, <hi>Exod.
XXIX. 39. Num. XXVIII.</hi> 4. And for the daily burning of <hi>Incense</hi>
on the <hi>Incense</hi>-Altar: And for the daily dressing and lighting of the
<hi>Lamps</hi> in the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXX. 8. So that in these four
cases the meaning of the phrase seemes to be the same; Noting out
one certain time; and these two Evenings in the larger, or stricter sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
to be contiguous, or continued rather; to be that <hi>Communis
terminus,</hi> which couples the end of the day, and the beginning of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49194:46"/>
night together; or the two extremities of our Evening-tide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the former belongs to the end and shutting up of the natural day
preceding, and the later to the beginning of the night, which leades
on, and ushers in the natural or civil day following, as the first part
of it. So that this time is a participle of both, or a Borderer betwixt
both, as the large Annotations fitly expresse it.</p>

Gerah, 1 d. ob. and the Bekah 1 s. 3 d. The Talent is 3000 Shekels;
which appears thus in the Text; The 603550 men are taxed at a
Bekah a piece. This makes 301775 Shekels. Now reckoning
3000 Shekels to a Talent; The 301775 Shekels make up 100 Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,

weight with that of silver; but of farre greater value; of ten to one
with the Jewes, as may be gathered out of 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXII. 14. And
so their Shekel of gold comes to 1 l. 5 s. their Talent of Gold comes

<hi>receiving the Spies, and</hi> Davids <hi>Birth must be</hi> 366. which may, and
must be made up in some such reckoning as this; <hi>viz.</hi> Supposing <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
to be eighteen years old when she received the Spies; and sixty six
when she did bear <hi>Boaz</hi> to <hi>Salmon;</hi> then of necessity must <hi>Boaz</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<hi>Obed,</hi> and <hi>Obed</hi> beget <hi>Iesse,</hi> and <hi>Iesse</hi> beget <hi>David, each about the
age of</hi> 106. Which well considered, evidenceth and <hi>evinceth these two
things.</hi> 1. That the years of the six Oppressors in the times of the
Judges, <hi>Ch. III.</hi> 8, 14. and <hi>IV.</hi> 3. and <hi>VI.</hi> 1. and <hi>X.</hi> 8. and <hi>XIII.</hi> 1.
which amount to 111. years, <hi>cannot be reckoned distinct and apart;</hi>
But are to be <hi>included</hi> within the years of the Judges, and of the Rest
of the Land. For otherwise the years between <hi>Rahabs</hi> receiving the
two Spies, and <hi>Davids</hi> birth, would rise to 477. <hi>which cannot be true.</hi>
And secondly, that the <hi>years</hi> 480. which is that famous Link of time,
1 <hi>King. VI. 1. cannot possibly be forced</hi> to any more then 480. much

approbation and encouragement, <hi>Ch.</hi> X. 7, 8. And this seemes law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because they sued for Peace before they were besieged; and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
submitted to all Conditions, without any reservation of their
Lands, Goods, Lawes, Liberties, much lesse of their superstitions and
idolatries, (which otherwise might have ensnared the Israelites); but
of their Lives onely, and they to be employed in the Israelites ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

might be received upon farre easier termes and conditions. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all these Conditions, others of these Nations themselves might
have been spared their lives. Yet God in his providence so ordered,
That there was not a City that made peace with the Israelities, saving
these Hittites of <hi>Gibeon</hi> onely, and their Cities: All other they took
in battel; for it was of the Lord so to harden their hearts, that
they might be destroyed, <hi>Ch. XI.</hi> 19, 20. And therefore, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
here murmured unjustly (haply through ignorance) against

justly punished, and that grievously, in his posterity; and the Land
also with famine, many ages after this, because he sought to slay and
destroy them from remaining in any of the coasts of <hi>Israel,</hi> contrary

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>XIX</label> The word for Concubine

                  </gap>, some old Latine Inscriptions, <hi>Viro-conjux,</hi> an half-wife,
or secondarie wife. We read in Scripture of Concubines, and Wives,
variously: Of many wives to one man, in the Old Testament. And
this, not onely in prophane and evill men, as in <hi>Lamech, Gen.</hi> IV. and
<hi>Esau,</hi> and other; but also in good and godly men, as in <hi>Iacob, David,</hi>
and others. And among these many wives, we sometimes finde a kinde
of distinction of them into two sorts; One sort, the First, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,
and absolutely lawful wife, and Mistris; The other sort, but in a
secondary and inferiour degree. And such as had no Dowries; nor
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49194:78"/>
solemne Rites of reception; nor Rule in the family; nor their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
had any Inheritance, but Gifts and Portions, For that of <hi>Iacobs</hi>
sons by <hi>Bilhah,</hi> and <hi>Zilpah,</hi> was a case extraordinary. And thus we
finde with <hi>Abraham, Sarah</hi> of the first sort; and <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Keturah</hi>
of the second: with <hi>Iacob, Rachel,</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> of the first; <hi>Bilhah,</hi> and
<hi>Zilpah</hi> of the second. And those of the second sort, are sometimes
called wives, and sometimes Concubines; as we see in <hi>Keturah, Gen.</hi>

consult him at first onely about the precedencie in the warre, and who
shall have the honour of the day. And upon their first overthrow,
they weep; but more for their shame, and smart, then for their sin; And
they aske counsel of God, whether they shall fight again; but neither
crave his assistance, nor inquire of the successe, being still so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in themselves of their own strength, and still putting their trust
in the arme of flesh and blood. But upon the <hi>second</hi> overthrow,
they seek God in a right manner; they more seriously mourn, and
Fast, and repent of their sins; Offering Burnt-offerings for the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of them; and Peace offerings, to make their peace with God,
and testifie their Faith in him: And gaining a Promise of successe, yet
they carefully use the means, and stratagems, which formerly they
sleighted, and presumptuously neglected. And by this stratagem
they seeme to divide their army into three parts; some to lie in wait;
some to fight, and seemingly flee: And the body of their Army, as
a strong reserve to fall on and gaine the victory, upon an appointed
signe, when the Benjamites were brought to an amazed stand, and

well might the number be more at that beginning of his reigne, then
at the end of it; some of them dying in the meane time. And of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
some might have two different names. The chief of all the
Worthies slayes three hundred himself, aud likely in the pursuit, at

eight hundred. Of him see more, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXVII. 2, 3. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

there were besides, that were Priests and Levites. And divers of

of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> whereof two at least in his fathers life-time; and <hi>Ahaziah</hi>
but a piece of a year; in all thirty one.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Ahaziah</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> beginning to reigne in the seventeenth of
<hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> shewes that <hi>Ahab</hi> had made him Viceroy the year before
his death; for <hi>Ahab</hi> died in the eighteenth of <hi>Iehoshaphat:</hi> And so this
<hi>Ahaziah</hi> reigned but one year himself alone.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Iehoram</hi> the other son of <hi>Ahab</hi> beginning to reigne in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

had made his son <hi>Iehoram</hi> his Viceroy, the same year that <hi>Ahab</hi>
had done the like; <hi>viz.</hi> the year before their going to battel to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth-Gilead;</hi>
which battell was in the last of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and eighteenth of
<hi>Iehoshaphat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Iehoram</hi> the son of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> beginning to reigne in the fifth
year of <hi>Iehoram</hi> of <hi>Ahab;</hi> and that being in the time of <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi>
own reigning, and <hi>Iehoram</hi> reigning from that time eight years;
shewes that <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> made his son, of Voiceroy, King joynt with
himself, in the twenty third year of his reigne, two years before
his death. And so this <hi>Iehoram</hi> reigned as King two years in his
father <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi> life-time, and six years after his death: Not four
years in his life-time, and four years after his death, as is usualy
averred.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Ahaziah</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> upon the premises, begins to reigne, upon
the twelfth year beginning, or eleventh year ending, of <hi>Iehoram</hi> of
<hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Iehoram</hi> the father of this <hi>Ahaziah</hi> beginning to reigne in the
thirty two year of his age, and reigning eight years, and dying at four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
2 <hi>Kings VIII.</hi> 17, 24; This <hi>Ahaziah</hi> cannot possibly be fourty
two, but twenty two, when he began to reigne; his father being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to <hi>Athaliah,</hi> his mother, in the eighth year of, <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi> reigne.
And those fourty two years must needs relate to another time then
<hi>Ahaziah's</hi> age; and do justly agree with the number of years of the
continuance of <hi>Omri</hi> his race in the royal Throne, from whom this
<hi>Ahaziah</hi> descended by his mother <hi>Athaliah</hi> and in whom, and <hi>Omries</hi>

<hi>Ahaziah</hi> alone; one, <hi>Jehoram</hi> twelve: in all fourty two. And the
Hebrew expression in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXII. 2. is this, <hi>A sonne of fourty two
years was Ahaziah inhis reigning;</hi> which may have a relation to a
continuance in a stock. And a passage and computation, not unlike
to this, is that, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XV. 19. and <hi>chap.</hi> XVI. 1. from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the division of the two Kingdomes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel.</hi> This

Kings house, judging the people of the Land, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XXVI. 21.
This seemes to be four years before his father <hi>Uzziah's</hi> death: And

THE Books of <hi>Chronicles</hi> do chiefly pursue the Histories of the
Kings of <hi>Judah.</hi> And yet are more sparing in relating the
sinnes of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are not those <hi>Chronicles</hi> often cited in the Books of Kings; as
hath been shewed heretofore. But these are thought to be written by
<hi>Ezra, 2 Chron.</hi> XXXVI. 22, 23. <hi>Ezra</hi> I. 1, 2, 3 And that after the return
from the Babylonish captivity. Yet some things are inserted which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
beyond <hi>Ezra's</hi> time; as that 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> III. 21,—24. In these
Books, as in an Abridgement, the holy Penman is sometimes short, and
obscure. But in the Histories of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> full and exact.</p>
               <p>Take the periods of times from the Creation, to the year of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from the Babylonish Captivity, And so these Books containe
an History of 3458. years. The first Book, 2986. to the death of
<hi>David;</hi> Thus; <hi>Genesis,</hi> 2369; <hi>Exodus,</hi> 142; <hi>Levit, Num. Deut.</hi> 39.
<hi>Joshuah 17. Judges, 299. 1 Sam. 80. 2 Sam.</hi> 40. In all, 2986.</p>
               <p>The second Book 472. from the beginning of <hi>Solomons</hi> reigne, to the
said year of Returne; Others reckon thus; 3467. in the whole: 2990.
in the first Book: 477. in the second Book. Others, and that most
likely, 2986. in the first Book; And 466. in the second Book: <hi>viz.</hi>
from the first of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to the seventeenth of <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> 118.
Thance to the Captivity in the first of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and fourth of
<hi>Iehojakim,</hi> 278. Thence to the Returne, 70. In all, 466. And so the
whole in both Books will amount to 3452.</p>
               <p>The first Book mentions occasionally some things long after <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
death; as the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> after the Returne from

<hi>Baruch,</hi> that he was <hi>Ieremies</hi> Scribe. And of families of Scribes, that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49194:108"/>
dwelt at <hi>Jabez</hi> in the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and were of the posterity of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro,</hi>
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> II. 55. But why so called, or what their Office was,
whether as Publike Notaries, Scriveners, or Transcribers of the Law,
or what else, it appears not. Here in <hi>Iosiah's</hi> time we finde that in his
businesse of repairing the house of the Lord, there were appointed of
the Levites Scribes. And in <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> time he made Treasurers
over the <hi>Treasuries</hi> [in the Lords House] <hi>Shelemiah</hi> the Priest, and
<hi>Zadok</hi> the Scribe. And in his time also was that famous <hi>Ezra,</hi> a
Priest, sonne of the High Priest <hi>Serajah</hi> slaine by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and
the same a ready Scribe in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> a Scribe of the
Law of the God of Heaven, of the words of the Commandments of
the Lord, and of his Statutes to <hi>Israel;</hi> and the same a publick Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Teacher of the Law. In the New Testament we finde them
much more mentioned; and to be of more esteeme; and themselves
affected Preheminence and precedencies, <hi>Mark. XII.</hi> 38, 39. Here
they are often joyned with the Chief Priests, and Elders, and often
with the Pharisees. They pretended to extraordinary holinesse, as
the Pharisees did; whence is that, <hi>Matth.</hi> V. 20. and <hi>Acts</hi> XXIII.
9. They were of the Pharisees part against the Sadduces. Yea
he that is called a Scribe, <hi>Marke</hi> XII. 28. the same is called a
Pharisee, and a Lawyer, <hi>Matth. XXII.</hi> 34, 35. We read not that they
were of the Sect of the Sadduces, or Essenes. But we finde them to
joyne with all the rest, to question, to pose, and oppose our Saviour, to
entangle and insnare him by Questions, to charge his miracles to be
done by <hi>Belzebub;</hi> Himself, with Blasphemy; to apprehend and binde
him; to condemne him in the Councel; to deliver him to <hi>Pilate;</hi> to
accuse him before <hi>Herod;</hi> to prosecute him to death; to mock him
upon the Crosse. And we finde that these Scribes sate in <hi>Moses</hi>-chair,
<hi>Matth. XXIII.</hi> 2. and were Preachers and Teachers of the people, <hi>Mat.</hi>
VII. 29. and XIII. 52. And likely were all of the tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Book of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is the last Book and History of
the Old Testament, mentioning matters after <hi>Malachi.</hi>
It containes an History of one hundred and twenty
years, or thereabout; reckoning from the twentieth of
<hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> began, <hi>chap.</hi> II.
1. to the days of <hi>Jaddua,</hi> two years before the period of
the Persian Empire, <hi>chap.</hi> XII. 11, 22. Some make it about fifty five;
reckoning so from the twentieth of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> to the period
of the Persian Empire.</p>
               <p>The two maine and differing reckonings then of the years of
the two Books of <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemie</hi> joyntly considered, stand
thus; Reckoning as some do, to <hi>Ezra</hi> one hundred fourty six, and to
<hi>Nehemie</hi> fifty five, the summe of both comes to two hundred and one.
But rather reckoning to <hi>Ezra</hi> seventy two, and to <hi>Nehemie</hi> one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty, the summe of both doth arise to one hundred ninety
two. Thus the difference between these two reckonings of both Books
joyntly, amounteth to nine years.</p>
               <p>If this <hi>Nehemiah</hi> be the same that came up with <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi>
mentioned <hi>Ezra II. 2. Neh. VII.</hi> 7. and writ this Book; then <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
must needs be a very old man; And that passage, <hi>ch. XII.</hi> 10, 11.
mentioning <hi>Jaddua</hi> the High Priest, must needs be inserted by some
other Prophet since his dayes; And much more since the dayes of
<hi>Ezra:</hi> For <hi>Jaddua</hi> lived till the dayes of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and met
him coming into <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> which is the very last Historical Passage and
Record of the Old Testament: For <hi>Psalm XLIV.</hi> And <hi>LXXIV.</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by some to be penned in the dayes of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> carrie
no sure ground for such an after-date. And surely so many years as
include the whole continuance of the Persian Empire and more, do far
passe the date of one mans life in that age of the world. Yet that <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
might well reach to the 32. year of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus;</hi>
which is the last passage of this Book, setting that of <hi>Jaddua</hi> aside.
However, many make this <hi>Nehemiah</hi> this famous Governour, to be
another <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> of younger and later years, then he, <hi>Ezra II.</hi> 2.
This <hi>Nehemiah</hi> came to his Government, when <hi>Eliashib,</hi> the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childe
of <hi>Jeshua,</hi> or <hi>Joshua,</hi> or <hi>Jehoshua</hi> was High Priest, <hi>chap. III.</hi> 1.
and XII. 10. The whole time of his Government is set down, <hi>chap.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49194:113"/>
II.</hi> 1. and <hi>chap.</hi> V. 14. and <hi>chap. XIII.</hi> 6. The first time was twelve
years. And the twelve first Chapters of his Book mention the things
that were done by him in the first year only of those twelve. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time of his Government is contained in the last chapter: And the
beginning and durance of it is uncertaine: yet long it was, as may be
gathered out of <hi>chap. XIII.</hi> 28. See the <hi>Observations</hi> on that Text.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I brought up</hi>] The maner of the Dedication of the wall was thus;
The wall was thick and broad; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">verse </seg>31</label> that divers went a breast on it. <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
appointed two great companies, consisting of Priests, Levites,
Princes, and People. They entred upon the wall about the middle of
the West wall, near the Dung-gate. And there the two companies
parted. And each went as in Procession in this Order; The one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
had <hi>Ezra</hi> the Priest and Scribe before them. And other Priests
after him, founding their Trumpets. After them the Levites, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on sacred musical instruments; and singers of them, that sang with
a loud voice; All sounding forth Gods praise, and their own thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
and joy, <hi>ver.</hi> 31,—42. After them the Princes and Rulers.
After them the People. And last of all, some great Prince, likely
next in degree to <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> And this company thus went on the
right hand South-ward by the Fountain Gate; and about the Citie
of <hi>David,</hi> and all along the South-wall, even unto the Water-gate
on the East. The other company went in like equipage; and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
himself the last of them. And they made their Procession on
the left hand North-wards, from beyond the Tower of the Furnaces,
even unto the Broad wall. And all along the North-side, from above
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49194:116"/>
the Gate of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and above the Old-gate; and above the Fish-gate,
and the Tower of <hi>Hananeel,</hi> and the Tower of <hi>Meah,</hi> even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sheep-gate, on the East; And they stood still in the Prison-gate.
The two companies somewhat beyond this Gate met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they might in order descend from this East-wall, to go into
the House of God. And likely it was from the Water-gate on the
East-wall; For the street it opened upon, was one of the eminentest,
and of greatest receipt in the Citie, deemed to be that of <hi>Millo,</hi> which

upon sundry others of the Persian Monarchs. But the greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
is for <hi>Darius Hystaspis;</hi> who first extended the bounds of that
Empire so farre and wide, and over so many Provinces; and married
<hi>Atossa</hi> the daughter of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> called <hi>Vasthi, ver.</hi> 9, who was the third
King of <hi>Persia;</hi> omitting <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> before <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus

That the drinking was according to the Kings Law, not of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but of all the Officers of his house; or that the Officers should
give them royal wine, such as the King himself used, and that in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
according to the state of the King when now in this Feast the
Kings purpose was to shew the riches of his glorious Kingdome, and
the honour of his excellent Majesty; that none therefore of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
should restraine, inhibit, or hinder it, but give to every one of the
guests freely and bountifully what wine, and as much, and as often as
he desired; that as no restraint, so no complaint should be to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>

speeches to him. Here then, He aments the most woful extremity of
this misery which God inflicts upon him, so that his Complaints are
not causelesse; he wisheth that God would cut him off, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of the unpitifulnesse of his friends towards him, <hi>chap.</hi> VI. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth
the mention, and bemoaning of his miseries, as insupportable:
he wisheth death: confesseth his sinfulnesse; and craveth pardon, <hi>chap.</hi>
VII. He acknowledgeth man cannot contend with God; and that he
will not answer God, or contend to justifie himself, though he were
righteous, which he is not; but makes supplication to his Judge. He
saith, God destroyes the perfect and the wicked; that his dayes are few;
his sorrowes are great; that God will not hold him innocent; that he
cannot answer God; yet would willingly speak to him, if his rod,
and terrours were taken away from him, <hi>chap.</hi> IX. He will speak to
God and say, wherfore doest thou so contend with me; and search after
my sinne? Thou knowest I am not wicked: Thy hands have made
me: If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not
lift up my head; I am full of confusion; Thou huntest me as a fierce
Lion: Oh that I had not been borne. Cease then, that I may take
comfort a little before I die, <hi>chap</hi> 10. He reproves his friends for their
pleadings against him: He knowes what they know, and say, <hi>viz.</hi> That
God doth all things in the governing of the affairs and states of men;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49194:122"/>
even of the great ones. <hi>chap.</hi> XII. Again reproves his friends, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and checks them for pleading for God, in a wrong maner: bids
them hold their peace; that he may speak: professeth his trust in God;
his uprightnesse, void of Hypocrisie; and that he shall be justified:
he desires of God to know his iniquity, for which he writeth such bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things against him, <hi>Chap.</hi> XIII. He entreateth God for favour
by the shortnesse of life, and certainty of death; though life once
lost be irrecoverable; yet he waighteth for his change: he complains
that God watcheth over his sinne; and concludes that God prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
over man, <hi>chap.</hi> XIV.</p>

He adviseth him to remember himself, what God is, in himself, and in
his wayes, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23. And in his works; in the Meteors of the aire,
the raine, the clouds, the lightnings, whereby he can work good to his,

him, and his infinite wisdome, rather then to stand on his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie,

Luke</hi> XX. 42. <hi>Acts</hi> I. 20. is divided by the Hebrewes
into these five Parts: The first part ending with <hi>Psal.</hi>
XLI. The second part, with <hi>Psal.</hi> LXXII. The third,
with <hi>Psalme</hi> LXXXIX. The fourth, with <hi>Psalm</hi> CVI.
The fifth, with <hi>Psalme</hi> CL.</p>
               <p>The Division of them, from the Subject-matters of them, is very
various. There are <hi>Psalmes Laudatorie,</hi> of Praises; <hi>Gratulatorie,</hi> of
Thanksgiving: <hi>Psalmes</hi> of Supplications; of Deprecations; of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations;
of Comminations; of Imprecations: There are Peneten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<hi>Psalmes; Psalmes</hi> to teach; to give instruction; <hi>Psalmes</hi> to bring to
Remembrance, things past; <hi>Psalmes</hi> Prophetical, of things to come:
And many <hi>Psalmes</hi> are mixt of many, or most of these matters. So as
out of them, as out of a store-house, every man may richly fit and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
himself for all and every particular occasion, either publike, or
else private, according to his several conditions, in prosperity, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
in all his devotions, and addresses to God; still finding his own
estate in some one <hi>Psalme</hi> or other; These <hi>Psalmes</hi> containing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Anatomy of the soul, the characters and representations of the
thoughts, meditations, affections, and workings of it, towards God,
towards man, towards herself, throughout all the changes of her pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
in this world.</p>
               <p>The number of them is one hundred and fifty. The LXX. and
vulgar Latin, do divide the ninth <hi>Psalme</hi> into two. And so their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
of the number doth constantly go on to exceed ours by one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the CXLVII. <hi>Psalm:</hi> which <hi>Psalm</hi> doth contain their CXLVI. and
CXLVII. And so in the conclusion all agree in the same number of
CL.</p>
               <p>Of these, eighty two bear <hi>Davids</hi> title. Whereof these are upon
several special occasions, as appears in their Inscriptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Other <hi>Psalmes,</hi> without <hi>Davids</hi> name, which have special Titles, are

Degrees, CXX. to CXXXIV. Having Titles, are 125. The rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
XXV. the sixth part of the whole number, are without any Title
or Inscription at all.</p>
               <p>In the Titles we have the persons, by whom they were written; or
for whom they were written; or to whom they were committed. And
these last are either generaly described, by their skill in Musick; or
more particularly named to be of the Quire or Posterity of <hi>Jeduthun,</hi>
of <hi>Korah,</hi> or of <hi>Asaph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In some we have also the Times when they were made; or when
to be used. In some also their Quality and Excellencie. In some
their Matter Subject, as of Prayer, of Deprecation, as Destroy not; of
obtestation; of Gratulation or Thanksgiving; of Praise; of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and Doctrine; of Commemoration, or for Remembrance; of
nuptial love.</p>
               <p>The Musick, either by voice, or instrument mentioned in some Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
is but little known in our dayes; yet for the voice, some <hi>Psalmes</hi>
may seeme to point to the Base, some to the Tenor, some to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-tenor:
And again, in some mens opinions, some <hi>Psalmes</hi> do inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
that the voice should leade, and the instrument follow; as in those
Titles <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

of six strings; from <hi>Shesh,</hi> six, as <hi>Shalishim</hi> of three strings, 1, <hi>Sam.</hi>
XVIII. 6. <hi>Sheminith,</hi> of eight strings; <hi>Nehiloth,</hi> a wind-instrument; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halath,</hi>
likewise. And so other guesses may be made of other words
mentioned in sundry Titles of sundry <hi>Psalms;</hi> as <hi>Shoshannim Eduth, Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shan

yet no certainties can be had for the exact notions and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psalme</hi> XIV. and LIII. are much the same. And so again, <hi>Psalme</hi>

same. And <hi>Psal. CVIII.</hi> 1,—5. are the same with the end of the LVII.
<hi>Psalme.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 6,—18. are the same with the end of the LX. <hi>Psalme.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49194:130"/>
Psalme</hi> XXV. begins each <hi>verse</hi> almost with the several letters of the
Hebrew Alphabet, in order. And so in a maner doth the XXXIV.
<hi>Psal.</hi> CXI. and CXII. begin each <hi>half verse</hi> with the letters of the
Hebrew Alphabet, in order: save that the two last <hi>verses</hi> in both
<hi>Psalmes,</hi> take up three letters apiece, to fill up the number of the two
and twenty letters of the Hebrew Alphabet. <hi>Psal.</hi> XXXVII. begins
every second <hi>verse</hi> with the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet in order.
<hi>Psalme CXIX.</hi> without <hi>Davids</hi> Title, begins each of the first eight <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
with the first letter of the Hebrew Alphabet: and each of the eight
next <hi>verses</hi> with the second letter of the Hebrew Alphabet. And so
continues along to the end of the Alphabet. <hi>Psalme CXLV.</hi> begins
each <hi>verse</hi> with the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet; omitting only the
letter <hi>Nun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some <hi>Psalmes</hi> composed long before <hi>David</hi> was borne; as <hi>Psalme
XC.</hi> Some long after he was dead; as <hi>Psalme LXXIV. LXXXIII. CXXVI.
CXXXVII.</hi> Whereby it appears that the <hi>Psalmes</hi> were put into the
forme and order they now have, after the returne of the Jewes from
<hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Some are set-formes, as</hi> Psalmes XX. XXI. CII. CXXXVI. Esay
XXVI. 1.</p>
               <p>The Book of <hi>Psalmes</hi> authentical with the Papists, and by them
fathered upon <hi>Jerome,</hi> is confessed by him to be but a Translation out
of the Greek LXX. not out of the Hebrew text. And the Popish
<hi>Bonaventure</hi> ventures but badly when he substitutes the word <hi>Mary,</hi> or
Lady, in stead of Lord or God; and with some other alterations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
them to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Book of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> is much cited in the New Testament: As
doth appear in this Table following.</p>

In these Citations and Allegations, and Allusions, The Penmen
of Scripture regard more oftentimes the sense and intent of the Text
cited, then the precise termes, where the one swerves not much from
the other, and what is in the words so read or implyed, is of undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
truth. And sometimes they cite not the entire Text, nor tie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the precise words of the place, nor observe strictly the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of them, as they lie in the Text; but pick only out of them so
much as may serve for their present purpose; which in quotation of
places is sufficient. So <hi>John</hi> XII. 40. <hi>Matth.</hi> IV. 15, 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> XX.
7. And in Citations in the New Testament, the holy Penmen in some
places follow the LXX. as then most in use in Synagogues, &amp; Schools,
publikely, &amp; privately, though therein departing from the Hebrew, but
yet only in matters of no concernment as to the present Allegation.
Some are Accommodations only; when Prophesies besides their Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
sense; have sometimes another in this sort affixed to them, To
which when they are accommodated, they are said to be fulfilled, <hi>i. e.</hi>
to have a more eminent accomplishment in a higher sense; As <hi>Esay</hi>
IX. 1, 2. the great Light and comfort and deliverance from <hi>Sennaohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,</hi>
and out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is accommodated, <hi>Matth.</hi> IV. 13,—16. to

them, <hi>Acts</hi> XIII. 33. And the Church doth ascribe this

this <hi>Psalme David</hi> bears a Type of Christ, who is here more realy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,

Christs soul out of Hell, but punctualy of Christs Resurrection: They
inferre nothing else out of this Text. But Resurrection is properly
of the Body, not of the Soul. <hi>Gehenna</hi> is sometimes taken for the
Grave; and most-times further, for Hell it self. The true meaning
and sense of the Article of Christs Descent into Hell, as the Latines
very improperly translate the words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, seemes to be thus
rendered rather, he went into the place of invisible souls: and to be
understood of Christs Soul; for his body remained in the Grave; And
his soul in that interim to passe to the place of souls; to Heaven or
Paradise; as the souls of the godly did, and his principaly. As the souls
of the wicked went to Hell. For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as a general name doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and evidently signifie both places. And thus the Articles go on
methodicaly, without any tautologie; That after Christs death, his
body was buried in the Grave, his Soul went to the place of blessed
souls; and the third day, both soul and body were reunited in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.

In summe, the Apostle herein followes the LXX. And applies this to
the preaching of the Gospel to the Heathens; as God had formerly
taught them, in another &amp; a weaker maner and degree, by his works of
Creation. They had as a voice to speak; so a line to write, rule, direct,

a Protestation of the bitternesse of his Passion, so stricken, smitten

for the time, as it was the Fathers pleasure to have it so, so the
Sonnes office called him unto it; and he did not contract it by any
fault of his, but did voluntarily undertake it for our sinnes, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation
of them: as he did the death it self. So that in this then there
could not be any defect or defanlt of faith, and hope requisite in him,
And likewise that Prayer and Speech, <hi>Matth.</hi> XXVI. 39. bewrayes
the sense of the flesh; but joyned with the obedience of the Spirit in
him: A double Will in him, against Monothelites: but joyned
both in one holy obedience and subjection. All which shew the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of sinne, the infinite wrath of God against it; the infinite Love
of the Father, and the Sonne, towards the children of men; and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Christs Humane Nature, both in body and soul.</p>

therein, for the time, either by extraordinary signes and tokens

ceremonial under the Old Testament; which now is done away,
and not to be recalled; or spiritual, under the New. The former,
though of Gods appointment and ordination, had not in themselves,
nor could give absolute holinesse to the worship therein performed:
And much more now the Places of Gods worship do not make holy
the Services therein performed; but by them rather are made holy
only relatively, being appointed to such holy uses.</p>

that <hi>James</hi> V. 12. is not to be understood simply and absolutely; but
relatively, as Christ thereby opposeth the corrupt practise of the
Pharisees, and their false interpretation of Gods Law concerning
swearing, as if swearing, so as Gods name were not directly used in it,
and no falshood or perjury contained in it, were no sinne with them;
but ever and altogether lawful, though it were never so lightly and
slightly, vainly, and customarily, unnecessarily, and causelesly done,
where <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> had been sufficient. Thus Christ opposeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth

swearing, upon just, urgent and necessary occasions. Of Oaths, see

               <p>The matter of this <hi>Psalme,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">chapter </seg>XXXVII</label> or the first maine part of it, is that
grand point, of the prosperity of the wicked, and afflictions of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in this life; and of Gods Providence therein. Heathens have much
debated this matter. <hi>Job</hi> is much upon it, as <hi>chap.</hi> XXI. 7. &amp;c. and
<hi>chap.</hi> XXIV: and <hi>chap.</hi> XXVII. and in other places. Divers other
<hi>Psalmes</hi> also insist upon it more or lesse; as <hi>Psal.</hi> XLIX. and LXXIII.
and XC. <hi>Jeremie</hi> professedly, <hi>chap.</hi> XII. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Habakkuk</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
<hi>chap.</hi> I. 13. The case in point of fact is plain and undeniable.
The Providence, Wisdome, and Justice of God in it, is a Mystery to
man. Yet to the Christian who believes the Resurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and eternal life, things not so clearly revealed in the infancie of
the Church, the difficulty is now soone dissolved. And the well and
wise weighing of the point by an Heathen, or natural man, may much
availe him for his further and better information in matters of great
consequence and concernment. See the <hi>Annotations</hi> on <hi>Psal.</hi> XLI. 1.
The greatest doubt arising hence to the godly, may seeme to be this,
How these same occurrences of administrations in Gods Providence
may stand with such constant, continual, and abundant promises of
Gods blessings in temporal things to the godly in this life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> IV.
8. and with his like threatnings of plagues and punishments to the
wicked in this world. The issue will be, That these Promises and
Threatnings, specialy under the Law, are spoken to vulgar capacities,
in those times; and yet have their exceptions and limitations in the
Word: And that the prosperity of the wicked is but a seeming prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and a short, and momentany prosperity in relation to eternity;
and many wayes disadvantageous and hurtful to them; and ends with
an overthrow suddaine, and terrible, and everlasting: And again, That
the affliction of the godly is but momentany, nothing to eternity, and
mainly profitable for the work of Grace here, more then abundantly
recompensing and over-poizing their afflictions; and for the increase
of Glory hereafter. Yet super-adding this, That Gods wisdome and
wayes of Providence are not commensurate with mans finite and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
capacity, <hi>Psal. XXXVI. 6. Rom.</hi> XI. 33. <hi>Gen.</hi> XVIII. 25. <hi>Esay</hi>

Gods, and their forlorne foes. Yet possible that in some of these

                  <hi>sit thou</hi>] This, and other phrases here, are not proper, but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
to be understood, not corporealy, but spiritualy. Christ is said
in Scripture promiscuously, both to <hi>stand,</hi> and to <hi>sit</hi> at the right hand
of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> I. 3. <hi>Acts</hi> VII. 55, 56. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> III. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>at my right hand</hi>] The right hand signifies <hi>power and strength,
Psal.</hi> CXVIII. 16. <hi>Exod.</hi> XV. 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> CXLIV. 8. <hi>Power to help,
verse 5. Psal.</hi> XVI. 8. and CXLII. 4. <hi>Eccles.</hi> X. 2. <hi>To be or sit there,</hi>
imports <hi>dignity and honour, 1 Kings</hi> II. 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> XX. 21. And
such is the meaning here. And this <hi>dignity</hi> here expressed by this
phrase is ascribed to Christ; not in relation to his <hi>Deity,</hi> for so he and
the Father are one. Herein he is, and alwayes was of equal dignity
with the Father: But in regard of his <hi>Humanity</hi> whereby the Father
was greater then he: And wherein formerly he had emptied and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himself, and suffered, even to death; and so was made a little
lower then the Angels. But now hereby he is crowned with glory and
honour. Yet this dignity here is not ascribed to his Humanity singly
in it self considered, but <hi>in supposito,</hi> as it hypostaticaly subsists in the
Person of the Sonne of God. And this Dignity is not an elevation
and exaltation of the Humanity of our Saviour into the Majesty and
essential properties and prerogatives of the Divine-nature; and so to
have a parity of Dignity with it, an equality in all points; realy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Humanity in it self, as the Ubiquitaries contend and
plead for, and which they referre, not to the Person only; but to the
very Humane nature also in the Person of the Sonne of God. But
this Dignity of Christs Humanity is that which is next in degree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God and the Father, above that of the Angels, and all creatures,
<hi>Heb.</hi> I. 3, 4. <hi>Ephes.</hi> I. 20, 21, 22, 23. given to him in time, after his
Ascention, as a consequent and reward of his exinanition and passion,
<hi>Phil.</hi> II. <hi>ult. Heb.</hi> II. 9. <hi>Luke</hi> XXIV. 26. This Dignity Saint <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XV. 25. and Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> V. 31. and X. 42. <hi>Iohn</hi>
V. 27. In summe then, as Christ emptied himself, and subjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Father, not in regard of his Divine nature, but in regard of
his Person God-man, and that only out of his Voluntary dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
So out of the same his voluntary dispensation it is, that he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
this office of Mediation in both natures, And here after his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention;
not before; in the Personal Union of both Natures; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
this Dignity of sitting on the Fathers right hand; his Person
reigning so in both natures. It is not then the Humanity in it self sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken that sits on the right hand of God; but the Humanity of
that Person that sits at the right hand of God: as in the Incarnation it
came to passe, not that the Humanity became God, but that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49194:159"/>
became then the Humanity of God. And Christ now sitting
at the right hand of God doth reigne every where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even as Man also;
though his Humanity be not every where: as a King doth in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
though his body be not every where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Head in the Body,
though the Head be not every where as the Sun in the firmament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens,
heats, cherisheth, quickeneth things below, though the Sun
remaine in its own place above.</p>

then he shall leave off his Office of Mediation, having then overcome
his enemies, and fully gathered his Church; he shall not thenceforth
use those meanes, and actings which formerly he did; the whole work
being then finished; then shall he leave off the administration of that

decreeing both, as to do the thing, so again to change it upon

salvation; for our greater confirmation, and consolation herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou art</hi>] The Lord Christ well knew this, and could not doubt
of the will of the Father herein. What then needed this Oath to be
made unto him? Answ. It was made to him, for the use of his Church;
that his Church might know and be assured of it. As that <hi>John</hi>
XI. 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>art</hi>] God saying, is as much as doing.</p>

Christ in truth, the Antitype. The Priests office was to Teach, Pray,
and Sacrifice. The High Priest among the Jewes once a year entred
into the most Holy place. Yet he in all things was not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and sufficient Type of our High Priest Christ the Lord. For
he is an eternal High Priest; and both King and Priest; and his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of another nature; and himself of another Tribe.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>of Melchizedec</hi>] Much question who this <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was. He was
not the Sonne of God himself, our Lord and Christ. Very many take
him to be <hi>Sem</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Noah,</hi> who saw both worlds, before, and
after the Flood; and lived to the one hundred and fiftieth year of the
age of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Yet because <hi>Sems</hi> genealogie is exactly set down in
Scripture; and that the Levitical Priests themselves came from him
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49194:160"/>
after sundry descents: and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> seems not to be <hi>Sems</hi>
habitation, which took its name from his younger brother <hi>Cham,</hi> or
from <hi>Chams</hi> sonne <hi>Canaan:</hi> Neither would <hi>Abraham</hi> so long have
forborne his due respects and visitation of <hi>Sem</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> if <hi>Sem</hi> had
lived there: Therefore divers learned men take this <hi>Melchizedec</hi> to
be rather some eminent man in <hi>Canaan,</hi> raised up by God in those
corrupt times, both good and godly, both King and Priest, living in
<hi>Salem,</hi> after called <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> whose King in <hi>Joshuahs</hi> time was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Adoni-Zedeck,</hi> that is, Lord of righteousnesse, <hi>Josh.</hi> X. 1. As this
man here is called <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> that is, King of righteousnesse. By
which place, or near to it, <hi>Abraham</hi> in his returne from this warre and
victory, was to passe.</p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> and his Priesthood, and the difference of it
from <hi>Aarons</hi> Priesthood, the Apostle to the Hebrews, <hi>chap,</hi> VII en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth
at large, and observeth divers things; his Name and Title;
his greatnesse in that he blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and received Tythes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi>
his being mentioned in Scripture without any Pedegree,
without father without mother, without descent, having neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of dayes, nor end of life. All these he had; as our Saviour
himself had them; but none of them recorded or registred in the
Scripture; that he might so become a Type of the <hi>eternity</hi> of Christs
Person, and Priesthood; <hi>verse</hi> 3. The Apostle further observeth his
Offices, that he was both King and Priest; and that our Saviour was
made such, with an oath of God the Father; and a Priest of a better
Priesthood, Covenant, and Commandment; and that he was made,
not after the Law of a carnal commandement, having carnal succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
in his Priesthood; but after the power of an endlesse life, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
for evermore, having an eternal Priesthood, and unchangeable,
continuing ever, and living ever to make intercession, and by his one,
offering up himself once for all, saving them to the uttermost that
come to God by him. In all which there are manifold resemblances
between <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Melchizedec;</hi> and manifold differences between
theirs and the Aaronical Priesthood. As for those fond and forced
dreams of the Papist, That <hi>Melchizedec</hi> offered up to God the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of bread and wine; And therein was a Type and Figure of their
sacrifice of the Masse; And that thereupon Christ our Lord is said to
be <hi>a Priest after the order of Melchizedec;</hi> These may well befal to
them, who for want of the love of the truth, are given up to beleeve
lies; but are too weak, poor, and silly, for us to trouble our selves
withal.</p>

in his <hi>Mothers;</hi> and sometimes in <hi>Gods</hi> name.</p>
               <p>It may seeme thus; That he speaks in his Owne name, <hi>Chapters</hi>
I, II, III. He sets down the summe of his Father <hi>Davids</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>Chapters</hi> IV, V, VI, VII. Then brings in <hi>Wisdome</hi> speaking,
<hi>Chapters</hi> VIII. IX. After he sets down those <hi>Proverbs</hi> of his Owne,
which he had set in order in his Life-time, <hi>Chapters</hi> X,—XXIV. Then
others are added that were gathered by the <hi>Servants of King Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,
Chapters</hi> XXV,—XXIX. Then follows the Prophesie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur,
Chap.</hi> XXX. And lastly, the Instruction which <hi>Solomons mother</hi>
taught him, <hi>Chap,</hi> XXXI. So that the Collection was made by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry;
and at sundry times. For <hi>explanations,</hi> where most need shall
be, I shall give some short touches; And therein willingly make

wise <hi>Proverbs:</hi> to mark them out as rocks at Sea, that we might
avoid shipwrack thereon. Shortly thus; That the Foole feedeth on
foolishnesse; it is joy to him; he is full of words: delights that his
heart may discover it self: uttereth all his minde; layeth open his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
saith to every one that he is a fool: whereas, if he held his peace, he
might be counted wise: his instruction is folly: Excellent speech
becomes him not: honour is not seemely for him: The legs of the
lame are not equal; and so is a parable in the mouth of fools. His
eyes are in the ends of the earth; his heart at his left hand; he will be
medling: he enters into contention, and his mouth calleth for stroaks,
<hi>Job</hi> V. 2. A stone is heavie, and the sand weighty, yet his wrath is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then them both. And as a whip is for the horse, a bridle for the Asse,
so a rod for the fools back: yet he trusts in his own heart: that though
thou shouldest bray him in a Morter among wheat with a pestle, <hi>yet will
not his foolishnesse depart from him: But as a dog returneth to his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
so a fool to his folly. He hath no delight in understanding; it is
too high for him: though a price be put in his hand,</hi> to get wisdome, yet
he hath no heart; he doth despise, doth hate knowledge and reproof:
yea the thought of foolishnesse is sinne. <hi>He makes a mock of sinne; it
is a sport to him to do mischief:</hi> And therefore saith <hi>Solomon, meddle
not with him,</hi> or his companie. Answer him not according to his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
unlesse it be shortly, to convince him; leave him, and go from
his presence; <hi>for shame shall be his promotion; and destruction is near

his old age, as may seeme to be gathered, both out of
the Title of the Book, and the Closure of it in the six
last <hi>verses;</hi> and also out of the whole Body of it; Being
written upon a serious view of the Passages and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of his life past, and the great and manifold Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
he had made and found therein. His maine businesse is a curious
search after true Felicitie and real Contentation. And upon his search,
and experience he doth finde and pronounce. That in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
all things under the Sunne were but vanitie of vanities, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of spirit: and for such experimented by him; though the same
improved by humane wisdome in him to the utmost, <hi>Chap.</hi> II. 3, 9.
This he shews in a large maner, in sundry sorts, in many particular va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
under the Sunne; principaly in humane wisdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
humane labours, industries, and endeavours; in Delights and

and Possessions; and in the utter insufficiencie that is in all these,
to extract from them, or the quintessence of them, any true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or from any other sublunarie thing, or creature whatsoever. He
seemes to speak sometimes in the person, and according to the carnal
reasonings of the Atheist and Epicure, as reciting their opinions, with
their arguments; yet he avers the truth of God against them; and
the just and wise course, though to us secret, hid, and unsearchable, of
his Providence, Administration, and government of all the events,
issues, accidents, and affairs of this life, in relation both to the just, and
to sinners; even in things befalling in common to both of them. He
giveth sundry sound remedies to abate and heale the said Vanities. He
speaks much for Wisdome, and against Folly. And prescribes many
good Rules for better things, for procuring tranquillity unto the mind,
and peace and comfort to the life of a man; eftsoones minding and
mentioning, among other things, a chearful fruition and enjoyment
of the outward Blessings and Comforts of this Life, with gladnesse,
contentation, and thankfulnesse, as from the hand of God. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the twelfth <hi>Chapter</hi> he concludes, That in Old age, elegantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

The first meanes and remedy here is a Good Name. or Fame.
The first letter of the Hebrew word for Good, is here greater then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;
to intimate belike the great and extraordinary goodnesse of a
good name. Which is better to a man, to his conscience, and soul, then
a precious ointment is to his body. It refresheth, and cheereth, and
comforteth the soul and conscience, in the very midst of all wrongs and

names as a curse, and a stinking snuff behinde them, <hi>Esay</hi> LXV. 15. yea,

as it were to ravish the Text, and to fall
into sundry (I might say) ridiculous singularities
and absurdities.</p>
               <p>It is the Song of Songs, the chiefest of his
1005. Songs, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> IV. 32. the most excellent of all others: and
that for Expressions, Mysteries, Purity and Holinesse; but most for
the Subject and Matter of it, which is sublime, divine, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical.</p>
               <p>It is all a continued Allegorie; full of Obscurities, as is confessed
by all; somewhat the harder to understand by reason of so many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
of understandings; somewhat the more difficult, because
we meet here with diverse Hebrew words which are not found in
the Scripure besides. It is all mystical; as many words, almost so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Mysteries: As is likewise said of the Apocalypse. And the Jewes
hereupon are said to forbid the reading of this Book among them till
they came to thirty years of age.</p>
               <p>Yet it appears to be an Epithalamium, a marriage-Song, a Song
of Loves: Penned by <hi>Solomon,</hi> it seemes in his younger years, and
best times, not long after his marriage with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

               <p>Here is Christ the true <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Bridegroome; and his Church,
the Spouse. Here between them is set down all Rhetorick of Love;
pathetical Compellations, affectionate Elogies, Passionate Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
all here pure and spiritual in this Celestial Poem: Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Temporal, Carnal, or worldly mixture in it. The flowers
and ornaments of Language in the Praises of Both, are not applicable
to bodily or natural beauties, but to spiritual and supernatural. Here
is hidden Manna; <hi>sancta sanctis;</hi> Pearls are not for swine. Here <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
rips up, and rifles, as it were, all the rarities of Nature, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
his sacred and supernatural mysteries. Yea, such is the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:49194:199"/>
riches and sweetnesse of this Poem, and the subject of it, that
though the storehouse of the whole world from both her spheres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to it, yet all is not sufficient: The richest earthly things are but
grosse and sensible illustrations of spiritual Majesty, and glory: They
can serve but as mystical representations, as Emblemes, as Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiks,
as Manuductions, and Perspectives to Grace, and Glory. Here
between Christ, and his Church are interchangings of mutual Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Gloriations, and Congratulations; of Zealous spiritual longings,
and breathings of Loves, and Vowes, and Joyes; of acclamations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
and administrations. His divine and glorious excellencies
in himself, and rich bounties and blessings to her; and her precious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
graces, and endowments, ornaments, and priviledges by him,
in an high character, in lofty and stately sayings and similies, are por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied
and laid out to the life, by her, and by him. And yet withal,
her failings, and recoveries; and his withdrawings thereupon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings,
are not omitted</p>
               <p>And lastly, she being never satisfied with his Love, out of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
flame of her affection, she doth beg still a more intimate
Union, and communion with him, and a perpetual fruition of him, for
her self; and for all her members that yet knew him not: And that he
would hasten his last coming, for the full finishing of all, and her enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him in Vision Beatifical in the Life of Glory. In all these
Interlocutions betwixt them; she speaking nine times. He seven times;
And both joyntly together the same things, as in a Chorus, two times;

to admonish and dehort her from unworthy societie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

she makes a brief Reply, by desiring to be made fit for those Praises
and future affections, by the work of his Spirit; and that he may come

her love and zeal, so prayes to him, and so professes, as is in the two <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
following. Others under stand all these words as spoken by Christ
to the Church, whose grace alone did, and doth raise up his Church,
depressed and fallen under the tree of offence after the eating of the
forbidden fruit, lying in her blood, as it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> XVI. 5, 6. then and
there he said unto her, and be the mother of the living, as, <hi>Gen.</hi> III. 20.
And so they make the rest of the words to be his command to his
Church, naturaly following as her duty, from the consideration of his
foresaid benefits to her vouchsafed. But yet, however the words in
the fifth <hi>verse</hi> be taken, I do rather incline to understand the words in
the six and seven <hi>verses</hi> to be the Churches; by reason of their mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
idiome. She so begging Christs dearest love to her: and so
professing her own love to him, as riding in a Chariot o triumph, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
over all oppositions, unconquerable, unquenchable. And such
indeed is the Divine mutual love between Christ and his Church, thus
exalted to the highest.</p>

any wickednesse or corruption, of any kinde, into them: but indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by accident, and consequent, thus; By not hindering it, but
permitting it; justly, for their sinnes, withholding, or withdrawing
his Restraining Grace, which holds them in as a Grayhound is held in
from an hare by a slip; Denying his blessing to the meanes of Grace,
not vouchsafing his special and free grace and assistance to them; but
withdrawing the efficacy of his Spirit, which things he is not bound to
give to any: and justly leaving them so both to all Satans tentations,
and his instruments; And also to their owne vile lusts, the inbred
hardnesse of their hearts, rebellion of their wills, and the universal
corruption of their natures; which enslaves them to sinne, and fires
them after it; yea, the more for any opposition of Gods Commands,
Word, or Works, or any meanes else used to the contrary; as we see
Lime burne with water cast upon it. Even so the Heathen could say,
<hi>Nitimur in vetitum, semper cupimúsque negata:</hi> according with that of
the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> VII. <hi>verse</hi> 8,—13. Yea, God justly suffering and
presenting such objects, and occasioning such things to fall out, as are
not simply evil in themselves, yet through their default will prove
stumbling-blocks unto them, as whereupon their own wicked hearts
will still work and improve their own induration, excecation, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation
to further sinning. Thus they willingly fall further into sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
actions. The power of doing which acts, as they are acts, are yet
from God alone, in whom we live, and move, and have our being; but
the obliquity, malignity, and evil of them is from the wicked Agent.
And all this God doth in a way of justice: It is a just thing with God,
when men wilfully winkand shut their eyes against the light; And when
they harden their hearts, and stop their eares against him, his Word,
and Will, and Works; It is just with him, in maner aforesaid, to let
them have and enjoy what they so love and desire to have and enjoy.

XXXII. 31. In this Miracle, if the Sunne went back in its ordinary
pace and swiftnesse; and in like sort did returne forward againe, then
that Day-light must be long thirty two hours, if by a degree, an hour
be understood. If the Sunne returned back ten degrees in an instant,
then it must be long twenty two hours. But by a degree here most
likely half an hour is understood. See more of this in the <hi>Annotations</hi>

Man Repents with trouble of minde and conscience, for some fault,

this, and other Humane Passions, in some semblance, are ascribed to

Repent, when he doth as men use to do when they Repent, 1 <hi>Sam.

at most no greater or biger then the several Portions for each of the

of <hi>Palestine,</hi> V. Book. page 189. I desire to be rightly so understood,
and no otherwise. The said Draught is represented there in a far larger
Proportion. But the only Reason was, That so there might be roome
enough for the setting down of the several Situations, and Limits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, of the Priests Portion, and of the Sanctuarie in the
midst of it; And of the Levites Portion by themselves; And of the

time immediately preceding the destruction of the Jewish Politie,
their Citie and Temple; as being fulfilled and compleated then and
there: He shewes that both this effusion of the Spirit; And likewise
those wonders shewed in heaven, and in earth, so particularly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
