         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>INstead of prefixing so great a
Name to the following Papers,
I had thoughts of craving Your
<hi>Grace</hi>'s Patronage for some others
which more nearly relate to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Your own Province. But, I
know not how, these have gotten the
start; and, tho' I may (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
have some Reason to vary my
Subject, I hope, I may be allow'd to
put those also under Your Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hereafter. I am deeply sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of my own Insufficiency to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
what is here begun, without
such Assistances as Your <hi>Grace</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb facs="tcp:98722:3"/>
all others) can best afford me.
My great distance from Libraries,
and the narrowness of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with our <hi>English</hi> Historians,
will render my best Performances
very scanty and imperfect. Yet,
if the Design be approv'd and meet
with acceptance abroad, I shall not
despair of such helps as will rectify
all my mistakes, and supply the
defects of this first Essay. To this
purpose, I now humbly offer it to
Your <hi>Grace</hi>'s View and Censure;
being very ready to acknowledge
all your Corrections as so many
Particular Obligations and Honours
conferr'd upon,</p>

that I do not question but Attempts
will be made to gratify the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Humour of the Times. Though
to me, I confess, the Prospect is a
little discouraging: Since the due
observance of all the Rules which
<hi>Lucian,</hi> Father <hi>Le Moyne,</hi> and
others, have laid down for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on of such a work require so
many Accomplishments, that I am
very much of the Jesuits opinion,

be also a Divine, a Lawyer, an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
a Poet, and a downright honest

add the great Moral one of his being
<hi>Philalethes,</hi> a Person of that just

a Lesson this is to Flesh and Blood,
himself has fairly shewn us, when
(in the same Page) he sticks not to
affirm that his late Patron left more

                  <p>So that, for my share, I know not
where to look for this fine Person;
this Nonesuch of a Man; who alone
(it seems) is qualify'd to write a
General History. We have lately
indeed had Proposals for the speedy
publishing of an entire History of
this Nation: But I extremely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
the Author, when he appears

this Test. The very Title of his

all three of 'em have discover'd

such defects in their writings, as are

own Attempting such a Matter; and
seems to acknowledge that 'twas
Imprudence and want of thought,
which, in his younger daies, had
led him into the Sare. Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>
and Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> design'd
only to write Abridgments of our
<hi>English</hi> Story; and therefore they
do not expect that what they have
drawn up, for a View of the Times
before the Conquest, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
as a Complete General Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
even for so far as it reaches.

haste, and affords so slender a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the road, that it looks like
the Tale of a Man in a fright; one
that has been scared with dismal
Apprehensions of meeting with most
monstrous Sprites and Hobgoblins
in the Shades and Night he had
pass'd thorough.</p>
                  <p>Before therefore I can have any
tolerable hopes of seeing a work of
this Grandeur carry'd on with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and to the purpose, I must
hear of its being undertaken by a
Clubb of Men of Parts and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
some whereof are Masters of
our ancient Languages, and others
of the Modern; Some vers'd in the
Writings of the old <hi>Britains, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thoroughly acquainted with the
Historians since the Conquest; some
that know the Geography, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the Law, of the Realm; some
<pb facs="tcp:98722:6"/>
that have been bred at Court, and
others in the Camp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor would
I have this Society to consist of such
as the Bookseller only should assure
me were Persons of these very Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;
but I could wish it might
be an Engagement mutually and
generously enter'd into by Men of
Leisure and Fortune, as additional
Accomplishments, over and above
all that we have mention'd. Or
else, let me hope to see a College of
Historians as Nobly endow'd here,
as that of the Antiquaries is in
<hi>Sweden;</hi> where the President has
a yearly Salary allow'd him of six
hundred Crowns, and each of his
Assessors three hundred. When these
Gentlemen have agreed on, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
their several Tasks, they ought
to be carefully perus'd by every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Member of the Society; as
well as by him whose peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb facs="tcp:98722:7"/>
it shall be to inspect and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervise
the whole.</p>
                  <p>To serve this imaginary Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
I have drawn together the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Papers; which give the
Reader as short and as methodical
an Abstract of a great many larger

I could readily furnish him with.
I know there have been Catalogues
of this kind made heretofore by Men
of better Acquaintance with our

seldom that the Censures and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks

they are push'd on by private Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

points at the mistakes and errors
of every page in our several Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,

For, most of our Printed Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

prevented them. What they left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finish'd
was, in a good measure,
perfected by (that mighty Supporter
of Learning) Dr. <hi>John Fell,</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:98722:9"/>
late excellent Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
who took care to<note n="a" place="bottom">Oxon. 1684.</note> publish some
of the Treatises which they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Press; and had been
at a great charge in procuring others
of 'em, which he did not live to
finish. Of these a more particular
account will be given hereafter, in
their proper places.</p>
                  <p>To repair (as much as was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
the inexpressible loss we had
by the Death of this worthy Prelate,
the like good service to the Publick
was happily undertaken by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
and Learned Dr. <hi>Th.
Gale;</hi> who has kindly obliged us
with Twenty of our old Writers, in
two Volumes. The former of these
(tho' last<note n="b" place="bottom">Oxon. 1691.</note> Printed) contains fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
pieces of our most ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
(as <hi>Gildas, Nennius, As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serius,</hi>
&amp;c.) transcribed out of old
<pb facs="tcp:98722:9"/>
Manuscripts; with the various
Readings, where any variety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
was to be had. To which he
has added a large Appendix of such
fragments of Antiquity as are justly
to be call'd Prime-Primitive, out
of <hi>Ptolemy, Antoninus</hi>'s Itinerary,
the <hi>Notitia Dignitatum,</hi> &amp;c. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some of these he has given us
his own excellent Notes; together
with <hi>Surita</hi>'s upon the Itinerary,
so far as it relates to <hi>Britain.</hi> It
were to be wish'd the Printer had
perform'd his part as well: But the
Doctor's great Distance from the
Press, and the usual negligence of
Correctors, has occasion'd several
<hi>Errata;</hi> which yet will be easily
rectify'd by an Intelligent Reader.
In the<note n="a" place="bottom">Oxon. 1687.</note> second Volume we have
Five Historians of Note; who make
us acquainted with many consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:98722:10"/>
Transactions in the first eight
Reigns after the Conquest. The
Publisher's Design, in this part,
would not allow him to descend any
lower than to the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi>
the First: and therefore, although
<hi>Wikes</hi> and the Annals of <hi>Waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
carry him a little beyond his
Bounds (as ending soon after) yet,
he tells us, he has reserv'd a good
share of <hi>Hemmingford</hi> for the
more regular Prosecution of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
in some other Volume, which
he encourages us to hope for from
him hereafter. To these (as he<note n="a" place="bottom">Praef. ad Vol. I. p. 5, 6.</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves)
there ought indeed to be
added a Third Volume (perhaps, a
Fourth and a Fifth) of our MS.
Historians from <hi>Hen. III.</hi> to <hi>Hen.
VIII.</hi> And that would complete the
Collection which he has, with so
great Pains and Judgment, begun.
<pb facs="tcp:98722:10"/>
For, since Printing came in fashion,
nothing of History has been penn'd,
worth the Common View, which is
not effectually published and easy to
be had; except only some few choice
Papers that are still monopoliz'd by
such private men (of slow thought)
as do believe they wrong themselves
whenever they communicate these
hidden Treasures. In both Volumes
we have most exact and full <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices;</hi>
which exceedingly add to
the value of the Work.</p>
                  <p>The like good Services have been
done to the Ecclesiastical History
of this Kingdom by <hi>H. Wharton,</hi>
who has publish'd<note n="a" place="bottom">Anglia Sacra, Par. I. &amp; II. Lond. 1691.</note> two Volumes
of Writers on that Subject; and
seems to intimate that, some time
or other, we might have hoped for a
Third and Fourth Volume of the
same sort of Collections from him.
<pb facs="tcp:98722:11"/>
Had he improv'd the Opportunities
he once had of fitting out all these
for the Press, before the misfortunes
of his Patron had spoil'd both his
<note n="a" place="bottom">Cùm adversa Clementissimi Patroni fortuna mihi hujusmodi studiorum subsidia, omnium verò praemia, infoelici excusserit: Praef. ad Par. II. p. 30.</note> Design and Prospect, his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Publick would have been
doubled; and perhaps other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
might have been offer'd him of
communicating his elaborate Notes
on the Succession of some of our
Bishops. His other Ornamental
Discourses, which seem to have
robb'd us of a deal of his Time and
Pains, might have been spard. At
least; they would have taken no
harm, if he had kept them within
Doors a little longer; since some of
'em look as if they were sent abroad
too early, and before they were come
to their full growth and perfection.
For instance; That about the two
<pb facs="tcp:98722:11"/>
                     <hi>Aelfrics</hi> (which he values himself
upon, as his<note n="a" place="bottom">Tot tantisque Argumentis firmata, ut non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilè aliis rejicienda fuerit.</note> master-piece) is
founded on a gross mistake in <hi>A.
Wheloc</hi>'s wrong Translating an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">Ad Antiq. 975.</note> Chronicle;
which carries no such sense as he
puts upon it. Some body, I fansy,
had made him sensible of this Error;
and therefore (in his<note n="c" place="bottom">P. 796.</note> 
                     <hi>Addenda</hi>)
he endeavours to gain his point by a
fresh Argument, assuring us that the
<hi>Codex optimus Cottonianus</hi> ends
the Chronicle at the year 975.</p>
                  <p>Had the rest of our Libraries been
as well search'd, as that at <hi>Lambeth</hi>
was by this Gentleman, I should
have been able to have enlarg'd this
Collection to a much greater bulk:
whereas, for want of such Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
some hundreds of Volumes may
possibly escape me. Sir <hi>John Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s

our Publick or Private Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:98722:13"/>
will afford. 'Tis a very Noble
and Generous Vndertaking. Only;
a little more caution (I think)
should be observ'd by him, in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
perusing the Catalogues that
are sent from some of the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Counties: especially, where
the Authority rely'd on, for the
Truth of the Copies, is not very
good and staunch. Otherwise, 'tis
possible the Reader may be sent some
hundreds of Miles to enquire after
a Book that has not appear'd, in
the place referr'd to, at any time
since the Restoration of King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second. This, I am
very sure, is the Case with some of
the Northern Libraries; whose Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues
(as he has Printed them)
were either drawn thirty years ago,
or else are Prophetically calculated
for about thirty years hence. Of
this latter kind is that of a certain
<pb facs="tcp:98722:14"/>
Cathedral Church; which neither
is, nor ever was, furnish'd with
any one single Manuscript of the
several, in all Volumes, which 'tis
there said to contain. I have some
cause to fear that I shall never live
to see such Books, in that Library,
as are there mention'd: and I am
also afraid that most of 'em (if
they have any being at all) are of
that modest complexion which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a private retirement better
than an appearance in publick.
The Doctor's Project is certainly
very commendable; and deserves
encouragement, and the utmost
Assistance that Men of Learning
and Acquaintance with Books can
give it. But then, They that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to put a helping hand to the
Work should be sure to do it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
They should be scrupulously
nice in their Informations; take
<pb facs="tcp:98722:14"/>
nothing upon Trust and Hear-say;
send no Transcripts of ancient (here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore)
Catalogues, instead of such
as give the present State of their
Libraries; view the Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
be sure they are already in
the Classes referr'd to, and not only
in some distant and uncertain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> By these means we
might truly discover the dormant
Riches of the Nation; and the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
might, with good assurance,
apply to such Persons as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
able to Answer their
Hopes.</p>
                  <p>Till these vast Designs are perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
we cannot hope for a full and
exact Index of all those Historians
that have escaped the common De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
in the Dissolution of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys,
and the Outrages of our Civil
Wars. And 'twill be enough for a
Man that lives in such an obscure
<pb facs="tcp:98722:15"/>
corner of the Earth, as my Lot is
fallen into, to point at the Times
wherein the <hi>greatest part</hi> of 'em
flourish'd; how they were qualify'd
for their several Vndertakings; and
how well, or ill, they have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselves in their Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
This I shall endeavour to do
in a Method, which, I hope, the

I have not the vanity to imagine
that I shall ever be able to run
through all these Chapters without
being guilty of a deal of very gross
Mistakes: and therefore I expect
to hear of a large Muster-Roll of
Errors and Defects in my Book.
This I shall so little repine at; that
I do assure Thee (Honest Reader) 'tis
what I heartily long for and desire.
I pretend to little more at present
than the drawing of such Lines as
may be filld up hereafter into a
piece worth the Viewing; and I
shall be abundantly thankful to
have the finishing part done by a
better and more Skilful hand than
my own. I have spent a great deal
of time (perhaps, too much) in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with some of these old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen;
and I cannot but flatter my
self into a belief that I have attain'd
to something of a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb facs="tcp:98722:17"/>
Acquaintance with them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Characters I shall give of
'em are not alwaies mine, but are
sometimes Censures pass'd by better
Judges than my self. Where-ever I
venture to give my own opinion, I
hope, I shall do it with that Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Caution which becomes an
<hi>Englishman;</hi> one that is alwaies
ready to put himself upon a Tryal
by <hi>God and his Countrey,</hi> as not
being conscious of any Offence, either
against Religion or good Manners.
And yet, where there is Manifest
Cause of Complaint; where a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is either scandalously Ignorant or
Impertinent; where we have Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
or Buffoonry trump'd upon us
for good Sterling-History; where a
Bankrupt Plagiary sets up upon the
borrow'd Stock of an Industrious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
or the like; there, I hope, a
moderately keen Resentment will
<pb facs="tcp:98722:17"/>
not be Interpreted as a Breach of
any Commandment, either of the
First or Second Table.</p>
                  <p>I have but one thing more to
Apologize for; and that's the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Repetitions, the Reader will
be apt to observe, of the same Word
and (perhaps) Expression and
Phrase. I have repeated Occasions
to take Notice of this and the other
Man's <hi>Undertaking</hi> and <hi>Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Penning</hi> and <hi>Publishing,</hi> his
several Historical Labours: And
possibly a nice Critick in the Finery
and Cadence of the <hi>English</hi> Tongue
would expect that I should have
Collected a good Number of Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
Sentences for this Purpose.
I can only say, I never intended my
Papers for the View of such Delicate
and Curious Judges of Language
and Oratory. If I had but a Word
in readiness that would serve my
<pb facs="tcp:98722:18"/>
Turn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I never vex'd my Brains in
Pumping for another that could only
do as well: And, being to cloath
so many People of the very same Size
and Shapes, it were too severe (I
think) to force me to provide each
of 'em with a different Habit and
Fashion.</p>

therefore we may safely call him the first

Accounts which we have from <hi>Julius

seem to be so; since the Maps which

these (I think) are all the Remains of
our old Geography, and the Summ of
what was penn'd before the Conquest
that look'd this way. For, with what
confidence soever<note n="a" place="bottom">Pag. 136.</note>

                  <p>From the Conquest,<note place="margin">Since the Conquest.</note> down to the

the loss of most of them. <hi>Gyraldus

<hi>Holland</hi> himself frequently turns Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary,
taking upon him to correct, add

Corruptions have been all noted in a

'tis hoped, effectual care has been
taken to do the great Author all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

Countrymen. Some early Attempts
were made by an envious Person, one

little to be regarded is that scurrillous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective,
which <hi>Fuller</hi> has most unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
inserted into his Church-History:
a Work wherein (if the Author had been
capable of any such thing) a Man would
have expected nothing but what look'd

                  <p>To our late Antiquaries,<note place="margin">

has been the same thing as <hi>Homer</hi> was
of old to the Poets of <hi>Greece.</hi> They
have usually borrow'd or stoln their
whole stock from him. <hi>J. Speed,</hi> 'tis
true, was a Person of extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and Attainments in the Study of
Antiquities; and seems not altogether
unworthy of the Name of <hi>summus &amp; eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus

who was certainly so himself. His Maps
are extremely well; and make a noble
<hi>Apparatus</hi> (as they were design'd) to
his History. But his Descriptions of the
several Counties are mostly short Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts
of what <hi>Camden</hi> had said before
him, saving only that of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which
(he owns, tho' he is not always so civil
to his chief Benefactor) he had from
Sir <hi>Henry Spelman.</hi> I am apt to believe
he was not much in Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s Debt;
since 'tis likely the <hi>Villare Anglicum</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

and said to be compos'd by him and
Mr. <hi>Dodesworth</hi>) was chiefly drawn out
of <hi>Speed</hi>'s Alphabetical Tables on the

said of <hi>Edw. Leigh</hi>'s short Treatise of<note n="a" place="bottom">8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Lond. 1659.</note>
                     <hi>England describ'd,</hi> &amp;c. which is a small

many Mistakes in his Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
but makes more new ones in
their stead. The best things in it are the
Catalogues of the Sheriffs; and the Lists
of the Gentry, as they were return'd
from the several Counties (twelve only

Philosophers, that we wanted two
parts in three of a just Natural History;
which he calls <hi>Expatiatio Naturae &amp; Ars.</hi>
Under the former he ranks all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth

Simple Nature; and, under the other,
her several Modifications (and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

as a piece of great Rarity and good

written also something of the History of

of this County (Geographical and

left in the hands of Sir <hi>Ranulph Crew,</hi>
sometimes Lord Chief Justice of the

was compil'd by <hi>W. Webb</hi> M. A. and

was thought worthy the publishing by

widely different: So that whether he
was <hi>Lux Patriae,</hi> as the former Styles
him, or (in the others plain <hi>English) a

                     <hi>Leicester</hi>'s Historical
Antiquities were also (no doubt) chiefly
intended to do Honour to this County:
For tho' the first Book pretends to treat
of the general Affairs of <hi>Great Britain</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98722:32"/>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> its true Design was to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
(what alone comes to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
in the Second) the Antiquities of
<hi>Cheshire,</hi> and chiefly of <hi>Bucklew</hi> Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
The Contests which hereupon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
'twixt Sir <hi>Peter</hi> and (his Kinsman)
Sir <hi>Thomas Manwaring</hi> are not worth the
remembring, as belonging rather to the
Men of the Law than History. There's
an old MS. History of the Earldom of
<hi>Chester</hi> quoted (out of <hi>Bennet</hi>-Library)
by Mr.<note n="a" place="bottom">Titles of Hon. p. 729.</note> 
                     <hi>Selden;</hi> the summ whereof, I
imagine, has been publish'd by Judge
<hi>Doderidge,</hi> in the History he<note n="b" place="bottom">4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Lond. 1630.</note> wrote
of the Ancient and Modern Estate of
this Earldom, together with that of the
Principality of <hi>Wales</hi> and Dutchy of
<hi>Cornwall.</hi> In this Treatise Sir <hi>John,</hi> with
a great deal of Industry and Exactness,
calculates the ancient and present Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of this Palatinate; but is not so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in clearing up its original History.
This Defect is since very much supply'd
by the Labours of the late<note n="c" place="bottom">See Camd. Brit. N. E. p. 566.</note> Ingenious
Mr. <hi>Harrington;</hi> who has left behind

a good View of the Government of this

and Sheriffs down to the Fortieth year
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp;c. The whole
is Collected out of our best Historians
and most Authentick Records; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
a deal of Industry and Accuracy
in the worthy and honest Author. It
appears he had perus'd the small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
call'd the <hi>City Law</hi> in its Original:
So that there was little occasion for the
Translation and Publishing of that<note n="a" place="bottom">8<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Lond. 1647.</note>

mighty City is wonderfully chang'd since
his time, we are in daily Expectance of
a new Edition of this Book; with very
considerable Additions and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                  <p>A diligent Enquirer into our old <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Records lost.</note>
Antiquities would rather observe
(with Industrious<note n="b" place="bottom">Assert. Arth. Fol. 25. b.</note> 
                     <hi>Leland</hi>) that the
poor <hi>Britains,</hi> being harass'd by those
<hi>Roman</hi> Conquerours with continual Wars,
could neither have leisure nor thought
for the penning of a Regular History:
and that afterwards their Back-Friends,
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> were (for a good while) an
Illiterate Generation; and minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Killing and taking Possession.
So that 'tis a wonder that even so much
remains of the Story of those Times as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98722:54"/>
the sorry Fragment of <hi>Gildas;</hi> who
appears to have written in such a
Consternation, that what he has left us
looks more like the Declamation of an
Orator, hired to expose the miserable
Wretches, than any Historical Account
of their Sufferings. Besides, 'tis not to
be imagin'd but another long and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous
War (with the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi>
afterwards) that demolish'd their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as well as Libraries, would sweep
away even the very Ruines of Religion
and Learning. Some have thought that
there are considerable Reliques of the
<hi>British</hi> History among the Refugees
of <hi>Britany</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and that they have
Manuscripts of much elder Dates than
the Lives of some ancient Saints, which
have been had from thence. We are
sure there are many such Books, of a
very great Age, that still remain in
<hi>Wales;</hi> a good Collection whereof was
lately made by a notable Antiquary,
Mr. <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Kevny braich</hi> in <hi>Denbigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>

he be able to understand the meaning
of what he meets with; and therefore
'tis requisite that our Antiquary furnish
himself with a competent skill in the
<hi>British,</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi> Language. The thing
will be of no great Difficulty, if the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Tongue be so far perish'd, that (as
Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> has<note n="a" place="bottom">In Epist. ad G. <hi>Hickesium,</hi> in fine Gramm. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glo-sax.</note> observ'd) the words in
Dr. <hi>Davies</hi>'s Dictionary are one half <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
a Quarter <hi>English,</hi> and onely another
quarter <hi>Welsh:</hi> But I dare not promise
that this will be found to be a true and
punctual Account. Mr. <hi>Edward Lhwyd</hi>
(who took the pains to examine into the
matter) says, there are about 10000
Words in that Dictionary; whereof 1500
are indeed like the <hi>Latin,</hi> and 200 like
the <hi>English:</hi> So that not a sixth part can
be so much as suspected to be <hi>Latin,</hi>
nor a fortieth <hi>English.</hi> For, tho' the
<hi>Welshmen</hi> grant 1500 words to be <hi>like
the Latin,</hi> yet they will not allow that
their Original is owing to that Language;
since many of 'em are also used (in the
like signification) by other Nations, who
are confess'd to have borrow'd none
from thence. Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> takes
<note n="b" place="bottom">De Angl. Orig. p. 108, 109, &amp;c.</note> notice that <hi>Brutus,</hi> coming from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:98722:55"/>
(which I do as verily believe as that
<hi>Romulus</hi> came from <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Rhes Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>)
must necessarily have had a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
near-a-kin to what was spoken
there; and that hence are so many
words in the <hi>Welsh</hi> which look like the
<hi>Roman,</hi> and not from the Corruption of
it by the Conquering <hi>Romans</hi> afterwards.
<hi>Tacitus</hi> himself<note n="a" place="bottom">In Vit. Agric. Cap. 21.</note> confesses the <hi>Britains</hi>
zealously kept their Language unmix'd:
And Dr. <hi>Davies</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">In Praefat. ad Gram. Brit.</note> says, their old Laws
expresly forbid the <hi>Bards</hi> to introduce
any new words into their Rhimes. Mr.
<hi>Sheringham</hi> further observes that the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
have many words nearly related to
such old <hi>Latin</hi> ones as were grown obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete
even before <hi>Caesar</hi>'s time; and that
many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Proper Names may
be handsomly deriv'd from the <hi>British</hi>
Tongue, which have no Foundation in
the Modern <hi>Latin.</hi> As to that part of
the Language which Dr. <hi>Bernard</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously
tells them they owe (<hi>Dominis
Anglis</hi>) to their Masters, the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Lhwyd</hi> will not allow that they are
so indebted for one Moyety of the 200
words observ'd to agree in Sound and
Signification with the <hi>English;</hi> since a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98722:56"/>
half of 'em are found in the <hi>Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi>

                     <hi>Ivon

went hence to <hi>Armorica</hi> in the Year 384,
whereas the <hi>Saxons</hi> came not in before 450.</p>
                  <p>If then our <hi>English</hi> Antiquary be not
a Native of <hi>Wales,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars.</note> 'tis indispensably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that (to compleat himself in this
Study) he gain a good acquaintance
with the <hi>Welsh</hi> Tongue; which he may
pretty readily do with the Assistance of
such Grammars as have been compos'd
for that purpose. The first of these was

                     <hi>Samuel Britannus,</hi>

                     <hi>English</hi> Families; some

'Twas customary to sing these Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures

And, truly, if the Story of one
of these <hi>Bards</hi> canting the Praises of

a hint to the Monks of <hi>Glassenbury</hi>

                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:98722:58"/>
Amongst these <hi>Bards</hi> is to be reckon'd
their famous <hi>Merlyn;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Merlyn.</note> whose true Name
(says<note n="a" place="bottom">Commentar. Fragm. Fol. 64. b.</note> 
                     <hi>Humph. Lhuid</hi>) is <hi>Merdhyn,</hi>
so called from <hi>Caermarthen [Mariduno</hi>]
where he was born. This was so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a Man in his Time that our Writers
have thought it convenient to split him
into three. The first of these (God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
to the two following) they call
<hi>Merlinus Ambrosius,</hi> or <hi>Merdhyn Emrys;</hi>
who liv'd about the Year 480, and wrote
several Prophetical Odes, turn'd into
<hi>Latin</hi> Prose by <hi>Jeoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
The next is <hi>Merlinus Caledonius,</hi> who
liv'd <hi>A. D.</hi> 570, wrote upon the same
Subject with the former, and had the
same Translator. The third is surnam'd
<hi>Avalonius,</hi> who liv'd under King <hi>Malgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunus</hi>
(they might as well have made
him Secretary to <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi>

affirms that he) was an eminent Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary,
but seems to mix too many
Fables with his true Story. They write
this last indeed <hi>Melchinus, Melkinus</hi> and
<hi>Mewynus,</hi> and make him to live some
time before the latter <hi>Merlyn:</hi> But all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98722:58"/>
this is Stuff; and he's manifestly the
same Man, or nothing. Soon after him
came <hi>Ambrosius Thaliessin;</hi> whom <hi>Bale</hi>
and <hi>Pits</hi> make to live in the days of
King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and to record his Story.
Sir <hi>John Prise</hi>

(according to the Powers given

that were good and usefull, explain'd the
Ambiguous, and abrogated the Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
For, we are to know that (full
fourteen hundred years before <hi>Hoel</hi>'s
Time) the <hi>Britains</hi> had a whole Body of
Muncipal Laws, enacted by King
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98722:61"/>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Bale</hi> (Edit. I.) Cent. I. Cap. 8. &amp; 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Dunwallo Molmutius;</hi> which were
soon afterwards enlarg'd by Queen <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>
All these, says <hi>Bale,</hi> were transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into <hi>Latin</hi> by <hi>Gildas;</hi> and into <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
by King <hi>Aelfred.</hi> Nay, some wise
Writers will needs affirm, that a certain
part of our <hi>English Saxon</hi> Laws, which
they call <hi>Lex Merciorum,</hi> had its Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
from these <hi>Leges Martiae:</hi> and
this childish Fancy has been embrac'd
by several of our<note n="b" place="bottom">Vid. R. Higden. Lib. I. cap. 50. &amp; Hist. Jorn. p. 38.</note> grave and ancient
Historians. Others think it improbable
that so great a Prince as King <hi>Aelfred</hi>
should ever trouble his Head with Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating
any of the Laws either of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutius</hi>
or <hi>Martia;</hi> who were only Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
Legislators among his Enemies,
and Heathens. But (since the <hi>Britains,</hi>
as <hi>Asserius</hi> and others tell us, voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
submitted to him) it seems as wise in
Him to give them their own Laws in his
Language, as 'twas in <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
to grant us the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws in
<hi>French.</hi> Many of 'em (we have already
been told) were abolish'd even by the
<hi>Britains</hi> themselves, after they became
Christians: But Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> thinks
'tis evident from several Law-Terms
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98722:62"/>
(such as<note n="a" place="bottom">Shering. de Orig. Gentis Angl. p. 125, 126.</note>

which are purely <hi>British,</hi> that some of
them were taken into the Body of our
<hi>English</hi> Laws. <hi>Hoel</hi>'s are said to have
been first Translated into <hi>Latin</hi> by (a

                     <hi>Leland</hi> tells us he never (in all his
Travels, throughout the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>England</hi>) could meet with one
<hi>British</hi> Coin, among the many Millions
of those of the <hi>Romans</hi> found in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And the Reason, he says, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(as he proves out of<note n="c" place="bottom">Vid. Histor. <hi>Gilda,</hi> §. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Gildas</hi>)
the <hi>Romans</hi> would not allow any of our
Metal to be stamp'd with any other
Image or Superscription, save only that
of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, that is, some of their own
Emperours. However, we now have
several ancient Coins in our publick and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98722:64"/>
private Libraries, which are generally
reputed to be <hi>British:</hi> tho' 'tis very hard
to determine in what Age of the World
they were minted. My very Learned
and Ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Lwhyd</hi> believes
that, before the coming in of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
they had Gold Coins of their
own; because there have been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found (both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi>)
thick pieces of that Metal, hollow'd on
one side, with variety of unintelligible
Marks and Characters upon them.
These, he is sure, cannot be ascrib'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the <hi>Romans, Saxons</hi> or <hi>Danes;</hi>
and therefore 'tis reasonable we should
conclude them to be <hi>British.</hi> And the
Reason why he thinks they were coin'd
before the <hi>Romans</hi> came, is this: If the
<hi>Britains</hi> had learn'd the Art from them,
they would (tho' never so inartificially)
have endeavour'd to imitate their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Coining; and, in all likelyhood,
have added Letters and the Head of their
Kings. Here's a fair and probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
against the express Testimony of
<hi>Julius Caesar;</hi> who could hardly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on in this part of the Account he
gives of our Isle. <hi>Camden</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Remains p. m. 199.</note> rather
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98722:64"/>
thinks that, after the Arrival of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
the <hi>Britains</hi> first began to imitate
them in their Coining of both Gold and
Copper: But his Stories of <hi>Cunobeline</hi>
and Queen <hi>Brundvica,</hi> are much of a
piece with those of Doctor<note n="a" place="bottom">Nat. Hist. of Oxfordsh. cap. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Plott's
Prasutagus;</hi> all of 'em liable to very
just and (to me) unanswerable Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
For my own part, I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that never any of the <hi>British</hi> Kings
did Coin Money: But that even their
Tribute-Money (like the <hi>Dane-Gelt</hi> and
<hi>Peterpence</hi> afterwards) was the ordinary
Current Coin; which was brought in
(or minted here) by the <hi>Romans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as long as this Island continu'd a
Province. The most (if not all) of the

concern'd for the Credit of this Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

in the Work, than only to translate an
ancient <hi>Welsh</hi> History brought out of
<hi>Britany</hi> in <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Walter Calenius,</hi>
Archdeacon of <hi>Oxford;</hi> who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an eminent Antiquary, and added
a<note n="a" place="bottom">

Translation of the whole he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the care of his Friend <hi>Geoffry;</hi>
who (says<note n="b" place="bottom">Ad An. 1151.</note>

willing to let the matter rest. The
Translator might have employ'd his
time better, yet may be an honest
man: But the Author (whoever he
was) has basely impos'd upon the
World, and was certainly something of
another Nature. The best defence that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98722:66"/>

wherein he fetches the Original of
the <hi>British</hi> Customs, Religion and Laws,
from the <hi>Phoenicians.</hi> This Conceit
(which is all that looks new in his Book)
is wholly borrow'd from <hi>Bochartus;</hi> as
is his long Discourse of the Off-spring of
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> from <hi>Sheringham.</hi> As for
his own part, 'tis visible he equally
understood the <hi>Phoenician, British, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick,
Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Islandic</hi> Languages;
and, if left to himself, could as easily
have brought the <hi>Britains</hi> from <hi>New

both of the Work and its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:
who (by what the<note n="c" place="bottom">Athen. Oxon. Vol. II. p. 879.</note> 
                     <hi>Oxford</hi>
Antiquary has since told us) was every
way unworthy of such a Complement.
Whether his Uncle or himself was the
true Author of what he was pleas'd to
publish under his own Name, is not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98722:69"/>
worth our while to enquire. But, if we
believe Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> that <hi>Aylet</hi> had <hi>never
so much as heard of</hi> John Leland <hi>before
the Year</hi> 1677, he's the most unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and ridiculous Plagiary and Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon
that ever had his Name in the
Title Page of any Book whatever. For
that which he pretends to be his, was
Printed the Year before; and (in the
Preface to it) we are told, that 'twas
<hi>John Leland</hi>'s asserting, that the main
Body of the <hi>Welsh</hi> Language consisted
of <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> words, which
first put the Author upon his search
into the Stories of the <hi>Phoenician</hi> Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.
So that, it's very probable that
good Master <hi>Sammes</hi> never read so much
as the Preface to his Book: Or else,
either he or Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> must be under
the misfortune of a very treacherous
Memory.</p>
                  <p>Something of value might have been<note place="margin">J. Aubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey.</note>

and Collections of that excellent Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary
<hi>John Aubrey</hi> Esquire, Fellow of

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98722:69"/>
Reception. The World is not
come to that Ripeness we hope for, as
duely to relish Works of this Nature:
but how well his have deserv'd a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Encouragement than hitherto they
have met with, is apparent from the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Tasts we have of 'em in the late E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the <hi>Britannia;</hi> especially in
<hi>Wiltshire, Herefordshire</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi>
He would have given us (if we had
been so kind to our selves as to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted

both <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> But we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
his offers; and may possibly too

                  <p>As to the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers,<note place="margin">Roman Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> there are
hardly any that treat of the Affairs of
this Isle any otherwise than occasionally
only, and by the bye. The Design of
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Commentaries is to give the
World an Account of the most glorious
Passages of his own Life; and what he
says of <hi>Britain</hi> (as well as <hi>Germany</hi>) is
apparently what he could pick up from
uncertain Tattle and Hear-say. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

who may all be suppos'd to have had
the perusal of such Memorials as were,
from time to time, sent to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
from their Lieutenants (and other
chief Officers) in this Province. In
the use of these, the Reader ought to take
a deal of Leisure and Caution. For
most of 'em seem to have been loose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested
<hi>Adversaria;</hi> such as had not the
last Examination and Thoughts of their
Authors; and do therefore want the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that should be had to Order and
Time. Besides the several Tracts are
not well ascertain'd to their Genuine and
Proper Writers; the not heeding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

dangerous mistakes. These Defects are
happily supply'd by the famous Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>

Life of <hi>Agricola</hi> (especially as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd

the Students of Antiquities by <hi>Gruterus</hi>
and <hi>Reynesius,</hi> the Inscriptions on Altars
and other Monuments have carry'd a
very high price; and (among others)
the Antiquaries of our own Nation have
fansy'd that our History has had great
Improvements from such as have been
discover'd here. Those that Mr. <hi>Camden</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:98722:71"/>
met with were all preserv'd (as choice
Ornaments) in his <hi>Britannia;</hi> and some
few have been added in the late Edition
of that Work. Many more might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
be had for seeking after: And
'tis no small Unhappiness, that, among
the many Advancements of Learning in
this Age, the Recovery of these precious
Treasures should be so much neglected.
The Persons employ'd in these Searches
ought to be Men of Probity as well as
Knowledge; Religiously scrupulous in
obtruding any thing upon the World,
under the Venerable Name of Antiquity,
which has not an honest Title to that
Character. <hi>Annius</hi> of <hi>Viterbo</hi>'s scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Project of raising the Credit of that
City by some forg'd Inscriptions (which
he had caus'd to be hid in the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Fields, and afterwards discover'd in
a Boasting Triumph) has been justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
and exploded by all true Lovers of
ancient Learning: But the Inclinations
of all Men are so naturally bent upon
doing Honour and Service to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country in their own way (and
the Temptations that we meet with in
these Studies are so many and strong)
that a very great share of Integrity is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98722:71"/>
requisite to the making of a Complete
Antiquary.</p>

(about five hundred years) the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Coin only was current in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And that (whereas all Money for
this part of the World was, for a long
time, coin'd either at <hi>Rome, Lions</hi> or
<hi>Treves) Constantine</hi> the Great erected a
Mint at <hi>London.</hi> Some of his Pieces,
which were there coin'd, I have in my
poor Collection; and they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
in many of the <hi>Musaea</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But, long before his Days, his
Predecessors took occasion to magnify
their Exploits, in this other World of
<hi>Great Britain,</hi> on the Reverse of their
Coins; from whence several good Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
of that part of our History may
be had. What are given us of this kind,
in the <hi>Britannia,</hi> are very valuable: But
their Numbers might be further enlarg'd;

after those we want, because I have not

                  <p>Before a just Sentence could be

any thing of this kind, is not
known; tho it has been lately<note n="f" place="bottom">N. E. Camd. Brit. p. 38.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that, in the beginning of the
Civil Wars, there was such a Grammar
there printed. The first attempt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, that we hear of, was by
Mr. <hi>John Josseline,</hi> Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi>'s
Secretary; who drew up a Specimen,
which is now hardly to be met with.
Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> prefix'd some short Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Rules to his Dictionary: but
Mr. <hi>Junius</hi> did not (as far as I could
ever learn) bend his thoughts that
way. Bishop <hi>Fell</hi> was earnest with
Dr <hi>Marshall</hi> (late Rector of <hi>Lincoln</hi>-College)
to draw up a Grammar; and
he devolv'd the work upon one much
more unfit for the employment, who
had made some Collections to that
purpose. His endeavours were super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seded
by the excellent performance
of Dr. <hi>Hickes,</hi> who has publish'd his
<hi>Institutiones</hi>
                     <note n="g" place="bottom">4to. Oxon. 1689.</note>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98722:74"/>
the Attainments of any that had gone
before him in that Study; and will be
of most necessary use to such as shall
apply themselves to the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the ancient History and
Laws of this Kingdom. But, as all
first Draughts of any sort are usually
Imperfect, so there seem to be some
Defects in this that may be supply'd.
For Example, There wants a Chapter
of the variety of Dialects; which
might have been had out of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Interlineary Versions of the
Gospel mention'd by Doctor<note n="h" place="bottom">Observat. in Vers. Anglo. Sax. p. 491, 492.</note>

One whereof is peremptorily
affirm'd to have belong'd to St. <hi>Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
as the other (in all likelihood)
did to Venerable <hi>Bede.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Grammar is well and
carefully perus'd,<note place="margin">Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</note> the next Enquiry
ought to be after such Dictionaries as
have been written in the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Tongue; whereof we shall meet with
as great plenty as we did in the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish.</hi>
We find, that even in those
<hi>Barbarous Ages,</hi> they had some few
men of Learning, who collected se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Vocabularies, in <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:98722:74"/>
for the use of their School-boys.
Some of these are still remaining, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been carefully pick'd up and
transcrib'd by Mr. <hi>Junius.</hi> The chief
of them are the two that bear the
Name of the learned <hi>Aelfric:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the worse was printed, with his
Grammar, in the end of Mr. <hi>Somner</hi>'s
Dictionary; the better still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Manuscript (notwithstanding
<note n="i" place="bottom">Auct. Hist. Dogm. <hi>Vsserii,</hi> p. 377, 378.</note> Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi>'s Remark to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)

Out of these, and other helps,
the most Industrious of our <hi>English</hi>
Antiquaries have compil'd their <hi>Saxon</hi>
Dictionaries; very serviceable towards
the carrying on of these intricate and
useful Studies. All that I have heard
of in this kind, are: 1. That which
was drawn up by <hi>Laur. Noel,</hi> Dean of
<hi>Litchfield,</hi> in the beginning of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign: whose Original
Manuscript fell into the hands of
Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and is now in <hi>Bodley</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary;
as a fair Copy of it is amongst
<hi>Junius</hi>'s MSS. 2. <hi>John Josseline</hi>'s;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98722:75"/>
said to be in<note n="k" place="bottom">Titles of Hon. p. 82.</note> 
                     <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Library, tho
Dr. <hi>Hickes</hi> does not mention it in his
Catalogue. 3. <hi>Will. Somner</hi>'s; which
was<note n="l" place="bottom">Fol. Oxon. 1659.</note> publish'd at the Earnest Request
and Charges of some of the most
Learned Men in this Kingdom. The
chief Additions he made, to what was
done to his hand by the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Gentlemen, were out of
<hi>Caedmon</hi>'s Paraphrase, and the Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
MS. in the King's Library; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with two old Glossaries in Sir
<hi>John Cotton</hi>'s. 4. That most elaborate
one of <hi>Fr. Junius,</hi> who has infinitely
outdone all that went before him.
His large Glossary or Lexicon of the
five old Northern Languages (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>Saxon</hi> has the preference) may
be seen in the Author's own MS. in
<hi>Bodley</hi>'s Library; and a fair Transcript
of it (in Eleven Volumes, at the charge
of the late pious Bishop <hi>Fell</hi>) in the
<hi>Musaeum Ashmoleanum.</hi> It was design'd
for the Press by that most excellent
Prelate; and may be yet hoped for,
as soon as it shall please God to restore
to us the Blessing of Peace, together
with (one of its certain Consequences)
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98722:75"/>
the Encouragement of Industry and
good Learning. We may likewise
then expect the same Author's <hi>Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicum
Anglicanum,</hi> a work complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
finish'd in two Volumes; which
will be also of singular use to our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Antiquary. After these I can
hardly think it worth the while to
take notice of the Imperfect Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made by Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> in
<hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>English;</hi> nor of two Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
Fragments, of the like kind,
in the Libraries of Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley</hi>
and <hi>Bennet</hi>-College.</p>
                  <p>To these Dictionaries ought to be
added the Glossaries of Sir <hi>Henry Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

This computation (tho not exact)

or more, than we have occasion for
at present. <hi>Camden</hi> here omits their
<hi>Thrimsa;</hi> which Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>

being allow'd to be about three
times the weight of ours, this Summ

there being eighty six thousand and

that we meet with are those that

the first that gave out Charters in

their bare word sufficient to secure
any of their Gifts and Benefactions.
Nay, one of their own<note n="y" place="bottom">Gervas. Dorob ad an. 1181.</note> Monks
acquaints us, that his Brethren were

says, he could rarely observe one
<hi>Saxon</hi> Charter, penn'd in their own
Tongue, to have been counterfeited:
and the reason he assigns, is, because
all the Forgery came in after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
when the hungry <hi>Normans</hi>

their Titles to their Lands and

Now, what was written in the <hi>Saxon</hi>

The first attempt towards so good a

It appears there were some Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<note place="margin">Saxon Chronicle.</note>
who wrote of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Affairs
before Venerable<note n="h" place="bottom">Vid. Bed. Eccl. Hist. lib. 3. cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Bede</hi>'s time;
and I am inclinable to think that a
part of their old Chronicle (which
has had so<note n="i" place="bottom">

                     <hi>much honour</hi> of late

Age. The first Publisher of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

translated it, and caus'd it to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the end of his<note n="k" place="bottom">Fol. Cantab. 1643.</note> 
                     <hi>Saxon Bede.</hi>
He made use only of two Manuscript
Copies; one in <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Library, the
other in that of <hi>Bennet</hi> College:
whereof the former ended with the
year 1001, and the latter with 1070.
<hi>Cotton</hi>'s, he says, had been compar'd
with a Third; which the Collater
(whom he supposes to have been
Mr. <hi>Josseline</hi>) calls the Book of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Gibson</hi> had the advantage
of three Copies more: 1. <hi>Laud:</hi> A
fair one in Vellum, given by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Laud</hi> to the University of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
which corrects those that <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loc</hi>
had seen, and continues the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
down to the year 1154. This, he
fansies, did anciently belong to the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98722:80"/>
Monastery of <hi>Peterburgh;</hi> because it
often largely insists upon the Affairs
of that place. But, if it did so, 'tis
plain it cannot be the same where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Mr. <hi>Wheloc</hi>'s <hi>Cottonian</hi> MS. had
been compar'd, tho its variations
from it are not very considerable,
being mostly in words, and not in
sence. 2. <hi>Cant.</hi> Another Gift of the

at <hi>Oxford.</hi> 'Tis a Paper-tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
of some Copy (now lost) dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering

of all these we have the Text made
up as entire and compleat as 'twas

and proper<note n="n" place="bottom">4to. Oxon. 1672.</note> Translation,
void of all affected Strains, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Mistakes, which used to abound
in Works of this kind. If some few
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98722:81"/>
passages have a little puzzl'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
publisher, let it be consider'd,
that in these, <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi>
and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> (who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
nearer the times wherein they
were penn'd) were much more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
gravell'd. Perhaps, some further
Enlargements and Additions might
yet be made to this Work, out of
such MSS. as came not early enough
to Mr. <hi>Gibson</hi>'s View and Knowledge.
Of this Number I take to be, 1. The
<hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle from <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>

the Martyr, in<note n="o" place="bottom">Tiber. A. 6.</note> Sir <hi>John Cotton</hi>'s

must be different from what was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd

the same<note n="q" place="bottom">Tiber. B. 1.</note> Library, from <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi> down to the Conquest; which
was transcrib'd by <hi>Somner,</hi> and is now
(under the Title of the Chronicle of
<hi>Abingdon</hi>) amongst his MSS. at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
3. A Third, in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Saxon,</hi>

the Hand writing of their Ancestors,

a Love for the Antiquities of their

the Book (as 'tis publisht) continue
his Story to his Death, yet that part
is borrowed from Authors of a later
time; particularly, the Copy of
Verses, by way of Epitaph, is <hi>Henry</hi>
of <hi>Huntingdon</hi>'s. He shows, through
the whole, a great deal of Modesty,
especially in the Account he gives of
his own being call'd to Court, and
his Reception there. He mentions no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Visionary Dialogue 'twixt
King <hi>Aelfred</hi> and St. <hi>Cuthbert;</hi> which
all the rest of our Historians largely
insist on, together with the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects

He is exactly copy'd by <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>

The most elaborate piece in his whole

some good Remarks of his own, and

The Characters themselves were first

that word came to acquire

it appears indeed that the <hi>Danes</hi> were
long in possession of the Kingdom of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> or (at least) a good share of
it: and yet we have not hitherto
met with any Remains of their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Learning, which have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
in that Island. But the thing
is not much to be wonder'd at. As all
Reformations in religious matters are
zealous and warm; so we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe that to have been
wherein these Pagan Nations were first
converted to Christianity. Care was
taken to abolish the very Ruins of
their former Worship; and their first
Apostles, bringing generally their
Commissions from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
thought the Papal Conquest never to
be effectually finish'd till even the
<hi>Italian</hi> Characters and Way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
had been wholly admitted into
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98722:90"/>
practice by their Northern Converts.
Which was the more easily brought
about, by reason of the ill use which
had been some time made of their
<hi>Runic</hi> Letters: For the suggestion was
obvious, that, as long as these were
at hand, it would be difficult to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Men from trying some of their
old Magical Conclusions; and, by
degrees, relapsing into Idolatry and
Paganism.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> (as all other ancient<note place="margin">Runic Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>
People of the World) register'd their
more considerable Transactions upon
Rocks; or on parts of them, hewen
into various Shapes and Figures. On
these they engrav'd such Inscriptions
as were proper for their Heathen<note n="g" place="bottom">Vid. Lit. Run. cap. 1. &amp; 25. Mon. Dan. lib. 5. p. 344, 345, &amp; 438.</note>

most commonly employ'd in these
Services, from the word <hi>Bog</hi> (which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98722:90"/>

sort of Wood) they and all other
Northern Nations have the Name of
<hi>Book.</hi> The poorer sort used Bark;
and the Horns of Rain-Deer and Elks
were often finely polish'd, and shaped
into Books of several Leaves. Many
of their Old Calendars are likewise
upon Bones of Beasts and Fishes: But
the Inscriptions on Tapestry, Bells,

Few of their<note n="h" place="bottom">Mon. Dan. lib. 1. cap. 3, 6, 7.</note> Temples
were cover'd; and the largest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by <hi>Wormius</hi> (at <hi>Kialernes</hi> in
<hi>Island</hi>) was 120 foot in length, and
60 in breadth. Their Altars stood in
a sort of Chappel, or Chancel, in the
end of these Temples; being only
large broad Stones, erected on three
bulky Supporters, on the top of a
Hillock, surrounded with Rows of
lesser Stones. These Altars are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
three of 'em, found together;
being consecrated to their three chief
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98722:91"/>
Deities. They buried their Princes
and great men (as the old <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans</hi> also did) in Hills, rais'd
sometimes to a considerable heighth,
surrounded with one row of Stones
about the bottom, and another near
the top; and, on some pompous oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
having a third row (in a
square) at some distance from the
lower of the two former Coronets.
They likewise anciently burn'd their
dead, and enclos'd their Ashes in Urns,
which were reposited in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
Barrows, together with the
choicest Jewels, Treasure, and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Accoutrements, of the deceas'd.
The places wherein they fought their
Duels were sometimes Squares, lined
out with rows of Stones; sometimes
round Pits, with convenient Posts
(at a due distance) for the By-standers.

of Historical Treatises. With these
he return'd full fraught into <hi>Island;</hi>
where he also drew up an account of
the affairs of his own Country. Many
of his Works are now said to be lost:
But there is still an <hi>Edda,</hi> consisting
of several <hi>Odes</hi> (whence I suspect its

Fables, relating to the ancient State

his Followers, in terms poetical and
adapted to the Service of those that
were employ'd in the composure of

was written by <hi>Snorro Sturlaesonius,</hi>

hundred years after <hi>Saemund;</hi> and
liv'd to be an eminent Lawyer in his

be only an Epitome of the former:

pick'd a deal of good History, and the

the Report comes of an Elder <hi>Edda</hi>

<hi>Saxo</hi> himself says he<note n="x" place="bottom">In Epist. Ded.</note> compil'd a

<note n="y" place="bottom">Proleg. p. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Stephanius</hi>) assures us that he did
not deal fairly in that matter, nor
make such good use of those Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities

                     <note n="z" place="bottom">Antiq. Dan. Serm. 8.</note> quarrels him upon the like

perfection: But what we have is of
as good and valuable a kind as the
fore-mention'd: For, as <hi>Saxo</hi> framed
his History out of the old Rhimes, so he
declares that his is mostly taken from
the Tales and Traditions of old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

that he added many things met with

will easily convince the Reader that
he does really follow <hi>Bede;</hi> for he
Copies him to a word. But I am not
satisfy'd that he has added any great
matters, as far as that Author goes.
He has indeed a great many Lyes out
of <hi>Jeoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> which <hi>Bede</hi>
never heard of; and which the World
might have wanted well enough. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

take notice of one great Truth, that
he writes very<note n="a" place="bottom">Lib. 2.</note> confusedly. All
the Transactions of the Heptarchy he
reduces to the several Reigns of the

Out of this large Mass
many notable Remarks have been
made by the learned Men of this Age:
But, because they chiefly relate to
the doughty Feats and Miracles of
our <hi>English</hi> Saints, as well as his other
Works that more professedly treat
on that Subject, we shall defer the
further consideration of him to<note n="b" place="bottom">Chap. 13.</note>

                     </note>
we shall here place <hi>Matthew</hi> (a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine
Monk) of <hi>Westminster,</hi> who,
they tell us, flourish'd in the year
1377. 'Tis more probable that he
hardly out-liv'd the year 1307. in
which he<note n="c" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>H. Wharton,</hi> Praef. ad Angl. S. c. Par. I. p. 32, 33.</note> ended his History, tho
'twas afterwards (as we shall see anon)
continued by other hands. He was
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98722:113"/>
a choice Collector of the Flowers of
former Historians, from whence, and
from the Title of his Book; he is
usually styl'd <hi>Florilegus.</hi> His chief Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactoris
<hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> whom he so
accurately transcribes, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be perswaded to leave him, even
when he warmly treats of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of his own Monastery of <hi>St. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans.</hi>
Nay, he sometimes refers (in
<hi>Paris</hi>'s very words) to that Author's
<hi>Addilamenta,</hi> as to a Work of his own
composure; and hence some have
concluded that the whole, even that
part which precedes the Conquest,
was borrow'd from the same hand.
But I can hardly agree to that, since
the same heedless way of writing (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
the Accuracy of <hi>M. Paris</hi>)
runs through both of 'em. Hence

there's another historical
Work which bears the Name of <hi>Flores

from the Printed Copy, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98722:114"/>
the Reader ought to know that there
are many anonymous Historians in this
Kingdom, who (beginning at the
year 1307,) manifestly shew that they
chiefly intended to continue the
Work of <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster.</hi> The
most eminent (indeed) of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuators
was <hi>Adam Merimuth,</hi> Canon

Sir <hi>John Froissart</hi> (sometime Canon
<note n="q" place="bottom">See his Hist. Vol. II. cap. 200.</note> and Treasurer of <hi>Chimay</hi> in the
Diocess of <hi>Liege</hi>) justly deserves to
be placed first, as having ended his
Life and Story about the beginning of
it. His Work contains a General Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Affairs of <hi>France, Spain,</hi>
and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as
<hi>England;</hi> tho it chiefly insists on those
of this Nation. The Author was a
<hi>Frenchman</hi> born, but was brought up,
in his Youth, in the Court of our
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; and, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years after, familiarly conversant
in King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's. He
wrote in his own Native Language,
which was also, in his Time, the<note n="r" place="bottom">

Copies that were taken of him in
<hi>French</hi> (as well Manuscript as in<note n="s" place="bottom">Fol. Paris. 31 Vol. 1505.</note>

in Names and Numbers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Author himself, being perfectly
acquainted with the <hi>English</hi> Court
and Customs, could not well mistake.
Most of these Errors are corrected in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98722:116"/>
the <hi>English</hi> Edition, which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by Sir <hi>John Bourchier,</hi> Deputy
of <hi>Calais,</hi> at the Command of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, towards the latter
end of his Reign. His Account of
matters seems to be plain and honest;
and perhaps none gives a better of the
Affairs of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and
(his unfortunate Successor) <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second. <hi>Sleidan</hi> epitomiz'd his
History in<note n="t" place="bottom">Quarto Heydelberg. 1587.</note>

in search after the Manuscript
Historians in the Libraries of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Churches, and was very exact
and Critical in his Collections. Having
spent above Forty Years in these Studies,
he was put upon the Correction and
Publishing of <hi>Reyne Wolf</hi>'s Chronicle by
Archbishop <hi>Whitgift;</hi> and he had fairly
transcrib'd his Work, and made it ready
for the Press, when he died <hi>A. D.</hi> 1605.
He always protested (and we may take
his honest word for it) that he never
was sway'd by Favour or Fear in any of

his Writings; but that he had impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially

the Truth. This good Opinion

to have of him, since even Sir <hi>Francis

he made more haste than he ought to
have done; and that he was forced to

Truth of this honest Acknowledgment

There have been some Additions made
to this Treatise, since the Doctor's death

may have with some Readers) are not
to be laid to his Charge. Others, we

                  <p>THE Historians that have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
mention'd, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Chapter, have usually treated
most Copiously of the Reigns of those
Princes that rul'd in their own Times;
and are to be most especially consulted
in such Transactions as may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to have happen'd within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of their own View and Observation.
Others have confin'd their Pens to the
History of this or the other particular
Monarch; and from them (if not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
under some Prejudices and
Temptations either to Invective or
Panegyrick) we may expect the best
and most comprehensive Account, as
far as their Subject carries them. Of
these I shall give the Reader as full
a List as I can; following the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

to have so few Writers of his Story,
whose Labours have continu'd to this
day: For, 'tis plain, our <hi>English-men</hi>
have been as backward in paying this
Complement to this Memory, as they
were in acknowledging his Title. Among
those that have done it, <hi>William</hi> of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiers
(<hi>Pictaviensis</hi>) is the largest; and,
tho' a Foreigner, and under some seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Obligations to the King's Interests,
has so fairly acquitted himself, as to find
good Credit with the most of our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians.

he is observ'd to have been so well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

his<note n="c" place="bottom">4to Lond. 1663.</note> Treatise of <hi>Gavel-kind.</hi> He guesses
the Author was a Monk of <hi>Battle-Abbey:</hi>

plain the Writer liv'd in the days of
<hi>Henry</hi> the First, and so might be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
inform'd of the Truth of all he

whether he did really draw up a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

the Reader; tho' <hi>Hector Boethius</hi>

whether <hi>Walter Hemmingford</hi>'s Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle

If it be, 'tis not likely that it can escape
the diligent and curious Enquiry of the

encourag'd us to hope for his sending
abroad a great many more of our old
Manuscript Historians. The like Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
I have upon me as to some other

<hi>John Pits</hi>
                     <note n="t" place="bottom">Pag. 654.</note> avers, that, in his time,
such a Treatise was kept (as a choice
Rarity) by the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> in
their publick Library; together with
some Historical Pieces of the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's

related to that City. The victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Atchievements of the <hi>Black Prince,</hi>
falling all within the Compass of his

of its Story: And these were collected,
and<note n="u" place="bottom">

by <hi>Will. Packington,</hi> who was Secretary
and Treasurer to that Hero, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
attended him in the Wars. The
<hi>English</hi> Historian will observe, that in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98722:135"/>
this and many of the following Reigns,
this Kingdom was so constantly engaged
against the United Policies and Forces
both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that 'twill
be convenient for him to consult the
Accounts given by the Writers of those
Nations, as well as our own; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
since the Testimony of an Enemy
(if to the Advantage and Honour of our

other (more unlucky) Adventures of
his Reign, that I have not heard of any
who have thought it worth their while
to write his Life; except only a poor
Knight of <hi>John Pits</hi>'s Creation. That
Author<note n="w" place="bottom">Id. p. 576.</note> says, That one Sir <hi>John
Gower</hi> (a <hi>Yorkshire</hi> Knight, and Cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary

(or, his Continuer, <hi>Howes</hi>) has done
him the Honour to Translate the Elegy
he made on this King's untimely Death,
which (it may be) contains the whole
Chronicle. There's an Ingenious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
lately written and published by
<note n="y" place="bottom">8vo Lond. 1690.</note> Sir <hi>Robert Howard,</hi> which (in the
Title-page) is said to be the <hi>History of
the Reigns of</hi> Edward <hi>and</hi> Richard <hi>the
Second:</hi> But the Author himself seems
to have more rightly named it <hi>Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi>
upon some select Passages in them.
His Design is to give a Prospect of the
Hazard and Madness of a Prince's fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the <hi>Misguiding Meteor of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power:</hi> And, by comparing the
Misadventures of these two unhappy

                     <hi>Glory and Safety Wise and Vertuous
Princes have obtain'd, and what Ruin
the Cruelty and Folly of others have
brought upon Themselves and Subjects.</hi>
This he has done in a Well-penn'd Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98722:136"/>
Essay, which will very much
advantage our <hi>English</hi> Historian, in
giving him a Right Notion of many
(otherwise) dark Occurrences in those
Reigns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's surprizing and

a more proper Subject for a Poet to
Descant upon, than the Melancholick
Reign of his Predecessor: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may the more readily believe
(what the same Author tells us) that
the foremention'd Northern Bard wrote
his Panegyrick. <hi>Pits</hi> also<note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>J. Pits,</hi> p. 598.</note> says,
that <hi>Rob. Mascall,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hereford,</hi>
was employ'd in several Embassies du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Reigns of this King and his
Successor; and that (dying at <hi>Ludlow,</hi>

Sir <hi>John Hayward,</hi> King <hi>James</hi>

who was of his Bed-chamber, and an
Attendant on him in all his Triumphs:
But what the same<note n="d" place="bottom">Id. p. 824.</note> Person writes
of another (Anonymous) Author who
translated <hi>Livy</hi>'s History into <hi>English;</hi>
and also wrote the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Fifth, is such Stuff as is common with
him. The Truth is, His Life was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
at large by one who call'd himself
<hi>Titus Livius;</hi> who, by that name, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
it to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, and
is still quoted by <hi>Stow</hi> and others. We
have, to this day, two good Copies of
his Work; one in Sir <hi>John Cotton</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
the other in that of <hi>Bennet</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.
Out of these, carefully collated,
a third was prepared for the Press by
the<note n="e" place="bottom">See <hi>Wh. Kennet</hi>'s Life of <hi>Somn.</hi> p. 65, 66.</note> worthy Publishers of the <hi>Decem
Scriptores;</hi> which (with several other
Historical Treatises, some whereof have
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98722:137"/>
been printed) was afterwards purchas'd
by that Indefatigable Promoter of all
sorts of Learning, the late Pious Bishop
<hi>Fell.</hi> This Treatise is abundantly quoted
by our General Chroniclers: But no
piece of History relishes so well at the
second hand, as it does when we have
it from its first Author. It were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be wish'd, that the good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late's
Executors would do Him and
Themselves (as well as the Publick) so
much Right as to Print it; together
with the like valuable Manuscripts which
have thus fallen into their hands. What
was done by Sir <hi>George Carew</hi> (Earl of
<hi>Totness</hi>) has been already observ'd to
be remitted into <hi>J. Speed</hi>'s Chronicle;
where the Reader will meet with some
Remarks becoming a Statesman, a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

find that all his strict Piety gain'd so

that there was any great struggling

which was afterwards made at

the Twenty Years of his suppos'd
Reign, as to have setled the House of

Favourers of Justice, and his Cause,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98722:138"/>
have not known what Account to give
of the Times; or how to Form a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
History out of such a vast Heap
of Rubbish and Confusion. Mr. <hi>Hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington</hi>
has given us as fair a Draught
as the thing would bear: At least, he
has Copy'd this King's Picture as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably

the Tower and the Grave (all within

Months) are largely and elegantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the Famous Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi>
Lord Chancellor of <hi>England;</hi> who has
sufficiently shewn how a short and dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tale may be improv'd into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
History, by a Person of good Skill
and Judgment. This Treatise has met
with such a general Acceptance, as that
it not only finds Admission (by whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale)
into all our late Chronicles; but
has also been<note n="h" place="bottom">8vo Lond. 1651.</note> separately printed,
without any other Alteration than a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98722:138"/>
small change of the <hi>English</hi> Orthography,
according to the Usage and Mode of

that it has been rather look'd

Reign as prosperously as it began; and
is justly esteem'd one of the most Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Princes that ever sat on the <hi>English</hi>
Throne. It appears Sir <hi>Thomas Moor</hi>
had once some<note n="p" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Stow</hi>'s Chron. p. 459. col. 1.</note> faint Thoughts of
writing this King's Life, whilst he was
in hand with those of his immediate
Predecessors: But I know not whether
he ever liv'd, or not, to digest them.
Sir <hi>James Ware</hi> has Industriously Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
and<note n="q" place="bottom">In Append. ad Disquisit. de Hiberniâ, 8vo Lond. 1658.</note> Published such Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of this Reign, as relate to the

of the whole has been<note n="r" place="bottom">8vo Lond. 1638.</note> printed
by <hi>Ch. Aleyn.</hi> But this good Work was
the most effectually undertaken and
compleated by the Incomparable<note n="s" place="bottom">Fol. Lond. 1676. &amp; apud <hi>Joh. Speed</hi> in Chron.</note> Sir
<hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> who has bravely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
all those Difficulties, and pass'd
over those Rocks and Shallows, against

He has perfectly put himself into King
<hi>Henry</hi>'s own Garb and Livery, giving
as spritely a View of the Secrets of his
Council, as if himself had been Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in it. No trivial Passages, such
as are below the Notice of a Statesman,
are mix'd with his Sage Remarks: Nor
is any thing of Weight or Moment
slubber'd over with that careless Hast
and Indifferency which is too common
in other Writers. No Allowances are
given to the Author's own Conjecture
or Invention; where a little Pains and
Consideration will serve to set the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in its proper and true Light. No
Impertinent Digressions, nor fanciful
Comments, distract his Readers: But
the whole is written in such a Grave and
Uniform Style, as becomes both the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and the Artificer.</p>

Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cherbury</hi> may be

acquitted himself with the like
Reputation as the Lord Chancellor <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
gain'd by that of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh.
For, in the Politick and Martial Part
this Honourable Author has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
Particular and Exact, from
the best Records that were Extant:
Tho', as to the Ecclesiastical, he seems
to have look'd upon it as a Thing out
of his Province, and an Undertaking
more proper for Men of another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
The <hi>Oxford</hi> Antiquary<note n="z" place="bottom">Athen. Oxon. Vol. II. p. 19.</note>
tells us, That he had seen four thick
Volumes (in <hi>Folio</hi>) of Collections, which

as Materials necessary for the firm ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of so noble a Structure. Out
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98722:141"/>
of these, and other Helps, he (at last)
finish'd his excellent History; the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Manuscript whereof he was pleas'd
to bestow on the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
in whose Archives it still remains. It
has been frequently Printed, and the
several Impressions as greedily bought

Her Establishment of the Reformation,

of her better Subjects have furnish'd
us with more agreeable Accounts of
the chief Passages in her Reign. Sir

But this, as vast an Undertaking as it

Comprehensive one of Sir <hi>Symonds
d'Ewes;</hi> whose Journal of Both Houses,
during her whole Reign, was soon
after given us in<note n="h" place="bottom">Fol. Lond. 1682.</note> Print. Her Wars

of her Fleets at Sea, with their many

                  <p>THE first Part of this
Work having taken
Shelter under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,
this naturally flies to
your Lordship: From whom I
have good Encouragement to
hope for as kind a Protection. I
have great Reason to be fond of
any Opportunity of making my
grateful Resentments of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Favours known to the
World; and I heartily wish this
little Book may be look'd upon
as any part of a suitable Return.
I can honestly boast of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
<pb facs="tcp:98722:151"/>
                     <hi>Approbation</hi> of what I have
already publish'd, and of your
<hi>Encouragement</hi> to proceed: Tho'
(give me leave, My Lord, here
to repeat it) those are Words
which sometimes appears in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications
without any thing of the
caress'd Patrons Knowledge or
Allowance. I dare not presume
to enlarge upon your Bounty and
Goodness to the Author; since
most of the Instances I should give
of 'em are so many Testimonies
of your Lordship's Desire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Directions of your Great
Master, in bestowing your Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
in Secret. May God be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
pleas'd to reward openly
what you have thus done for this
Church and Diocese, as well as for,</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHen I was first perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to publish this <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
Library,</hi> I
easily foresaw some of the many Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
to which such an Adventure
would expose me. I knew the little I
had to say would fall very far short of
being a just Treatise on so copious a
Subject: And I was also sensible that,
even in that little, there was too much
that would give Offence. This was
the general Notion I had of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking;
which was so natural and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
that 'twas impossible I should be
mistaken. I confess, in Particulars,
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:98722:152"/>
my Conjectures have very much fail'd
me. I have been cavill'd at, and
buffeted by a couple of Gentlemen,
whom (above all Mankind) I thought
I had oblig'd. One of these is lately
dead; and therefore my Answers to
his Reflections (which, I think, were
never made very publick) shall be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
with him. The other attacks me
in the Face of the Sun; and what he
objects shall be particularly reply'd to,
as soon as that Author and his Book
are out of the Clouds; Till when, it
will be sufficient to acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that I have here amended whatever
he has truly observ'd to be amiss in me.
If these two Persons had known and
consider's that I have been fifteen Years
(which <hi>Tacitus</hi> justly calls<note n="a" place="bottom">In vit. Agric.</note> 
                     <hi>gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
mortalis aevi spatium)</hi> a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of a Church and Diocese at a very
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:98722:152"/>
great distance from our Universities and
Publick Libraries, they would have
overlook'd a few little Failures; and
have given some grains of Allowance to
a Writer in my Circumstances. Not
that I, who am so insolent as to censure
every body, either do or ought to beg
Quarter of any. No. Let each
Man that's offended chastise me in his
own way; provided his stripes make
me wiser: For 'tis indifferent to me
whether my Informations come wrinkled
or smooth; whether I have 'em in plain
<hi>English,</hi> or in rough (balderdash)
<hi>Latin.</hi> I was as much surpriz'd with
the different and more acceptable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
which my former Book met
with amongst a great many eminently
learned Men; who were pleas'd, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with their kind Remarks on the
Omissions and Mistakes in it, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to request the publishing of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part. 'Tis to their unexpected
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:98722:153"/>
Goodness that I owe a great share of
the following Emendations; which
strongly oblige and encourage me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the Attempt, hoping for the like
Assistance and support from them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
I must also acknowledge my
self extremely indebted to the late accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

which has effectually clear'd a great
many of my Doubts, rectify'd my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
and furnish'd me with a much
better Light than I could have hoped for
from any other hand: So that, if it shall
be the good Fortune of this Work to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in a second (and more entire) E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
it may possibly prove more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable

ever its Author had the Confidence to
think it would.</p>
                  <p>The first Error, that's to be taken
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:98722:153"/>
notice of, is of a very large Extent;
and wherein the Printer and I are joint
Faulters. The Index, 'tis observ'd,
is too scanty: and the repeating of no
less than Twenty Pages (from <hi>p.</hi> 99.
to 108. and again, from 185. to
194. inclusive) causes great Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in some of the References. This
latter Failure is remedy'd in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Additions, by marking the repeated
Pages thus, 99. *, 100, *. &amp;c. and
the Reader is desir'd to correct the first
Index after the same manner.</p>

<hi>saw this Author's entire History; which
ended,</hi> Anno 29 Hen. 1. <hi>He has
made Collections out of it: wherein
(as in some other Passages cited by</hi> R.

found in</hi> Jeoffrey. <hi>Which (consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
withal that</hi> Aelfred <hi>may probably

is one of the most cogent Arguments, as

Dr. <hi>R. Brady</hi>'s Complete<note n="d" place="bottom">Fol. Lond. 1685.</note> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>England;</hi> wherein he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prove (and no Man ever did
it more effectually) that all our adored
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:98722:167"/>
Liberties are deriv'd from the Crown,
and owing to the <hi>Concessions of our
Princes.</hi> He shews that the <hi>Normans</hi>
themselves (weary of the Tenure of
Knight-Service, and other Drudgeries
of the Feudal Law) rais'd all our old
Civil Commotions in <hi>England:</hi> And
that no ancient Rights and Properties of
the Subject were any part of the true
Controversie. He very well illustrates
many dark Passages in our <hi>English-Saxon</hi>
Laws; by comparing them with
those of the old <hi>Germans, Francs,
Lombards,</hi> &amp;c. His Preface to the
<hi>Norman</hi> History largely accounts for
the Customs of that People; and shews
what sort of Government and Laws
they brought with them into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Afterwards we have a good view
of the seven first Reigns after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
His chief Author is <hi>M. Paris,</hi>
well epitomiz'd; and confirm'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd
with authentick Evidence from
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:98722:168"/>
Records, a great many whereof are
printed (at large) in his Appendix.
He has also publish'd an Introduction to
the <hi>English</hi> History; which (treating
chiefly of Matters of Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
shall be consider'd elsewhere. 4.

to forget that Sir <hi>John Froissard</hi> is

Above all; Mr. <hi>Joshua Barnes</hi> has

and (generally) his Authors are as
well chosen as such a Multitude can be
suppos'd to have been. His Inferences
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:98722:171"/>
are not always like a Statesman; and
sometimes his Digressions are tedious. His

as that of the Book, is written: <hi>Ce

Charles Damon Conte du Maine
&amp; de Mortaing, &amp; Gouverneur de
Languedoc.</hi> This was lately in the
Possession of the learned Dr. <hi>Hickes;</hi>
who (finding many Passages in it not
touch'd on by other Writers, and others
differently related) had once Thoughts of
publishing it, with a Translation and
Notes of his own: But, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
acquainted that <hi>Dr. Brady</hi> had
written the Life of this King; and
knowing that nothing could escape the
Diligence of that Historian, he lay
those Thoughts aside. Here (rather
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:98722:172"/>
than it should be wholly forgotten) let
me put the Reader in mind of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
History of our old Civil Wars;
written in <hi>Italian</hi> by Sir <hi>Francis Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ondi</hi>
(of the Bed-Chamber to King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First) and translated into

the little that's<note n="b" place="bottom">Lond. 1599.</note> published should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of that Prince's Life, compiled out of a
<hi>French</hi> Book call'd <hi>Enquerrant</hi> (which,
of all the <hi>French</hi> Chronicles, is said to
treat most copiously of the Wars betwixt
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>) and out of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Livius:</hi> To which Book (says the
Author or Translator in the Prologue) I
<hi>have added divers Sayings of the

that I have read of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of a certain Honourable and

                  <p>These are the chief of those Errors and

by others, or hitherto observ'd by my self,
in the former part. There are several
others, of lesser Note, which an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Reader will easily correct, without
my Directions: As (particularly) the
frequent References to some following
Chapters, which are here digested in a
different manner than was at first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
They that have any Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the Drudgery of preparing
Books for the Publick View, know
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:98722:175"/>
very well how apt an Undertaking of
this kind is to grow upon the Author's
hand; and how little 'tis we see of our
Work, when we first begin to engage in
it. With these I shall need no Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
and the rest must excuse me, if I
make none. I am now in haste: And
can only stay to tell them that I have
as many Papers that treat on our Law-Books,
Records, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so far as they
are serviceable to History (all which I
once thought to have crowded into a
Chapter or two), as will furnish out a
Third Part; if they and the Bookseller
think it worth their while to call for it.
For the present, I am resolv'd to keep
my self within the Verge of the Church;
and shall only (in this Second Part)
give the Reader the best Account I can
of our Ecclesiastical Historians, in the
following Chapters:

will find themselves much more oblig'd

their Intelligence. 'Twas Happiness

have been so much unacquainted with
Letters, as not to have been able to
transmit their own Story to Posterity.
Some Remains there are of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Times, and the State of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
in them; and our Church has
not wanted Men of Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,

have successfully imploy'd themselves

of <hi>Arimathea</hi> wrote several Epistles
to the Churches of <hi>Great Britain:</hi> And
for the better strengthening of such a
Conjecture, he assures us 'twas usual
for the Primitive Fathers to send such
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98722:178"/>
Letters to those Churches to which
they were some way or other specially
related. He might as well have told
us of some Epistles sent hither by
St. <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul;</hi> since 'tis likely
that one (or both) of those Apostles
were as instrumental in planting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in this Island, as this <hi>Joseph</hi>
himself; and we are also very sure,
that they used to write such Epistles.</p>

wanted somebody, it seems, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct

Letter to Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> desiring
that some Persons in Holy Orders might
be sent hither to Baptize Him and his

this Epistle now extant; and yet I dare
not say the Original is lost. Not to

that his Enquiry was after the Imperial

'tis more than probable that those

was had and enjoy'd above a dozen
Years before the Book was first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.
He begins with a Collection
of whatever Narratives and old Stories
he could meet with about <hi>Simon Zelotes,
Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and others, first
planting Christianity in this Island:
From whence he proceeds to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend
of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> and the whole
Succession of those Archbishops and
Bishops descended from <hi>Jeoffrey</hi> of
<hi>Monmouth</hi>'s <hi>Flamines</hi> and <hi>Archi-Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</hi>
After this, we have the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of three Metropolitical Thrones,

are afterward removed to <hi>Canterbury,
Dole</hi> (in <hi>Britany</hi>) and St. <hi>Davids.</hi> Then

these Reports, the Reader will find a

clearing of many doubts in our <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,

He also gives a particular Account of

this Kingdom, and its Dependencies:
Whereof we are to give some farther
Account anon. For the present, the
Reader is only to be inform'd, That
the excellent Publisher of those Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
has prefix'd to them an Elaborate
and Learn'd Discourse of his own;
touching the first Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel

and the State of the
Churches under them.</p>
                  <p>The next that engaged in these dark
Enquiries,<note place="margin">W. Lloyd</note> was our Learn'd Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Lloyd,</hi> (then Bishop of St. <hi>Asaph,</hi>
now of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfield</hi>) in his
<note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>8vo,</hi> Lond. 1684,</note> Historical Account of Ancient
Church-Government in Great <hi>Britain</hi>
and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Undertaking became
a Bishop of our <hi>English</hi> Church; and
the Performance answered the great
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98722:185"/>
Opinion that Men of Learning have
always had of this worthy Prelate.
His Aim in it was the encountring an
Objection against the Order of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
from the Story of the <hi>Scotch
Culdees:</hi> An Argument put into the
Mouths of our Schismaticks by <hi>Blondel</hi>
and <hi>Selden,</hi> out of the abundant Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they had for our Establishment.
In the answering of the several Cavils
of these Learned Men, the Bishop
thought himself obliged to give a short
History of the first planting of the
<hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Great Britain;</hi> which thwarted
the common Road of their Historians
since the Days of <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> and
bereaf'd them of about Forty of their
first Monarchs. This <hi>shortening of the
Royal Line,</hi> His Majesty's Advocate of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> the late Ingenious and Learn'd
Sir <hi>Geo. Mackenzie,</hi> presently resented
as an Affront little short of what the
Lawyers of that Country call <hi>Lese-Majesty;</hi>
and therefore publish'd<note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>8to.</hi> Lond. 1685.</note> a
<hi>Defence of the Antiquity of the Royal Line
of</hi> Scotland. In this Tract the zealous
Author was so wholly on Fire, that
'twas not safe for the Bishop himself
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98722:185"/>
to approach him: but his incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Friend Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> took the<note n="a" place="bottom">In praefat. ad Orig. Brit.</note>
Pains to confirm, at large, the Bishops
Positions, and to answer the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Objections.
Soon after, the Advocate published a
<note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>8vo.</hi> Lond. 1686.</note> Reply to his new Antagonist, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Title of <hi>The Antiquity of the
Royal Line of</hi> Scotland, <hi>further clear'd,</hi>
&amp;c. I am not now concern'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether these two great Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
or their no less ingenious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer,
had the better in these Debates;
tho' I may perhaps hereafter weigh
some of the Arguments on both sides,
if I live to publish my Notes on the
<hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Historians. For the

                     <hi>Origines Britannicae</hi> have perfected all

is to vindicate the Liberties of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>British</hi> Church, against the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Jurisdiction of the Bishops of
<hi>Rome:</hi> so that it reaches only, from the
first appearance of the Christian Faith
in this Island, to the Conversion of the
<hi>Saxons.</hi> 'Tis penn'd with an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
of Judgment and Purity of Style
peculiar to its great Author; and clears
many doubtful Passages that had
escaped the diligence of the famous
AB. of <hi>Armagh.</hi> He tells us (in the
conclusion of his Preface) that it comes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98722:186"/>
forth as a Specimen of a greater Design;
to clear the most important difficulties
of Ecclesiastical History. He rejects,
for very good Reasons, the <hi>Glastonbury</hi>-Legend
of <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea;</hi> but
confirms the Story of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The History of King <hi>Lucius</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to set free from the Monkish

&amp;c. The <hi>Picts</hi> he thinks (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Camden</hi>'s Opinion) to have
been a People originally distinct from
the ancient <hi>Britains;</hi> and agrees with
<hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> for better Reasons than
ever he knew, that they were some of
the old Maritime Inhabitants of the
<hi>Baltic</hi> Sea. He teaches his Reader how
to judge of the Antiquities and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and
concludes with a very particular and
full Account of the great Revolution
in this Island, upon the coming in of
the <hi>Saxons.</hi> His Preface (as we have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98722:187"/>

no other Reply, than only to tell him;
1. The probable Arguments alledg'd
for St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching Christianity in
this Isle, are not to be overthrown by
less probable ones on the behalf of
St. <hi>Peter:</hi> Nor should the Man that
admits King <hi>Lucius</hi>'s and Pope <hi>Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi>'s
Epistles as genuine, reject the

Life has been the Subject of some learn'd

wrote about the Year 590. but had the

old Priest well skill'd in the ancient

such Volume (but of much greater
Antiquity) at the Request of Abbot
<hi>Aedmar</hi> about the Year 970. whereof
we have an notable Account given

to have written two Books of
the Martyrdom of St. <hi>Alban</hi> and
St. <hi>Amphibalus.</hi> Dr. <hi>Wats</hi> could not
meet with them; and indeed <hi>Pits</hi> is
not very consistent in the Account he
gives of them: For he elsewhere tells
us, That a certain modest Gentleman

(who calls himself<note n="a" place="bottom">In the Conclusion of that translated by <hi>W. Alban<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

liberty of believing or disbelieving, as
his own Reason shall guide him. But,
so far is both <hi>Capgrave</hi> and his Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
from any thing of this bashful
Temper, that they always load a Man's
Faith with more than it well can
carry. For Example; The Story of
St. <hi>Vrsula</hi> and her Eleven thousand
Virgins was thought (in former times)
a sufficiently glorious Army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs:
but Mr. <hi>Caxton</hi> assures us, there
were also Fifteen thousand Men that
suffer'd with them, and so the whole
Company consisted of no less than
26000. This part of the History
was vouch'd to him by the Men of

Person of those Times, that deserves
the Name of an Ecclesiastical Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;
there having not been many of

Learning or Judgment sufficient for
such an Undertaking. The Account
which<note n="b" place="bottom">Ad fin. lib. 5. Hist. Eccles. pag. (See Edit. <hi>Wheloc.</hi>) 492.</note> himself gives of his own
Life, is, That he was born within the

<hi>Saxon</hi> Paraphrase) of the Monastery of
St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Weremouth</hi> and
<hi>Jarrow;</hi> where he was afterwards
Educated: That he was, when Seven
Years old, committed to the care of
Abbot <hi>Benedict:</hi> That he was ordain'd
Deacon (at Nineteen) and Priest (at
Thirty) by St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Beverly:</hi> That
from thenceforth he continued still in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98722:194"/>
the same Monastery to the 59th Year
of his Age. Here he imploy'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in writing Commentaries on the
Scriptures, and distinct Treatises upon
almost every part of Learning; most
of which are still extant. What we are
(at present) concern'd in is his Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
History of this Island, in Five
Books, which have had many<note n="a" place="bottom">8vo. Antverp. 1550. Heidelb. 1587. Colon. 1601. &amp;c.</note> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in <hi>Latin;</hi> the Language
wherein he penn'd them. It's plain
he had seen and perused several Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
of the <hi>English</hi> Kings, before his
own Time: witness that Expression
<note n="b" place="bottom">Lib. 3. cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Vnde cunctis placuit Regum tempora
computantibus,</hi> &amp;c. But he first at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
an Account of their Church-Affairs;
and kept Correspondence in
the other Kingdoms of the Heptarchy,
the better to enable him to give a true
State of Christianity throughout the
whole Nation. He treats indeed most
largely of the Conversion of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
and the progress of Religion
in that Kingdom: but always inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixes
what other Relations he could
borrow from Books, or learn from
such living Testimonies as he believed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98722:195"/>
to be credible. Some have censur'd
his History, as composed with too
great partiality; favouring, on all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and depressing the
<hi>Britains.</hi> Such a Charge is not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
groundless. He must be pardon'd
for stuffing it, here and there, with
thumping Miracles; the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Zeal and Ignorance of his
Age: Especially, since so little Truth
was to be had of the Saints of those
Days, that there was a sort of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of filling up Books of this kind
with such pleasant Legends as the Chat
of the Country, or a good Invention
would afford a Man. It's worth our
observation that none of the Writers
of his own Life have mention'd one
single Miracle wrought by him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
they had enough of Truth to
relate: Not but that we may boldly
reckon him (as a Foreign Minister is
said once to have done) a much better
Saint than many of those <hi>Thaumaturgi</hi>
that we read of in his History. There
was a Paraphrase very early made of it
in the <hi>English Saxon</hi> Tongue, which
has been printed<note n="a" place="bottom">Fol. Cantabr. 1644.</note> together with the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98722:195"/>
Original <hi>Latin</hi> Text: But whether
'twas done by the famous King <hi>Alfred,</hi>

with these words, <hi>Bede</hi> himself begins
with such as are very like them; and
to confound two Writers, if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear

Transgression in my Author. There's

History, who descends below the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;

                  <p>All that look'd like Truth in <hi>Bede</hi>'s

of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>'s<note n="b" place="bottom">Fol. Lond. 1639.</note> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils:
to which were added such other
genuine Remains of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Church,
as that Industrious and truly Religious
Knight could any where meet with.
This good Work was undertaken at
the Entreaty of AB. <hi>Abbot,</hi> and his
Successor <hi>Laud;</hi> and mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
by Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> who had
Thoughts of engaging in it himself.
Many of the Notes are owing to AB.
<hi>Vsher;</hi> who seems to have furnish'd
the Author with more than were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.
He is mightily perplex'd in
some of them, when he comes to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the Times of the Kings and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
mentioned together in the Laws;
and the Difficulties increase upon him,
by his adhereing too stiffly to Bishop
<hi>Goodwin</hi>'s and Sir <hi>H. Savil</hi>'s Authority.
Had he had the compleat <hi>Saxon</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
(especially, with the Advantages
of such accurate <hi>Indices</hi> as are now
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98722:197"/>
publish'd with it) these Mists would
have vanish'd more readily; and he
would have had much fewer Achro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisms
to disturb him. He confesses, he
often follows blind Guides; and is
therefore apprehensive of the danger
he's in of leading his Reader into the
same Ditch with himself. Some Laws,
he acknowledges, were omitted (he
knows not well by what Misfortune)
which were even in his own Possession;
and others were communicated by his
Friends (chiefly, the Learn'd Primate
of <hi>Armagh</hi>) when 'twas too late to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
them in their proper places. His
Translations are mostly <hi>Lambard</hi>'s,
which we have already observed to be
uncorrect. Where those fail'd him,
he made use of <hi>W. L'Isle,</hi> and (some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times)
his Son Sir <hi>John Spelman;</hi> who
seems to have understood our ancient
Language better than his Father. He
had also great Assistances from Mr.
<hi>Stephens,</hi> a Person eminently skill'd in
our English Antiquities; and who, for
his good Services in the Edition of this
very Book, is<note n="a" place="bottom">Hist &amp; Antiq. Oxon. lib. 2. p. 223. Vide etiam ipsius H. Spelm. praefat. ad Lect.</note> said to have had a

by AB. <hi>Laud.</hi> There are several Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
in the very Titles of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
I shall only instance in Two:
1.<note n="a" place="bottom">Pag. 432. &amp; 434.</note> 
                     <hi>Aedgari Regis Anglorum Charta
ae</hi> Oswaldes-Law, <hi>hoc est, de ejiciendis
Clericis Vxoratis &amp; introducendis Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachis.</hi>
'Tis known St. <hi>Oswald</hi> was
Canoniz'd for his inveterate Hatred of
secular and marry'd Clergy; and for
that he help'd to enact severe Laws
against them. But none of these were
ever call'd by the Name of <hi>Oswald</hi>'s
<hi>Law;</hi> which signifies no more than a
certain Hundred of that Name in the
Country of <hi>Worcester,</hi> whereof we have
this account in an old Register of that
Church:<note n="b" place="bottom">Regist. MS. Coenob. Wigorn. in Monast. Angl. Tom 1. p. 120.</note>

So that here's a very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Mistake; and of the same Nature
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98722:198"/>
with that we have already observed
of <hi>Denelage,</hi> &amp;c. in the first part. I
wonder we never had any mention of
the Laws of the <hi>Picts,</hi> as well as those
of the <hi>Danes.</hi> since we read of<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Vsserii</hi> Antiq. p. 350.</note>
                     <hi>Pithland-Law</hi> in <hi>Hector-Boethius,</hi> of the
like signification with the former.
2. The proof that a Learn'd Person

Primitive Ages of <hi>English</hi> Writers call'd
<hi>Vrbs Ambrosii,</hi> is not conclusive: For
the Title, there referr'd to, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s own; his Author
mentioning only <hi>Ambresbyrig,</hi> which
may admit of another signification than
<hi>Vrbs Ambrosii.</hi> It may be as well, and
'twas as anciently, translated, <hi>Mons
Ambrii.</hi> We wait impatiently for a
New Edition of these Councils: And
the worthy Undertaker (if God please
to bless him and us with the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his Health) will amply an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
our Expectations. He will be
able (out of <hi>Junius</hi>'s Collections; a
Manuscript in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>
of <hi>Sunningwel,</hi> &amp;c.) to make large
Additions; and to insert them, appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely
translated, in their proper places.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98722:199"/>
He'll finish the Pains which Mr. <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
long since took<note n="a" place="bottom">Inter MSS. <hi>Somner.</hi> in Bibl. Cantuar.</note> to collate
all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Pieces (already printed)

Prefaces to the whole, subjoin a
convenient Glossary; and (in a

                  <p>When this is done,<note place="margin">Saints.</note> we shall have no
occasion to search any further for the
History of our <hi>English-Saxon</hi> Church:
unless the Lives of the Saints of those
Times (which are very numerous) will
afford us some little Supplies, together
with what the Reader will find consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in other Chapters. I pretend
not to any certain Account of the <hi>Vitae

the one was written by <hi>Aelfric,</hi> and the
other by an Anonymous Author. I
know not but they may be the
same with two small Treatises, amongst

Saints, and was transcrib'd by
him out of two old Copies in the <hi>Cotto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>

which he thought highly valuable;

Lives are describ'd at large in the Old

the printed<note n="d" place="bottom">8vo. Lond. 1663.</note> Legend of St. <hi>Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
with the Antiquities of the
Church of <hi>Durham;</hi> which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
by <hi>B. R.</hi> a Gentleman of the old
<note n="e" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. vol. 1. p. 455.</note> Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Retinue, but writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by one <hi>Robert Hegge,</hi> sometime
Fellow of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> College in
<hi>Oxford.</hi> The latter part of the Title
might have been spar'd, since there's
not much in it that will any way il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate
the Antiquities of that Church:
But the Saint's own History is prettily
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98722:202"/>
composed, in a good orderly Method
and handsome Stile; intermix'd with
great variety of Learning and witty
Reflections. The Publisher did not
do his Author Justice: For, besides the
concealing his Name, he<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. D. <hi>Tho. Marshal.</hi> praefat. ad observat. in Evang. Anglo-Sax. p. 492.</note> omitted
a great many considerable Passages, all
his Quotations, and a Learn'd Preface.
All these Defects have been lately sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
(from the Author's own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script)
by Mr. <hi>Tanner;</hi> who has also
added some curious Notes and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of his own. This Piece he has
had, for some time, ready for the
Press: and (methinks) the Members
of that great Cathedral, which owes
so much to the Memory of this Saint,
should encourage and countenance his
Pains.</p>

Monk of <hi>Ramsey;</hi> who was his
Cotemporary, and whose Treatise is
publish'd in the<note n="b" place="bottom">Maii. Tom. 4. p. 344.</note> 
                     <hi>Antwerp</hi> Collection.
This was afterwards epitomiz'd and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98722:202"/>
beautified with a set of new Miracles,
by<note n="a" place="bottom">Bibl. Cott. <hi>Nero, c.</hi> 7. Vide &amp; E. 8. It. <hi>Cleo, patra,</hi> B. 13.</note>

St. <hi>Elphegus,</hi> to whom 'tis dedicated.
This is also publish'd, with the former.
Out of these two, and some other
Helps, <hi>Osbern</hi> (a very Learn'd Monk,
and Precentor of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> about the
Year 1074.) compos'd a couple of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant

gives us the Life, and in the other the
Posthumous Miracles, of St. <hi>Dunstan.</hi>
The former of these was publish'd by

                  <p>THE Subject of this Chapter is,
in a great measure, dispatch'd
already. The general Historians of
the Kingdom, during this whole Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
were mostly Monks and other
Church-men; who have taken care to
Register our Ecclesiastical Transactions
as accurately as the Civil, and to carry
along with them the Affairs of our
Church and State together. Canon-Law
and Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> were first

Reign, upon the Debates that
arose betwixt the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>
(the Pope's Legate) and the AB. of
<hi>Canterbury:</hi> And these soon introduced
that Exaltation of the Clergy, that
they were necessarily in at every thing;
no Intriegue (either of the Court or
Camp) being to be manag'd without
them. So that 'tis no wonder if, after
that time, our Histories are generally
cramm'd with Disputes and other
Matters of a purely Ecclesiastical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and the main Body of 'em look
like the Annals of Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>

Monk of St. <hi>Eurole</hi>'s [<hi>Vtici</hi>] in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi>

The most of his Thirteen<note n="a" place="bottom">Inter Script. Normann. Fol. Paris. 1619.</note> Books
are spent in Affairs of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his own Native Country: But,
towards the latter end, he has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd
a great many Passages that relate
to us. There are in his Writings two
Faults (and they are great ones) which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98722:208"/>
                     <hi>Lucian</hi> of old condemn'd in History:
For 1. He's immoderate in the Praise
of his Friends; and the Dispraise of his
Enemies; either all Panegyrick, or all
Satyr. Now such Discourses are
rightly observed to be strangely mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
and unnatural Productions:
They want Meeter to become Poems,
and Truth to make them just Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
2. He's too large in his Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of little petit Matters; and, on
the contrary, passes too cursorily over
some things of such weight as would
well endure Reflection and a second
Thought. We are told of one<note n="a" place="bottom">J. Pits, <hi>p.</hi> 248.</note>

State of Christianity in this Isle. The
first of these doughty Champions
was <hi>Nicholas Harpesfield,</hi> sometime
Arch-Deacon of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> but outed
(<hi>A. D.</hi> 1559.) for refusing the Oath
of Supremacy. <hi>John Pits</hi>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98722:211"/>
from it, that AB. <hi>Parker</hi> took him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

him all the assistance he could wish
for, in compiling what he calls his
<note n="a" place="bottom">Fol. Duaci. 1622.</note> Ecclesistaical History of the <hi>British</hi>
Church. In the first Ages he has
lazily follow'd <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Malmesbury;</hi>
transcribing the very Errors of such
Copies as he met with, and not giving
himself leisure to examine the Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herencies
in Chronology; and other
Contradictions, that he delivers for
good and grave History. In after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
he amasses Things together,
out of the Registraries and other Helps
he had at hand, without any sort of
Order or Form: Insomuch, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Reader is plagued with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sheets of tedious Impertinences;
and elsewhere scarce meets with the
bare Names of the Prelates for some
Ages together. Some things are said
to have been expunged out of his Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Manuscript, by the Licenser of
his Book; being mostly particular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of his own, condemning the<note n="b" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. vol. 1. p. 172.</note>

ballanc'd that<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. Somner. Antiq. Cantuar. p. 272.</note> load of Infamy
which he endeavours to lay upon the

was,<note place="margin">R. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> the famous Jesuite,
<hi>Robert Parsons;</hi> who wrote an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the three Conversions of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from Paganism to Christianity, in
as<note n="c" place="bottom">8<hi>vo.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domar. 1603. 1604.</note> many little Volumes. The first
of these he ascribes to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> whom
he very Logically proves to have been
here, because he was not at <hi>Rome</hi>
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> sent his Epistle thither.
His story of King <hi>Lucius</hi>'s change is
<note n="d" place="bottom">

who also (tho' he would have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98722:212"/>
been loath to have own'd any such
thing) had it from the Centuriators.
The whole seems to have been design'd
in answer to Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'dly
opposes, throughout a great part
of his Second and Third Volumes.
He represents that Author, as a Person
very ignorant and very dishonest; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Sense in some of his Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and mistaking it in others.</p>

was not much short of <hi>Parsons</hi> in

Learn'd Member of our Church has
well prov'd how vain and empty are
the brags of our <hi>Romanists;</hi> who are
frequently valuing themselves upon
the great Treasure they have of our
Ancient <hi>English</hi> Records. These, they
say, were carry'd off by Monks and
other Religious People, who were
forc'd to fly in the last Age; and are
now (<hi>in Salva Custodia</hi>) in several Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries
beyond the Seas. 'Tis much,
as he unanswerably argues, that none
of their own Friends should ever reap
any Benefit from these mighty Spoils:
that this same <hi>Alford,</hi> for Example,
should not have the Advantage of one
of those Venerable Instruments to
grace his Book; but be forced to run
on in the beaten Track, and fetch all
his Quotations from such printed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

for him. This is the true state
of his Case. There's nothing in him
that carries a Face of Antiquity, save
only some few Shreds that were pick'd
up at <hi>Lambeth</hi> by <hi>Harpsfield;</hi> who has
furnish'd him and his Brethren with

which should have been brought

by K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, tho' what
is<note n="a" place="bottom">Fol. Rothom. 1668.</note> publish'd reaches no lower than
the Conquest. 'Twas much wondred
(by those that had been acquainted
with this Learned Person in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
before he fled to the <hi>Roman</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion)
how he came to stuff his Book
so full of Legendary Miracles; since
a Man of good substantial Learning,
and that enlargement of Thought
which usually accompanies it, is very
rarely split upon such Rocks. <hi>Yet let
this be said for him</hi> (says honest and
blunt<note n="b" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. p. 388.</note> 
                     <hi>Anthony Wood) that for as
much as he mostly quotes his Authors

                  <p>THE first Man that engaged in
the History of our Reformation
was Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">J. Fox.</note> sometime Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who dy'd at <hi>London</hi>
in the Year 1587. His <hi>Acts and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
were first written in <hi>Latin,</hi> for
the Instruction of Foreigners; and
were so publish'd, during his own
Exile in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
They afterwards grew into two large
<hi>English</hi> Volumes, which have had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<note n="a" place="bottom">Lond. 1583, 1596.</note> Impressions; and have (at
last) been publish'd in<note n="b" place="bottom">Ibid. 1684.</note> three, with
fair Copper-Cuts. In behalf of this
last Edition, the Publishers had well
nigh prevail'd with King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second to revive Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98722:218"/>
Order and AB. <hi>Parker</hi>'s Canon, for
the having a Set of these Volumes in
the Common Halls of every Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
Bishop, Dean, Archdeacon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But that Project fail'd, and came to
nothing: And indeed it would have
look'd a little odly, to have paid such a
respect to the Works of an Author,
<note n="a" place="bottom">Hist. &amp; Antiq. Oxon. lib. 2. p. 195.</note> 
                     <hi>Qui Matri Ecclesiae Anglicanae non
per omnia Amicus deprehenditur, ut pote
qui Puritanis faveret, &amp; Ritibus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae

Design of the Author is to discover the
Corruptions and Cruelties of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi>
Clergy; together with the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Constancy of the Reform'd,
and of the Maintainers of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins
in all Ages of the Church:
which he has done so throughly, that
'tis no wonder to find those of the
Papal Communion very much gall'd
with his Writings. Hence the Jesuite
<hi>Parsons</hi>

Author's residing in <hi>England.</hi> It must
be confess'd that these Volumes (being
large and penn'd in haste) have some
Mistakes in them that are not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembl'd:
But in the main, 'tis an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Character that<note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>G. Burnet,</hi> Praef. ad Hist. Reform. vol. 1.</note> one of the
greatest Historians of our Age gives of
them, That <hi>having compared these Acts
and Monuments with the Records, he had
never been able to discover any Errors or
Prevarications in them, but the utmost
Fidelity and Exactness.</hi> Indeed, where
his Stories are of a more modern Date,
and depend on common Reports, or
such Informations as were sent him
from distant parts of the Kingdom,
the like exactness is not always to be
look'd for; since the Author's hasty
Zeal against the Papists, furnish'd him
with a large Stock of Faith, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to avouch any thing that might
effectually blacken them and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

from him that one <hi>Greenwood</hi> had by
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98722:219"/>
Perjury taken off a Martyr in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, and came afterwards to
a shameful End; the said <hi>Greenwood</hi>
was (it seems) present at the Sermon,
and brought an Action of Scandal
against the Preacher. However the
Judge clear'd him at the Trial; as only
harmlesly quoting an Author, without
any malicious intent, of slandering his
Neighbour. Such Slips as these were
pretty numerous in some of the first
Editions: But as many of them as
came to the Author's knowledge were
rectified by himself; and others have
been corrected since his Death.</p>
                  <p>Several Papists were provok'd to
write Counterparts to these Volumes;<note place="margin">Popish Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note>
wherein they pretended to set forth
the Reformers in as bloody a Dress, as
<hi>Fox</hi> had painted <hi>Them;</hi> and to draw
up as large Kalendars of their own
Martyrs. The chief of these were,
1. <hi>Maurice Chancey</hi> (by some call'd

(as we have it from his Nephew<note n="c" place="bottom">Pag. 775.</note>
                     <hi>Pits</hi>) is this: He was born in <hi>Surrey,</hi>

in <hi>Oxford;</hi> where he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<hi>Regius Professor</hi> of the Canon-Law.
He afterwards fled to <hi>Rome:</hi>

the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as also into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98722:220"/>
Russia,</hi> &amp;c. At last Pope <hi>Gregory</hi>
the 13th sent him, as his Nuncio, into
<hi>Ireland;</hi> where he dy'd about the
Year 1580. He was an indefatigable
Writer, as well as Warrior, for the

that he thought might advance it.

This Libellous Invective was mainly
design'd for a Calumny upon Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in her Birth and Parentage.
It was not in her Reign allow'd to be
answer'd: because such an impudent
Slander ('twas thought) would soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
fall to nothing, if slighted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.
But this allowance, of its
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98722:221"/>
walking abroad without controul, has
embolden'd some in our Days to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
its Authority; and to quote it as

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> As much of these as falls
under our present Consideration has
been amply reply'd to by Sir <hi>Roger

                        <hi>4to.</hi> Lond. 1675.</note> 
                     <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical

separated from the</hi> Roman, <hi>and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi>
1 Eliz. Wherein he shews,
1. How the Papal Usurpations grew
upon us; and what immense Sums they
extorted from the <hi>English</hi> Clergy.
2. That our Kings were always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
to be invested with a Plenary
Power <hi>in sacris;</hi> as much as is at this
Day acknowledg'd by our Laws.
3. That the Procedure of our Princes,
in this Separation from the <hi>Roman</hi> See,
was agreeable to that Power; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the legal and primitive
Constitution of our Government.
These Particulars he proves at large, by
the irrefragable Authorities of a vast
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98722:222"/>
number of our old Histories and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords;
wherein no Man was ever bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vers'd than this truly Learned and
Religious Baronet.</p>
                  <p>Tho' Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>

                     <hi>speaks</hi>

already finish'd,<note place="margin">H. Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> and ready for the

We have seen in what an imperfect

some assistance given, in the

(who<note n="b" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Car. Spelm.</hi> Praef. ad Tom. 2.</note> he says, not only
Corrected the Press, but brought in a

of any such Provision like to be made

the Gentleman takes no notice of his
chief Benefactor in that Matter; who
was (as has been already observ'd)
Sir <hi>Will. Dugdale;</hi> and who seems to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98722:222"/>
have had a Resolution to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
the whole Work. Amongst
his MSS. at <hi>Oxford,</hi> there's one Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume

                     <hi>Thomas Fuller</hi>'s<note n="b" place="bottom">Fol Lond. 1655.</note> Church-History
must have the next Place: for,<note place="margin">T. Fuller.</note> tho' he
begins higher, and goes lower than
the strict limits of this Chapter would
require, his chief business falls within
the Times we are speaking of. It starts
with the first planting of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in this Island; and ends with the
Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First. 'Tis
divided into Eleven Books; whereof
the Sixth gives the History of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
of <hi>England;</hi> from the first rise of
Monkery, to the final Eradication of
it under <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. These are
subdivided into lesser Sections; which
are severally dedicated to such Patrons
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98722:223"/>
as were most likely to make their due
acknowledgments to the Author. Nor
were these Infant Lords and Rich Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
the only People he design'd to
flatter. He was to make his Court to
the Powers then in fashion; and, he
well knew, nothing would be more
grateful to them than squinting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on the Management of the
Late King's chief Ministers of State,
Eminent Church-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For such
mis-behaviour as this he was severely
taken to task by <hi>Peter Heylin,</hi> in his
<note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>8vo.</hi> Lond. 1658.</note> 
                     <hi>Examen Historicum:</hi> to which was
added Dr. <hi>Cosin</hi>'s Apology in Answer
to some Passages in that History,
which concern'd himself. We have
formerly observ'd that his <hi>Worthies</hi>
were sent abroad to Apologize for the
mistakes in his Church-History; and
we have here an ample instance of the
Truth of that Remark. Upon the
King's Restauration, Dr. <hi>Cosin</hi> was
deservedly advanc'd to the See of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
and 'twas then high time to
harp upon another string, and to turn
his Eloquence another way. The late
wavering Doctor, is now the very
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98722:223"/>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">

Learning,</hi> &amp;c. But to what purpose
should we insist upon Particulars?
Through the whole he is so full of
his own Wit that he does not seem to
have minded what he was about. The
Gravity of an Historian (much more
an Ecclesiastical one) requires a far
greater care, both of the Matter and
Style of His Work, than is here to
be met with. If a pretty Story comes
in his way, that affords scope for Clinch
and Droll, off it goes with all the gayety
of the Stage; without staying to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
whether it have any Foundation
in Truth, or not; and even the most
serious and most authentic Parts of it
are so interlac'd with Punn and Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that it looks as if the Man had
design'd to ridicule the Annals of our
Church into Fable and Romance. Yet,
if it were possible to refine it well, the
Work would be of good use: since
there are in it some things of Moment,
hardly to be had elsewhere; which
may often illustrate dark Passages in
more serious Writers. These are not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98722:224"/>
to be despised, where his Authorities

                  <p>The first that attempted a formal Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of our Reformation was Dr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

wherein he pretends to give a
punctual account of the rise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of that great Work. But the
first <hi>Agitations in Religion</hi> (as he calls
them) are very slenderly touch'd; his
Story beginning at the Year 1537.
What he chiefly design'd by it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well apprehend; unless 'twas to
shew K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second the Errors
and Mistakes of our first Reformers,
and to direct him how to settle the
Church on a better Foundation: For
he falls foul on all the Princes of those
Times, without any regard to their
good or ill Wishes to the Protestant
Interest. He represents K. <hi>Edward</hi>
the Sixth as one of ill Principles, and
Soft; and Censures his Mother's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98722:224"/>
with a more than ordinary
Freedom. He intimates as if the
<hi>Zwinglian Gospellers</hi> would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd
all before them, had that Prince
Liv'd; and observes they were far
too rife in the beginning of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>'s
Reformation, when many
were rais'd to great Preferments, who
were too much inclin'd to the <hi>Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of Geneva.</hi> On the other hand;
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Bloodiness is no where
set off in so lively a Paint as where
he tells us,<note n="a" place="bottom">Pag. 139.</note> 
                     <hi>She admitted of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation

<note n="b" place="bottom">Le Moyne. Dissert. 4. cap. 3.</note> Critick gives his Historian,
That he should have a <hi>Regard to his

have Govern'd his native Country.</hi> As
this should restrain a Man from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Failures of such Governours
in their own Persons; so it ought to
caution him against making too
free with the Frailties of their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Councellors. He concludes
with the Act of Establishing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98722:225"/>
of the Church by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops

                        <hi>G. Burnet,</hi> Praef. ad Hist. Reform. Tom. 1.</note> who should
be best acquainted with it: <hi>He wrote</hi>
(says he) <hi>Smoothly and Handsomly; His
Method and Style are good; and his
Work was generally more read, than any
thing that had appear'd before him. But
either he was very ill inform'd, or very
much led by his Passions; and, being
wrought on by some Violent Prejudices
against some that were concern'd in that
Time, he delivers many things in such a
manner, and so strangely, that one would
think he had been secretly set on to it, by
those of the Church of</hi> Rome. <hi>Tho' I
doubt not but he was a sincere Protestant;
but violently carri'd away by some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Conceits. In one thing, he is
not to be excused, That he never vouch'd
any Authority for what he wrote: which
is not to be forgiven any who write of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98722:225"/>
Transactions beyond their own Time, and
deliver new things not known before.</hi>
[The most of his Materials (I guess)
were had from the Transcript which

1679. by Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi>'s Order,
and Dedicated to K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.
In the Months of <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi>
(in the Year following, 1680.)
The Historian had the Thanks of both
Houses of Parliament for what he had
already done; and was desired to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the finishing of the whole
Work: which was done accordingly.
This History gives a punctual Account
of all the Affairs of the Reformation;
from it's first beginnings in the Reign
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, till it was finally
compleated and setled by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
A. D. 1559. And the whole is
penn'd in such a Masculine Style, as
becomes an Historian, and such as is
this Author's Property in all his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
The Collection of Records,
which he gives in the conclusion of
each Volume, are good Vouchers of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98722:226"/>
the Truth of all he delivers (as such)
in the Body of his History: and are much
more perfect than could reasonably be
expected, after the Pains taken, in Q.
<hi>Maries</hi> days, to suppress every thing
that carry'd the Marks of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
upon it. The Work has had
so much Justice done it, as to meet
with a general Acceptance abroad, and
to be translated into most of the <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi>
Languages: insomuch that even
the most Picquant of the Author's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
allow it to have a<note n="a" place="bottom">

firmly and deservedly establish'd.</hi> Indeed,
some of the <hi>French</hi> Writers have ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill'd
at it: But the most eminent of
them (Mr. <hi>Varillas</hi> and Mr. <hi>Le Grand</hi>)

Communion, laying out their best
endeavours to raise themselves a Name
by so glorious a Service to their Church,
as the disparagement of this Writer
(and the disgracing his History) might
justly have been reckon'd: But 'twas
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98722:227"/>
a little unaccountable that the same
Rancour should possess Men within
the Pale of our Reform'd <hi>English</hi>
Church; and such as desired to be
looked upon as Zealous maintainers of
Her Honour, and the Justice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
of her Reformation. The first of
these was<note n="a" place="bottom">Of the Subject of Church power, <hi>8vo.</hi> Lond. 1685.</note> S. <hi>Lowth;</hi> who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only to batter the <hi>Erastian</hi> Tenets
in Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s <hi>Leviathan:</hi> But took
occasion, in the conclusion of his Book,
to Censure the Account Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>
had given of some of Arch-bishop
<hi>Cranmer</hi>'s singular Opinions. This
Gentleman had the confidence to assert,
That both our Historian and Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>
had impos'd upon the World
in that Particular; and had <hi>unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
joyn'd together</hi> in their endeavours
to lessen Episcopal Ordination. I am
not now concern'd with his Charge
against Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> who did him
the Honour, which he ought not to
have hoped for, to expose his Folly in
a short Letter to the Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>

certainly, these two Authors have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
differ'd. And yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the awkardness of Mr. <hi>Lowth</hi>'s
Stile, 'tis thought the Man himself
was not Master of so much Venome
and Ill-Nature, as appears in his Book:
But that he had a great share of his
spiteful Language put into his Mouth
by a warm Neighbour; who is now
dead, and ought to be forgotten. The
next Assailant was a peevish Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in Masquerade; who, under the
feign'd Name of <hi>Anthony Harmer,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
a<note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>8vo.</hi> Lond. 1693.</note> 
                     <hi>Specimen of some Errors and
Defects in the History of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp;c. As if what he there gives
were only a Sample of what he had
in store for us: when it appears that
he has stoop'd to such mean and pitiful
Remarks, as sufficiently shew that he
had pump'd himself to the bottom,
and that his Malice was upon the Lees.
'Tis a great Indignity which some have
put upon the Memory of a late most
Reverend, Learn'd and Pious, Prelate;
in reporting him to have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that malicious Libel: For,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98722:228"/>
whatever other unhappy Mistakes he
might be guilty of, he could never fall
so low as to write at such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
and uncharitable Rate. The
Historian vouchsaf'd this Book a
short Answer, in a<note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>4to.</hi> Lond. 1694.</note> Letter to the
Bishop of <hi>Litchfield;</hi> to which the
Animadverter made no Reply. To
those that are still inclin'd to favour
the <hi>Specimen,</hi> I shall only say that the
whole 150 Particulars, therein summ'd
up, will fall under these six Heads; as
being either, 1. Such aery and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Matters as we usually call Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies.
2. Some inconsiderable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
of the Printer's or Copiers.
3. Others that have a little Weight;
but might have been corrected without
Noise; and do not affect the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
4. Some few (a very few) that
do touch upon its Justice and Honour:
In most of which 'tis easie to discern
the Affection which the Animadverter
pretends to bear it, if Apologies for
the old Monks and <hi>N. Sanders</hi> be any
Argument of such Affection. 5.
Others wherein he himself is mistaken.
6. Several Objections are raised purely
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98722:228"/>
for the sake of Calumny and Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
These are the Thoughts I had
of this Piece, upon my first perusal of
it; and I am throughly confirm'd in
them from the successful Pains that has
been since taken with it by my modest
and industrious Friend. Something of
a fresh Attaque was afterwards made
by<note n="a" place="bottom">Discourses on Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>4to.</hi> Lond. 1695.</note> one, who had set himself to
discredit, whatever had been publish'd
by this Historian: And yet all that
even such a Writer could find charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
on his History of the Reformation,
was only, that<note n="b" place="bottom">See the Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s Vindication, <hi>8vo.</hi> Lond. 1696. p. 83, 87.</note> 
                     <hi>In a Matter of no
great Consequence there was too little Care
had in Copying or Examining a Letter
writ in a very bad Hand;</hi> and that there
was since probability that Dr. <hi>Burnet
was mistaken in one of his Conjectures.</hi>
I think I may justly observe thus much
of all those that have hitherto endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to lessen the Repute of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
That they have apparently
shewn their Inclinations rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatter
the Author than his Work:
And, whatever Success such Persons
may meet with in their Attempts, they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98722:229"/>
have commonly the Misfortune to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
themselves to be (at least) <hi>Men
of like Passions</hi> with their Adversary.</p>
                  <p>The Reverend Author of these Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
publish'd also an<note n="a" place="bottom">

of them;<note place="margin">Burnet<hi>'s</hi> Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> wherein the Reader
has a full and clear View of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
without any of those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities
or Defects that usually attend
Works of this kind. Take an Account
of it in his own Words: <hi>I have wholly
wav'd every thing that belong'd to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
and the proof of what I relate; or
to the Confutation of the Falshoods that
run through the Popish Historians. All
that is to be found in the History at large.
And therefore in this Abridgment, every
thing is to be taken upon Trust; and those
that desire a fuller Satisfaction, are to seek
it in the Volumes I have already published.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">J. Strype.</note> shall conclude this
Chapter; tho' (were it not that the
Subject rather than the Title of the
Book inclines me to bring them in here)
they would more properly belong to
another Place. The Writer of them
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98722:229"/>
has adhered to Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Method;
giving us his own Historical Account
in Three Books (ending with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Deaths of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>)
and in the Conclusion, a good Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Records. Several Things,
relating to the State of the Church
during that Primacy, are well Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by him; and some Authentick
Letters, and other Original Papers of
Value, are discover'd and made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
The only Blemish I know in
this Book is (what, it may be, the
Author will think its most comely Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
the crowding so much of his
other Learning into the Body of his
History; which, instead of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Readers answerably to his good
Design, is apt to distract and amuse
them. Where the Subject is dry and
barren, a few choice Flowers out of a
right Common-place-book, are very
refreshing; provided they are sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with a sparing Hand, and a steady
Judgment. But, where the Matter it
self is pleasant and diverting, all those
Embellishments are nauseous; and
even <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> themselves are
troublesome.</p>

most of his Works were in the

I know not: But, upon a<note n="d" place="bottom">Praefat. ad Angl. Sac. vol. 1. p. 14.</note>
late Search, nothing could be found
that bore this Author's Name; save
only a pitiful Treatise (at <hi>Lambeth)

reading. I fancy somebody's quoting
this under the Title <hi>de Pontificibus</hi>

fortunate in his Commentary, as he
calls it, on this Subject; being himself
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98722:232"/>
advanced to the Episcopal Order<note n="a" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. vol. 1. p. 497.</note>
for the good Services that (as Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> thought) he had done the
Church by that Book. It was twice
published in<note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>4to.</hi> Lond. 1601, 1615.</note> 
                     <hi>English;</hi> equally full
of the Authors and Printer's Mistakes.
The Faults of the latter Edition (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially)
were so very gross, that they
put him upon the speedy dispatch of
another in <hi>Latine;</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="bottom">Comment. de Praesul. <hi>4to.</hi> Lond. 1616.</note> which came out
the next Year. The Style of this is
very neat and clean; and he seems to
have taken more Pains in polishing it,
than in gathering together all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
of his History. He quotes no
Authorities; excepting (belike) that
Posterity should acquiesce in his singly,
without enquiring any further. He is
particularly ungrateful to the Author
of the <hi>Antiquitates Britannicae;</hi> from
whom he has borrow'd (by the Great)
his Account of the See of <hi>Canterbury;</hi>
varying only the Phrase, and that
sometimes for the worse. The like
Carriage he is guilty of towards <hi>Bale,
Camden,</hi> and others: But what is most
especially notorious, is his transcribing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98722:232"/>
out of <hi>Josseline</hi> and <hi>Mason,</hi> what he
pretends to have had immediately from
the Archives and Registraries, from
the Year 1559, to his own Time. He
is also frequently guilty of Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Mistakes; a too confident Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on the Authorities of counterfeit
Charters in <hi>Ingulfus</hi> and others; an
uncertain Calculation of Years, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
some at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and others at
<hi>Christmas,</hi> &amp;c. as his Authors blindly
led him: and lastly, a contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with false and imperfect Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues
of the Prelates in almost every
Diocess. These are the Failures where
with he stands charg'd by<note n="a" place="bottom">Praefat. ad Angl. Sac. vol. 1. p. 17.</note> Mr.
<hi>Wharton;</hi> who modestly assures us
that a better Progress had been made
in these Matters by himself, within
the compass of Eighteen Months, than
by this Bishop in Twenty Years.

                     <note n="b" place="bottom">4th. Oxon. vol. 1. p. 496.</note> Antiquary further
complains, that he <hi>Puritanically</hi> vilified
Popish Bishops; with a Design there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to advance the Credit of those since
the Reformation: whereby he had
given unlucky Advantages to <hi>William
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98722:233"/>
Prynne</hi> (the profess'd Enemy of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy)
who made ill use of his Book.
I will not say that either of these Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
are mistaken: but I must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to the Reader, that each of them
intended to have furnish'd us with a
View of this part of our Ecclesiastical
History, of his own drawing; and
therefore, like all new Builders, they
must be allow'd to spy more Faults in
the old Fabrick, than others can.
The former has help'd us to a noble
Stock of old Writers upon the Affairs
of a great many of our Sees, from
their Foundation, in his <hi>Anglia Sacra:</hi>
and the latter has given us almost an
entire History of our Bishops, for the
two last Centuries, in his <hi>Athenae Oxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienses.</hi>
These are good Materials;
and such as will direct to more of the
same kind; whereof there are good
store in the <hi>Bodleian</hi> and <hi>Cottonian</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries.
We long only for a skilful
Architect, to put them into the Figure
we desire. And (I hear) the Work is
at last put into the Hands of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who wants none of those Helps
or Qualifications that are necessary to
the Undertaking.</p>

Hitherto we have mention'd only
such as have written the History of
our Prelacy with an honest Intent,<note place="margin">Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etives.</note>
to represent it to the World in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and true Colours: we have others
that have made it their Business to daub
it with false Paint, endeavouring to
give such Pourtraictures of our Bishops,
as might most effectually defame and
prostitute the sacred Order. The first
of these was one <hi>Thomas Gibson,</hi> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical
Physitian in the beginning of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign; who entitl'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
of his Treatises <hi>A History of the
Treasons of the Bishops since the Norman
Conquest.</hi> Whether this was ever
Printed my<note n="a" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. vol. 1. p. 109.</note> Author cannot inform
me. The next was Sir <hi>John Harring
ton</hi> of <hi>Kelweston;</hi> who, soon after
K. <hi>James</hi> the First's arrival in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
began to draw together some
malicious Remarks upon the Bishops
of his Time; which he at last finish'd
under the Title of<note n="b" place="bottom">

the state of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as it
stood in Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s and King</hi>
Jame<hi>'s Reign, to the Year</hi> 1608. It
was presented by the Author, in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98722:234"/>
to Prince <hi>Henry;</hi> from whom
the Presbyterian Faction expected great
Alterations in Church-Government.
After the downfal of Episcopacy, it
fell into such Hands as brought it to
the Press; believing it to be a proper
Antidote against the return of the
plaguy Hierarchis. The last of this
Gang was (that eternal Scribler) <hi>Will.
Prynne;</hi> who rak'd together all the
Dirt that had been thrown at any
of our Bishops, by the most invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and implacable of all their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and hap'd it into a large
Dunghil-Book inscrib'd<note n="a" place="bottom">

wish the Reader himself to consult
his very useful Book, saving only,
that some of those Authors he barely
quotes (where I am able to do it) shall
be set in the truest Light I can give
them. Let it be here also noted, that
when ever he refers his Readers (as
he does in this place) to one or the
other Volume of <hi>Anglia Sacra,</hi> they
are there sure to meet with a good
view of such old Writers as have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the ancient History of this or that
Diocess; or else they have (at least)
a composure of Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi>'s, very
valuable for the Pains that Author
took in adjusting the true Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
succession of our Bishops. Dr.
<hi>Thomas Chandler</hi> (sometime<note n="b" place="bottom">Hist. et Antiq. Oxon. par. 2. pag. 134.</note> Warden
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98722:235"/>
of <hi>New College</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour

<hi>de Laudibus</hi> Bathoniae <hi>&amp;</hi> Welliae;
which, I suppose would afford us some
such Light as the same learn'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
has given in those Lives, that have
been gratefully penn'd by him, and
will be taken notice of in another
place. I guess the <hi>Historia de tempore

Antiquities of any Diocess in <hi>England.</hi>
The first of these was Arch-bishop
<hi>Deusdedit,</hi> or <hi>Adeodatus;</hi> who is<note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>J. Pits,</hi> p. 109.</note>
said to have recorded the Acts of all his
Predecessors; which was no mighty
Undertaking, since himself was only
the Sixth from <hi>Augustine.</hi> The eldest
of those Writers, whose Works are
now Extant, is <hi>Gotseline</hi> the Monk;
who (besides the Life of <hi>Augustine,</hi>
publish'd by Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi>) wrote also
those of the Six following Arch-bishops.
These are now in MS. in<note n="b" place="bottom">

of a few <hi>Romantic</hi> Miracles)
they have not hitherto been thought
worth the Printing. About the same
time <hi>Osbern</hi> was Precentor of Christ-Church;
and (upon the<note n="c" place="bottom">Vid. Praefat. ad Ang. Sac. vol. 2 p. 9.</note> unhappy
Fire, which destroy'd most of their

Records, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1070.) took a deal of
Pains in recovering the Histories of the
Arch-bishops; several of whose Lives
were written by him, besides those
we have in Print. <hi>Gervasius Dorober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis</hi>
(that is, Monk of <hi>Canterbury</hi>)
has left three good Treatises on this

And 'twould not have been any great

<note n="b" place="bottom">Angl. Sac. vol. 2. p. 677.</note> very short, and mostly stuff'd with

he that runs on his Errand, will find
himself mistaken. There are, indeed,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98722:237"/>
in that Library some Collections out
of the last mention'd Author's Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Work with the Title of <hi>Annales Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phani

that Subject, and so imposes upon a
careless Catalogue-monger. The next,
in Order of time, was <hi>Tho. Spott, Spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tey</hi>

himself to have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that Book: But it does fairly

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98722:238"/>
place the <hi>Hannow</hi> Edition is blam'd
for omitting <hi>Parker</hi>'s own Life; which
perhaps was no fault in those that
had the care of it. There were only
a few Copies of the First Edition (such
as were design'd for<note n="a" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. vol. 1. pag. 588, 589.</note> public Libraries,
and the accomodation of a few choise

to be expected that the Foreign Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishers
should Print it otherwise than
as 'twas commonly sold by our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>

than any other he's pleased to cite:
and yet he<note n="b" place="bottom">In notis ad Canon. <hi>Lichfield,</hi> de Succes. Archiep. Cant passim.</note> observes a great many
of his mistakes; and, I do not doubt
but any skilful Antiquarie will easily

are very broken and imperfect since
that <hi>Epoche.</hi> Out of these, and what

Dr. <hi>Hugh Todd</hi> (Prebendary of this

My worthy Brother hopes that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions

(after our Chapter-House and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury

it can hardly be expected that so many

ever since the dismembering of it from

happily undertaken at the Request of
the late Mr. <hi>Wharton;</hi> who design'd
to have oblig'd the Publick with it,
in some future Volume of his <hi>Anglia

the good Services that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
our Church by that Learn'd
Person, fully finish'd and brought to
Perfection by some other able Hand:
So that, 'tis to be hop'd, we shall not
long want the Benefit of such successful
Labours. His other Volume bears the
Inscription of <hi>A Parochial Visitation of
the Diocess of</hi> Gloucester; wherein the
Matters treated on are chiefly Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical,
tho' some Affairs of a Civil
Nature are also intermix'd. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
that occur in this are partly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98722:245"/>
owing to the Author's own View and
Enquiries, made in the several Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes;
and partly to such Helps as
could be had out of the Registry at
<hi>Worcester,</hi> and his own at <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi>

during the Ravage of our late

other Cathedral Churches: being made
a very improper Prey to a Fanatical
and Illiterate Army of Rebellious
Blockheads. Amongst these <hi>Silas Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>
was an Officer of a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Fancy and Respect for Books
and Learning; and, having gotten
part of the<note n="c" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. vol. 2. p. 464.</note> Bishop's Palace into
his Possession, thought it was also
convenient to seize as many of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98722:245"/>
Churches Evidences and Records, as
he could possibly get into his Clutches.
With these (and many of the like kind
from the Church at <hi>Worcester</hi>) he
troop'd off, upon the happy return of
our old <hi>English</hi> Government; and near
Twenty Years afterwards, dy'd
with some of 'em in his Possession at
<hi>Harwich.</hi> His Books and Papers, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the other few Moveables
he left behind him, fell into the Hands
of his Creditors; from whom (if any
care was taken to preserve them) it
will now be a very difficult Matter to
retrieve them.</p>

him to have been penn'd about that

                  <p>THere's no part of History more
Instructive than that which falls
under the care of <hi>Biographers;</hi> if the
Subject be rightly chosen, and the
Author a skilful Artist. The great
Concerns of both Church and State
pass through the Hands of a Few;
who only are acquainted with the true
Spring and Cause of all those Changes
that inferiour People admire and feel,
but cannot comprehend. The secret
Memoirs of these Men of Business
give a quite different prospect of
Things, than what we see in Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Gazettes; and they that have
the perusal of them (if otherwise qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
for the Undertaking) must also
afford an Account widely different
from that of a Monkish Chronicle,
where nothing of moment (more than
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98722:255"/>
a great Frost or Pestilence, occurs for
some Years together. They that sit at
the Helm, and are entrusted with the
Mysteries of Government, have all
their private Affairs so interwoven with
the Publick, that they are not to be
consider'd asunder: So that he that
can justly give the Features of one of
these, must be likewise able to present
us with the exact Lineaments of that
whole Community whereof he was a
Member.</p>
                  <p>Whoever attempts a Work of this
high Nature, must come prepar'd
with suitable Parts and Judgment;
such as will enable him to discover
many considerable and grand Truths
from (sometimes) very poor and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Hints. To this purpose, it will
be necessary that he have a good gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Notion of the several Matters, Men
and Times, that will come under his
Consideration; as well as that he be
perfectly acquainted with the Abilities,
Inclination and Interests, of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Person whose Picture he chiefly
intends to draw. His Affections must
also be as clear and spotless as his
Reason. No Byass of Love or Duty,
of Malice or Revenge, must govern or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98722:255"/>
direct his Thoughts or Pen; nor must
he be a Zealot (or so much as a Party)
in any of the Modish Factions of the
Age he treats on. He must have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in Common with the Man he
describes; so as neither to reap any
Advantage by his Fame, nor to suffer
any Damage by his Disrepute. 'Tis
true, the Remains of deceas'd Heroes
(Ecclesiastical and Civil, as well as
Military) fall usually into the Hands
of their dearest Friends and Kindred;
who are too often so unhappily tender
of their Reputation, that they will
not entrust them with Strangers of the
best Experience and Integrity. What
we have of such a Man's Story must
come from These; who most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
send it abroad so tinctur'd with
Prejudice (the Glories of their Friend
or Patron being so fulsomely daub'd,
and his Frailties so slovenly dash'd and
blotted) that it makes only a very
awkard Piece, how Good-like and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soever this Gentleman him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
may have been. Whereas, the
best Service and the fairest Respect that
we can pay to the Memories of those
that have been publick Blessings to the
Religion or Government of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98722:256"/>
Country, is the taking Care to
have their Actions recorded by just
and dis-interested Writers; who have
Sagacity enough to discern what is fit
for Posterity to know, and Honesty
enough to transmit and represent it
duly.</p>
                  <p>These are the proper Qualifications
of those that take upon them the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Lives of other People: And
the Reader will be easily directed by
them, how to judge of such Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
Thus, when he has learn'd
the Relation there is betwixt the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian,
and the Patriot or Confessor,
he will be able to make Abatements
proportionably: He will see how to
distinguish Truth from the additional
(garnishing) Devoirs of a Subaltern, a
Nephew or a Cousin: He will readily
discover the Allowances that are to be
given to Flesh and Blood, and in what
Particulars they have the upper Hand
of Honour and Justice. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
where he finds a great Man's
Life undertaken by his profess'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
he will be sure to read it with a
Curb upon his Faith: He will criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
weigh and examine his Author's
Conclusions and Inferences; And, if
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98722:256"/>
he finds those good and logical, he will
yet suspend his Belief till Matters of
Fact are attested by some other (indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent)
Authority. And lastly, where
Miracles and Revelations are in Vogue
and carry a Price, he will attentively
consider whether the Penman will not
be a Gainer by having his Story credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And whether he's not in hazard
of wanting some part of his daily Bread
if it miscarries. In such a Case, a
complaisant Respect to the Fashions of
a Country, may prevail upon a Man
to be silent and say nothing; but
Reason will direct him what to
think.</p>
                  <p>By these Rules we are to judge of
the Lives of those Saints which have
been taken notice of in some of the
foregoing Chapters, as well as of those
Religious Persons that are here to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
I mean, those good Bishops and
other pious Ecclesiasticks (of a lower
Form of Sanctity, and second-rate Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
who, though they have not the
Honour to come in the Kalendar, are
acknowledg'd to have done the Church
very eminent Services in their several
Generations. The Lives of these are
not very numerous: At least, they are
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98722:257"/>
but a few that have come to my
Knowledge. In the ancient <hi>British</hi>
and <hi>Saxon</hi> Churches all that were
worth the having their Names re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister'd
by an Ecclesiastical Historian,
are Saints (of some degree or other)
and are all to be had in the <hi>Catholick
Almanack:</hi> where <hi>Joseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi>
Venerable<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>I. Pits,</hi> p. 142. &amp; <hi>H. Spelm.</hi> Gloss. p. 245. voce <hi>Fossa,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Bede,</hi> Bishop<note n="b" place="bottom">Monast. Angl. Tom. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Erken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald,</hi>
&amp;c. (who are sometimes Saints,
and sometimes only Confessors or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
old Church-men) have the
Days of their several <hi>Obits</hi> assign'd
them. Having therefore nothing more
to write of the Lives of the Holy Men
of these Ages, I shall take my leave of
them; with the Observation of a witty
<note n="c" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Th. Fuller</hi>'s Holy War, ch. 8. pag. 11.</note> Author on some following Times,
which I think may be as applicable to
these: <hi>One may wonder,</hi> says he, <hi>that the
World should see most Visions, when it
was most blind; and that that Age, most
barren in Learning, should be most fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Revelations.</hi> After the Conquest
we have several Ecclesiastical Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,
that have had a very profound
Respect paid them by their Cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98722:257"/>
Writers; and yet could never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at a legal Canonization. These
(as many of 'em, that is, as have had
their Lives penn'd by such particular
Historiographers as I have heard of)
were mostly either Archbishops or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:
To which a third Class of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Clergy-men shall be added; to
be inlarg'd by those that have better
opportunities (than I have had) of
making just and full Enquiries.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> have
always presided in the <hi>British</hi> Church
<hi>tanquam Papae alterius Orbis;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in their Lives, well written, we
may justly expect the most considerable
part of our Ecclesiastical History. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Contests betwixt the Crown
of <hi>England</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it
was commonly the mishap of these
Primates to side with the latter; which
brought them sometimes into disgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Circumstances with their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns;
but made their Memories pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in the esteem of those bigotted
Monks, to whose Lot it fell to write
their Elogies. Hence we have already
met with <hi>Anselm, Edmund</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi>
among the Saints; and must here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98722:258"/>
such of their Successors as have
had particular Pens engag'd in their
Service, tho' never so much as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
with (even the diminutive Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
a Beatification. <hi>Simon Sudbury,</hi>
who was beheaded by the Rebels in
<hi>Wat. Tyler</hi>'s Insurrection, is the first
that I can meet with of this kind: And
we have only a Fragment of his Life,
written by one<note n="a" place="bottom">Angl. Sacr. vol. 1. p. 49.</note> 
                     <hi>William Chartham.</hi>
It tells us, that 'twas prophesy'd such
an untimely Death should befal him,
because (when Bishop of <hi>London</hi>) he
met some Pilgrims on their way to
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> designing to pay their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Shrine, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
them to let the Journey alone;
assuring them <hi>Quod illa Indulgentia ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria
quae apud</hi> Cantuarios <hi>fore speraba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
nullius commodi fuerat vel valoris.</hi>
Such Doctrin as this in his Life-time,
and the sealing his Loyalty to his Prince
with his Blood at his Death, ought
indeed to be remember'd with Honour.

Usurpations; of their extraordinary
Sanctity; of their Benefactons to some

a Letter from the Dean and Chapter
of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s for his Canonization:
But it appears, from many of his own
Writings, that his Request was not
like to be granted; notwithstanding
the fair Caresses that he had from
the Pope (who fear'd him more than
he lov'd him) in his Life-time. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
of <hi>Wickham,</hi> the great Founder
of two famous Colleges in <hi>Oxford</hi> and

his Benefits carefully Register'd by
some of those that daily tasted of the
Sweets of them: And indeed there
have been several of those who have
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98722:262"/>
thus paid their grateful Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to his Memory. The first of
'em (I think) was <hi>Tho. Chaundler,</hi>
sometime Warden of New-College;
who wrote the<note n="a" place="bottom">MS. in Coll Novo, Oxon.</note> Founder's Life,
by way of Dialogue, in a florid and
good Stile. This is contracted (by
the Author himself, as is suppos'd)
into a<note n="b" place="bottom">Angl. Sac. vol. 2. p. 355.</note> Couple of Pages; together
with which is publish'd a piece of his
larger Colloquy, wherein he touches
upon the Life of (his Patron) <hi>Tho.
Bekinton,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi>
He commends this latter Prelate's
Skill in the Civil Law; but says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of (what won the Heart of
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth) his writing
against the <hi>Salic</hi> Law of <hi>France.</hi> The
next Writer of <hi>Wickham</hi>'s Life was

Dr. <hi>Johnson</hi> (sometime Fellow of New-College,

and afterwards Master of <hi>Winchester</hi>-School)
gave a short view of their

a little unfairly borrow'd the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
he gives us of this Prelate's
Life (one of the best in his Book)
from Mr. <hi>Josseline;</hi> without taking
any notice of his Benefactor. <hi>Henry
Spencer</hi> Bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> (a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

had his active Life written by

                     <hi>John Capgrave;</hi> who takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to state the Case, how far a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
may engage in Military Affairs.
There's no doubt but there may be
some Junctures wherein 'tis not only
allowable (but a Duty) in every Man,
that is able, to bear Arms; and this
Bishop's Suppressing the Rebellious
Insurrection in his own Diocess was
so far from being a Crime, that 'twas
highly commendable and becomingly
Brave. But his Atchievements in
<hi>Flanders</hi> and other Foreign Parts
(against the express Command of his
Sovereign) were such extraordinary
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98722:263"/>
Efforts of Lay-Gallantry, as are not
easily to be defended: Nor do I see
that honest <hi>John</hi> ever thought of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logizing
for them. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>
(Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> and Lord
Chancellour of <hi>England</hi>) was bred in

These are all the Writers, that
I know of, which have attempted
the History of any of our particular
Prelates, before the end of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign; which is as low
as my Enquiries are to come. I do
not question but that, upon a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Search into our <hi>English</hi> Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
a good Number may be added
to them; tho' I cannot hope they
will ever prove either so many, or so
exact, as those that have been written
of the Bishops since the uniting of the
Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>There are few inferiour Clergymen
that have had the Honour done them
to be remember'd in any special Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
on their several Lives;<note place="margin">Inferiour Clergy.</note> tho'
many of 'em had the chief Places of
Trust and Honour in the State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
upon them. Within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of six or seven Reigns, after the
Restitution of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Line, we
have one Abbot, two Deans, six Arch-deacons
and a Dignitary of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s,
Chancellours and Keepers of the great
Seal; not to mention others in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
lower Stations. I know not
whether that these Men, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98722:264"/>
themselves in the Management
of secular Affairs, were thought to
desert their Clerical Functions, or for
what other Reason, they seem to have
been out of the Road of the Monkish
Historians: Or, at least, they never
look'd upon them as Persons that equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deserv'd their Respect, with such
as had entirely devoted themselves to
the Churche's Service. Not one of
them, as far as I have hitherto learn'd,
have had their particular Histories;
nor should we have known that some
of 'em had ever liv'd, but from the
public Records of the state. In short,
I have only a couple of Lives to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the Account with in this Class
(for that of <hi>Henry</hi> Arch-deacon of

and they both fall within the Reign
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the single Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess

they that know the values of that

                  <p>THE great Usefulness of the
Leiger Books and other Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stic
Records is so apparent to any Man
that has had the least acquaintance with
them, that I need not much insist on
so known a Subject. The most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
of our Historians are visibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to them for their chief<note n="a" place="bottom">See the Pref. to <hi>Tanners</hi> Notitia, p. 22, 23.</note> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials;
and 'tis from hence that they
are enabled to clear the Descents and
Pedigrees of many Noble Families;
the Tenures of Estates, the Ancient
Customs of Counties, Cities and great
Towns; the Foundation and Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For how spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or defective, soever the old Monks
might be in Recording the Public Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the State, we are sure they
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98722:266"/>
were extreamly diligent in noting
down those of their own Monasteries:
Whence it is that the Histories of those
Cathedrals, which were anciently in
their Possession, are the most entire
of any in the Kingdom. This suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appears from the late Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Publisher of <hi>Anglia Sacra,</hi>
who soon furnish'd out one<note n="a" place="bottom">Vol. I. De Archiepiscopis &amp; Episcopis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siarum quas Monachi possiderunt.</note> Volume
of this sort of Writers, but was forced
to patch up the second out of a more
incoherent Medly of Shreds. He
would certainly have driven very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
in the succeeding ones that he had
promised; since ('tis plain) his best
Fund was already exhausted. Nor are
these Registers only more particular
and full in Matters relating to their
own History, than that of the Public;
but they are also much more Authentic
and Credible in these. They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been allow'd as good Evidence
in our Courts of Judicature; and do
often effectually determine such Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as have been thought to labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in extricable difficulties. Their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
indeed, is not so Venerable in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98722:266"/>
those Passages that concern the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur,
Priviledges and Immunities, of their
respective Houses; where the private
Zeal or Interest of the Pen-man may
be suspected to have transported him
a little, beyond the exact Limits of
Truth. The Monks are rarely so strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac'd,
as to boggle at an Officious Lye;
and therefore, where the Subject will
admit of such a pious piece of Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
they are to be read with Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Judgment. In reporting
the several Grants of their Founders
and Benefactors, with the Number
and Boundaries of the Acres they
gave, we may readily and safely trust
them: because an interpolation in such
a Case would be hazardous, and what
might probably destroy an old Title
instead of creating a new one. But
when a Story comes to be told that
may advance the Repute of the whole
Fraternity, or discover the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sanctity of a single Brother, we are
to look for its being set off to the best
Advantage; and the Historian uses us
kindly, if he Romances only a little. I
<hi>am apt to believe</hi> (says Father<note n="a" place="bottom">Critic. Hist. of N. Test. par. 1. p. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Simon</hi>)
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98722:267"/>
                     <hi>that these Letters</hi> [of Christ and King
<hi>Agbar</hi>] <hi>were really found in the Archives
of the City of</hi> Edessa: <hi>But we ought
not too easily to give Credit to the first
Originals of Churches. Every one strives
to advance their Antiquity as much as is
possible; and they make no scruple (on
such Occasions) to counterfeit Acts, when
they have none that are true.</hi>

(if at all) it ought to have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.
We are also told of an Historical
Account of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
from King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s time to the
Conquest; which is as high as that
Order could be traced in this Kingdom.
For, whatever may be argued to the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98722:267"/>
contrary, 'tis very plain that our first
<hi>Saxon</hi> Monks knew nothing of St. <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>'s
Rule; but lived under the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
brought from <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was
very much different from what was
afterwards introduced by St. <hi>Dunstan.</hi>
If <hi>Augustine</hi> himself was of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and planted it at <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
(which is much questioned by very
Learn'd Men) 'tis demonstrable the
Rules were soon forgotten or laid aside,
even in the southern Parts of the Island;
and, in the North, <hi>Columbanus</hi> and
the Men of <hi>Hy</hi> were the Founders of
all our Monastic Schemes.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Norman</hi> Invasion, we had
several Members of particular Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
that apply'd themselves to write
the Histories of their own Houses;<note place="margin">After the Conquest</note>
but few that had any such concern
for the Honour of their Orders in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.

the Topographical Description of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which has been already mention'd
in the first part, is the whole of this
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98722:268"/>
Gentleman's Labours; and that this
Treatise has been sub-divided into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
deal of lesser Tracts (such as his Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
of <hi>Bristol,</hi> History of <hi>Osney,</hi> &amp;c.)
by the same Powers that sliced the
Man himself into three several Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
Sir <hi>Henry Savile</hi> did certainly
make a draught of a future History of
the <hi>English</hi> Monasteries: but is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have laid aside those Thoughts,
upon <hi>John Speed</hi>'s intermixing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that Nature in his General
History. The Annual Revenues of
the Abbies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Speed</hi> were had from
Sir <hi>Robert Cotton;</hi> whose<note n="a" place="bottom">Bibl. Cott. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> E. 4.</note> Copy
has a double Valuation, of computed
and clear Profits: whereof the former
is only given by <hi>Speed,</hi> and the latter
by <hi>Dugdale.</hi> The Reason why the
former of these Writers is so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mistaken, in assigning the right
Counties to the several Monasteries,
was because he follow'd the List
brought in by <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
who were chiefly sollicitous in
learning the Value and Income, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being too nice in the Topographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
part of their Account. This is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98722:269"/>
what we have from a very<note n="a" place="bottom">Hist. &amp; Synops. Bibl. Cott. p. 39, 40.</note> learn'd
Pen: To which let me add what
another<note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>T. Tanner,</hi> in Praefat ad Notit. Monast. pag. 5, 6, 20, 21.</note> worthy Person (who has
been very happy in his searches into
these Matters) has further told us.
That Catalogue, he observes, was
drawn up by <hi>William Burton,</hi> out of
<hi>Leland</hi>'s Papers and the Original Book
of Valuations; which Book differs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
from that ancient Copy which
Sir <hi>William Dugdale</hi> transcrib'd from
the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library. Nor are these
to be reconcil'd by deducting of Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
as appears from the History of
those in <hi>Dugdale's Warwickshire,</hi> where
all those common Burthens (of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Corrodies, Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are
summ'd up: so that he inclines to the
Opinion that there were several Rates
taken of our Monasteries, upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Surveys and at different Times;
especially since he meets with some
Valuations in <hi>Leland</hi>'s Notes, that
will not agree with either of these.
<hi>Richard Broughton</hi> (who has been once
remember'd before) wrote a small
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98722:269"/>
Book of indigested Tales; which he
entitl'd, <hi>Monasticon</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>8vo.</hi> Lond. 1655.</note> 
                     <hi>Britannicum;</hi> or,
<hi>A Historical Narration of the first
Founding, and flourishing State of the
Ancient Monasteries, Religious Rules and
Orders of</hi> Great Britain, <hi>in the Times of
the</hi> Britains <hi>and Primitive Church of the</hi>
Saxons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was printed a
dozen Years after the Death of the
Author, by some of his Friends: so
that 'tis probable we have it much
more imperfect than he intended; and
in such an unfinish'd Condition, as the
mistaken Kindness of Executors too
frequently send things abroad.</p>
                  <p>The same Year was publish'd the
First Volume of the famous <hi>Monasticon
Anglicanum:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Monasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum.</note> to which a<note n="b" place="bottom">Fol. Lond. 1661, 1673.</note> Second
and Third were afterwards added.
The two former of these were (as the
Title-Pages will inform us) owing to
the joint Labours of Sir <hi>Will. Dugdale</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Dodsworth:</hi> who had also the
Assistance of a great many other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Antiquaries and Well-wishers to
our <hi>English</hi> History. These were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
chiefly the Work of R. <hi>Dodsworth,</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:98722:270"/>
whose Father was Register at <hi>York;</hi>
and <hi>Dugdale</hi> had only so much share
in it, <hi>Vt Authoris alterius Titulum op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
meritus sit,</hi> as Sir <hi>John Marsham</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<note n="b" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon, vol. 2. p.</note> explains it to us,
He took care in the Methodizing and
Publishing of them; in Correcting the
Sheets at the Press, and in Composing
very useful Indexes. Accordingly
(tho' <hi>Dodsworth</hi> was dead before the
printing of the First Volume, yet) he
has the glory given him, in the Title,
of the principal Author of both Tomes.
The former of these gives us the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monasteries,
and (their Off-spring), the <hi>Cluniacenses,
Cistertians</hi> and <hi>Carthusians:</hi> And the
latter affords those of the Canons Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
of St. <hi>Augustine, Hospitalers,
Templars, Gilbertines, Praemanstratenses,</hi>
and the <hi>Maturines</hi> or <hi>Trinitarians.</hi> We
have in them the Remains of all those
Orders, digested into a good Method;
without any thing intermix'd, either
by the Collector or Publisher. The
<hi>Latin</hi> Pieces are printed off exactly as
they found them; and those in <hi>Saxon</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:98722:270"/>
(as also <hi>Leland</hi>'s <hi>English</hi> Notes) were
translated by <hi>Will. Somner.</hi> The Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
ought to be reckon'd amongst
those worthy Benefactors to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
that have made it their Business
to preserve our ancient Historians;
such as <hi>Twisden, Fell, Gale,</hi> &amp;c. Great
and many are the Advantages which
all the several Branches of our History
(not only in Ecclesiastical, but Civil
and Martial Occurrences) will derive
from this Work: And hardly a private
Family (of any Consideration) in the
Kingdom, but will here meet with
something of its Genealogy and Pedigree.
He is most scrupulously exact in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
the ancient Records: So that,
the bald <hi>Latin,</hi> barbarous Expressions,
and other Deformities of the Monkish
Stile, are to be reckon'd Beauties in
him. By the Catalogue of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
in the end of the First Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
it appears how far the Industry
of this Writer has exceeded that of the
People employ'd by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to
bring in a List of all the Religious
Houses in this Nation: many being
added (as more might have been, in
almost every County) to the Schedule
by them transmitted into the Exchequer.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98722:271"/>
And yet the old Register-Books, that
are cited in the <hi>Monasticon,</hi> have a deal
more in them than is there made use
of. Sir <hi>William Dugdale,</hi> (on second
Thoughts) transcrib'd many Things
into the <hi>Additamenta</hi> of the latter
Tome; which both he and Mr. <hi>Dods<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
had overlook'd or did not (at
first) think Material enough. The
Third Volume was publish'd under the
sole Name of Sir. <hi>William:</hi> though
Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> does not question (he<note n="a" place="bottom">Ath. Oxon. vol. 2. p. 700.</note>
says) but, in this also, he was very
much indebted to <hi>Dodsworth</hi>'s Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
He seems the rather to suspect
such a thing, because many Records
were communicated by himself, which
are not duly acknowledg'd as they
ought to have been; and he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
the like good Assistance was given
him by Sir <hi>Tho. Herbert,</hi> tho' his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefaction
is also disregarded. These
Three Tomes were lately<note n="b" place="bottom">Fol. Lond. 1693. See Mr. <hi>Tanner</hi>'s Praef. p. 7, 8.</note> Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miz'd
or Abridg'd by some modest
Gentleman or other, that did not think
fit to put his Name to his Work:
which might have been of some good
use, if a little more care had been taken
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98722:271"/>
of the Numerals; which direct to the
Pages in the <hi>Monasticon</hi> it self, and
(being frequently mistaken) do not
only render the Book useless, but very
dangerous. Besides, we are so far
from wanting any Abridgment of
these Tomes, that we rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of their too great Conciseness;
and could wish there were some more
added, out of such Leiger-Books and
Records, as never came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of either of the worthy Authors
of these Three.</p>
                  <p>Towards the furtherance of such
an acceptable Service as this,<note place="margin">T. Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> we have
had an excellent Manual, given us
by Mr. <hi>Tanner;</hi> whose<note n="a" place="bottom">8vo Oxon. 1695.</note> 
                     <hi>Notitia
Monastica</hi> does not only afford us a
short History of the Foundation and
chief Revolutions of all our Religious
Houses, but presents us also with a
Catalogue of such Writers (noting the
Places where we may find them) as
will abundantly furnish us with such
further Particulars as we shall have
occasion for. The foremention'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers
of the <hi>Monasticon Anglicanum</hi>
took care to make the like References;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98722:272"/>
and to let the World know from
whose Hands they had the perusal of
the Records of this or the other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery.
But, as many new Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
have been made since their
Time, so several of the Books they
met with have changed their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
and therefore their Defects are
not only here supply'd, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Proprietors of what they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
much better ascertain'd. Some
Volumes indeed, and several single
Charters and other Instruments, are
still appropriated to their old Masters;
where 'tis not known how, or to
whom, they have been lately trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd.
And this may possibly prove an
obliging piece of Service to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Administrators or Legatees, of the
Persons so mention'd; who will be
hereby directed and encouraged to
make Enquiry after their unknown
Chattels, and to claim them where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they shall find them. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Author has superseded some
Pains I had long since taken to the
like purpose; and whereof I should
have given the Reader an Account
in this Chapter. The Informations
he has here, are beyond what I could
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98722:272"/>
have afforded him; and I hope (upon
a second Edition of the Book, which
I much long for) will be yet a great
deal fuller. 'Till that can be had,
give me leave to offer a slender Tast
of the large Editions we may look
for from the Author himself. In the
<hi>Cottonian</hi> Library alone there are Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
and Register-Books of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Monasteries; which (for
want of such a Catalogue as we now
have) had not come to his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

In the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth, during the Storm against Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
and Colleges, the Controversy was
seemly enough. For, whilst nothing
but Ruin was within their view, such
a concern was as natural as 'tis for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
Families to value themselves on
their Pedigrees: But, in their flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishing
condition under Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
it might have been hoped that
the Members of both would have
found themselves better Employment.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98722:278"/>
This the contending Parties in that
Reign seem to have been somewhat
sensible of; and therefore the most
violent and fierce of 'em declin'd the
owning of their several Brats, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing
their Names to Pleadings and
Apologies. The Truth is, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of what was offer'd on either
side was so aery and vapid, that 'twas
fit only for young Sophisters, or Men
that had left the School for thirty<note n="a" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>J. Caii,</hi> de Antiq. Cantab. lib. 1. in princip.</note>
Years, to argue at such a rate: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the grave and residing Doctors were
justly asham'd of such Practices, and
(for some time) modestly play'd their
Puppets from behind the Curtain.
What was done for either of these
Noble Seminaries by King <hi>Sigebert</hi> or
King <hi>Aelfred</hi> may possibly endure the
Canvasing: But when the contesting
Antiquaries begin to be so hardy as to
launch farther (into the vast and dark
Ocean of the Times of <hi>Iren</hi> or <hi>Rydychen</hi>
and <hi>Caer-grant,</hi>) I think the wisest
Course is to divide the Laurel, and
to call in King<note n="b" place="bottom">Hist. &amp; Antiq. Oxon. lib. 1. p. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Bladud</hi> to be Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of our first University at <hi>Stanford.</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:98722:279"/>
Thus the pitching of our Tents in a
third place ends the Controversy; and
we may quietly, and at leisure, draw
off our Colonies, to <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
as we have occasion.</p>
                  <p>Some Writers we have that have
behaved themselves with tolerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
in treating of these Matters,<note place="margin">Both the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</note>
and have honestly enquir'd into the
true History of the gradual Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning in this Kingdom;
recounting whatever remain'd of the
ancient State and Condition of it in
either of our Universities: But the
most of those that pretend to write
of both without prejudice, are too
manifestly byass'd in their Affections,
and seldome fail of giving the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the place of their own res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective
Education. <hi>John Ross</hi> (the
<hi>Warwick</hi> Antiquary) has been already
observ'd to mix a deal of this kind of
History in that which he wrote of the
Kings of <hi>England:</hi> And 'tis certain
he also design'd a particular Treatise of
the Antiquities of our Universities.
This very Treatise (tho' he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
'twas an imperfect Copy that
came to his hands) is frequently quoted
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98722:279"/>
by <hi>John Leland;</hi> and yet Mr. <hi>Wood</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">Id. ibid. lib. 2. pag. 77.</note> believes 'tis now lost, as confidently
as his Predecessor (<hi>Brian Twine</hi>) thought
it never had a being. I presume his
other Tract, <hi>Contra Historiolam Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brigiensem,</hi>
was only a Fragment of
this Fragment; and therefore, if the
one be irrecoverably gone, there's little
encouragement to look after the other.

we have also one that bears the Title,

out of some of those that wrote
on the same Subject a little before his
Time: from whom he borrows all the
new Light he pretends to give, <hi>De

but he could not direct his Reader
where it was afterwards to be had;
and speaks so coldly of it, that the

the enquiring after. He rather offers

gives abundantly more than the whole
Tribe of the foremention'd Authors
could afford us; and, in two large
Books, runs through every particular
of her Story. In the former of these
we have her Annals, from the eldest
date of her Records, down to the
Year 1648. wherein our ancient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Government, Religion, Liberties,
Laws and Learning, were all sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
together. The Confusions that
ensu'd, and continu'd for above ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
long Years after King <hi>Charles</hi>'s
Martyrdom, made a Scene too Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical;
and therefore our Historian
wisely drop'd the Curtain before Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
had entirely usurp'd the
Schools, Blasphemy the Pulpits and

that the Style is not very uniform,

Key.</hi> The former Edition of them
was under the feign'd Name of <hi>Londi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis:</hi>
But in the second the Author
himself thought it no disparagement to
own his Work. His first Attempt is
to establish the lately advanc'd Doctrin

                  <p>It had been a happy thing if all
those that,<note place="margin">Writers.</note> with so much Industry and
Application, have enquir'd into the
first Originals of our two Universities,
had bestowed as much of their learned
Pains in following down the Histories
of such eminent Writers as have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
in either of them: For (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might severally have done
as much Honour to their respective
Mothers, so) this had been the most
effectual Course to have endear'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Posterity, and to have made
their Labours for ever valuable. We
are extreamly indebted to those pious
Princes and generous Heroes that
(either in the East or Western Parts
of the Kingdom) have afforded us
such noble advantages of Education,
in all sorts of Learning, as no other
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98722:289"/>
Nation can pretend to; and perhaps
we cannot be more injurious to their
Memories than by clogging their true
Story with Fables, Fancies and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries.
Instead therefore of raking
in their Ashes and rifling their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres
to prove them Men of Gigantick
Stature, instead of refineing upon
their History till we have turn'd it
into Romance, we should pay them
more grateful and real Honours if (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
content with such Remains of
them as we know are Genuine) we
employ'd more of our Time in letting
the World see what use has been made
of their Benefits; how much the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Branches of the unforbidden
<hi>Tree of Knowledge</hi> have thriven under
the Influences of their Charity; what
mighty Numbers of great Doctors and
Masters (in all Faculties) have been fed
at their Expence, and flourish'd by
their Bounty. 'Tis true, our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
were not always the sole
Fountains of good Literature in this
Island; many of our eminent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
having had their Education in
Monasteries: But (since St. <hi>John</hi> of
<hi>Beverly</hi> has been made a Member of
that at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and venerable <hi>Bede</hi> a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98722:289"/>
Student at <hi>Cambridge</hi>) I wish they
had rank'd all our antient Men of
Knowledge on one Hand or the other,
provided they had given us full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of their Persons and Labours.
I think we may (without Vanity)
affirm that hardly any Kingdom in
the World has outdone <hi>England,</hi> either
in the Number or Goodness of her
Authors; and that, even in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Ages, our Lamps shone always
as bright as any in our Neighbourhood.
When School-Divinity was in Fashion,
we had our <hi>Doctores Subtiles, Irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabiles,</hi>
&amp;c. and, as Learning grew
to a better Ripeness and Stature, we
had plenty of good Books in other (as
useful) Sciences.</p>
                  <p>The first that attempted the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of our Writers was <hi>John Boston,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">J. Boston.</note>
a Monk of St. <hi>Edmundsbury,</hi> A. D.

of the Libraries in <hi>England,</hi> drew a
Catalogue of all the <hi>British</hi> Authors,
and gave short censures upon them.
He could hardly have flourish'd so
early as <hi>Pits</hi> here speaks of, if his

Progress was (as a later<note n="a" place="bottom">

to a good share of Knowledge in the
<hi>Greek, Latin, Welsh, Saxon, Italian,
French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Languages. In the
Year 1534. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth
gave him a Commission to Search all
the Libraries of <hi>England,</hi> and to make
what Collections he thought Good:
in which Employment he Spent Six
whole Years. He afterwards turn'd
Protestant, and was siez'd with a Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy;
losing (says my<note n="a" place="bottom">J. <hi>Pits,</hi> p. 743.</note> Author, very
uncharitably) his Understanding with
his Faith. In this Condition he dy'd
at <hi>London,</hi> A. D. 1552. leaving a vast
number of Historical Treatises behind
him. Amongst these, the most valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
(at least, that which we are now

said to have been entitl'd <hi>De Illustribus

Piece of Service. Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> has taken

                  <p>Our Writers of these two last Ages
have been pretty well accounted for by<note place="margin">A. Wood.</note>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:98722:292"/>
the late industrious <hi>Anthony Wood;</hi>
whose<note n="a" place="bottom">Fol. Lond. 1691. &amp; 1692.</note> 
                     <hi>Athenae Oxonienses</hi> give us a
large Collection of Reports (good and
bad) of the most minute Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of almost all the Authors that have
flourish'd in either of our Universities
since the Year 1500. The Writer of
these two Volumes (or his Friend, who
penn'd the Prefaces for him) thought it
convenient to excuse the extraordinary
Respect he paid to the Members of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Communion; telling us that he
had found those the most communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as (on the contrary) the Fanaticks
were generally the most reserv'd and
morose. Some fancy'd there were other
secret Reasons for these mutual Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
betwixt the Gentlemen of that
Persuasion and our Author; who, by
his long conversation amongst them,
was thought to be a little too deeply
tinctur'd with their Principles. 'Twill
be a difficult Task to prove him a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
from any thing that he has here
advanc'd; since in some places he falls
as foul on those People, as his Praises
of 'em are extravagant in others. The
truth is, His Books are little more than
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98722:293"/>
a Medly of Notes and such Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as were sent in from his several
Correspondents; without being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
into any other method than the
throwing them under that particular
Author's Name, to whom they chiefly
related. 'Tis no Blemish on his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to observe that he had his share of
that Peevishness and Austerity (both in
his Stile and Manners) which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
incident to Antiquaries; and thus
much we ought gratefully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that he has furnish'd us with
a larger Stock of useful Materials than
perhaps any one Man of this Age
has Collected. If he was too sullen
among Courtiers, he paid sufficiently
for all the Liberty he took; and 'tis
illegal to object a Crime for which a
suitable Penance has been already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
and perform'd.</p>
                  <p>It were highly to be wish'd that we
had a general Account of all our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
done with the like accuracy and
exactness as those of <hi>Oxford</hi> (for the last
200 Years) are in these two Volumes;<note place="margin">T. Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note>
but in somewhat better and more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
Air: And I think I may boldly
promise the Reader that this will be
abundantly perform'd by Mr. <hi>Tanner,</hi>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:98722:293"/>
who has diligently compar'd <hi>Leland</hi>'s
Original Manuscript with the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
false Copies that have been
given of it by <hi>Bale</hi> and <hi>Pits.</hi> He
has Corrected innumerable Errors in
all the three; and has made those many
and large Additions to all that they
could tell us, that we shall have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to look upon the Work as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
new and his own. The oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pains that have been taken by this
worthy Person on that Subject have
render'd him better qualify'd to give
an Account of our <hi>English</hi> Historians
than I can pretend to be; and I wish
I had early enough thought of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the Task to him: But his
great Candour, in remarking the Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Mistakes in my former Part,
encourages me to hope that he will as
kindly review this; and then I shall not
question but they will both become
more serviceable than (without such
an Assistance) I could ever have made
them.</p>
