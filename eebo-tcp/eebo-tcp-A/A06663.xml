         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the obieccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
that God maye styll

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of hym. The seconde
parte of this treatise is this, as
concernyng the priest, he forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not the synne, but onely is
a minister of God, appointed to
vtter &amp; declare that fre remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of synnes purchased for vs of
God the father, by the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
bloude of Iesu Christe.
This maketh the Papistes to
cry, <hi>ad ignem, ad ignem.</hi> For this
doctrine plucketh them doune
one staffe lower than they were
before. They may now become
no more Checkemate with God.
For before they were not onely
not contented to be his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
but also they woulde be

Now shall they be fayne, eyther
to be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> messengers and seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of God, or els playne Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christes
and papistes. But let
vs se, what the scripture sayeth.</p>
            <p>That the priest forgeueth not
synne but God alone, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
proued before. Now must

that hys vnspeakable goodnes

The summe of their commissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

before God, that whatsoeuer
they pronounce, beynge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the worde of God,
shall as certenly come to passe,
as thoughe God hym selfe had
spoken it. As for an example,
Whan soeuer the ministers &amp;
preachers of Gods woorde in
this worlde shall declare to the
faythfull repentaunce, remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of synnes, &amp; tell them that
they be losoned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> captiuitie

sure, as though God hym selfe
had sayde these woordes vnto
them: Thy synnes are forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

they shall saye to the vnfayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that they remayne still
bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in their synne, and that
the wrathe of God abydeth
vpon them, and therefore they
shall be damned, God appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approueth
<pb facs="tcp:9683:40"/>
their sayinge, and it
shal vndoubtedly come to passe
according to their preachinge.
So that whatsoeuer the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Gods worde sayeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge
to the worde of God,
ought to be receyued w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greate

sent doune from heauen, &amp;
vndoubtedly beleued, as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeste
and infallible veritie
of God. And this preaching of
remittyng or retaynyng sinnes
are the keyes of the kyngdome
of heauen, which Christ promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Apostles before hys
death, as we maye se in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,<note place="margin">Math. xvi.</note>

And by a Metaphore
Christ calleth the preachyng of
his worde a keye. For as a keye
hath twoo properties, one too
<pb facs="tcp:9683:40"/>
shutte, another to open, so hath
the worde of God. It openeth

it shutteth all his treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,

none of them all, so lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they
persiste and remayne in theyr
incredulity and vnfaithfulnes.
These keyes are geuen too so
many, as beynge truely called
vnto the office of ministracion,
preache y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> worde of God. They
loosen, that is to say, they prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

bynde, that is, they declare to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

And where there is no keye,
there is neyther openynge nor

let all menne iudge what is to
be thoughte of the Papistes
absolucion, whereof they crake
so muche, whiche also they sell

it foloweth that their absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion

greately fortunate is that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryshe,
