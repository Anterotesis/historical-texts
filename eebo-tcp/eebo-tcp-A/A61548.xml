            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHen I was desir'd, not long since, to reprint the Discourse lately published, concerning the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ's Satisfaction,</hi> I thought it necessary to look into the <hi>Socinian Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,</hi> (which have swarmed so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us within a few years) to see how far an Answer had been given in them to any of the arguments contained in it; but I found the Writers of them thought it not for their purpose to take any notice at all of it; but rather endeavour'd to turn the Controversie quite another way, and to cover their true Sense under more plausible Expressions. Of which I have given a full account in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the late Edition of it. But among those Treatises which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etended to be an Answer to my
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:100626:3"/>
Sermon about <hi>the Mysteries of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith,</hi> (reprinted with the former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and therein I meet with a passage, which hath given occasion to this <hi>Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For there are these Words, <hi>That I had utterly mistaken, in thinking that they deny the Articl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of the new Creed, or</hi> Athanasian <hi>Religion, because they are Mysteries, or because,</hi> say they, <hi>we do not comprehend them; we deny them, because we do comprehend them, we have a clear and distinct Perception, that they are not Mysteries, but Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Impossibilities and pure Nonsense.</hi> Which words contain in them so spitefull, so unjust, and so unreasonable a Charge upon the Christian Church in general, and our own in particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I could not but think my self concerned, especially since they are addressed to me, to do what in me lay (as soon as my uncertain State of Health would permit) towards the clearing the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Mystery of the Athanasian Religion,</hi> as they call it, viz. <hi>The Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> (which is chiefly struck at by them) without running into any <hi>new Explications,</hi> or laying aside any <hi>old terms,</hi> for which I could not see any just occasion.</p>
            <p>For however thoughtfull Men may think to escape some particular difficulties better,
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:100626:3"/>
by going out of the common Roads; yet they may meet with others, which they did not foresee, which may make them as well as others judge it, at last, a wiser and safer course to keep in the same way, which the Christian Church hath used, ever since it hath agreed to express her Sense in such <hi>Terms,</hi> which were thought most proper for that purpose. For in such cases, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Critical Signification of words is not so much to be attended, as the use they are applied to, and since no other can be found more significant or proper for that end; it looks like yielding too great advantage to our Adversaries, to give up the Boundaries of our Faith. For although there be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the necessary Article of Faith it self, and the manner of expressing it, so that those may truely believe the Substance of it, who differ in the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet since the Sense of the Article hath been generally received under those terms, there seems to be no sufficient reason to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute new ones instead of the old, which can hardly be done, without reflecting on the Honour of the Christian Church, and giving occasion for very unreasonable Heats and Disputes, among those, who, if we may believe their own words, agree in the same fundamental Doctrine; <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Trinity</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:100626:4"/>
in <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>three Persons</hi> in the <hi>same undivided divine Essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am so little a Friend to any such Heats and Differences among our selves especially when we are so violently attacked by our common Adversaries, that were there no other reason, I should for the sake of that alone forbear making use of <hi>new Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> but there is another too obvious, which is, the mighty advantage they have taken from hence to represent our Doctrine as <hi>uncertain,</hi> as well as <hi>unintelligi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le.</hi> For as soon as our <hi>Unitarians</hi> began to appear with that Briskness and Boldness they have done now for several years, some of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines thought themselves obliged to write in Defence of the Doctrine of the Trinity. Thence came several Answers to them, and in <hi>several Methods,</hi> as the Persons thought most subservient to the same end; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their intentions were, our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were too much pleased to conceal the Satisfaction which they took in it. For soon after, we had the <hi>several Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> set forth and compared with each other; and all managed so, as to make the Cause to suffer by the disagreement of the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for it. And from hence they have formed a <hi>fivefold Trinity.</hi> 1. The <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronian Trinity,</hi> because <hi>Tully</hi> had used
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:100626:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Word <hi>Personae</hi> for different Respects;<note place="margin">Considerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, by Dr. <hi>W. &amp;c. p.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>Sustineo ego tres Personas</hi>; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Acceptation, <hi>Three Persons in the Godhead</hi> are no more than <hi>three Relations, Capacities or Respects of God to his Creatures,</hi> which say they, is <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Sabellianism: and is no manner of Mystery,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> 
               <hi>but the most intelligible and obvious thing in the World. 2. The</hi> Cartesian <hi>Trinity, which maketh three divine Persons, and three infinite Minds, Spirits and Beings to be but one God. 3. The</hi> Platonick <hi>Trinity, of three divine Co-eternal Persons, whereof the second and third are subordinate or inferiour to the first in Dignity, Power, and all other Qualities, except only Duration. 4. The</hi> Aristotelian <hi>Trinity, which saith the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons are one God, because they have one and the same numerical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. 5. The Trinity of the</hi> Mobile, <hi>or that which is held by the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or by such lazy Divines, who only say in short, that it is an unconceivable Mystery; and that those are as much in fault who go about to explain it, as those who oppose it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which hath made the most noise, and caused the greatest Heat and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among us, hath been a difference first
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:100626:5"/>
begun between two learned Divines of our Church, about the second and fourth; and the account which our <hi>Unitarians</hi> give of both is this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>That the one is a rational and intelligible Explication, but not true nor Orthodox; the other is true and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, but neither rational, intelligible nor possible.</hi> I do not mention this, as though their words were to be taken as to either; but only to shew what advantage they take from both, to represent that which is set up for the Churches Doctrine, either not to be <hi>truly so,</hi> or to be neither <hi>rational nor intelligible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>design</hi> of the following <hi>Discourse,</hi> is to make it appear, (1.) That the Churches Doctrine, as to the Trinity, as it is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> is not liable to their charges of <hi>Contradiction, Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities and pure Nonsense.</hi> (2.) That we own no other Doctrine than what hath been received by the Christian Church in the several Ages from the Apostles Times: (3.) And that there are no Objections in point of reason, which ought to hinder our Assent to this great point of the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>But the chief <hi>Design</hi> of this <hi>Preface,</hi> is to remove this Prejudice which lies in our way from the different <hi>manners</hi> of <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:100626:5"/>
and the warm Disputes which have been occasion'd by them.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, that our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have taken all possible advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us from these unhappy differences; and in one of their latest Discourses they glory in it, and think they have therein <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the foreign Unitarians: For,</hi> say they, <hi>We have shewed,</hi>

               <hi>that their Faiths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this pretended Mystery are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and so contrary, that they are less one Party among themselves, than the far more learned and greater number of them are one Party with us:</hi> this is spoken of those they call <hi>Nominal Trinitarians</hi>; and for the other whom they call <hi>Real,</hi> they prove them guilty of <hi>manifest Heresie</hi>; the one they call <hi>Sabellians,</hi> which they say is the same with <hi>Unitarians,</hi> and the other <hi>Polytheists or disguised Pagans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, <hi>p.</hi> 15.</note> and they borrow arguments from one side to prove the charge upon the other; and they confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm that all that speak out in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, must be driven either to <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> or <hi>Tritheism.</hi> If they are <hi>Nominal Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians,</hi> they fall into the former, if <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> into the latter.</p>
            <p>This is the whole Design of this late Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which I shall here examine, that I may remove this stumbling Block, before I enter upon the main business.</p>

If it be, the most learned and judicious of the Fathers did not know what <hi>Sabellianism</hi> meant (as I have shewd at large in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) for they utterly disowned <hi>Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> and yet asserted,<note place="margin">

            <p>Let us then examine this matter by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son without them. <hi>Persons among Men,</hi> say they, <hi>are distinguished from Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, because they have distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, therefore where there is but one Substance, the Person can be only a Mode, and therefore the same with the Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that the true original Notion of <hi>Personality</hi> is no more than a different Mode of subsistence in the same common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For every such Nature is in it self one and indivisible; and the more perfect it is, the greater must its Vnity be.

               </hi> and <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Those Philosophers (called <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici)</hi> did not think much amiss, who said, <hi>That if all things were alike, there would
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:100626:9"/>
be but one Substance or Being in the World;</hi> and what we now call <hi>different Substances,</hi> would be only different Modes of Subsistence in the same individual Nature. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Substances in created Beings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises from those two things. 1. A Dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Accidents, both internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. 2. The Will and Power of God, whereby he gives them distinct and separate Beings in the same common Nature. As for instance, the Nature or Essence of a Man consider'd in it self, is but one and indivisible; but God gives a separate Existence to every Individual, whereby that common Nature subsists in so many distinct Substances, as there are Individuals of that kind; and every one of these Substances is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not only by a separate internal vital Principle and peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, but by such external Accidents, as do very easily discriminate them from each other. And the subject of all these Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents is that <hi>peculiar Substance,</hi> which God hath given to every Individual, which in rational Beings is called a <hi>Person</hi>; and so we grant that in all such created Beings the <hi>Personality</hi> doth suppose a distinct Substance; not from the Nature of Personality, but from the condition of the subject wherein it is. The <hi>Personality</hi> in it self is but a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:100626:10"/>
Mode of Subsistence in the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature, which is but <hi>One:</hi> but this Personality being in such a subject as Man is, it from thence follows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that each Person hath a peculiar Substance of his own; and not from the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Personality.</hi> But when we come to consider a divine Essence, which is most perfectly one, and is wholly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any separate Existence or Accidents, there can be no other way of distinction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it, but by different <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> or <hi>relative Properties</hi> in the same divine Essence. And herein we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, as we do in our other Conceptions of the divine Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> we take away all Imperfection from God, and attribute only that to him, which is agreeable to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections, although the manner of it may be above our comprehension. And if this be owning the <hi>Trinity of the Mob,</hi> I am not ashamed to own my self to be one of them; but it is not out of <hi>Lazyness</hi> or <hi>affected Ignorance,</hi> but upon the greatest and most serious consideration.</p>

Property? The instance of <hi>Solomon</hi> is not at all to the purpose, unless we asserted three Persons founded upon those different Relations in his individual Nature.

<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:100626:12"/>
which the Church hath used to express her Sense by, still retaining the same fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Article of <hi>three Persons in one undivided Essence,</hi> but explaining it in such a manner, as to make each Person to have a <hi>peculiar and proper Substance of his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This gave so great an advantage to the Author of those Treatises, that in a little time,<note place="margin">Considerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Trinity, <hi>p.</hi> 12.</note> he set forth his Notes with an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix in answer to this <hi>new Explication.</hi> Wherein he charges him with <hi>Heresie, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism</hi> and <hi>Contradiction.</hi> The very same charges which have been since improved and carried on by others; I wish I could say, without any unbecoming Heat or Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>But I shall now examine how far these charges have any ground, so as to affect the Doctrine of the Trinity, which is the chief end our Adversaries aimed at, in heaping these Reproaches upon one who appear'd so early, and with so much zeal to defend it.

            <p n="1">1. That a Man may be very right in the Belief of the Article it self; and yet may be mistaken in his <hi>Explication</hi> of it. And this one of his keenest Adversaries freely acknowledges.

            <p>But suppose a Man to assent to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Article it self, and be mistaken in his Explication of it, can he be charged with <hi>Heresie</hi> about this Article? For <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> must relate to the fundamental Article to which he declares his hearty and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Assent; but here we suppose the mistake to lie only in the <hi>Explication.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Sabellianism</hi> is a condemned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded Heresie, for it is contrary to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrine of the Trinity; but suppose one who asserts the Doctrine of <hi>three Persons,</hi> should make them to be <hi>three Modes,</hi> must such a one presently be charged with <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi> before we see whether his Explication be consistent with the fundamental Article or not?

<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:100626:15"/>
reach no farther than the restraint of Mens Tongues and Pens about these matters, and unless something be found out to satisfie their Minds and to remove Misapprehensions, the present Heat may be only cover'd over and kept in; which when there is a vent given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may break out into a more dangerous Flame.</p>
            <p>Therefore I shall endeavour to state and clear this matter so as to prevent any future Eruption thereof, which will be done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how far they are agreed, and how far the remaining difference ought to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are agreed, <hi>That there are three distinct Persons and but one God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That there are no separate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Substances in the Trinity; but the divine Nature is wholly and entirely one and undivided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the divine Essence is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the Father to the Son, and from both to the holy Spirit.</hi> So that the charge of <hi>Sabellianism</hi> on those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this new Explication is without ground. For no <hi>Sabellian</hi> did or could assert a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the divine Essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which being agreed on both sides, the Dispute turns upon this single point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:100626:15"/>
a <hi>communicated Essence,</hi> doth imply a <hi>distinct Substance</hi> or not. On the one side it is said,<note place="margin">Remarks upon the examinat. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note> 
               <hi>That there being but one God, there can be but one divine Essence, and if more Essences more Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side, that <hi>since they own a communicated Essence necessary to make a distinction of Persons in the Son and Holy Ghost, if the Essence be not distinct, the foundation of distinct Personalities is taken away.</hi> But how is this clear'd by the other Party? They say,<note place="margin">Remarks <hi>p.</hi> 34.</note> 
               <hi>That it is one peculiar Prerogative of the divine Nature and Substance, founded in its infinite and therefore transcendent Perfection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is capable of residing in more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons than one, and is accordingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from the Father to the Son and Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>the Communication of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is owned to the Persons of the Son and Holy Ghost.</hi> But how then comes it not to make a distinct Essence, as it makes distinct Persons, by being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated?</p>
            <p>The answer we see is, <hi>That it is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Prerogative founded on the infinite and therefore transcendent Perfection of the divine Nature.</hi> But they further add, <hi>That when the Son and Holy Ghost are<note place="margin">P. 36.</note>
                  <pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:100626:16"/>
said to have the same divine Nature from the Father, as the Origin and Fountain of the Divinity; not by the Production of a new divine Nature but by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his own; which is one and the same in all three without Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Difference, or Distinction; that this is indeed a great Mystery, which hath been always look'd upon by the greatest and wisest Men in the Church, to be above all Expressions and Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the greatest difficulty is at last resolved into the incomprehensible Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the divine Nature; <hi>and that neither Man nor Angels can give a satisfactory answer to Enquiries about the manner of them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </note> And the Author of the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Animadv. <hi>p.</hi> 36.</note> 
               <hi>That in the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Trinity, the divine Nature and the personal Subsistence coalesce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one, by an incomprehensible, ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kind of Union and Conjunction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But do those on the other side think, that the asserting three distinct Substances in one and the same individual Substance tends to clear and explain the Notion of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and make it more easie and intelligible? <hi>The Divinity,</hi> they say, <hi>is whole, intire, indivisible,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Modest exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> 
               <hi>and inseparable in all three.</hi>
               <pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:100626:16"/>
But can one whole entire indivisible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance be actually divided into three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances? For if every Person must have a peculiar Substance of his own; and there be three Persons, there must be three peculiar Substances, and how can there be three pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Substances, and yet but one entire and indivisible Substance? I do not say, there must be three divided Substances in place, or separate Substances, but they must be divided as three Individuals of the same kind, which must introduce a <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Divine Nature,</hi> which I think very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the divine Perfections; but of this at large in the following Discourse.</p>
            <p>I do not lay any force upon this argument, that <hi>there can be no ground of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between the three Substances,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tritheism</hi> charged, <hi>p.</hi> 262.</note> 
               <hi>if there be but one Substance in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> (as some have done) <hi>because the same Substance cannot both unite and distinguish them;</hi> for the ground of the distinction is not the <hi>Substance</hi> but the <hi>Communication</hi> of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 264.</note> and where that is so freely asserted, there is a reason distinct from the <hi>Substance</hi> it self, which makes the <hi>Distinction</hi> of Persons.</p>
            <p>But the difficulty still remains, how each Person should have a Substance of his own; and yet there be but one entire and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:100626:17"/>
Substance, for every <hi>Person</hi> must have a proper Substance of his own; or else accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> he can be no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and this peculiar Substance must be really distinct from that Substance which is in the other two: so that here must be three distinct Substances in the three Persons. But how then can there be but one individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Essence in all three? We may conceive one common Essence to be individuated in three Persons, as it is in Men; but it is impossible to conceive the same individual Essence to be in three Persons, which have peculiar Substances of their own. For the Substances belonging to the Persons, are the same Essence individuated in those Persons: and so there is no avoiding making three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Essences and one specifick or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon divine Nature. And <hi>Maimonides</hi> his argument is considerable against more Gods than one; <hi>If,</hi> saith he, <hi>there be two Gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:100626:17"/>
thought that <hi>wherein they differ'd</hi> sufficient <hi>to make them two Gods.</hi> So that I fear it will be impossible to clear this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> as to the reconciling <hi>three individual Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences</hi> with <hi>one individual divine Essence,</hi> which looks too like asserting that there are three Gods and yet but one. And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Explica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion doth at last confess, that <hi>three distinct whole inseparable Sames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Modest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> 
               <hi>are hard to conceive as to the manner of it.</hi> Now to what purpose are <hi>new Explications</hi> started and Disputes raised and carried on so warmly about them, if after all, the main difficulty be confess'd to be above our Comprehension? We had much better satisfie our selves with that Language which the Church hath receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d and is express'd in the Creeds, than go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by new Terms, to raise new Ferments, especially at a time, when our united For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are most necessary against our common Adversaries. No wise and good Men can be fond of any new Inventions, when the Peace of the Church is hazarded by them. And on the other side, it is as dangerous to make <hi>new Heresies</hi> as <hi>new Explications.</hi> If any one denies the Doctrine contained in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> that is no <hi>new Heresie</hi>; but how can such deny the Son to be consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial to the Father, who assert one and
<pb n="xxxii" facs="tcp:100626:18"/>
the same indivisible Substance in the Father and the Son? <hi>But they may contradict themselves.</hi> That is not impossible on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side. But doth it follow that they are guilty of Heresie? <hi>Are not three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and but one a Contradiction?</hi> No more, say they, than that a <hi>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Substance</hi> is not distinct from that which did communicate. But this whole dispute we find is at last resolved into the infinite and unconceivable Perfections of the Godhead, where it is most safely lodged; and that there is no real <hi>Contradiction</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> it self, is part of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Discourse afterwards.</p>
            <p>But here it will be necessary to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what the <hi>Unitarians</hi> have objected against this <hi>new Explication,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Considerat. on the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Trinity, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 12.</note> viz. <hi>That it was condemned by the ancients in the Person of</hi> Philoponus; <hi>in the middle A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, in the Person and Writings of</hi> Abhor Ioachim; <hi>but more severely since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, in the Person of</hi> Valentinus Gentilis, <hi>who was condemned at</hi> Geneva, <hi>and beheaded at</hi> Bern <hi>for this very Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these I shall give a distinct answer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Joh Philoponus,</hi> I do freely own, that in the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> when in the sixth Century he broached his opinion,
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:100626:18"/>
               <hi>That every Hypostasis must have the common Nature individuated in it,</hi> this was look'd upon as a Doctrine of dangerous consequence, both with respect to the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Incarnation.

                  <hi>Leont. de Sectis Act.</hi> 5.</note> the dispute did not begin about the Trinity, but about the Incarnation; and <hi>Philoponus</hi> took part with those who asserted but one Nature in Christ after the Vnion, and he went upon this ground, That if there were two <hi>Natures</hi> there must be two <hi>Hypostases,</hi> because <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Hypostasis</hi> were the same. Then those on the Churches side, saith <hi>Leontius,</hi> objected, That if they were the same, there must be three distinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Trinity, as there were three <hi>Hypostases</hi>; which <hi>Philoponus</hi> yielded, and grounded himself on <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that there was but one common Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and several individual Substances, and so held it was in the Trinity, whence he was called the leader of the <hi>Heresie of the Tritheius.</hi> This is the account given by <hi>Leontius</hi> who lived very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Niceph. Callist</hi> l. 18. c. 46, 47.</note> and that he wrote a Book on purpose about the Vnion of two Natures in Christ, out of which he produces his own words concerning a common and individual

               </gap>) which can agree to none else. And the main argument he went upon was this, that unless we assert a singular Nature in the <hi>Hypostases,</hi> we must say, that the whole Trinity was incarnate; as unless there be a singular humane Nature distinct from the common, Christ must assume the whole Nature of Mankind. And this argument from the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> was that which made <hi>Roscelin,</hi> in the beginning of the disputing Age, <hi>A.

            </p>
            <p>But among these <hi>Severians,</hi> there were three several opinions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of <hi>Philoponus,</hi> who held one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature and three Individual.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of those who said there was but one Nature and one <hi>Hypostasis.</hi>

Of those who affirm'd there were three distinct Natures, but withal, that there was but <hi>one indivisible Godhead</hi>; and these differ'd from <hi>Philoponus</hi> in the main ground of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> which was, that he held the <hi>common Nature</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> to be only a <hi>specifick Nature,</hi> and such as it is among Men.

<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:100626:20"/>
doth assert plainly, that the common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is separated from the Individuals, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, by a mere act of the Mind; so that he allow'd no individual Vnity in the divine Nature, but what was in the several Persons; as the common Nature of Man is a Notion of the Mind, as it is abstracted from the several Individuals, wherein alone it really subsists; so that here is an apparent difference between the Doctrine of <hi>Joh. Philoponus</hi> and the <hi>new Explication,</hi> for herein the most real, essential and <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Unity of the divine Nature</hi> is asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and it is said to be <hi>no Species,</hi>

               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is but one,</hi> and so it could not be condemned in <hi>Joh. Philoponus</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We now come to <hi>Abbat Joachim,</hi> whose Doctrine seems to be as much mistaken, as it is represented in the <hi>Decretal,</hi> where the Condemnation of it by the <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> is extant.

<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:100626:21"/>
my purpose, that he denied the individual Vnity of the divine Essence, which cannot be charged on the Author of the <hi>new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> and so this comes not home to the purpose.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But the last charge is the most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for it not only sets down the <hi>Heresie,</hi> but the capital punishment which follow'd it.

            <p n="2">2. In the same Sentence it is said, <hi>That he acknowledged the Father only to be that infinite God which we ought to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>

            <p n="3">3. It is charged upon him, <hi>That he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Trinity a mere human Invention, not so much as known to any Catholick Creed, and directly contrary to the Word of God.</hi>

               <hi>That he made three Spirits of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Order and Degree, that the Father is the one only God, by which the Son and Holy Ghost are excluded manifestly from the Unity of the Godhead;</hi> But the Person charged with his Heresie saith,<note place="margin">Modest exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Now to deal as impartially in this matter as may be, I do not think our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one jot helped in the Notion of the Trinity by this Hypothesis; but that it is liable to as great difficulties as any other, and therefore none ought to be fond of it, or to set it against the general Sense of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the current Expressions of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines about these Mysteries; nor to call the different opinions of others <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>Nonsense,</hi> which are provoking Words, and tend very much to inflame Mens Passions, because their Faith and Vnderstanding are both call'd in question, which are very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, a difference ought to be made between the Heresie and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of such who maintain the <hi>individual</hi>
               <pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:100626:23"/>
and <hi>indivisible Unity</hi> of the Godhead; but withal, believe that every Person hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Substance as a Person, and that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellianism</hi> cannot be avoided otherwise. Wherein I think they are mistaken, and that the Fathers were of another opinion; and that our Church owns but <hi>one Substance in the Godhead,</hi> as the Western Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did, (which made such difficulty about receiving <hi>three Hypostases,</hi> because they took <hi>Hypostasis</hi> for a <hi>Substance)</hi> but yet I see no reason why those who assert three <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postases,</hi> and mean three individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances should be charged with the Heresie of <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> or so much as with that of <hi>Abba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Joachim</hi> or <hi>Philoponus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they all rejected the <hi>individual Unity of the divine Nature,</hi> which is constantly maintained by the Defenders of the other <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is said and urged with vehemency, that these two things are inconsistent with each other; that it is going forward and backward, being Orthodox in one Breath and otherwise in the next; that all this looks like shuffling and concealing the true meaning, and acting the old Artifices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a different Form. For the <hi>Samosate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> when they were pinched, seem'd very Orthodox in their Expressions,
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:100626:23"/>
but retained their Heresies still in their Minds; and there is reason to suspect the same Game is playing over again, and we cannot be too cautious in a matter of such Consequence.</p>
            <p>I grant very great caution is needfull, but the mixture of some Charity with it will do no hurt. Why should we suspect those to be inwardly false, and to think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than they speak, who have shew'd no want of Courage and Zeal, at a time when some thought it Prudence to say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and never call'd upon their <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> then to own <hi>the cause of God,</hi> and to do their Duties as they have now done, and that in no very obliging manner? And if the same Men can be cool and unconcerned at some times, (when there was so great reason to be otherwise) and of a sudden grow very warm, and even to boil over with Zeal; the World is so ill natur'd, as to be too apt to conclude there is some other cause of such an alteration than what openly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. But there is a kind of <hi>bitter Zeal,</hi> which is so fierce and violent, that it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inflames than heals any Wounds that are made; and is of so malignant a Nature, that it spreads and <hi>eats like a Cancer,</hi> and if a stop were not given to it, it might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the whole Body.

<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:100626:27"/>
unite and look more narrowly to their steps.) I do not charge their Writers with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed design to advance <hi>Deism</hi> among us; but their way of managing their Disputes, is as if they had a mind to serve them. And such men who are Enemies to all revealed Religion, could not find out better Tools for their purpose than they are. For they know very well, that in such a Nation as ours, which is really concerned for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion one way or other, there is no opening professed Schools of <hi>Atheism;</hi> but the design must be carried on under some shew of Religion. And nothing serves their turn so well, as setting up natural Religion in opposition to Revealed. For this is the way by degrees to loosen and unhinge the Faith of most Men, which with great reason is built on the Scripture as the surest foundation.</p>
            <p>But here it is fit to observe the several steps they take in order to this advancing <hi>Deism,</hi> and how our <hi>Unitarians</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with all of them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The first point they are to gain is, <hi>The lessening the Authority</hi> of Scripture, and if this be once done, they know Mens Minds will be left so roving and uncertain, that they will soon fall into <hi>Scepticism</hi> and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:100626:27"/>II. The next is, to represent <hi>Church-men</hi> as <hi>Persons of Interest and Design,</hi> who maintain Religion only because it supports them; and this they call <hi>Priest-Cra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> and if they can by this means take away their Authority too, the way lies still more open for them; for it is more easie to make a Prey of the Flock, when the Shepherds are suspected only to look after their Fleeces. Since such a suspicion takes away all Trust and Confidence in their Guides; and they know very well, how little others will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend themselves.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another step is, to magnifie the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists</hi> as Men of <hi>Probity and good Sense</hi>; that assert the just Liberties of Mankind, against that terrible thing called <hi>Priest-Craft</hi>; and that would rescue Religion from false Glosses and absurd Notions taken up from the <hi>Schools</hi> and taught in the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,</hi> on purpose to keep under those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of universal Liberty as to Opinions, which those of freer Minds endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. But especially they are great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to all <hi>Mysteries of Faith,</hi> as unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Impositions on those of more refined Vnderstandings, and of <hi>clear and distinct Perceptions,</hi> as they have learnt to express themselves. These they account intolerable Vsurpations on Men of such <hi>Elevations</hi> as
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:100626:28"/>
themselves; for <hi>Mysteries</hi> are only for the <hi>Mob,</hi> and not for Persons of such <hi>noble</hi> Capacities.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The last thing is, to represent all Religions as indifferent, since they agree in the common Principles of natural Religion, especially the Vnity of God, and all the rest is but according to the different Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, the skill of the Contrivers, and the several Humors and Inclinations of Mankind.</p>
            <p>These are the chief <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Deism</hi> in our Age; for even <hi>Deism</hi> hath its <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,</hi> and it is it self a <hi>Mystery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> which I am afraid is too much <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already</hi> among us, and will be more if no effectual stop be put to it.</p>
            <p>I call it <hi>Deism,</hi> because that Name ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains now, as more plausible and modish; for <hi>Atheism</hi> is a rude unmannerly Word, and exposes Men to the Rabble, and makes Persons shun the company and avoid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation and Dealing with such who are noted for it. And this would be a mighty Prejudice to them, as to their Interests in this World, which they have reason to value.</p>
            <p>But to be a <hi>Deist,</hi> seems to be only a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up for having more Wit, than to be cheated by the <hi>Priests,</hi> and imposed upon by the common Forms of Religion, which serve
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:100626:28"/>
well enough for ordinary People that want Sense, and are not skill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but the Deists are so wise as to see through all these things. And therefore this name gains a Reputation among all such as hate Religion, but know not how otherwise to distinguish themselves from prosessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, which they would by no means be taken for; although if they be pressed home, very few among them will sincerely own any more than a Series of Causes, without any intellectual Perfections, which they call <hi>God.</hi> A strange God without Wisdom, Goodness, Iustice or Providence!</p>
            <p>But I am now to shew, how in all these points the present <hi>Unitarians</hi> have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry serviceable to them, in the Books which they have lately published and dispersed both in City and Country.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Authority of Scripture: They have been already justly exposed for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Authority of S. <hi>John's Gospel,</hi> by mustering up all the Arguments of the old Hereticks against it,<note place="margin">Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> and giving no answers to them. And what defence have they since made for themselves? No other but this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trifling one, that they <hi>repeat their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons but do not affirm them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer to Dr. <hi>Bull, p.</hi> 47.</note> What is the meaning of this? If they are true, why do they not affirm them? If they are false, why
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:100626:29"/>
do they not answer them? Is this done like those who believe the <hi>Gospel of S. John</hi> to be <hi>divine,</hi> to produce all the arguments they could meet with against it; and never offer to shew the Weakness: and Vnreasonableness of them? Doth not this look like a design to furnish the <hi>Deists</hi> with such arguments as they could meet with against it? Especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they say, <hi>That S.</hi> Iohn <hi>doth not oppose them</hi> Why then are these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produced against his Gospel? Men do not use to dispute against their Friends, nor to tell the World what all People have said against them, and give not a word of answer in vindication of them. But they say, <hi>The modern</hi> Vnitarians <hi>allow of the Gospel and other Pieces of S.</hi> Iohn. A very great favour indeed, <hi>to allow of them.</hi> But how far? As of divine Authority? Not a word of that.

But of these things in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="liii" facs="tcp:100626:29"/>As to <hi>Church-men,</hi> no professed <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists</hi> could express themselves more spitefully than they have done, and that against those to whom they profess the greatest respect.

And the Insinuation is, that if it were not for worldly Interests, they would own them to be in the right. Whereas I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that they have no way to defend their Opinions, but to reject the Scriptures and declare themselves <hi>Deists</hi>; and as long as we retain a just Veneration for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we can be of no other Opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we look on their Interpretations as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, new, forced, and inconsistent with the circumstances of Places and the main Scope and Tenor of the New Testament.

               <hi>For it is certain we have a mighty Propensity to believe as is for our Turn and Interest.</hi> And soon after, that their Opposers <hi>are under the power of such fatal Biasses, that their Doctrine is the more to be suspected because it is theirs.

               <pb n="lv" facs="tcp:100626:30"/>But what <hi>Bias</hi> was it, which made him write with that Strength and Iudgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Opinions? Let us set aside <hi>all Titles of Respect and Honour</hi> as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, let Reason be compared with Reason; and his Arguments with their Answers; and it will be soon found that the advantage which he had, was not from any other <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> than that of a clearer Iudgment, and a much stronger way of Reasoning Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their Answers are such, as may well be supposed to come from those, who had some such <hi>Bias,</hi> that they must at least seem to answer what in truth they could not. As hath been fully made appear in the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of him, to which no reply hath been given, although other Treatises of theirs have come out since.

               <hi>That they did not expect that their Answer should satisfie us,</hi> and in truth they had a great deal of reason to think so. But what reason do they give for it?

between the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> as some did, and defended them, as well as they could, when Popery was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost. But enough of this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have seen how much they have gratified the <hi>Deists</hi> by representing Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in such a manner, let us now see in what manner they treat the <hi>Deists.</hi> It is with another sort of Language; and which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a more than ordinary kindness to them. In one place they say, <hi>That the Deists are mostly well-natured Men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Some thoughts upon Dr. <hi>Sh.</hi> Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, p. 21.</note> 
               <hi>and Men, of Probity and Understanding; in effect that they are sincere honest-hearted Men, who do good by the impulse of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, Honesty and good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which have great Influence upon them.</hi> What another sort of character is this from that of the greatest, and in their opinion the best of our Clergy? This must proceed from some Intimacy and Familiarity with them; and it is easie to imagine from hence, that they are upon very good Terms with one another, because they must be <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians,</hi> if they believe a God at all.</p>
            <p>But where else are these <hi>honest, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Deists</hi> to be found?</p>
            <p>It is rare indeed for others to find any one that rejects Christianity out of pure Conscience, and that acts by principles of sincere Virtue. I never yet could meet
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:100626:31"/>
with such, nor hear of those that have. And I would fain know the reasons on which such conscientious Men proceeded; for truly the Principles of natural Religion are those which recommend Christianity to me; for without them the <hi>Mysteries of Faith</hi> would be far more unaccountable than now they are; and supposing them, I see no Incongruity in them, <hi>i. e.</hi> That there is a just and holy God, and a wise Providence, and a future State of Rewards and Punishments; and that God designs to bring Mankind to Happiness out of a State of Misery; let these be supposed, and the Scheme of Christianity will appear very reasonable and fitted to the Condition and Capacity of Mankind. And the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest Mysteries of it are not intended to <hi>puzzle</hi> or <hi>amuse Mankind,</hi> as weak Men imagine; but they are discover'd for the greatest and best purposes in the World, to bring Men to the hatred of Sin and Love of God, and a <hi>patient continuance in well-doing,</hi> in order to <hi>a blessed Immortality.</hi> So that this is truly a <hi>Mystery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> being intended for the advancement of real Piety and Goodness among Mankind in order to make them happy. But as to these <hi>Unitarians,</hi> who have such happy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with these <hi>conscientious Deists</hi>; I would fain learn from them, if they think them mistaken, why they take no more pains
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:100626:32"/>
to satisfie and convince them; for I find they decline saying a word against them. In one place they compare the <hi>Atheist</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist</hi> together; and very <hi>honestly</hi> and like any <hi>conscientious Deists,</hi> they impute <hi>all the Deism and most part of the Atheism of our Age to the Doctrines of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Incarnation.</hi>

            <p>Is it possible for Men that live in our Age to give such an account as this of the <hi>Growth of Deism</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi> among us? What number of <hi>Atheists</hi> is there, upon any other account than from a looseness of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Living? Where are those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God to be an incomprehensible Being, and yet reject the <hi>Mysteries</hi> which relate to his Being, because they are incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible? Suppose any reject <hi>spiritual Substance as Nonsense and a Contradiction,</hi> as they do the <hi>Trinity</hi> on the same Pretences. Is this a sufficient reason or not?

But I hope they give some better satisfaction to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist</hi>;<note place="margin">Letter of Resol. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> No, for they say, <hi>This is not a place to argue against either Atheist or Deist.</hi> By no means: some would say, They were not such Fools to fall out with their Friends. And
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:100626:32"/>
it cannot be denied, that they have been the greatest Incouragers of such kind of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which serve their turn so well; and in pure Gratitude they forbear to argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To shew how near they come to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in Religion, they speak favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and even <hi>Tartars,</hi> because they agree with them in the Vnity of the Godhead.

               <hi>Mahomet is affirmed by divers Historians to have had no other design in pretending himself to be a Prophet, but to restore the Belief of the Unity of God, which at that time was extirpated among the Eastern Christians by the Doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation.</hi> Who are those Historians who give this character of him?

expose the Christian Doctrine by such Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings among us. I am ashamed to mention what they say of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> when they call them, <hi>The Shield and Sword of that way of acknowledging and worshipping God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter of Resol. <hi>p.</hi> 19.</note> So that <hi>Mahometans, Jews</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> are fairly represented because they agree in the grand Fundamental of the Vnity of the Godhead; but the Christian Church is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with believing <hi>Impossibilities, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, and pure Nonsense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we find our <hi>Unitarians</hi> serving the <hi>Deists</hi> in all their methods of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing Revealed Religion and advancing <hi>Deism</hi> among us. And if this will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us to look more after them, and unite us in the defence of our Common Cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, I do not think that other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods will do it. For it is become a Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and Active, although as yet, but a small Body of Men, and they tell the World plainly enough that they are <hi>free from the Biasses of Hopes and Fears</hi>;<note place="margin">Answer to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop p. 44. <hi>P.</hi> 66.</note> 
               <hi>and sit loose from the Awes and Bribes of the World.</hi> So that there is no way of dealing with them, but by shewing the falsness &amp; weakness of the grounds they go upon; and that they have no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of us as to <hi>Scripture, Antiquity</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> which is the Design of this Vndertaking.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. The Occasion and Design of this Discourse.</head>
               <p>IT is now above twenty years since I first published <hi>a Discourse about the reasons of the Sufferings of Christ,</hi> (lately reprinted) in answer to some <hi>Socinian</hi> Objections at that time. But I know not how it came to pass, that the <hi>Socinian</hi> controversy seemed to be laid asleep among us for many years after;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100626:37"/>
and so it had continued to this day, if some mens busie and indiscreet zeal for their own particular Opinions (or rather <hi>Heresies</hi>) had not been more prevalent over them, than their care and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the common interest of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity among us. For it is that which really suffers by these unhappy and very unseasonable Disputes about the <hi>Mysteries of the Christian Faith,</hi> which could never have been started and carried on with more fatal consequence to all revealed Religion, than in an age too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Scepticism and Infidelity. For all who are but well-wishers to that, do greedily catch at any thing which tends to unsettle mens minds as to matters of Faith, and to expose them to the scorn and contempt of Infidels. And this is all the advantage which they have above others in their writings. For upon my carefull Perusal of them (which was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd by re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rinting that Discourse) I found nothing extraordinary, as to depth of Judgment, or closeness of Reasoning, or strength of Argument, or skill in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture or Antiquity, but the old stuff set out with a <hi>new dress,</hi> and too much suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the age we live in, <hi>viz.</hi> brisk and airy, but withal too light and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100626:37"/>
superficial. But although such a sort of Raillery be very much unbecoming the weight and dignity of the subject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet that is not the worst part of the character of them; for they seem to be written,<note place="margin">

                  </note> not with a design to convince others, or to justifie themselves, but to <hi>ridicule</hi> the great <hi>Mysteries of our Faith,</hi> calling them <hi>Iargon, Cant, Nonsense, Impossibilities, Contradictions, Samaritanism,</hi> and what not? any thing but <hi>Mahometism</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.</hi> And at the same time they know, that we have not framed these Doctrines our selves; but have received them by as universal a Tradition and Consent of the Christian Church, as that whereby we receive the Books of the new Testament, and as founded upon their authority. So that, as far as I can see, the truth of these Doctrines and authority of those Books must stand and fall together: For from the time of the writing and publishing of them all persons who were admitted into the Christian Church by the <hi>Form of Baptism,</hi> prescribed by our Saviour, were understood to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>that Doctrine</hi> were cast out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it: which to me seem plain and demonstrative arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ments, that this was the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Church from the beginning, as will appear in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of this Discourse. The chief design whereof is to vindicate the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> as it hath been <hi>generally received in the Christian Church,</hi> and is expressed in the <hi>Athanasian Creed,</hi> from those hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Imputations of <hi>Nonsense, Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Impossibility;</hi> with which it is charged by our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> (as they call themselves;) and that in the answer to the Sermon lately reprinted, about <hi>the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Christian Faith:</hi> which I first preached and published some years since, upon the breaking out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie among us, by the <hi>Notes on A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius his Creed,</hi> and other mischievous Pamphlets one upon another. I was in hopes to have given some check to their insolent way of writing about matters so much above our reach, by shewing how reasonable it was for us to submit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation in such things, since we must acknowledge our selves so much to seek, as to the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Substances,</hi> which are continually before our Eyes; and therefore, if there were such difficulties
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100626:38"/>
about a Mystery which depended upon Revelation, we had no cause to wonder at it; but our business was chiefly to be satisfied, whether this Doctrine were any part of that Revelation. As to which I proposed several things, which I thought very reasonable, to the finding out the true sense of the Scripture about these matters. After a considerable time, they thought fit to publish something, which was to pass for an answer to it; but in it, they wholly pass over that part which relates to the sense of Scripture, and run into their common place about <hi>Mysteries of Faith;</hi> in which they were sure to have as many <hi>Friends,</hi> as our Faith had <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>: and yet they managed it in so tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling a manner, that I did not then think it deserved an Answer. But a worthy and judicious Friend was willing to take that task upon himself, which he hath very well discharged: so that I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to meddle with all those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are fully answer'd already, but the <hi>general charge</hi> as to the <hi>Christian Church</hi> about the Doctrine of the Trinity, I think my self oblig'd to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to upon this occasion. But before I come to that, since they so confidently charge the Christian Church for so many
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100626:39"/>
ages, with embracing <hi>Errors,</hi> and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,</hi> and <hi>Contradictions</hi> for <hi>Mysteries of Faith,</hi> I desire to know (supposing it possible for the Christian Church to be so early, so generally and so miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a matter of such moment) by <hi>what light</hi> they have discovered this <hi>great Error.</hi> Have they any <hi>new Books</hi> of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> to judge by? Truly they had need, for they seem to be very weary of the old ones; because they find they will not serve their turn.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Therefore they muster up <hi>the old Objections against them,</hi> and give no answer to them; they find fault with <hi>Copies,</hi> and say, they are <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and falsified to speak the Language of the Church:</hi> they let fall suspicious words, <hi>as to the Form of Baptism,</hi> as though <hi>it were inserted from the Churches Practice;</hi> they charge us with following <hi>corrupt Copies</hi> and making <hi>false Translations</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of ground for it.</p>
               <p>And doth not all this discover no good will to the Scriptures, at least, as they are received among us? And I despair of meeting with better Copies, or seeing a more faithfull Translation than ours is. So that it is plain, that they have no mind to be tried by the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> For these exceptions are such, as a Malefactor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100626:39"/>
would make to a Jury, he is afraid to be condemned by.</p>
               <p>But what then is the peculiar light which these happy men have found in a corner, the want whereof hath made the Christian Church to fall into such <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Errors and Contradictions? Nothing (they pretend) but the mere light of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense and reason;</hi> which they call af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more refined way of speaking, <hi>clear Ideas and distinct Perceptions of things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But least I should be thought to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent them; I will produce some of their own Expressions. In one place they say, <hi>We deny the Articles of the new Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, or the</hi> Athanasian <hi>religion, not because they are Mysteries, or because we do not comprehend them; we deny them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we do comprehend them; we have a clear and distinct Perception, that they are not Mysteries, but Contradictions, Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and pure Nonsense. We have our reason in vain, and all science and certainty would be destroy'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we could not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Mysteries and Contradictions.</hi> And soon after,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answer to my Sermon</hi> p. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>we are not to give the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable name of Mystery to Doctrines that are contrary to nature's and reason's Light, or which destroy or contradict our natural Ideas.</hi> These things I have particular
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100626:40"/>
reason to take notice of here, because they are published as an <hi>Answer</hi> to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sermon</hi> about the <hi>Mysteries of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith:</hi> and this shews the <hi>general grounds</hi> they go upon, and therefore more fit to be consider'd here. To which I shall add one passage more, wherein they insinuate, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> hath been supported only by interest and force. Their words are (after they have called the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity, a monstrous Paradox and Contradiction) This is that,</hi>

But if every thing which displeases some men must pass for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100626:40"/>
                  <hi>Popery,</hi> I am afraid <hi>Christianity</hi> it self will not escape at last: for there are some who are building apace on such foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as these; and are endeavouring what they can, to remove out of their way all revealed Religion, by the help of those two powerfull <hi>Machines,</hi> viz. <hi>Priest-craft</hi> and <hi>Mysteries.</hi>

               <p>But because I intend a clear and distinct Discourse concerning the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as it hath been generally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us; I shall proceed in these four Enquiries.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Whether it was accounted a <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Paradox and Contradiction,</hi> where Persons were not sway'd by <hi>Force and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Whether there be any <hi>ground</hi> of <hi>common reason,</hi> on which it can be justly charged with <hi>Nonsense, Impossibilities</hi> and <hi>Contradiction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Whether their Doctrine about the <hi>Trinity</hi> or ours, be more agreeable to the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Antiquity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Whether our Doctrine being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it doth overthrow all <hi>certainty of reason,</hi> and makes way for believing the greatest Absurdities under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being <hi>Mysteries of Faith?</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. The Doctrine of the Trinity not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Christian Church by Force or Interest.</head>
               <p>AS to the first, it will lead me into an enquiry into the sense of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church,</hi> as to this Doctrine, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Popery</hi> was hatched, and at a time when the main force of <hi>Imperial Edicts</hi> was against <hi>Christianity</hi> it self; at which time this Doctrine was owned by the Christian Church, but disowned and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted against by some particular Parties and Sects. And the question then will be, whether these had engrossed <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and all the body of the Christian Church, with their heads and governors, were bereft of common Sense, and given up to believe <hi>Nonsense</hi> and <hi>Contradictions</hi> for <hi>Mysteries of Faith.</hi> But in order to the clearing this matter, I take it for granted, That <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> are no <hi>late inventions,</hi> only to be found among our <hi>Vnitarians;</hi> but that all Mankind
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100626:41"/>

               </p>
               <p>This is the substance of their Plea, which must now be examin'd.</p>
               <p>I begin with those <hi>Primitive Vnitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> concerning whom, I observe these things:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:100626:44"/>1. That they were a distinct, separate body of men from the Christian Church. For all the ancient Writers who speak of them, do mention them as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and wholly divided from it, as appears by <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Epiphanius, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and others. <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith of them,<note place="margin">Euseb. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> 
                  <hi>That although the Devil could not make them renounce Christianity, yet finding their weakness,</hi>

                  </gap>, he made them <hi>his own.</hi> He would never have said this of any whom he look'd on as Members of the Christian Church. But wherein is it that <hi>Eusebius</hi> blames them? He tells it in the very next words; that it was <hi>for the mean opinion they entertained of Christ;</hi> for they look'd <hi>on him as a meer Man, but very just.</hi> And although there were <hi>two sorts</hi> of them; some owning the <hi>miraculous Conception,</hi> and others not; yet saith he, <hi>They at last agreed in the same Impiety,</hi> which was, <hi>That they would not own Christ to have had any Pre-existence before his Birth; nor that he was <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, God the Word.</hi> It's true, he finds fault with them afterwards <hi>for keeping to the Law of</hi> Moses; but the first <hi>Impiety</hi> he charges them with, is the other. That which I inferr from hence is, that <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> himself (to whom they profess to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100626:44"/>
shew greater respect than to most of the ancient Writers,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>did hold the genuine Doctrine of Christ,</hi> it must be understood of his <hi>Pre-existence and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>; for the other we see he accounted an <hi>Impiety.</hi> And he tells us <hi>the Church of Ierusalem then consisted of believing Iews, and so it had done from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times to that of</hi> Hadrian<hi>'s Banishment of the Iews.</hi> Which is a considerable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to two purposes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To shew that the Primitive Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> did hold the Doctrine of Christ's <hi>Pre-existence</hi> and <hi>Divinity.</hi> But say our <hi>Vnitarians, this doth not follow.</hi> For what reason? When it is plain that <hi>Eusebius</hi> accounted that the <hi>only genuine Doctrine. No,</hi> say they,<note place="margin">Resp. ad Judic. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. <hi>p.</hi> 176.</note> 
                  <hi>he meant only the miraculous Conception, and that they held that, in opposition to those Ebionites who said that he was born as other men are.</hi> This is very strange; when <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had distinguished the two sorts of <hi>Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100626:45"/>
about this matter, and had blamed both of them, even <hi>those that held him born of a Virgin,</hi> for falling <hi>into the same Impiety.</hi> What can satisfie such men, who are content with such an answer? But say they, <hi>Eusebius only spake his own sense.</hi> Not so neither: For he saith in that place, that he had searched the most ancient Records of the Church of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Yes,</hi> say they, <hi>for the Succession of the first Bishops; but as to their Doctrine he had it from</hi> Hegesippus, <hi>and he was an</hi> Ebionite <hi>himself.</hi> Then <hi>Eusebius</hi> must not be the man they take him for. For if <hi>Hegesippus</hi> were himself an <hi>Ebionite,</hi> and told <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Commentaries, that the Primitive Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> consisted of all such, then <hi>Eusebius</hi> must suppose that Church guilty of the same <hi>Impiety</hi> with which he charges the <hi>Ebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites;</hi> and would he then have said, <hi>That they had the true knowledge of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them? No,</hi> say they, Eusebius <hi>spake his own opinion, but</hi> Hegesippus <hi>being an</hi> Ebionite <hi>himself, meant otherwise.</hi> But <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth not use <hi>Hegesippus</hi> his words, but his own in that place; and withal, how doth it appear that <hi>Hegesippus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was an <hi>Ebionite?</hi> This, one of their latest Writers hath undertaken, but in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100626:45"/>
such a manner, as is not like to convince me. It is thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answer to Dr.</hi> Bull, <hi>part I.</hi> p. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Hegesippus was himself a Iewish Christian, and made use of the Hebrew Gospel, and among the Hereticks which crept into the Church of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>he never numbers the</hi> Ebionites <hi>or</hi> Cerinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>but only the</hi> Gnosticks. I will not dispute, whether <hi>Hegesippus</hi> was a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Christian or not. Grant he was so, yet how doth it appear that all the <hi>Iewish Christians</hi> were at that time <hi>Ebionites</hi> or <hi>Cerinthians?</hi> It seems they were neither of them <hi>Hereticks,</hi> although they were opposite to each other; the one <hi>held the World created by inferiour Powers,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>by God himself:</hi> the one, we see, <hi>made Christ a mere Man</hi>; but the <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> held <hi>an illapse of the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> upon him, and so made him a kind of a God by his Presence,</hi> as <hi>Nestorius</hi> did afterwards. But honest <hi>Hegesippus</hi> took neither one nor the other for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> if our <hi>Vnitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> say true. But yet it doth not appear, that <hi>Hegesippus</hi> was either one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For he speaks of <hi>the Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> as is plain by <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. <hi>l.</hi> 4, <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note> and the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> and <hi>Ebionites,</hi> were in other parts; the former in <hi>Egypt</hi> and the <hi>lesser</hi> or <hi>Proconsular Asia</hi>; and the latter about <hi>Decapolis</hi> and <hi>Coelesyria,</hi> from whence they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100626:46"/>
spread into <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> But <hi>Origen</hi> saith, <hi>That all the Iewish Christians were</hi> Ebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites. What! no <hi>Cerinthians</hi> among them? Were not those <hi>Iewish Christians</hi>? Or were they all turned <hi>Ebionites</hi> then? No such thing appears by <hi>Origen</hi>'s saying. But we are not enquiring now, what they were <hi>in his time,</hi> but in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Doth <hi>Origen</hi> say all the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Christians</hi> there were such? And as to his own time, it is not improbable that those who then made up the separate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jewish Christians were <hi>Ebionites.</hi> But what is this to the <hi>first Christians</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem? Very much,</hi> say they, <hi>because the first Christians were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nazarens, and the Nazarens held the same Doctrine with the Ebionites.</hi> But the title of <hi>Nazarens</hi> did not always sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the same thing. It was at first used for <hi>all Christians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 24.5.</note> as appears by the Sect of the <hi>Nazarens</hi> in <hi>Tertullus</hi> his Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> then it was taken for the <hi>Christians</hi> who stay'd at <hi>Pella</hi> and setled at <hi>Decapolis</hi> and thereabouts, as <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> affirms;<note place="margin">Epiphan. haer. 29 <hi>n.</hi> 7.</note> for although all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans withdrew thither before the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith, yet they did not all continue there, but a great
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100626:46"/>
number returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and were there setled under their Bishops; but those who remained about <hi>Pella</hi> kept the name of <hi>Nazarens,</hi> and never were united with the Gentile Christians, but kept up their old Jewish customs, as to their Synagogues, even in S. <hi>Ierom</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s time. Now these <hi>Nazarens</hi> might be all <hi>Ebio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> and yet those of the <hi>Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> not so at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next thing observable from this place of <hi>Eusebius</hi> is, that while the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> and <hi>Ebionites</hi> were setled in <hi>Coelesy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and the parts thereabouts, there was a regular Christian Church at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> under the Bishops of the Circumcision, to the Siege of <hi>Hadrian. Eusebius</hi> observes, that before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem, all the Christians forsook not only Ierusalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>but the Coasts of Iudea.</hi> But that they did not all continue there, is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what <hi>Eusebius</hi> here saith of the Church and Bishops of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; between the two Sieges of <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100626:47"/>
Christians with very great severity to make them renounce Christianity.</hi> How could this be, if all the Christians were out of his reach, then being setled about <hi>Pella?</hi> And although <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 4 <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That when the Iews were banished their Country by</hi> Hadrian<hi>'s Edict, that then the Church of Ierusalem was made up of Gentiles</hi>; yet we are not so strictly to understand him, as though the Christians who suffer'd under <hi>Barchochebas,</hi> were wholly excluded. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Oros. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>That they were permitted by the Emperor's Edict.</hi> It is sufficient for me, if they were connived at, which is very probable, although they did not think fit to have any such publick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as their <hi>Bishops</hi> to be any other than <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And <hi>Hegesippus</hi> is allow'd after this time, to have been a <hi>Iewish Christian</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> so that the Church there must consist both of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but they can never shew that any of the <hi>Ebionites</hi> did admit any <hi>Gentile Christians</hi> among them, which shews that they were then distinct Bodies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were not only distinct in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> but had a different <hi>rule of Faith.</hi> This is a point of great consequence, and ought to be well consider'd. For, since our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> own the <hi>Ebionites</hi> as their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100626:47"/>
                  <hi>Predecessors,</hi> we ought to have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar eye to the <hi>rule of Faith</hi> received by them, which must be very different from ours, if they follow the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> as I doubt not to make it appear. They say, <hi>The Ebionites used only S.</hi> Matthew<hi>'s Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi> But the Christian Church then,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answer to Dr.</hi> Bull, <hi>p.</hi> 42.</note> and ever since, have receiv'd the four Gospels, as of divine authority. <hi>Eusebius,</hi> one of the most approved Authors in Antiquity by our <hi>Vnitarians,</hi> reckons up the <hi>four Evangelists and S.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Epistles,</hi> as wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings universally received by the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church; then he mentions some ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally rejected as spurious; and after those which were doubted, among which he mentions <hi>the Gospel according to the Hebrews,</hi> which <hi>the Iewish Christians fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd.</hi> Now here is an apparent difference put between <hi>the Gospel according to the Hebrews, and S.</hi> Matthew<hi>'s Gospel;</hi> as much as between a Book receiv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controversie, and one that was not. But if <hi>the Gospel according to the Hebrews</hi> were then acknowledged to be the <hi>true Gospel of S.

But it is worth our observing, what our <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> say about this matter. And by

that we may judge very much of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion about the Gospels. I shall set down their words, for fear I should be thought to do them wrong. <q>

                  <note place="margin">In Isa. <hi>c.</hi> 11. In Ezek. <hi>c.</hi> 18.</note> And so do other ancient Writers.

               <p>I Now come to consider the men of Sense they pretend to among these <hi>ancient Vnitarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is <hi>Theodotion,</hi> whom they make to be an <hi>Vnitarian.</hi> But he was, saith <hi>Eusebius</hi> from <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>

he was, if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> may be believed,<note place="margin">Epiph. de ponder. &amp; mens. <hi>n.</hi> 16.</note> first a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and then a <hi>Iew,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith indeed,<note place="margin">Euseb. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The next they mention as one of their great Lights, was <hi>Paulus Samosatenus, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Patriarch of Antioch.</hi> But in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, they have a spiteful Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that <hi>men in such places are the great Pensioners of the World;</hi>

discover the general sence of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church concerning it. <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus</hi> wanted neither parts, nor inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, nor experience; and he was support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Princess of great Spirit and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, enough to have daunted all the Bishops, at least in those parts, from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing against him. But such was the zeal and concernment of the Bishops of the Christian Church in this great affair, that they not only assembled themselves, but they communicated it to <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Athanas. desentent.

of his Opinions before the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Synod,</hi> which deposed him, sent him an account of their Faith and required his answer; wherein they declare the Son <hi>not to be God, according to God's Decree,</hi> (which he did not stick at) but that he was <hi>so really and substantially</hi>; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever denied this, they said, <hi>was out of the Communion of the Church, and all the Catholick Churches agreed with them in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And they declare, <hi>that they received this Doctrine from the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament,</hi> and bring the same places we do now, as, <hi>Thy Throne O God was for ever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who is over all, God blessed for ever.

               <p>But at last, after all the arts and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges which <hi>Paulus Samosatenus</hi> used, there was a Man of Sense, as it happen'd, among the Clergy of <hi>Antioch,</hi> called

Here was <hi>no Fire nor Faggot</hi> threatned, no <hi>Imperial Edicts</hi> to inforce this Doctrine, nay the Queen of those parts, under whose Jurisdiction they lived at that time, openly espoused
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100626:56"/>
the cause of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> so that here could be nothing of <hi>interest</hi> to sway them to act in opposition to her. And they found his interest so strong, that he retained the Possession of his See, till <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian</hi> had conquer'd <hi>Zenobia,</hi> and by his authority he was ejected. This <hi>Synod</hi> which deposed him, did not sit in the time of <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as is commonly thought, but before his time, while <hi>Zenobia</hi> had all the power in her hands in those Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern parts, which she enjoy'd five years; till she was dispossess'd by <hi>Aurelian,</hi> from whence <hi>Ant.

powerfull methods to make this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine go down. And what greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument can there be, that it was then the general sense of the Christian Church?

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially those who valued themselves for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100626:57"/>
coming out of his <hi>School.</hi> They were far enough from being such weak men to produce the authority of <hi>Lucian</hi> at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> where he was so much esteemed, for a Doctrine utterly inconsistent with that of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> if it were there known, that he was his Disciple, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from three Bishops on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. For therein the Son is owned to be <hi>God of God, begotten of the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Ages, perfect God of perfect God,</hi> &amp;c. Suppose they had a mind to subvert the <hi>Nicene Faith</hi> by this Creed under the name of <hi>Lucian,</hi> (only because <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was left out) yet what an improbable way did they take, when they supported the main points by his authority, and that at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where it was greatest? If <hi>Philostorgius</hi> may be credited,<note place="margin">Philost. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 15, 16.</note> the great men of the <hi>Arian Party</hi> had been his Scholars, as besides <hi>Eusebius</hi> of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media, Maris</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon, Theognis</hi> of <hi>Nice, Leontius</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and several other leading Bishops, and even <hi>Arius</hi> himself pretended to it. Which makes me apt to think, that <hi>Alexander</hi> knowing this, and at first not being able so well to judge of <hi>Lucian</hi>'s opinion, charged him with following <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> from whence the <hi>odium</hi> would fall upon his Scholars.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100626:58"/>
For his design is to draw the succession down from <hi>Ebion,</hi> and <hi>Artemon,</hi> and <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Samosatenus,</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> to <hi>Arius</hi> and his Associates; and charges them with holding the same Doctrine, wherein he was certainly mistaken; and so he might be about <hi>Lucian</hi>'s separation from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Bishops on that account.</p>
               <p>The last our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> mention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their great men, is <hi>Photinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sirmium.</hi> They take it for granted that he was of their opinion.

                  <note place="margin">Euseb. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 28.</note> who mentions it, from the Scriptures and the first Christian Writers, named by him, that it doth not deserve to be taken notice of; especially since he makes it appear, that it was not heard of among them at <hi>Rome,</hi> till it was first broached there by <hi>Theodotus,</hi> as not only he, but <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirms; as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready observed.</p>
               <p>Thus I have clearly proved, that the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> was so far from being embraced only <hi>on the account of force and fear,</hi> that I have shewed there was in the first Ages of the Christian Church, <hi>a free and general Consent</hi> in it, even when they were <hi>under Persecution;</hi> and after the <hi>Arian Controversie</hi> broke out, yet those who denied the <hi>Pre-existence,</hi> and <hi>Co-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of the Son of <hi>God</hi> were universally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; even the <hi>Arian Party</hi> concurring in the Synods mention'd by <hi>Hilary.</hi> But our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> are such great Pretenders to <hi>Reason,</hi> that this Argument from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the whole Christian Church, signifies little or nothing to them.</p>

                  <hi>That here is an Arithmetical, as well as Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Contradiction. For, in saying God the Father, God the Son, and God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, yet not three Gods but one God, a Man first distinctly numbers three Gods, and then in summing them up brutishly says, not three Gods but one God.

the Christian Church hath so long since condemned for Heresies. But it may be with the same Civility they will say, <hi>It was brutishly done of them.</hi> But can these Men of Sense and Reason think, that the Point in Controversie ever was, whether in Numbers, <hi>One could be Three,</hi> or <hi>Three One?</hi> If they think so, I wonder they do not think of another thing; which is the begging all <hi>Trinitarians</hi> for <hi>Fools</hi>; because they cannot count <hi>One, Two and Three;</hi> and an <hi>Vnitarian</hi> Jury would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cast them.

                  <hi>we are to embrace with it, all that it can reach to; and where we can go no farther, we must believe without doubting:</hi> which is a wise resolution of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For there are some things revealed, which we can entertain the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of in our minds, as we do of any other matters, and yet there may be some things belonging to them which we cannot distinctly conceive. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God to have been from all Eternity; and that because God hath revealed it; but here is something we can conceive, viz. <hi>that he was so</hi>; and here is something we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive, viz. <hi>How he was so.</hi> This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

I had produced in my <hi>Sermon,</hi> to shew that we might be obliged to believe such things concerning God, of which we cannot have a clear and distinct No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as that God was from all Eternity, although we cannot conceive in our minds, how he could be from himself. Now, what saith the <hi>Vnitarian</hi> to this, who pretended to Answer me? He saith, <hi>If God must be from himself,</hi>

                  <hi>then an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God is a Contradiction; for that implies, that he was before he was; and so charges me with espousing the cause of Atheists.</hi> I wish our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> were as free from this Charge as I am. But this is malicious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing. For my design was only to shew, that we could have no distinct conception of something which we are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. For upon all accounts we are bound to believe an Eternal God, and yet we cannot form a distinct and clear Idea of the manner of it. Whether being from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self be taken <hi>positively,</hi> or <hi>negatively,</hi> the matter is not cleared; the one is Absurd, and the other Unconceivable by us. But still I say, it is a thing that we are bound to believe stedfastly, although it is above our comprehension. But instead of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to this, he runs out into an Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of one notion of Eternity: and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100626:66"/>
as he thinks, shews some Absurdities in that, which are already answer'd. But that was not my meaning, but to shew that we could have no clear and distinct Notion of Eternity; And if his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were good they prove what I aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, at least as to that Part; and himself produces my own Words to shew, that there were such Difficulties every way, which we could not master; and yet are bound to believe, that necessary Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is an inseparable Attribute of God. So that here we have a clear instance of what S. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, That we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve something upon full Conviction, as that God is eternal; and yet there may remain something which we cannot reach to by our understanding, <hi>viz.</hi> the manner how Eternity is to be conceived by us: which goes a great way towards clearing the Point of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> notwithstanding the Difficulty in our conceiving the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how Three should be one, and One three.</p>
               <p>But S. <hi>Augustin</hi> doth not give it over so; <hi>Let us keep stedfast,</hi>

Matter. <hi>The Catholick Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> saith he, <hi>is this; the Father is God, the Son God and the Holy Ghost; but they are not three Gods but one God.</hi> And yet (which our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> may wonder at) this very man hath written a learned Book of <hi>Arithmetick.</hi> But how doth he make this out? How is it possible for <hi>Three to be but One?</hi> First he shews, <q>That there can be but one Divine Essence; for to make more than One must suppose a Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. <hi>Principium enim Pluralitatis Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas est.</hi> If you make a real difference in Nature as the <hi>Arians</hi> did, then there must be as many Gods, as there are different Natures. Among men, there are different individuals of the same kind; but, saith he, it is the Diversity of Accidents which makes it; and if you can abstract from all other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, yet they must have a different Place, for two Bodies cannot be in the same place. The Divine Essence is simple and immaterial, and is what it is of it self; but other things are what they are made, and consist of Parts, and therefore may be divided. Now that which is of it self can be but One; and therefore cannot be numbred. And one God cannot differ from another, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100626:69"/>
by Accidents or substantial Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. But saith he, there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Number; one by which we reckon; and another in the things reckoned. And the repeating of Units in the former makes a Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,<note rend="inter">Numerus enim du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex est, unus quidem, quo numeramus, alter verò qui in rebus nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilibus constat; Ergo in Numero quo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus, repetitio unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum facit Pluritatem; in rerum vero numero non facit Pluralitatem Unitatum repetitio.</note> but not in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It may be said, that this holds where there are only different Names for the same thing; but here is a real Distinction of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. But then he shews, "That the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Relation, can make no Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Essence; and where there is no Diversity, there can be but one Essence, although the different Relation may make three Persons.</q> This is the substance of what he saith concerning this Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,<note rend="inter">Ita igitur substantia continet Unitatem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio verò multiplicat Trinitatem.

               <p n="1">1. Between the <hi>Being of a thing,</hi> and a <hi>thing in Being.</hi> By the former we mean the Nature and Essential Properties of a thing; whereby it is distinguished from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100626:70"/>
all other kinds of Beings. So God and his Creatures are essentially distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from each other by such Attributes which are incommunicable; and the Creatures of several kinds are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Natures or Essences; for the Essence of a Man and of a Brute are not barely distinguished by <hi>Individuals,</hi> but by their kinds. And that which doth constitute a distinct kind is One and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible in it self: for the Essence of Man is but one and can be no more; for if there were more, the kind would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; so that there can be but one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature or Essence to all the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of that kind. But because these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals may be or may not be, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must distinguish them as they are in actual Being, from what they are in their common Nature; for that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the same, under all the Variety and Succession of Individuals.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We must now distinguish the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which belongs to the <hi>common Nature,</hi> from that which belongs to the Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in <hi>actual Being.</hi> And the <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Essence</hi> is twofold:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where the Essence and Existence are the same, <hi>i. e.</hi> where necessary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence doth belong to the Essence, as it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100626:71"/>
is in God, and in him alone; it being an essential and incommunicable Perfection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where the Existence is contingent, and belongs to the Will of another; and so it is in all Creatures, Intellectual and Material, whose actual being is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the Will of God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Existence</hi> may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to it self, and so it is called <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity</hi>; or a thing continuing the same with it self: the Foundation whereof in Man is that vital Principle which results from the Union of Soul and Body. For as long as that continues, notwithstanding the great variety of changes in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Parts, the Man continues entirely the same.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Existence</hi> as to Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals may be consider'd as to others, <hi>i. e.</hi> as every one stands divided from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other Individual of the same kind; although they do all partake of the same common Essence. And the clearing of this, is the main point, on which the right Notion of these matters depends.</p>
               <p>In order to that, we must consider two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What that is, whereby we perceive the difference of Individuals?</p>

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:100626:71"/>2. What that is, which really makes two Beings of the same kind to be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from each other?</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the reason of our Perception of the difference between Individuals of the same kind, it depends on these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Difference of outward Accidents, as Features, Age, Bulk, Meen, Speech, Habit and Place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Difference of inward Qualities and Dispositions; which we perceive by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and arise either from Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or Education, or Company, or acquired Habits.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the true ground of the real Difference between the Existence of one Individual from the rest, it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>separate Existence</hi> which it hath from all others. For that which gives it a Being distinct from all others and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Individual Properties, is the true ground of the difference between them, and that can be no other but the Will of God.

be a distinct Mind in Being from all other Minds, before it can reflect upon it self.</p>
               <p>But we are not yet come to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this matter. For as to <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Persons,</hi> there are these things still to be consider'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Actual Existence</hi> in it self, which hath a <hi>Mode</hi> belonging to it, or else the humane Nature of Christ could not have been united with the divine, but it must have had the <hi>personal Subsistence,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently there must have been <hi>two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> in <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A <hi>separate</hi> and <hi>divided Existence</hi> from all others, which arises from the actual Existence, but may be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it; and so the humane Nature of Christ, although it had the Subsistence proper to Being, yet had not a <hi>separate Existence,</hi> after the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>peculiar manner</hi> of <hi>Subsistence,</hi> which lies in such properties as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable to any other; and herein lies the proper reason of <hi>Personality.</hi> Which doth not consist in a meer <hi>Intelligent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but in that peculiar manner of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence in that Being which can be in no other. For when the common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth subsist in Individuals, there is not only a separate Existence, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100626:72"/>
so peculiar to it self, that it can be communicated to no other. And this is that which makes the distinction of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a <hi>common Nature</hi> which must be joyned with this manner of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence to make a <hi>Person</hi>; otherwise it would be a meer <hi>Mode</hi>; but we never conceive a <hi>Person</hi> without the Essence in Conjunction with it. But here appears no manner of contradiction in asserting several Persons in one and the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Individuals of the same kind are said to differ in number from each other, because of their different Accidents and separate Existence. For so they are capable of being numbred. Whatever is compounded is capable of number as to its parts, and may be said to be one by the Union of them; whatever is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from another is capable of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by distinction. But where there can be no Accidents nor Division, there must be perfect Unity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There must be a <hi>Separation in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> where-ever there is a difference of Individuals under the same kind. I do not say there must be an <hi>actual Separation</hi> and <hi>Division</hi> as to place, but that there is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100626:73"/>
and must be so in Nature, where one <hi>common Nature</hi> subsists in several Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals.<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3.

1. That there is no Person where there is no intelligent Nature to make it a Person, and so we grant it. 2. That a Person implies an intelligent Being, separate and divided from other Individuals of the same kind, as it is among men: and so we deny it as to the Persons of the Trinity, because the Divine Essence is not capable of such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and Separation as the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is.</p>

                  </note> then I hope the Fathers are freed from holding <hi>Contradictions</hi> in the Doctrine of the Trinity; for what <hi>Contradiction</hi> can it be, to hold three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Persons in the Godhead, and One common Nature, more than it is to hold that there are three humane Persons in <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>same common Nature</hi> of Man?

But some have so used themselves to the Language of <hi>Iargon, Nonsense, Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Impossibility,</hi> that it comes from them, as some men swear, when they do not know it. But I am not willing to go off
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100626:74"/>
with this Answer; for I do take the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to have been men of too great Sense and Capacity to have maintained such an absurd Opinion, as that of a <hi>Specifick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in God. For either it is a mere Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Notion, and Act of the Mind without any real Existence belonging to it as such, which is contrary to the very Notion of God, which implies a necessary Existence; or it must imply a Divine Nature, which is neither Father, Son, nor Holy Ghost. Which is so repugnant to the Doctrine of the Fathers, that no one that is any ways conversant in their Writings on this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, can imagine they should hold such an Opinion. And I am so far from being convinced by <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> his <hi>undeniable Proofs,</hi> that I think it no hard matter to bring <hi>undeniable Proofs</hi> that he hath mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken their meaning.</p>

                     </gap> which may extend to Individuals of the same kind.</hi> Who denies it? But the Question is whether the Fathers used it in that sense, so as to imply a difference of Individuals in the same common Essence? There were two things aimed at by them in their Dispute with the <hi>Arians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) To shew, That the Son was of the same Substance with the Father, which they denied, and made him of an inferior created Substance, of another kind. Now the Fathers thought this term very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to express their Sense against them. But then this Word being capable of a larger Sense than they intended, they took care, (2.) To assert a perfect Unity and Indivisibility of the Divine Essence. For the <hi>Arians</hi> were very ready to charge them with one of these two things. (1.) That they must fall into <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> if they held a perfect Unity of Essence: or (2.) When they clear'd themselves of this, that they must hold <hi>Three Gods</hi>; and both these they constantly denied. To make this clear, I shall produce the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100626:78"/>
want of this, some assert but one Hypostasis, as well as one Essence; and others, because there are three Hypostases, suppose there are three distinct Essences.</hi> For both went upon the same Ground, that <hi>Hypostasis</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> were the same.

                  <hi>a Division of Substances.</hi> From whence it follows, that S. <hi>Basil</hi> did look upon the Notion of three distinct Substances as a mistake: I say <hi>distinct Substances,</hi> as <hi>Individuals</hi> are distinct; for so the first Principles of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy do own that Individuals make a <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100626:78"/>
to the divine Nature? For therein lies the whole difficulty. Doth he own such a <hi>Community of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Distinction of Individuals</hi> there? He first confesses the divine Nature to be incomprehensible by us; but yet we may have some distinct Notions about these things. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>In the Father we conceive something common to him and to the Son; and that is the divine Essence: and the same as to the Holy Ghost. But there must be some proper characters to distinguish these, one from another; or else there will be nothing but confusion:</hi> which is <hi>Sabellianism.</hi> Now <hi>the essential Attributes and divine Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are common to them;</hi> and therefore these cannot distinguish them from each other. And those are the <hi>peculiar Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of each Person,</hi> as he shews at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But may not each Person have a distinct Essence belonging to him, as we see it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this S. <hi>Basil</hi> answers: (1.) He ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denies any possible <hi>Division in the divine Nature.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Phot. Cod. 24.</note> who was very able to judge.

That he makes the divine Essence to be <hi>uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of number,</hi> by reason of its perfect U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

                  </gap>mself. For, they say, <hi>That he held, that as to this question, How many Gods? it must be answered, Three Gods in number, or three Personal Gods, and one in

Nature, or divine Properties</hi>; whereas he is so far from giving such an answer, that he absolutely denies that there can be more Gods than one in that very place. He mentions it as an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that since he said, <hi>That the Father is God, the Son God, the Holy Ghost God; he must hold three Gods;</hi> to which he answers, <hi>We own but one God, not in Number, but in Nature:</hi> Then say they, <hi>He held but one God in Nature and more in Number.</hi> That is so far from his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I hardly think any that read the passage in S. <hi>Basil,</hi> could so wilfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his meaning. For his intention was so far from asserting <hi>more Gods in Number,</hi> that it was to prove so perfect a Unity in God, that he was not capable of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or of being <hi>more</hi> than <hi>one.</hi> For, saith he, <hi>That which is said to be one in Number, is not really and simply one, but is made up of many, which by composition become one; as we say, the world is one, which is made up of many things. But God is a simple uncompounded Being; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be said to be one in Number. But the World is not one by Nature, because it is made up of so many things, but it is one by Number, as those several parts make but one World.</hi> Is not this fair dealing with such a Man as S. <hi>Basil,</hi> to represent his

Sense quite otherwise than it is? As though he allow'd <hi>more Gods than one in Number? Number,</hi> saith he again, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Quantity, and Quantity to Bodies, but what relation have these to God, but as he is the Maker of them?</hi>

               <p n="1">1. It cannot be denied, that he asserts the <hi>Vnity of Essence</hi> to be <hi>Indivisible in it self,</hi> and to be the true ground of the Denomination of Individuals; as <hi>Peter</hi> hath the name of a Man, not from his <hi>individual Properties,</hi> whereby he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> but from that <hi>one indivisible Essence,</hi> which is common to them all, but yet receives no Addition or Diminution in any of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He grants a <hi>Division</hi> of <hi>Hypostases</hi> among Men, notwithstanding this <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibility of one common Essence</hi>: For saith he; among Men, although the Essence remain one and the same in all, without any Division;<note place="margin">

                  </note> yet <hi>the several Hypostases are divided from each other, according to the individual Properties belonging to them.</hi> So that here is a double consideration of the Essence: as in it self, so it is one and indivisible; as it subsists in Individuals, and so it is actually divided according to the Subjects. For although the Essence of a Man be the same in it self, in <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>; yet taking it as in the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100626:82"/>
Individuals, so the particular Essence in each of them is divided from the rest. And so <hi>Philoponus</hi> took <hi>Hypostasis</hi> for <hi>an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence individuated by peculiar Properties;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Niceph. Calist. hist. <hi>l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 47.</note> and therefore asserted, that where-ever there was an <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> there must be a distinct Essence; and from hence he held the three Persons to have three distinct Essences.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He expresses his meaning fully in another place. For in his <hi>Catechetical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg. Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, Tom. III. <hi>p.</hi>
                  </note> he saith, <hi>he looks on the Doctrine of the Trinity as a profound Mystery</hi> (which three <hi>individual Persons</hi> in one <hi>specifick Nature</hi> is far from.) But wherein lies it? Chiefly in this, <hi>That there should be Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and no Number; different View and yet but One; a distinction of Hypostases, and yet no Division in the Subjects.</hi> For so his words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which is contrary to what he said of <hi>human Hypostases.</hi> Now, what is the <hi>Subject</hi> in this case?

overthrow any such <hi>Individuals,</hi> as are among Men. These are the chief Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies out of the <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> whose authority <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> and others rely most upon, as to this matter, which I have therefore more particularly examin'd.</p>
               <p>But S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> saith <hi>Curcellaeus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cur. <hi>n.</hi> 48.</note> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to <hi>Damasus, thought three Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses implied three distinct Substances; and therefore when the</hi> Campenses <hi>would have him own them, he refused it and asked his Advice.</hi> Then it is plain, S. <hi>Ierom</hi> would not own <hi>three distinct Substances,</hi> and so could not be of <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> his mind.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>N.</hi> 107.</note> 
                  <hi>as the</hi> Arians <hi>did.</hi> But how doth that appear? <hi>Doth he not say, the</hi> Arian <hi>Bishop, and the</hi> Campenses <hi>put him upon it?</hi> But who was this <hi>Arian Bishop,</hi> and these <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses?</hi> No other than the <hi>Meletian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> for <hi>Meletius</hi> was brought in by the <hi>Arians,</hi> but he joyned against them with S. <hi>Basil</hi> and others, who asserted three <hi>Hypostases;</hi> and the <hi>Campenses</hi> were his People who met without the Gates, as the Historians tell us. But it is evident by S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> that the Latin Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>Hypostasis</hi> to be the same then with <hi>Substance;</hi> and the reason why they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100626:84"/>
would not allow three <hi>Hypostases,</hi> was, because they would not assert <hi>three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</hi> So that <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> his <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> hath very little colour for it among the <hi>Latin Fathers;</hi> since S. <hi>Ierom</hi> there saith, it would be <hi>Sacrilege to hold three Substances,</hi> and he freely bestows an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema</hi> upon any one that asserted more than one.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Hilary,</hi> saith <hi>Curcellaeus, owns a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Vnity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cur. <hi>n.</hi> 89.</note> for in his Book <hi>de Synodis,</hi> he shews, <hi>That by one Substance, they did not mean one individual Substance, but such as was in</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Seth, <hi>that is of the same kind.</hi> No man asserts the <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination</hi> of the divine Substance more fully and frequently than he doth; and that without any Difference or Variation, as to the Father and the Son.

               </p>
               <p>But doth he not say, <hi>That he hath a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate and proper Substance of his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Nature from God, the Father?</hi>

               <p>How can the <hi>Substance be distinct,</hi> if it be the very same; and the <hi>Son subsist in that Substance of which he was begotten?</hi> And that <hi>Hilary</hi> (besides a multitude of passages to the same purpose in him) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood of two distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances will appear by this Evidence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arians</hi> in their Confession of Faith before the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> set down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the several Heresies which they condemned;<note place="margin">Hilar. de Trinit. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 12.</note> that of <hi>Hieracas,</hi> who said <hi>the Father and Son were like two Lamps shining out of one common Vessel of Oil.

                  <hi>The one true God is three distinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and three distinct Persons, Father, Son and Holy Ghost are the one true God. Which is plainly, as if a Man should say,</hi> Peter, James <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>being three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are one Man; and one Man is these three distinct Persons,</hi> Peter, James <hi>and</hi> John. <hi>Is it not now a ridiculous attempt as well as a barbarous Indignity, to go about thus to make Asses of all Mankind, under pretence of teaching them a Creed.</hi> This is very freely spoken, with respect, not merely to our Church, but the Christian World, which owns this Creed to be a <hi>just and true Explication</hi> of the Doctrine of the Trinity. But there are some Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as remarkable for their untoward
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100626:87"/>
kicking, as for their Stupidity. And is not this great skill in these Matters, to make such a Parallel between <hi>three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Godhead,</hi> and <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn?</hi> Do they think there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between an infinitely perfect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and such finite limited Creatures as Individuals among Men are? Do they suppose the divine Nature capable of such <hi>Division</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> by Individuals, as human Nature is? <hi>No,</hi> they may say, <hi>but ye who hold three Persons must think so:</hi> For what reason? We do assert three Persons, but it is on the account of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, and in such a manner, as the divine Nature is capable of it. For it is a good rule of <hi>Boethius, Talia sunt praedicata, qualia subjecta permiserint.</hi> We must not say that there are Persons in the Trinity, but in such a manner as is agreeable to the divine Nature; and if that be not capable of <hi>Division</hi> and <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> then the Persons must be in the same undivided Essence. The next Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is, Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance; <hi>But how can we,</hi> say they, <hi>not confound the Persons that have, as ye say, but one numerical Substance? And how can we but divide the Substance, which we find in three distinct di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100626:87"/>
Persons?</hi> I think the terms <hi>numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Substance,</hi> not very proper in this case; and I had rather use the Language of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> than of the <hi>Schools</hi>; and some of the most judicious and learned Fathers would not allow the terms of <hi>one numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Substance</hi> to be applied to the divine Essence. For their Notion was, That <hi>Number</hi> was only proper for compound B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ep. 141.</note> nor hath any besides himself to be reckon'd with him. But because there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Hypostases,</hi> therefore they allow'd the use of <hi>Number</hi> about them, and so we may say the Hypostases or Persons are <hi>numerically different</hi>; but we cannot say that the Essence is <hi>one Numerically.</hi> But why must they <hi>confound the Persons, if there be but one Essence?</hi> The relative Properties cannot be confounded; for the Father cannot be the Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the Son the Father; and on these the difference of Persons is founded. For, there can be no difference, as to essential Properties, and therefore all the difference, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distinction must be from those that are Relative. A Person of it self imports
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100626:88"/>
no <hi>Relation,</hi> but the Person of the Father or of the Son must; and these Relations cannot be confounded with one another. And if the Father cannot be the Son, nor the Son the Father, then they must be distinct from each other. But how? <hi>By dividing the Substance?</hi> That is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a Substance that is indivisible. It may be said, <hi>That the Essence of created Beings is indivisible, and yet there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Persons.</hi> I grant it, but then a created Essence is capable of different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and qualities to divide one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from another, which cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the divine Nature; and withall the same power which gives a Being to a created Essence, gives it a separate and divided Existence from all others. As when <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> received their several distinct Personalities from God; at the same time he gave them their separate Beings from each other, although the same Essence be in them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how can we but divide the Substance which we see in three distinct divided Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?</hi> The question is, whether the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Properties of the Persons do imply a <hi>Division</hi> of the <hi>Substance?</hi> We deny that the <hi>Persons</hi> are <hi>divided</hi> as to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> because that is impossible to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100626:88"/>
but we say, they are and must be distinguished as to those incommunicable Properties which make the Persons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct. The <hi>essential Properties</hi> are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being divided, and the <hi>Relations</hi> cannot be confounded; so that there must be <hi>one undivided Substance</hi> and yet <hi>three distinct</hi> Persons.</p>

                  <hi>But every Person must have his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Substance; and so the Substance must be divided if there be three Persons.</hi> That every Person must have a <hi>Substance</hi> to support his Subsistence is not denied, but the question is, Whether that <hi>Substance</hi> must be <hi>divided</hi> or not. We say, where the Substance will bear it, as in created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, a Person hath a separate substance, <hi>i. e.</hi> the same Nature diversified by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, Qualities and a separate Existence, but where these things cannot be, there the <hi>same Essence</hi> must remain undivided, but with such <hi>relative Properties</hi> as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confounded. <hi>But may not the same undivided Substance be communicated to three divided Persons; so as that each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may have his own proper Substance, and yet the divine Essence be in it self undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</hi> This is not the case before us. For the question upon the Creed is, Whether the Substance can be divided? And here
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100626:89"/>
it is allow'd to remain undivided. <hi>Yes in it self, but it may be divided in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> The Substance, we say, is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being divided any way; and to say, that a Substance wholly undivided in it self, is yet divided into as many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar Substances, as there are Persons, doth not at all help our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in this matter; but if no more be meant, as is expresly declared, than <hi>That the same one divine Nature is wholly and entirely communicated by the eternal Father to the eternal Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by Father and Son to the eternal Spirit, without any Division or Separation;</hi> it is the same which all <hi>Trinitarians</hi> assert. And it is a great pity, that any <hi>new Phrases</hi> or Ways of Expression should cause unreasonable Heats among those who are really of the same Mind. For those who oppose the expressions of <hi>three distinct Substances</hi> as new and dangerous; yet grant, <hi>That it is one peculiar Prerogative of the divine Nature and Substance, founded in its infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and therefore transcendent Perfection, whereby it is capable of residing in more Persons than one; and is accordingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from the Father to the Son and Holy Ghost; but this is done without any Division or Multiplication.</hi> Now if both
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100626:89"/>
Parties mean what they say, where lies the difference? It is sufficient for my purpose that they are agrred, that there can be no <hi>Division</hi> as to the <hi>divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> by the distinction of Persons. And so this passage of the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed holds good, <hi>Neither confounding the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons nor dividing the Substance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Article, as it is set down in the <hi>Notes on</hi> Athanasius <hi>his Creed,</hi> is a contradiction to this. For there it runs, <q>There is one Substance of the Father, another of the Son, another of the Holy Ghost.</q> They might well charge it with <hi>Contradictions</hi> at this rate. But that is a plain mistake for <hi>Person;</hi> for there is no other variety in the Copies but this, that <hi>Baysius</hi> his Greek Copy hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and that of <hi>Constantinople</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but all the Latin Copies <hi>Persona.</hi> But what consequence do they draw from hence? <hi>Then,</hi> say they, <hi>the Son is not the Father, nor is the Father the Son, nor the Holy Ghost either of them.</hi> If they had put in <hi>Person,</hi> as they ought to have done, it is what we do own. And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? <hi>If the Father be not the Son, and yet is the one true God, then the Son is not the one true God, because he is not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> The <hi>one true God</hi> may be taken
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100626:90"/>
two ways: 1. The <hi>one true God,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>true divine Nature</hi> in him, and so the <hi>Father</hi> is the <hi>one true God;</hi> but not exclusive of the Son, if he have the same <hi>divine Nature.</hi> 2. The <hi>one true God,</hi> as having the <hi>divine Nature</hi> so <hi>wholly in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> as to make it incommunicable to the Son; <hi>so</hi> we do not say, that the Father is <hi>the one true God,</hi> because this must exclude the Son from being God; which the Scripture assures us that he is; and therefore though the Son be not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor the Father the Son, yet the Son may be the <hi>one true God</hi> as well as the Father, because they both partake of the <hi>same divine Nature,</hi> so that there is no contradiction in this, <hi>That there is but one true God, and one of the Persons is not the other.</hi> For that supposes it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there should be three Persons in the same Nature; but if the distinction of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> be allow'd, as it must be by all that understand any thing of these matters, then it must be granted, that although one Person cannot be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet they may have the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Essence. As for instance, let us take their own, <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> What pleasant arguing would this be, <hi>Peter</hi> is not <hi>Iames</hi> nor <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor <hi>Iames</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:100626:90"/>
nor <hi>Iohn</hi> are <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> hath the true Essence of a Man in him; and the true Essence is but one and indivisible; and therefore <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> cannot be true Men, because <hi>Peter</hi> hath the <hi>One</hi> and <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Essence</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> in him? But they will say, <hi>We cannot say that</hi> Peter <hi>is the One true Man,</hi> as we say, <hi>That the Father is the One true God.</hi> Yes; we say the same in other Words, for he can be said to be the <hi>One true God</hi> in no other Respect, but as he hath the <hi>One true Divine Essence.</hi> All the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference lies, that a finite Nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>Division,</hi> but an infinite is not.</p>
               <p>It follows, <q>The Godhead of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one, the Glory Equal, the Majesty Co-eternal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this they say, <hi>That this Article doth impugn and destroy it self.</hi> How so? <hi>For, if the Glory and Majesty be the same in Number, then it can be neither Equal, nor Co-eternal. Not Equal for it is the same, which Equals never are, nor Co-eternal for that intimates that they are distinct. For, nothing is Co eternal, nor Co temporary with it self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no appearance of Difficulty or Contradiction in this, if the Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Persons</hi> is allowed; for the <hi>three
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100626:91"/>
Persons</hi> may be well said to be <hi>Co-equal and Co-eternal;</hi> and if we <hi>Honour the Son, as we Honour the Father,</hi> we must give <hi>equal Glory</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>But one great Point of <hi>Contradiction</hi> remains, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>So that the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and yet there are not three Gods; but one God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>First, they say, <hi>This is as if a Man should say, the Father is a Person, the Son a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Holy Ghost a Person, yet there are not three Persons; but one Person.</hi> How is this possible, if a <hi>Person</hi> doth suppose some <hi>peculiar Property,</hi> which must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish him from all others? And how can <hi>three Persons</hi> be <hi>one Person,</hi> unless three incommunicable Properties may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one communicated Property to three Persons? But they are aware of a Distinction in this Case, <hi>viz.</hi> that the term God is used <hi>Personally,</hi> when it is said <hi>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost;</hi> but when it is said, <hi>There are not three Gods, but one God, the term God is used Essentially,</hi> and therefore compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the whole three Persons, so that there is neither a <hi>Grammatical,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Notes on</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanas. <hi>his Creed,</hi> p. 13.</note> nor <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical Contradiction.</hi> And what say our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> to this? Truly, no less, <hi>Than
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100626:91"/>
that the Remedy is worse, (if possible) than the Disease.</hi> Nay then, we are in a very ill Case. But how I pray doth this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? 1. Say they, <hi>Three personal Gods, and one Essential God make four Gods; if the Essential God be not the same with the personal Gods: and tho' he is the same, yet since they are not the same with one another, but distinct, it follows, that there are three Gods,</hi> i. e. <hi>three personal Gods.</hi> 2. <hi>It intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces two sorts of Gods, three Personal and one Essential. But the Christian Religion knows and owns but One, true and most high God of any sort.</hi> So far then, we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, <hi>That there is but One, true and most high God;</hi> and that because of the perfect <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Essence,</hi> which can be no more than One, and where there is but <hi>One Divine Essence,</hi> there can be but <hi>One true God,</hi> unless we can suppose a God without an Essence, and that would be a strange sort of God. He would be a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal God</hi> indeed in their critical Sense of a <hi>Person</hi> for a shape or appearance. <hi>But may not the fame Essence be divided</hi>? That I have already shew'd to be impossible. Therefore we cannot make so many <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Gods,</hi> because we assert one and the same Essence in the three Persons of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. <hi>But they
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100626:92"/>
are distinct, and therefore must be distinct Gods, since every one is distinct from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> They are distinct as to <hi>personal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi> but not as to <hi>Essential Attributes;</hi> which are and must be the same in all: So that here is but one Essential God, and three Persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But after all, why do we assert three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Godhead?</hi> Not because we find them in the <hi>Athanasian Creed;</hi> but because the Scripture hath revealed that there are <hi>Three,</hi> Father, Son and Holy Ghost; to whom the Divine Nature and Attributes are given. This we verily believe, that the Scripture hath revealed; and that there are a great many places, of which, we think no tolerable Sense can be given without it, and therefore we assert this Doctrine on the same Grounds, on which we believe the Scriptures. And if there are <hi>three Persons</hi> which have the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> attributed to them; what must we do in this Case? Must we cast off the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Divine Essence</hi>? No, that is too frequently and plainly asserted for us to call it into Question. Must we reject those Scriptures which attribute Divinity to the Son and Holy Ghost, as well as to the Father? That we cannot do, unless we cast off those Books of Scripture, wherein
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100626:92"/>
those things are contained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But why do we call them Persons, when that Term is not found in Scripture, and is of a doubtful Sense?</hi> The true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whereof I take to be this. It is observed by <hi>Facundus Hermianensis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Facund. <hi>l</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 19. Ed. Serm.</note> that <hi>the Christian Church received the Doctrine of the Trinity before the Terms of three Persons were used. But</hi> Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism <hi>was the occasion of making use of the name of Persons.</hi> It's true, That the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellians</hi> did not dislike our Sense of the Word <hi>Person,</hi> (which they knew was not the Churches Sense) as it was taken for an <hi>Appearance,</hi> or an <hi>external Quality;</hi> which was consistent enough with their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi> who allow'd but <hi>One real Person</hi> with <hi>different Manifestations.</hi> That this was their true Opinion, appears from the best account we have of their Doctrine, from the first Rise of <hi>Sabellianism.</hi> The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of it were laid in the earliest and most dangerous Heresies in the Christian Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is commonly called by the name of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and that of the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> and <hi>Ebionites.</hi> For how much soever they differ'd from each other in other things; yet they both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in this, that there was no such thing as a <hi>Trinity,</hi> consisting of <hi>Father, Son and

                  </gap>ood so as to be consistent with the <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Vnity</hi> of the <hi>divine Essence.</hi> And the great rule of the Christian Church was to keep in the middle, between the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Arius;</hi> and so by degrees, the Notion of <hi>three Hypostases</hi> and <hi>one Essence</hi> was look'd on in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Church, as the most proper Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination of the Orthodox from the <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Arians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Latin Church was not so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to the use of three <hi>Hypostases,</hi> because they knew no other Sense of it, but for <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi>; and they all denied that there was any more than <hi>one divine Substance,</hi> and therefore they rather embraced the Word <hi>Persona</hi>; and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100626:95"/>
did agree in the Name of <hi>Persons,</hi> as most proper to signifie their meaning, which was, <hi>That there were three which had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Subsistences, and incommunicable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and one and the same divine Essence.</hi> And since the Notion of it is so well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, to signifie such a peculiar Sense, I see no reason why any should scruple the use of it. As to its <hi>not being used in Scripture, Socinus</hi> himself despises it, and allows it to be no good reason. For when <hi>Franciscus Davides</hi> objected, <hi>That the terms of Essence and Person were not in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; Socinus</hi> tells him,<note place="margin">Socin.

                  <hi>That they expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their cause who went upon such grounds; and that if the sense of them were in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it was no matter whether the terms were or not.</hi>

                  </gap>ving thus clear'd the Notion of <hi>three Persons,</hi> I return to the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> about these matters. And our <hi>Vnitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> tell us, that <hi>we ought to interpret Scripture otherwise.</hi> How doth that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100626:96"/>
which if they do not mean, what to honest and sincere Minds they appear to do, must be intended (according to them) to set up <hi>Christ</hi> a <hi>meer Man</hi> to be <hi>a God.</hi> And if such a thought as this could enter into the Mind of a thinking Man, it would tempt him to suspect much more as to those Writings than there is the least colour or reason for. Therefore these bold inconsiderate Writers ought to reflect on the consequence of such sort of Arguments, and if they have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Christianity, not to trifle with <hi>Scripture</hi> as they do.</p>
               <p>But say they, <hi>The question only is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought to interpret Scripture when it speaks of God,</hi>

               <p>But if that be not taken as an <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of his being <hi>the eternal Son of God,</hi> how doth this prove him <hi>above Angels?</hi>

               <p>In answer to this, we may say in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that <hi>Morinus</hi> his great Proofs are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast</hi> of very small Reputation, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Ionathan</hi> upon the Law; and not that of <hi>Onkelos,</hi> which <hi>Rittangel</hi> relied upon in this Matter. And none can deny this to have been very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; but the <hi>Iews</hi> have so little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their own History, but what is in Scripture, that very little certainty can be had from them. But we must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Circumstances of things, if we would come to any resolution in this Matter. Now it is certain, that <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Alexandrian Iew,</hi> who lived so very near our Saviours time, had the same Notion of <hi>the Word of God,</hi> which is in the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee Paraphrast</hi>: whose Testimonies have been produced by so many already, that I need not to repeat them.</p>

               <p>The Substance of what I have said, as to S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Notion of the <hi>Word</hi> is this; That there is no colour for the Sense which <hi>Socinus</hi> hath put upon it; either from the use of it among other Authors, or any Interpretation among the Jews. But that there was in his time a current sense of it, which from the Jews of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was dispersed by <hi>Cerinthus</hi> in those parts where he lived. That for such a Notion there was a very ancient Tradition among the Jews, which appears in the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Paraphrase of the Law, which is read in their Synagogues. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to all reasonable ways of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100626:102"/>
interpreting Scripture, the <hi>Word</hi> cannot be understood in S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> for one whose Office it was <hi>to preach the Word,</hi> but for that <hi>Word</hi> which <hi>was with God</hi> before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing was made, and <hi>by whom all things were made.</hi>

But if no more were meant by the Word, but a divine Attribute of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> what colour could there be for the <hi>Son of Man</hi> taking that to himself, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to an Attribute of God? What strange way of arguing would this have been? <hi>What, and if ye shall see the Son of Man ascending where he was before</hi>? For according to this Sense, how comes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Attribute to be called the <hi>Son of Man</hi>? How could the <hi>Son of Man</hi> be said <hi>to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend</hi> thither, where a divine Attribute was before? The words <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100626:106"/>
of God be ever said to be the <hi>Son of Man</hi>? But if we suppose a personal Union of the Word with the human Nature in Christ, then we have a very reasonable Sense of the Words; for then no more is imply'd, but that Christ, as consisting of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, should ascend thither, where the <hi>Word was before;</hi> when it is said, that <hi>the Word was with God;</hi> and so <hi>Grotius</hi> understands it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Grotius</hi> doth not make <hi>the Word</hi> in <hi>the beginning of S.</hi> John<hi>'s Gospel to be a mere Attribute of Wisdom and Power,</hi> but <hi>the eternal Son of God.</hi> This I shall prove from his own Words.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He asserts in his <hi>Preface</hi> to S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Gospel,</hi> that the chief cause of his writing was universally agreed to have been to prevent the spreading of that Venom which had been then dispersed in the Church; which he understands of the <hi>Heresies</hi> about Christ and the Word. Now among these, the Heresie of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was this very opinion which they fasten upon <hi>Grotius;</hi> viz. that the <hi>Word was the divine Wisdom and Power inhabiting in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Iesus,</hi> as I have shew'd before from themselves. And besides, <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, <hi>That the other Evangelists had only intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the divine Nature of Christ from his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Conception, Miracles, knowing Mens
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100626:107"/>
Hearts, perpetual Presence, promise of the Spirit, remission of Sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But S.</hi> John, <hi>as the time required, attributed the Name and Power of God to him from the beginning.</hi> So that by the <hi>Name and Power of God,</hi> he means the same which he called <hi>the divine Nature</hi> before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He saith, that when it is said, <hi>The Word was with God;</hi> it ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as <hi>Ignatius</hi> explains it, <hi>with the Father</hi>; what can this mean, unless he understood the Word to be <hi>the eternal Son of God?</hi> And he quotes <hi>Tertullian,</hi> saying, that <hi>he is the Son of God, and God</hi> ex unitate Substantiae; <hi>and that there was a Prolation of the Word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Separation.</hi> Now what <hi>Prolation</hi> can there be of a meer Attribute? How can that be said to be <hi>the Son of God begotten of the Father, without Division, before all Worlds,</hi> as he quotes it from <hi>Iustin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr?</hi> And that <hi>he is the Word, and God of God,</hi> from <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus</hi>? And in the next Verse, when it is said, <hi>The same was in the beginning with God;</hi> it is repeated on purpose, saith he, That we might consider, that God is so to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that a Distinction is to be made between <hi>God, with whom he was, and the Word who was with God; so that the Word doth not comprehend all that is God.</hi> But
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100626:107"/>
our <hi>Wise Interpreters</hi> put a ridiculous Sense upon it; as though all that <hi>Grotius</hi> meant was, <hi>That Gods Attributes are the same with himself</hi> (which although true in it self, is very impertinent to <hi>Grotius</hi> his purpose) and that the Reason why he saith, <hi>That the Word is not all that God is,</hi> was, <hi>because there were other Attributes of God besides.</hi> But where doth <hi>Grotius</hi> say any thing like this? Is this <hi>Wise interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</hi> or honest and fair dealing? For <hi>Grotius</hi> immediately takes notice from thence of the Difference of <hi>Hypostases;</hi> which he saith was taken from the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> but with <hi>a change of the Sense.</hi>

Person by the same Figure of Speech, that</hi> Solomon <hi>saith, Wisdom hath builded her house,</hi> &amp;c. Doth <hi>Grotius</hi> say any thing like this? And yet they say, <hi>Let us hear</hi> Grotius <hi>interpreting this sublime Proeme of S.</hi> John<hi>'s Gospel.</hi> But they leave out what he saith, and put in what he doth not say; is not this <hi>interpreting like Wise men?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>These Sayings no doubt stuck with them; and therefore from them, they had Reason to think that he meant something extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, by his saying, <hi>I and my Father are One.</hi> And if they were so <hi>Wise</hi> in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scripture,</hi> as they pretend, they would have considered, that if these things did not imply his being really the Son of God, according to the old Jewish Notion, he would have severely checked any such

               <p n="1">1. <hi>They make no Question but some Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is due to the Lord Christ,</hi>

                  <hi>but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is concerning the kind or sort of Worship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They distinguish three sorts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> 1. <hi>Civil Worship from Men to one another.</hi> 2. <hi>Religious Worship given on the account of a Persons Holiness, or Relation to God; which is more or less, according to their Sanctity or nearer Relation to God</hi> 3. <hi>Divine Worship which belongs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God; which consists in a Resignation of our Vnderstandings, Wills and Affections, and some peculiar Acts of Reverence and Love towards him. The two former may be given to Christ,</hi> they say, <hi>but not the last.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence it follows, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not according to their own Principles, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign their Vnderstandings, Wills, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> to Christ; because this is <hi>proper Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship.</hi> Are not these very good
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100626:112"/>
Christians the mean while? How can they believe sincerely, and heartily what he hath revealed, unless they <hi>resign their Vnderstandings</hi> to him; How can they Love and Esteem him, and place their Happiness in him, if they cannot <hi>resign their Wills and Affections</hi> to him? I think never any who pretended to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, durst venture to say such things before and all for fear they should be thought to give <hi>Divine Worship to Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they confess, <hi>That they are divided among themselves about the Invocation of Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. Col. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Those who are for it,</hi> say, <hi>That he may be the object of Prayer, without making him God, or a Person of God, and without ascribing to him the Properties of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, Omnipresence, Omniscience, or Omnipotence. Those who deny it,</hi> they say, <hi>do only refuse it, because they suppose he hath forbidden it, which makes it a meer Error. And in the New Testament,</hi> they say, <hi>The Charge is frequently renewed, that they are to Worship God only.</hi> And as great Writers as they have been these last seven years,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answer to Archbish.

And now I hope we understand their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion right as to this matter. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, Whether this be <hi>interpreting those Scriptures</hi> which speak of the <hi>Honour and Worship due to Christ, like wise Men?</hi> And for that I shall consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That herein they are gone off from the opinion of <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Followers, as to the <hi>Sense of Scripture</hi> in those places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they have done it in such a way, as will justifie the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Popish Idolatry;</hi> and therefore have not <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Scripture like wise Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That they are gone off from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers, who did allow <hi>divine Worship</hi> to Christ. This appears by the disputes he had with <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscus Davidis</hi> and <hi>Christianus Francken</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. The former was about the <hi>Sense of Scripture. Socinus</hi> produced all those places which mention <hi>the Invocation of Christ,</hi> and all those wherein S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with you all;</hi> and <hi>the Lord Iesus Christ direct our way,</hi> &amp;c. and all those where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a divine Power and Authority is given to Christ as head of the Church, for the support of the Faith and Hope of all those who believe in him in order to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this <hi>Socinus</hi> truly judged to be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100626:113"/>
proper divine Worship. <hi>Georg. Blandrata</hi> was unsatisfied, that <hi>Socinus</hi> did not say enough to prove the necessity of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Christ, which he said he could do <hi>from his Priesthood and his Power, from the Examples of the Apostles, and the very Nature of Adoration.</hi> And <hi>Blandrata</hi> was a Man of great authority among the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians;</hi> and he thought <hi>Socinus</hi> ought to assert the <hi>necessity</hi> of it; or else he would do <hi>injury both to Christ and to his Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the dispute with <hi>Francken, Socinus</hi> went upon this ground, that divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was a sufficient ground for divine Worship, although there were not those essential Attributes of <hi>Omnisciency</hi> and <hi>Omnipotency.</hi> But I observe, that <hi>Socinus</hi> did not look on this as a matter of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> now seem to do; for in the Preface to the former Dispute, he calls the Error of denying the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, not, as they now do, a <hi>simple Error</hi> or a <hi>mere mistake;</hi> but a <hi>most filthy and pernicious Error, an Error that leads to Iudaism, and is in effect the deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ;</hi> and in the latter Dispute he saith, <hi>That it tends to Epicurism and Atheism.</hi>

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:100626:113"/>2. Is it <hi>like wise Men,</hi> to go upon such grounds as will justifie both <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Idolatry?</hi> This they have been char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with, and we shall see what wise Men they are, by the Defences they make for themselves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Pagan Idolatry,</hi> they say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They had no divine command for such a Worship.</hi> This was well thought of,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Defence of the Hist. of the</hi> Unit. <hi>p.</hi> 54.</note> when they confess, that some among themselves deny that there is any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for invocating Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must charge all those who do it with Idolatry. But this is no very wise Notion of Idolatry, which depends upon the Nature of the Worship, and not the meer positive Will of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They set up the Creatures more than the Creator, as S.</hi> Paul <hi>saith.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not think them such Fools, that they took the Creatures to be above the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, which was impossible, while they owned one to be the Creator and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Creatures; but that they g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve such acts of Worship to them, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to the Creator, and exceeded in the Worship of them those bounds which ought to be between them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They set up an infinite Number of Gods who had been mere Men.</hi> This is, as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100626:114"/>
if the question were only, whether one, or a great many were to have such Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship given them: as if it were a dispute about a Monarchy or a Common-wealth of Gods. But if it be lawfull to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship to one Creature, it is to a hundred.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Their Worship was terminated on them, and so they made true Gods of Men.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they asserted one supreme God, and made the rest subordinate to him, and appointed by him to be the immediate Directors of humane Affairs. I desire to know, Whether the Adoration of such were Idolatry or not? If it were, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excused who give Adoration to Christ, while they esteem him a mere Creature; if not, all the wiser Pagans must be excused.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Papists,</hi> the difference they make, is not like <hi>wise Interpreters of Scripture;</hi> for they say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They have no Text of Scripture, which commands them to worship S.</hi> Peter, <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>and S.</hi> Francis. So some among them say, there is none for the Invocation of Christ, and with them the case is Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel. But if <hi>Socinus</hi> his Principle be true, that communicated Excellency is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Foundation for Worship, because it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100626:114"/>
is relative to the Giver, then the Papists must be justified in all their relative Acts of Worship without any Text to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They exceed the Bounds of Honour and Respect due to glorified Saints.</hi> But who is to set these Bounds but themselves in all Acts of relative Worship, because they depend upon the intention of the Persons? And they hold the very same things concerning communicated Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Power from God, which our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> make use of to justifie their Notion of the Invocation of Christ.</p>

                  <hi>and that their first Translation was out of Syriac and not out of Greek.</hi> And the main point is, as to the <hi>old Greek Copies;</hi> and we are assured, that there is but One, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Clermont Copy</hi> which leaves out <hi>God,</hi> but that it is in the <hi>Alexandrian,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is therefore necessary to Examine in this place, the Authority of this <hi>Clermont Copy,</hi> (as it is called) whose reading is set up against all other ancient Greek Copies. <hi>Beza</hi> affirms it with great Confidence,<note place="margin">Verum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant perpetuo consensu omnes Graeci Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. <hi>Bez.</hi>

                  <hi>That all the Greek Copies have God with one Consent.</hi> But how comes he to take no notice of this Difference of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont Copy?</hi> For that he had a sight of that part of it, which hath the Epistles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> appears by his Notes in which he refers to it.

It seems by <hi>Morinus</hi> that in the <hi>Clermont Copy,</hi>

                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Beza</hi> observes, <hi>That the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latine leaves out part of the Verse, but that it is found in all the Greek Copies;</hi> here <hi>Morinus</hi> charges <hi>Beza</hi> with <hi>Negligence,</hi> or <hi>Dis-ingenuity</hi>; because it was left out in the <hi>Clermont Copy;</hi> but how doth he prove he had the same Copy? He saith indeed, <hi>That the ancient Copy, which he had was lent to</hi> Beza; but he tells not by whom, nor in whose Possession it was afterwards. But if <hi>Beza</hi> were a man of any ordinary Care or Honesty, he would never have concealed those things, which <hi>Morinus</hi> found in it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20, <hi>Beza</hi> saith, That those words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>are in all the Greek Copies; Morinus</hi> saith, <hi>That they
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100626:118"/>
were wanting in that which he made use of.</hi> It's true, they are wanting in the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian,</hi> and some others; but in none that <hi>Beza</hi> had the sight of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he may be believed. These are sufficient to shew, that there is no good Proof, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py which <hi>Beza</hi> had was the same which <hi>Morinus</hi> borrow'd; and therefore his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not to be slighted in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he affirms, that all the Greek Copies agreed in reading <hi>God manifest in the flesh;</hi> and I cannot imagine <hi>Beza</hi> so intolerably careless as he must have been, if <hi>Morinus</hi> his Copy and <hi>Beza's</hi> were the same. But whether it were in <hi>Beza</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or not, <hi>it's certain,</hi> they say, <hi>That it is not in that ancient Manuscript, which is called the Clermont Copy;</hi> which is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Morinus,</hi> and taken for granted by others, therefore we must enquire a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther into the Authority of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Copy. It appears by those who have view'd and considered them, that there are two very ancient Copies of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, so exactly agreeing, that one is supposed to be the Transcript of the other; one is in the King's Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the other in the Monastery of S. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains.</hi> Which <hi>Mabillon</hi> saith is a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years old.<note place="margin">Mabil. de Re Deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 346.</note> These two Copies are in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100626:118"/>
effect but one, agreeing so much where they differ from others; and having the old Latin Version opposite to the Greek. Monsieur <hi>Arnauld</hi> had so bad an Opinion of both parts of this <hi>Clermont Copy,</hi> (as it is called) that he charges it with manifest Forgery, and Imposture; inserting things into the Text without ground. <hi>F. Simon</hi> who defends them cannot deny several things to be inserted, but he saith, it was through Carelessness and not Design. But he Confesses,<note place="margin">Dissert. sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less MS. du Nov. Test. <hi>p.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>That those who transcribed both those ancient Copies of S.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Epistles did not understand Greek, and hardly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi> And now let us consider, of what just Authority this different reading of the <hi>Clermont Copy</hi> ought to be against the Consent of all other ancient Copies. We find some good Rules laid down by the Roman Criticks, when they had a Design under <hi>Vrban</hi> 8th. to compare the Greek Text of the New Testament, with their ancient Manuscripts in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and elewhere, and to publish an exact Edition of it (which Collation was preserved in the <hi>Barberin Library,</hi> and from thence published by <hi>Pet. Possinus.</hi>) And the main Rules as to the various Lections of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts were these, 1. That the Text was not to be alter'd but a Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100626:119"/>
of all, or the greatest part of the Manuscripts. 2. That if one Manuscript agreed with the vulgar Latin, the Text was not to be alter'd, but the Difference to be set down at the end of the Chapter. But it is observable in that <hi>Collation of Twenty two Manuscripts,</hi> there is no one Copy produced, wherein there is any Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety as to this place. I know they had not Twenty two Manuscripts of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, (they mention but Eight ancient Manuscripts) but they found no difference in those they had. And now I leave any reasonable man to judge, whether this <hi>Clermont Copy</hi> ought to be relied upon in this matter. But I have something more to say about the <hi>Greek Copies.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Erasmus <hi>mentions the great Consent of the old Copies as to the vulgar Latin, and whence should that come, but from a Variety in the old Greek Copies.</hi> To that I Answer,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Greek Copies,</hi> where they were best understood had no Variety in them; <hi>i. e.</hi> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves.

                  <hi>That they are not without their weight, but they have observed several things that make them think, that this Text is a genuine part of Scripture.</hi> Very <hi>Wisely</hi> and <hi>Discreetly</hi> spoken! The <hi>Reasons are strong and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> but they <hi>think otherwise.</hi> I wish they had told the World, who these <hi>learned Criticks</hi> were; lest it should be suspected that they were their own <hi>Inventions.</hi> But I find a certain <hi>Nameless Socinian</hi> was the Author of them; and his Words are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Sandius</hi> (a Person highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by them for his Industry and Learning,<note place="margin">Sand.

The reason of writing these Reasons <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> freely Confesses was, <hi>because this place clearly proved a Trinity of Persons against the</hi> Socinians. But what are these <hi>very
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100626:125"/>
strong and weighty Reasons?</hi> For it is great Pity, but they should be known.</p>
               <p>In the first place he observes, <hi>That S.</hi> Matthew's <hi>Gospel was written in Hebrew, and the Original</hi> he saith is lost; and he <hi>suspects that either S.</hi> Jerom <hi>was himself the Translator into Greek and Latin (who was a Corrupter of Scripture, and</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen) <hi>or some unknow Person: from whence it follows, that our Gospel of S.</hi> Matthew <hi>is not of such Authority, that an Article of such moment should depend upon it.</hi> Is not this a <hi>very strong and weighty Reason?</hi> Must not this be a very <hi>learned Critick</hi> who could mention S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> as <hi>Translator of S.</hi> Matthews <hi>Gospel</hi> into <hi>Greek</hi>? But then one would think this Interpreter might have been wise enough to have added this of himself. No; he dares not say that, <hi>but that it was added by Transcribers.</hi> But whence or how? To that he saith, <hi>That they seem to be taken out of the Gospel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the</hi> Egyptians. This is great News indeed. But comes it from a good hand? Yes, <hi>from</hi> Epiphanius. And what saith he to this purpose? He saith, <hi>That the</hi> Sabellians <hi>made use of the</hi> counterfeit Egyptian <hi>Gospel, and there it was declared that Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiph. haer. 62. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Son and Holy Ghost were the same.</hi> And what then? Doth he say <hi>they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100626:125"/>
borrowed the Form of Baptism from thence?</hi> Nothing like it. But on the contrary, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> urges this very Form in that place against the <hi>Sabellians</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>N.</hi> 4.</note> and quotes S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Authority for it. But this worthy Author produces other Reasons, which <hi>Sandius</hi> himself laughs at, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises? and therefore I pass them over. The most material seems to be if it hold, <hi>That the most ancient Writers on S.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew <hi>take no notice of them,</hi> and he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Origen, Hilary,</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> but these Negative Arguments <hi>Sandius</hi> thinks of no force. <hi>Origen</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> he saith, <hi>reach not that Chapter;</hi> the <hi>Opus Imperfectum,</hi> which was none of his, doth not; but his own Commentaries do, and there he not only mentions the <hi>Form,</hi> but takes notice of the <hi>Compendious Doctrine</hi> delivered by it, which can be nothing else but that of <hi>the Trinity.</hi> In the Greek <hi>Catena</hi> on S. <hi>Matthew</hi> there is more men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz. That Christ had not then first his Power given him; for he was with God before, and was himself by Nature God.</hi> And there <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> saith, <hi>The Form of Baptism was in the Name of the Holy Trinity;</hi> and he there speaks more fully. <hi>Remember,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Faith into which thou wert baptized. Into the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100626:126"/>
Father? That is well, but that is no farther than the</hi> Jews <hi>go</hi> (for they own <hi>one God,</hi> and <hi>one Person.) Into the Son? That is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yound them, but not yet perfect. Into the Holy Ghost? Yes,</hi> saith he, <hi>this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Baptism. But what is the common Name of these three, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Plainly, that of God.</hi> But this <hi>learned Critick</hi> observes, <hi>that</hi> Hilary <hi>in some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies takes no notice of this Form.</hi> That is truly observed, for the very Conclusion is not <hi>Hilary</hi>'s, but taken out of S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom;</hi> but if he had look'd into <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Works, he would have found the Form of Baptism owned, and asserted by him. For he not only sets it down as <hi>the Form of Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hilar. <hi>l.</hi> 2. de Trinit.</note> as well as <hi>our Baptism appointed by Christ</hi>; but argues from it, against the <hi>Sabellians</hi> and <hi>Ebionites,</hi> as well as others.

this Council propounds an expedient as most agreeable to the general Sense of the Christian Church, <hi>viz.

               <p>Therefore to give a clear account of this matter, I shall prove, that the <hi>Ante-Nicene Fathers</hi> did understand these words, so as not to be taken, either for <hi>mere Names,</hi> or for <hi>Creatures joyned with God</hi>; but that they did maintain <hi>the Divinity of the Son and Holy Ghost,</hi> from the general Sense, in which these words were taken among them.</p>
               <p>And this I shall do from these Arguments;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That those who took them in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sense, were opposed and condemned by the Christian Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Christian Church did own this Sense in publick Acts of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as well as private.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it was owned and defended by those who appeared for the Christian Faith against Infidels. And I do not know any better means than these, to prove such a matter of Fact as this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Sense of the Christian Church may be known by its behaviour towards those, who took these words only for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Names</hi> or <hi>Appearances</hi> of One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>And of this we have full Evidence, as to <hi>Praxeas, Noëtus</hi> and <hi>Sabellius,</hi> all long before the <hi>Council of Nice.</hi>

                  <hi>Praxeas</hi> was the first, at least in the Western Church, who made <hi>Father, Son and Holy Ghost, to be only several Names of the same Person,</hi> and he was with great Warmth and Vigor opposed by <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> who charges him with <hi>introducing a new opinion into the Church,</hi> as will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently appear.

                  <hi>That he lived</hi> 120 <hi>years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nicene Council,</hi> and that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly insists <hi>upon the Form of Baptism against</hi> Praxeas.<note place="margin">Advers.

               </p>
               <p>He grants to <hi>Praxeas, that Father,</hi>

               <p>But I find three things objected against <hi>Tertullian</hi> by their Friends:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Tertullian brought this Doctrine into the Church from</hi> Montanus, whose Disciple he then was. So <hi>Schlichtingius</hi> in his Preface against <hi>Meisner,</hi>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100626:131"/>
Doctrine were always esteemed <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the Christian Church. And this is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early Testimony of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> and general Reception of it, because as one was received the other was rejected, so that the Assertors of it were accounted <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And the Sense of the Church is much better known by such <hi>publick Acts,</hi> than by mere particular Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the learned Men of those times.

                  </gap>d; and the nearer they came to the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Times,</hi> the greater is the strength of their evidence; this I ground on <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s appealing to the <hi>ancient rule of Faith,</hi> which was universally known and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Christian Church, and that such Persons were look'd on as <hi>Hereticks</hi> who differ'd from it. Which being so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near the Apostles Times, it's hardly possible to suppose, that the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church should be mistaken as to what they received <hi>as the rule of Faith,</hi> which was deliver'd and explained at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and therefore the general Sense of the Form of Baptism must be understood by all who were admitted to it. So that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100626:132"/>
the Members of the Christian Church cannot be supposed better acquainted with any thing than the Doctrine they were baptized into. Here then we have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of several <hi>publick Acts of the Church.</hi> 1. The <hi>Form of Baptism.</hi> 2.

And <hi>Praxeas</hi> his Doctrine was then condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not by a particular Sentence, but by the general Sense of the Church at that time. For <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons him among the <hi>condemned Hereticks,</hi>

                  </gap>d.

               <p>The Dispute about the <hi>Marcionites Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> was upon another ground, for they held a <hi>real Trinity,</hi> as appears by <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Romanus</hi> in <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> &amp;c. but the Question was, whether they held the <hi>same Trinity</hi> or not. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>That our Saviour appointed his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100626:134"/>
to baptize in the Name of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and in the Sacrament of this Trinity they were to baptize.</hi> Doth <hi>Marcion</hi> hold this Trinity? So that S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> supposed the validity of <hi>Baptism</hi> to depend on the Faith of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And if he had gone no farther, I do not see how he had transgressed the Rules of the Church; but his Error was, that he made void Baptism upon difference of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and therein he was justly opposed. But the <hi>Marcionites</hi> Baptism was rejected in the Eastern Church,<note place="margin">Basil Epist. Canon, 47.</note> because of their Doctrine about the Trinity.</p>
               <p>In the Parts of <hi>Asia</hi> about <hi>Ephesus, Noe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> had broached the same Doctrine, which <hi>Praxeas</hi> had done elsewhere. For which he was called to an account, and <hi>himself with his Followers we cast out of the Churches Communion,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reports, which is another considerable Testimony of the Sense of the Church at that time. <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Epiph hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. 57. <hi>n.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>he was the first who broached that Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy;</hi> but <hi>Theodoret</hi> mentions <hi>Epigonus</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> before him; it seems, that he was the first who was publickly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of for it; and therefore underwent the Censure of the Church with his Disciples. When he was first summon'd to answer, he denied <hi>that he asserted any such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100626:134"/>
because no man before him</hi> saith E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius, <hi>had vented such Poison.</hi> And in the beginning he saith, that <hi>Noetus</hi> out of a Spirit of Contradiction had utter'd such things, <hi>as neither the Prophets, nor the Apostles, nor the Church of God ever thought or declared.</hi> Now what was this unheard of Doctrine of <hi>Noetus</hi>? That appears best by <hi>Noetus</hi> his answer upon his second appearance which was, <hi>That he worshipped One God, and knew of no other, who was born and suffer'd, and died for us</hi>; and for this he produced the several places which assert the <hi>Vnity of the Godhead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>N.</hi> 2.</note> and among the rest one very observable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all God blessed for ever.</hi> From whence he inferr'd <hi>that the Son and the Father were the same, and the same he affirmed of the Holy Ghost.</hi> But from hence we have an evident Proof that the most ancient <hi>Greek Copies</hi> in <hi>Noetus</hi> his time, which was long before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> had <hi>God</hi> in the Text. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> brings many places of Scripture to prove the Distinction of Persons in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Godhead; but that is not my present business, but to shew the general Sense of the Church at that time. I do not say that <hi>Noetus</hi> was condemned by a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100626:135"/>
general Council; but it is sufficient, to shew that he was cast out of the Church, where he broached his Doctrine, and no other Church received him, or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Church which cast him out, which shews an after Consent to it. Now what was this Doctrine of <hi>Noetus</hi>? The very same with that of <hi>Praxeas</hi> at <hi>Rome. Theodoret</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Theod. haer. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> this his Opinon was, <hi>That there was but One God the Father, who was himself impassible, but as he took our Nature, so he was passible and called the Son. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> more fully,<note place="margin">Epiph. 57. <hi>n.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that the same Person was Father, Son and Holy Ghost; wherein</hi> he saith, <hi>he plainly contradicts the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which attribute distinct Personalities to them; and yet assert but one Godhead. The Father hath an Hypostasis of his own, and so have the Son and Holy Ghost; but yet there is but one Divinity, one Power, and one Dominion</hi>; for these distinct Persons are, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>of the same individual Essence and Power.</hi> But <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was no <hi>Ante-Nicene Father:</hi> however in matters of Antiquity, where there is no incongruity in the thing, we may make use of his Authority; and I think no one will question, that <hi>Noetus</hi> was condemned; which was the thing I produced him to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:100626:135"/>But although <hi>Noetus</hi> was condemned,<note place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>in</hi> Matth. <hi>p.</hi> 470.</note> yet this Doctrine did spread in the Eastern parts; for <hi>Origen</hi> mentions those <hi>who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Notion of Father and Son, and made them but one Hypostasis, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished only by thought, and Denomination.</hi> This Doctrine was opposed not only by <hi>Origen,</hi> but he had <hi>the Sense of the Church</hi> concurring with him, as appears in the Case of <hi>Beryllus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bostra,</hi> who fell into this Opinion, and was reclaimed by <hi>Origen;</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> gives this account of it,<note place="margin">Euseb. <hi>l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 33.</note> 
                  <hi>That there was a Concurrence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with him in it,</hi> and that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was look'd on as an Innovation in the Faith. For his Opinion was <hi>that our Saviour had no proper Subsistence of his own before the Incarnation; and that the Deity of the Father alone was in him.</hi> He did not mean that the Son had no separate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity from the Father, but that the Deity of the Father only appeared in the Son; so that he was not really God, but only one in whom the Deity of the Father was made manifest. Which was one of the oldest Heresies in the Church, and the most early condemned and opposed by it.</p>
               <p>But those Heresies, which before had differenced Persons from the Church, were
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100626:136"/>
now spread by some at first within the Communion of it; as it was not only in the Case of <hi>Noetus</hi> and <hi>Beryllus,</hi> but of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius</hi> himself, who made the greatest noise about this Doctrine; and <hi>his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Epiphanius</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Epiph. haer. 62.</note> 
                  <hi>spread very much both in the Eastern and Western parts; in</hi> Mesopotamia <hi>and at</hi> Rome. <hi>Their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> he saith, <hi>was, that Father, Son and Holy Ghost were but one Hypostasis, with three different Denominations.</hi> They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared God to <hi>the Sun, the Father to the Substance, the Son to the Light, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost to the Heat which comes from it</hi>; and these two latter were only <hi>distinct O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the same Substance.</hi>

                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thinks that <hi>Sabellius</hi> therein differ'd from <hi>Noetus, because he denied that the Father suffer'd;</hi> but S. <hi>Augustin</hi> can find no difference between them.<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>in</hi> Joh. tract. 36.</note> All that can be conceived is, that a different Denomination did arise from the different appearance and Operation; which our <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi> call <hi>three Relative Persons, and one Subsisting Person.</hi>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100626:139"/>
Life, and a great promoter of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in those Parts, and by him the <hi>Form of Doxology was introduced into that Church,</hi> being chiefly formed by him (there being but Seventeen <hi>Christians</hi> when he was first made Bishop there) which was, <hi>Glory to God the Father, and Son with the Holy Ghost,</hi> which ought to be understood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense of the Maker of it. And <hi>Gregory</hi> hath deliver'd his sense plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough in this matter: for in that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith,</hi> which was preserved in the Church of <hi>Neo-Caesarea,</hi> he owns <hi>a perfect Trinity in Glory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Greg. Thaumat. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Eternity and Power, without Separation or Diversity of Nature,</hi> On which Doctrine his Form of <hi>Doxology</hi> was grounded. Which S. <hi>Basil</hi> following, Exceptions were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against it, by some as varying from the Form used in some other places. For the Followers of <hi>Aetius</hi> took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the Expression used in those <hi>Doxologies, Glory be to the Father, by the Son, and in the Holy Ghost,</hi> to infer <hi>a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similitude in the Son and Holy Ghost to the Father, and to make the Son the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Father, and the Holy Ghost on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to relate to time and place.</hi> But S. <hi>Basil</hi> takes a great deal of Pains to shew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency of these Exceptions. They
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100626:140"/>
would fain have charged this <hi>Doxology</hi> as an Innovation on S. <hi>Basil,</hi> because it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed <hi>equal Honour to Father, Son and Holy Ghost,</hi> which the <hi>Aetians</hi> would not endure; but they said, <hi>That the Son was to be honoured only in Subordination to the Father, and the Holy Ghost as inferiour to both.</hi> But S. <hi>Basil</hi> proves from Scripture an <hi>Equality of Honour</hi> to be due to them: and particularly from <hi>the Form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> c. 10. wherein <hi>the Son and Holy Ghost are joyned with the Father, without any note of Distinction. And what more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per token of a Conjunction in the same Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than being put together in such a manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Especially considering these two things. 1. The extream Jealousie of the Jewish Nation, as to joyning the Creatures with God in any thing that related to Divine Honour. But as S. <hi>Basil</hi> argues, <hi>If the Son were a Creature, then we must believe in the Creator, and the Creature together; and by the same reason that one Creature is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the whole Creation may be joyned with him; but</hi> saith he, <hi>we are not to imagine the least Disunion or Separation between Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son and Holy Ghost; nor that they are three distinct parts of one inseparable Being, but that there is an indivisible Conjunction
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100626:140"/>
of three in the same Essence; so that where one is, there is the other also. For where the Holy Ghost is, there is the Son, and where the Son is, there is the Father.</hi> And so <hi>Athanasius</hi> urges the Argument from these Words,<note place="margin">Athanas. c. Serap. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That a Creature could not be joyned with the Creator in such a manner, as in the Form of Baptism;</hi> and it might have been as well said, <hi>Baptize in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and any other Creature.</hi> And for all that I see, our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> would have liked such a Form very well; for they parallel it with those in <hi>Scripture; and they worshipped the Lord, and the King;</hi> and <hi>they feared the Lord and Samuel.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That it is deliver'd with so much assurance by the Opposers of Christianity; such as <hi>Plotinus, Porphyrius, Proclus</hi> and others were known to be, and they speak with no manner of doubt concerning it; as may be seen in the passage of <hi>Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> preserved by S. <hi>Cyril</hi> and others.<note place="margin">Cyril. c.

               <p n="2">2. That they took it up from no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; but as a Notion in it self agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough; as appears by the passages in <hi>Plato</hi> and others concerning it. They never suspected it to be liable to the Charge of <hi>Non-Sense,</hi> and <hi>Contradictions,</hi> as our modern <hi>Vnitarians</hi> charge the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with; although their Notion as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by <hi>Porphyrie</hi> be as liable to it.

               </p>
               <p>There is no question, but that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who suffer'd on the Cross, had Power given to him, after his Resurrection; but the true Question is, whether his <hi>Sonship</hi> were then given to him. He was then <hi>declared to be the Son of God with Power, and had a Name</hi> or Authority <hi>given him above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Name; being exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins:</hi> in order to which he now appointed his Apostles <hi>to teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; baptizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son and the Holy Ghost.</hi> He doth not say in the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd on the Cross; nor in the name of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Christ</hi> now exalted; but in the name of <hi>Father, Son and Holy Ghost:</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were a double Gift with respect <hi>to the Son and Holy Ghost</hi>; the one, as to his Royal Authority over the Church; the other, as to his extraordinary Effusion on the Apostles, yet neither of these are so much as intimated; but the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100626:148"/>
Office of Baptism is required to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Name of these three as distinct and yet equal; without any Relation to any Gift, either as to the <hi>Son or Holy Ghost.</hi> But if the ancient <hi>Iews</hi> were in the Right, as we think they were, then we have a plain account, how these came to be thus mention'd in the Form of Baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> that these three distinct Subsistences in the Divine Essence, were not now to be kept up as a secret Mystery from the World; but that the Christian Church was to be formed upon the Belief of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They bring <hi>several places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where God and his Creatures are joyned, without any Note of distinction or Superiority; as, The people feared the Lord, and</hi> Samuel, 1 Sam. 12.18. <hi>They worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Lord, and the King,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.20. <hi>I charge thee before God the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and his elect Angels,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride say come,</hi> Revel. 22.17.</p>
               <p>But can any Man of Sense imagine, these places contain a Parallel with a Form of Words, wherein men are entred into the Profession of a new Religion, and by which they were to be distinguished from all other Religions? in the former places, the Circumstances were so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100626:149"/>
as to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>the Civil Magistrate, that</hi> it shews no more than that the same external Acts may be used to both, but with such a different Intention as all men understood it. What if S. <hi>Paul</hi> name <hi>the elect Angels</hi> in a solemn Obtestation to <hi>Timothy,</hi> together with <hi>God, and the Lord Iesus Christ?</hi> What can this prove, but that we may call God and his Creatures to be Witnesses together of the same thing? And so <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> are called to bear Witness against obstinate Sinners: May men therefore be baptized in the name of <hi>God and his Creatures? The Spirit and Bride</hi> may say <hi>come</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Incongruity; but it would have been strange indeed, if they had said, <hi>Come be baptized in the Name of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Bride.</hi> So that these Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are very remote from the purpose.</p>
               <p>But they say farther, <hi>That the ancients of the first Four hundred years do not insist on this place, to prove the Divinity or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality of the Son or Spirit.</hi> As to the first <hi>Three hundred years,</hi> I have given an account already; and as to the <hi>Fourth Century,</hi> I could not have thought, that they would have mention'd it: since there is scarce a Father of the Church in that time, who had occasion to do it, but
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100626:149"/>
makes use of the Argument from this place to prove <hi>the Divinity</hi> and <hi>Personality of the Son and Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith, <hi>That Christ founded his Church on the Doctrine of the Trinity contained in these Words</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>and if the Holy Ghost had been of a different Nature, from the Father and Son, he would never have been joyned with them in a Form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, no more than an Angel, or any other Creature.

into that Religion which proceeds from God the Father, and deliver'd by his Son, and confirmed by the Testimony of the Holy Ghost.</hi> So much we grant is implied, but the Question still remains, whether the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are here to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd only in order to their <hi>Operations,</hi> or whether the Persons of the <hi>Son and Holy Ghost,</hi> from whom those Effects came, are not here chiefly intended? For if no more had been meant, but these Effects, then the right Form of Admission had not been, <hi>into the Name of Father, Son and Holy Ghost</hi>; but <hi>in the Name of the Father alone,</hi> as <hi>Revealing</hi> himself by his <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Confirming</hi> it by the miraculous Works of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> For these are only sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient Acts to the design of God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the only subsisting Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They tell us, <hi>That it is in vain, not to say ridiculously pretended, that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Thing is God, because we are baptized into it; for some were baptized into</hi> Moses, <hi>and others into</hi> John's <hi>Baptism, and so</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> John Baptist <hi>would be Gods; and to be baptized into a Person or Persons, and in the name of such a Person is the same thing.</hi> Grant this; yet there is a great difference between being baptized in the name of <hi>a Minister of Baptism,</hi> and of <hi>the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100626:150"/>
Author of a Religion,</hi> into which they are baptized. The Israelites <hi>were baptized unto</hi> Moses; but how? The <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic Versions</hi> render it <hi>per Mosen</hi>; and so S. <hi>Augustin</hi> reads it.<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>in Psal.</hi> 77.</note> And this seems to be the most natural sense of the Word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as it is, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.53. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. And the force of the Apostle's Argument, doth not lie in the Parallel between being <hi>baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Moses, <hi>and into Christ</hi>; but in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges they had under the <hi>Ministery of</hi> Moses with those which Christians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. The other place implies no more, than being enter'd into that Profession, which John <hi>baptized his Disciples into.</hi> But doth any one imagine, that because <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did enter his <hi>Disciples</hi> by Baptism, therefore they must believe him to be God? I know none that lay the force of the Argument upon any thing parallel to those Places. But it depends upon laying the Circumstances together. Here was a new Religion to be taught mankind, and they were to be entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, not by a bare verbal Profession, but by a solemn Rite of Baptism; and this <hi>Baptism</hi> is declar'd to be <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost:</hi> which cannot be understood of their <hi>Ministery,</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:100626:151"/>
and therefore must relate to that Faith, which they were baptized into, which was concerning <hi>the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</hi> And so the Christian Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it, from the beginning, as I have proved in the foregoing Discourse.</p>
               <p>And from hence came the Instruction of <hi>Catechumens,</hi> who were to be baptized about the <hi>Trinity</hi>; and the first <hi>Creeds</hi> which related only to them, as I have already observed. And so much our <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> grant in one of their latest Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ. to Dr.</hi> Bull, <hi>p.</hi> 17.</note> that a <hi>Creed was an Institution, or Instruction what we are to believe in the main, and fundamental Articles, especially concerning the Persons of Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</hi> But they contend, <hi>That the Creed which bears the Name of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, was the Original Creed framed by the Apostles themselves, because they suppose this Creed doth not assert the Son and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, to be Eternal and Divine Persons, and therefore they conclude, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of this Creed, either did not know, that any other Person but the Father is God, or Almighty, or Maker of Heaven and Earth, or they have negligently, or wickedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Proofs they bring, that this <hi>Creed</hi> was framed by the Apostles. We believe the <hi>Creed</hi> to be <hi>Apostolical</hi> in the <hi>true Sense</hi> of it; but that it was so in that <hi>Frame of Words,</hi> and Enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Articles, as it is now receiv'd, hath been called in question by some <hi>Criticks</hi> of great Judgment and Learning, whom I have already mentioned. <hi>Erasmus</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Eras. ad Cens. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Tit. II.</note> 
                  <hi>He doth not question the Articles being A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical; but whether the Apostles put it thus into Writing.</hi> And his chief Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is from the <hi>Variety</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Creeds</hi>; of which no Account can be given so probable, as that they were added <hi>Occasionally</hi> in opposition to a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heresie. As for Instance, the Word <hi>Impassible</hi> was inserted with Respect to the Father in the ancient <hi>Eastern Creed,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Doctrine of <hi>Sabellius</hi>; but it was not in the old <hi>Western Creed.</hi> And he argues, That the <hi>Apostolical Creed</hi> end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Holy Ghost; because the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100626:152"/>
                  <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> did so.<note place="margin">Voss de tribus Symb. Dissert. 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 47.</note> And <hi>Vossius</hi> thinks the other Articles which are in <hi>Cyril,</hi> were added after the <hi>Nicene Council;</hi> which would not have omitted them, if they had been in the former Creed. And when there were so many <hi>Creeds</hi> made afterwards, it is observable, that they do all end with the Article of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; which they would never have done, in so jealous a time about <hi>Creeds,</hi> if they had left out any Articles of what was then receiv'd for the <hi>Apostolical Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first <hi>Creed</hi> after the <hi>Nicene,</hi> which made great noise in the World, was that framed at <hi>Antioch</hi>;<note place="margin">Hilar. de Synod. <hi>p.</hi> 1169.</note> and that <hi>Creed</hi> not only ends with the Article of the Holy Ghost; but mentions the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; and our Saviours commanding his Apostles to baptize in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost</hi>; as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Creed. <hi>For it hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Father is true Father, and the Son true Son, and the Holy Ghost true Holy Ghost; not bare Names, but such as import three distinct Subsistences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Hilary</hi> observes, That this Council chiefly intended to overthrow <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> and therefore asserted <hi>tres Subsistentium Personas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius haer. 73. <hi>n.</hi> 17.</note> as <hi>Hilary</hi> interprets their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and so doth <hi>Epiphanius</hi>; which was to

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the latter calls the <hi>Article of the Trinity, the close of our Faith</hi>; which is always to be kept ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Saviour's command,<note place="margin">

such as they are, I leave them to any one that will compare them with the Answers. But there are two things they lay weight upon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the whole Christian Church East and West,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 27.</note> 
                  <hi>could not have agreed in the same Creed, as to Number and Order of Articles, and manner of Expression, if this Creed had not come from the same Persons, from whom they receiv'd the Gospel and the Scriptures; Namely, from the Apostles and Preachers of Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That it was receiv'd by a constant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to have been the Apostles;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now these I confess to be as good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as the Matters will bear; and I will no longer contest this Point with them, provided, that we be allowed to make use of the same Arguments; as to the second Point; wherein they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove, <hi>That the Apostles Creed doth exclude the Divinity of the Son and Holy Ghost.</hi> What is now become of the <hi>general Consent of the Christian Church, East and West? and of the Commentators upon this Creed?</hi> If the Argument hold good in one Case, I hope it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to do so in the other also. And
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100626:154"/>
what greater Testimony can be given of such a <hi>Consent of the Christian Church;</hi> than that those who opposed it, have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by it, and that the Church hath expressed her Sense of it in <hi>Publick,</hi> and <hi>Private Acts</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> and have defended it as a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary part of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> against the Assaults of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Hereticks?</hi> So that although the <hi>Apostles Creed</hi> do not in express words declare, <hi>The Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the three Persons in the Vnity of the Divine Essence;</hi> yet taking the <hi>Sense</hi> of those Articles, as the <hi>Christian Church</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood them from the Apostles times, then we have as full, and clear Evidence of this Doctrine, as we have <hi>that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Scriptures from them.</hi>

               <p>I now come in the last place to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the remaining Objections, in Point of Reason; and those are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Doctrine is said to be a <hi>Mystery,</hi> and therefore <hi>above Reason,</hi> and we cannot in reason be obliged to believe any such thing.</p>

Ideas, or Perceptions of things; of affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or denying according as he sees them to agree or disagree, and this is Reason in General It is not the bare receiving Ideas into the Mind, that is strictly Reason,</hi> (who ever thought it was?) <hi>but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Agreement, or Disagreement of our Ideas in a greater of lesser Number; wherein soever this Agreement or Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement may consist. If the Perception be immediate without the Assistance of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idea, this is not call'd Reason, but Self-Evidence: but when the mind makes use of intermediate Ideas to discover that Agreement or Disagreement, this method of Knowledge is properly call'd Reason or Demonstration. And so Reason is defined to be that Faculty of the Soul, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the certainty of any thing dubious, or obscure by comparing it with something evidently known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is offer'd to the World, as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Reason; but to shew how very loose, and unsatisfactory it is, I desire it may be consider'd, that this Doctrine sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, that we must have <hi>clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Ideas</hi> of whatever we pretend to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certainty of in our Minds, and that the only Way to attain this certainty, is by comparing these <hi>Ideas</hi> together. Which
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100626:156"/>
excludes all certainty of Faith or Reason, where we cannot have such <hi>clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Ideas.</hi> But if there are many things of which we may be certain, and yet can have no <hi>clear and distinct Ideas</hi> of them; if those <hi>Ideas</hi> we have, are too imperfect and obscure to form our Judgments by; if we cannot find out sufficient <hi>interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Ideas;</hi> then this cannot be the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Certainty,</hi> or the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I shall keep to our present Subject; and our certainty of it in Point of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, depends upon our Knowledge of the the Nature of <hi>Substance,</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> and the <hi>Distinction</hi> between them: but if we can have no such <hi>clear Ideas</hi> in our Minds concerning these things, as are required from <hi>Sensation,</hi> or <hi>Reflection;</hi> then, either we have no use of <hi>Reason</hi> about them, or it is in sufficient to pass any Judgment concerning them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I begin with the Notion of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> And I have great Reason to begin with it; for, according to this Man's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples there can be no certainty of Reason at all about it. And so our new Way of Reason is advanced to very good Purpose. For we may talk and dispute about <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> as long as we please, but, if his Principles of Reason be true, we can come
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100626:157"/>
to no certainty; since we can have no <hi>clear Idea</hi> in our Minds concerning it, as will appear from his own Words; and the method he proceeds in.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Chap. I.</note>(1.) He saith, <hi>That the Mind receives in Ideas two ways.</hi> 1. <hi>By Intermission of the Senses, as Colours, Figures, Sounds, Smells,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>By the Souls considering its own Operations about what it thus gets from without, as knowing, doubting, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, denying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>That these simple and distinct Ideas, thus laid up in the great Repository of the Vnderstanding, are the sole matter and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all our Reasoning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then it follows, That we can have <hi>no Foundation of Reasoning,</hi> where there can can be no such <hi>Ideas</hi> from <hi>Sensation, or Reflection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this is the Case of <hi>Substance</hi>; it is not <hi>intromitted by the Senses,</hi> nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon <hi>the Operations of the Mind;</hi> and so it cannot be within the compass of our Reason.

               </p>
               <p>If this be the truth of the Case, we must still <hi>talk like Children,</hi> and I know not how it can be remedied. For, if we cannot come at a rational Idea of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> we can have no Principle of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to go upon in this Debate.</p>
               <p>I do not say, that we can have a <hi>clear Idea of Substance,</hi> either by <hi>Sensation</hi> or <hi>Reflection</hi>; but from hence I argue, that this is a very insufficient Distribution of the <hi>Ideas</hi> necessary to Reason. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, there must be some <hi>general Ideas,</hi> which the mind doth form, not by <hi>meer comparing those Ideas it has got from Sense or Reflection</hi>; but by forming distinct general Notions, of things from particular <hi>Ideas.</hi> And among these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Notions, or rational <hi>Ideas, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:100626:158"/>
is one of the first; because we find that we can have no true Conceptions of any <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> (no matter which) but we must conceive a <hi>Substratum,</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wherein they are. Since it is a Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to our first Conceptions of things, that <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> should subsist by themselves, and therefore the <hi>Rational Idea</hi> of <hi>Substance</hi> is one of the first, and most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Ideas</hi> in our minds.</p>
               <p>But we are still told, <hi>That our Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing can have no other Ideas, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Sensation or Reflection.</hi>

               <p>And I desire to know, whether accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to true Reason, that be not a <hi>clear Idea</hi> of a Man; not of <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> but of a Man as such. This is not a meer <hi>universal Name,</hi> or <hi>Mark,</hi> or <hi>Sign</hi>; but there is as clear and distinct a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this in our Minds, as we can have from any such <hi>simple Ideas,</hi> as are convey'd by our Senses. I do not deny that the Distinction of particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, is by the several Modes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of them, (which they may call <hi>a Complication of simple Ideas</hi> if they please) but I do assert, that the <hi>general Idea,</hi> which relates to the <hi>Essence</hi> without these
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100626:159"/>
is so just, and true an <hi>Idea,</hi> that without it <hi>the Complication of simple Ideas,</hi> will never give us a right Notion of it.</p>
               <p>I must do that Right to the ingenious Author of <hi>the Essay of humane Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> (from whence these Notions are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to serve other Purposes than he intended them) that he makes the Case of <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Corporeal Substances</hi> to be alike, as to their <hi>Idea's,</hi> and <hi>that we have as clear a Notion of a Spirit, as we have of a Body, the one being supposed to be the</hi> Substratum <hi>to those simple Ideas we have from without,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. <hi>sect.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and the other of those Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we find within our selves. And that it is as rational to affirm, there is no Body, because we cannot know its Essence, as 'tis called, or have no Idea of the Substance of Matter; as to say, there is no Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know not its Essence, or have no Idea of a Spiritual Substance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it follows, That we may be certain, that there are both <hi>Spiritual and Bodily Substances,</hi> although we can have <hi>no clear and distinct Ideas of them.</hi> But, if our Reason depend upon our <hi>clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Idea's</hi>; how is this possible? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reason without <hi>clear Ideas,</hi> and yet we may be certain without them: Can we be certain without Reason? Or doth our
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100626:160"/>
Reason give us true Notions of things, without these <hi>Idea's?</hi> If it be so, this new <hi>Hypothesis</hi> about Reason must appear to be very unreasonable.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose this Principle to be true, <hi>That the simple Ideas</hi> by Sensation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, <hi>are the sole Matter and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all our Reasoning:</hi> I ask then, how we come to be certain, that there are <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Substances</hi> in the World, since we can have no <hi>clear and distinct Ideas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them? Can we be certain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>any Foundation of Reason?</hi> This is a new sort of Certainty, for which we do not envy these Pretenders to <hi>Reason.</hi> But methinks, they should not at the same time assert the absolute necessity of these <hi>Ideas</hi> to our knowledge, and declare that we may have certain Knowledge without them. If there be any other method, they overthrow their own Principle; if there be none, how come they to any Certainty, that there are both <hi>Bodily</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Substances?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to these latter (which is my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) I must enquire farther, how they come to know that there are such. The Answer <hi>is by Self-Reflection, on those Powers we find in our selves, which cannot come from a mere Bodily Substance.</hi> I allow
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100626:160"/>
he Reason to be very good, but the Question I ask is, whether this Argument be from the <hi>clear and distinct Idea</hi> or not? <hi>We have Ideas in our selves of the several Operations of our Minds of Knowing, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Considering,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which cannot come from a Bodily Substance.</hi> Very true; but is all this contained in the <hi>simple Idea</hi> of these <hi>Operations?</hi> How can that be, when the same Persons say, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Ideas</hi> it is possible <hi>for Matter to Think.</hi> For it is said,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>it being impossible for us by the Contemplation of our own Ideas, without Revelation to discover whether Omnipotency hath not given to some Systems of Matter, fitly disposed, a Power to perceive or think.</hi> If this be true, then for all that we can know by our Ideas of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Thinking;</hi> Matter may have a Power of Thinking: and if this hold, then it is impossible to prove a Spiritual Substance in us, from <hi>the Idea of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>: For how can we be assured by our <hi>Ideas,</hi> that God hath not given such a Power of Thinking, to Matter so disposed as our Bodies are? Especially since it is said, <hi>That in respect of our Notions, it is not
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100626:161"/>
much more remote from our Comprehension to conceive that God can, if he pleases, super-add to our Idea of Matter a Faculty of Thinking, than that he should super-add to it another Substance, with a Faculty of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Whoever asserts this, can never prove <hi>a Spiritual Substance</hi> in us, from a <hi>Faculty of Thinking;</hi> because he cannot know from <hi>the Idea of Matter and Thinking,</hi> that Matter so disposed cannot Think. And he cannot be certain that God hath not framed the matter of our Bodies, so as to be capable of it.</p>
               <p>It is said indeed elsewhere, <hi>That it is repugnant to the Idea of Sensless Matter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Book. IV. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>sect.</hi> 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that it should put into it self Sense, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Knowledge:</hi> But this doth not reach the present Case; which is not <hi>what Matter can do of it self,</hi> but what Matter prepared by an Omnipotent hand can do. And what certainty can we have that he hath not done it?

               <p>But we are told, <hi>That from the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Minds,</hi>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100626:161"/>
that be, when we cannot from those <hi>Ideas</hi> be assured, but that those Operations may come from a <hi>material Substance.</hi> If we frame an <hi>Idea</hi> on such Grounds, it is at most but a <hi>possible Idea</hi>; for it may be otherwise; and we can have no Assurance <hi>from our Ideas,</hi> that it is not: So that the most men may come to in this way of <hi>Idea's</hi> is, That it is possible it may be so, and it is possible it may not; but that it is impossible for us <hi>from our Ideas,</hi> to determine either way.

               <p>I am very glad to find the Idea of a <hi>Spiritual Substance</hi> made as consistent, and intelligible, as that of a <hi>Corporeal; for as the one consists of a</hi> Cohesion <hi>of solid Parts, and the Power of communicating Motion by impulse, so the other consists in a Power of Thinking, and Willing, and moving the Body; and that the</hi> Cohesion <hi>of solid Parts, is as hard to be conceived as Thinking; and we are as much in the dark about the Power of communicating Motion by impulse,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>These are very fair and ingenuous Confessions of the shortness of humane

Understanding, with respect to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Manner of such things, which we are most certain of the Being of, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and undoubted Experience. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal now to the Reason of mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be any reasonable Foundation for rejecting a Doctrine proposed to us, as of Divine Revelation, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend the manner of it; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when it relates to the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. For as the same Author observes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 33, 34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Idea of God is framed from the Complex Ideas of those Perfections we find in our selves, but inlarging them so, as to make them suitable to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Being, as Knowledge, Power, Durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 36.</note> 
                  <hi>For it is infinity, which joyned to our Ideas of Existence, Power, Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>makes that Complex Idea, whereby we represent to our selves the best we can, the Supreme Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, when our Knowledge of gross material Substances is so dark; when the Notion of Spiritual Substances is above all Ideas of Sensation; when the higher any Substance is, the more remote from our Knowledge; but especially when the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100626:163"/>
very <hi>Idea</hi> of a Supreme Being implies its being Infinite, and Incomprehensible, I know not whether it argues more Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, or Arrogance to expose a Doctrine relating to the Divine Essence, because they cannot comprehend the manner of it. But of this more afterwards. I am yet upon the Certainty of our <hi>Reason,</hi> from clear and distinct <hi>Ideas:</hi> and if we can attain to Certainty without them, and where it is confessed we cannot have them; as about <hi>Substances</hi>: then these can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>the sole Matter and Foundation of our Reasoning,</hi> which is so peremptorily asserted by this late Author.</p>
               <p>But I go yet farther: and as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shew'd, we can have no certainty of an <hi>Immaterial Substance</hi> within us, from these <hi>simple Ideas</hi>; so I shall now shew, that there can be no sufficient Evidence, brought from them by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, concerning the <hi>Existence of the most Spiritual and infinite Substance, even God himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are told, <hi>That the Evidence of it is equal to Mathematical Certainty;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Book IV. <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>sect.</hi> 1.</note> and very good Arguments are brought to prove it, in a Chapter on purpose: but that which I take notice of is, that the Argument from the <hi>clear and distinct Idea
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100626:163"/>
of God</hi> is passed over. How can this be consistent with deducing our <hi>Certainty of Knowledge</hi> from <hi>clear and simple Ideas?</hi> I do not go about to justifie those, <hi>who lay the whole stress upon that Foundation</hi>; which I grant to be too weak to support so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Truth; and that those are very much to blame, who <hi>go about to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date other Arguments for the sake of that;</hi> but I doubt all this Talk about <hi>clear and distinct Ideas, being made the Foundation of Certainty,</hi> came Originally from those Discourses, or <hi>Meditations,</hi> which are aimed at. The Author of them was an ingenious, Thinking man, and he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to lay the Foundations of Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as well as he could. The first thing he found any certainty in, was his own Existence; which he founded upon the Perception of the Acts of his Mind, which some call <hi>an Internal, infallible Perception that we are.</hi> From hence he proceeded, to enquire, how he came by this Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he resolved it into this, that he had a clear and distinct Perception of it; and from hence he formed his general Rule, <hi>That what he had a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Perception of was true.</hi> Which in Reason ought to go no farther, than where there is the like Degree of Evidence: for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100626:164"/>
the <hi>Certainty</hi> here, was not grounded on the clearness of the <hi>Perception,</hi> but on the Plainness of the Evidence Which is of that Nature, that the very <hi>Doubting</hi> of it proves it; since it is impossible, that any thing should doubt or question its own Being, that had it not. So that here it is not <hi>the Clearness of the Idea,</hi> but an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Act of Perception, which is the true ground of Certainty. And this cannot extend to things without our selves; of which we can have no other Perception, than what is caused by the Impressions of outward Objects. But whether we are to judge according to those Impressions, doth not depend on the <hi>Ideas</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but upon the Exercise of our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reason about them, which put the Difference between true and false, and adequate, and inadequate Ideas. So that our Certainty is not from the <hi>Ideas</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but from the Evidence of Reason, that those <hi>Ideas</hi> are true, and just, and consequently that we may build our Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty upon them.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Idea</hi> of an infinite Being hath this peculiar to it, that necessary Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence is implied in it. This is a <hi>clear and distinct Idea,</hi> and yet it is denied, that this doth prove the Existence of God.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100626:164"/>
How then can the Grounds of our Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty arise from <hi>clear and distinct Ideas;</hi> when in one of the clearest Ideas of our Minds we can come to no Certainty by it? I do not say, That it is <hi>denied</hi> to prove it; but this is said, That it is a doubtful thing <hi>from the different make of mens Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Application of their thoughts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 7.</note> What can this mean, unless it be to let us know, that even <hi>clear and distinct Ideas,</hi> may lose their Effect by the <hi>difference of mens Tempers and Studies;</hi> so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Ideas,</hi> in order to a right Judgment, a due Temper and Application of the mind is required.</p>
               <p>And wherein is this different, from what all men of Understanding have said? Why then should these clear and <hi>simple Ideas be made the sole Foundation of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</hi> One would think by this, that these <hi>Ideas</hi> would presently satisfie mens Minds, if they attended to them. But even this will not do, as to the <hi>Idea</hi> of an infinite Being. It is not enough to say, <hi>They will not examine how far it will hold:</hi> for they ought either to say, that it doth hold, or give up this Ground of Certainty from <hi>clear and distinct Ideas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But instead of the proper Argument from <hi>Ideas,</hi> we are told,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That from the

Consideration of our selves, and what we find in our own Constitutions, our Reason leads us to the Knowledge of this certain and evident Truth; that there is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, most powerful, and most knowing Being.</hi> All which I readily yield; but we see plainly, the Certainty is not placed in the <hi>Idea,</hi> but in good and sound Reason <hi>from the Consideration of our selves and our Constitutions.</hi> What! in the <hi>Idea of our Selves?</hi> No certainly; for let our <hi>Idea</hi> be taken which way we please, by <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> or <hi>Reflection,</hi> yet it is not the <hi>Idea</hi> that makes us certain, but the Argument from that which we perceive in, and about our Selves.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note>
                  <hi>But we find in our selves Perception and Knowledge.</hi> It's very true; but how doth this prove that there is <hi>a God?</hi> It is from the <hi>clear and distinct Idea</hi> of it. No, but from this Argument: <hi>That either there must have been a knowing Being from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or an unknowing; for something must have been from Eternity: but if an unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then it was impossible there ever should have been any knowledge; it being as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that a thing without knowledge should produce it, as that a Triangle should make it self three Angles bigger than two right ones.</hi> Allowing the Argument to be
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100626:165"/>
good, yet it is not taken from <hi>the Idea,</hi> but from Principles of true Reason; as That no man can doubt his own Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that every thing must have a Cause; that this Cause must either have Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or not: if it have, the Point is gained; if it hath not, nothing can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and consequently, a not knowing Being cannot produce a knowing.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>If we suppose nothing to be first,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Matter can never begin to be; if bare Matter without Motion eternal, Motion can never begin to be; if Matter and Motion be supposed Eternal, Thought can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be. For, if Matter could produce thought, then Thought must be in the power of Matter; and if it be in Matter as such, it must be the inseparable Property of all matter; which is contrary to the Sense and Experience of mankind. If only some parts of Matter have a power of Thinking, how comes so great a difference in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the same Matter? What disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Matter is required to thinking? And from whence comes it? Of which no account can be given in Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Substance of the Argument used, to prove an infinite spiritual Being, which I am far from weakning the force of; but that which I design, is to shew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

The next thing necessary to be clear'd in this Dispute is, the <hi>Distinction</hi> between <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> and of this we can have no <hi>clear and distinct Idea</hi> from <hi>Sensation</hi> or <hi>Reflection.</hi> And yet all our Notions of the Doctrine of the Trinity, depend upon the right understanding of it. For we must talk unintelligibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Point, unless we have clear and distinct Apprehensions concerning <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> and the grounds of <hi>Identity</hi> and <hi>Distinction.</hi> But that these come not into our Minds by these <hi>simple Ideas</hi> of <hi>Sensation</hi> and <hi>Reflection,</hi> I shall now make it appear;</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Nature,</hi> That is sometimes taken for the <hi>Essential Property</hi> of a thing, as when we say, that such a thing is of a <hi>different Nature</hi> from another, we mean no more than that it is differenced by such Properties as come to our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Sometimes <hi>Nature</hi> is taken for the <hi>Thing it self in which those Properties are;</hi> and so <hi>Aristotle</hi> took <hi>Nature</hi> for a <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Substance, which had the Principles of Motion in it self:</hi> but <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:100626:166"/>
are of an equal extent; and so that which is the <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>Powers,</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> is the <hi>Nature,</hi> whether it be meant of <hi>Bodily</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Substances.</hi> I grant, that by <hi>Sensation</hi> and <hi>Reflection</hi> we come to know the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of Things; but our Reason is satisfied, that there must be something beyond these; because it is impossible that they should subsist by themselves. So that the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of things propery belongs to our <hi>Reason,</hi> and not to meer <hi>Ideas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we must yet proceed farther. For, <hi>Nature</hi> may be consider'd two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it is in distinct Individuals, as the <hi>Nature</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> is equally in <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> and this is the <hi>common Nature</hi> with a particular Subsistence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to each of them. For the Nature of man, as in <hi>Peter,</hi> is distinct from that same Nature, as it is in <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, they would be but <hi>one Person,</hi> as well as have the <hi>same Nature.</hi> And this Distinction of <hi>Persons</hi> in them is discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both by our <hi>Senses,</hi> as to their different Accidents; and by our Reason, because they have a separate Existence; not coming into it at once and in the same manner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Nature</hi> may be consider'd <hi>Abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> without respect to individual Persons,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100626:167"/>
and then it makes an entire Notion of it self. For however, the same Nature may be in different Individuals, yet the Nature in it self remains one and the same: which appears from this evident Reason; that otherwise every Individual must make a different kind.</p>
               <p>Let us now see, how far these things can come from our <hi>simple Ideas, by Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Sensation.</hi> And I shall lay down the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of those, who resolve our <hi>Certainty</hi> into <hi>Ideas,</hi> as plainly, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly, as I can.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are told, <hi>That all simple Ideas are true and adequate.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>All our Ideas of Substances are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and inadequate; because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the real Essences of things, of which we are Ignorant, and no man knows what Substance is in it self:</hi> And <hi>they are all false,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But two things are granted, which tend to clear this Matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is <hi>a Real Essence,</hi> which is the Foundation of <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That we may <hi>know</hi> these <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> although we are ignorant of of the <hi>Real Essence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence I inferr.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That from those true and <hi>adequate Ideas,</hi> which we have of the <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of Things, we have sufficient certainty of the <hi>Real Essence</hi> of them: For these <hi>Ideas</hi> are allow'd to be true; and either by them we may judge of the truth of things; or we can make no Judgment at all of any thing without our selves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:100626:168"/>If our <hi>Ideas</hi> be only the Effects we feel of the Powers of things without us; yet our Reason must be satisfied, that there could be no such Powers, unless there were some real Beings which had them. So that either we may be certain by those Effects of the real Being of Things; or it is not possible, as we are framed, to have any certainty at all of any thing without our selves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That from the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of things which are knowable by us, we may know as much of the internal <hi>Essence</hi> of Things, as those <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> discover. I do not say, That we can know all Essences of things alike; nor that we can attain to a perfect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of all that belong to them: but if we can know so much, as that there are <hi>certain Beings</hi> in the World, endued with such <hi>distinct Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> what is it we complain of the want of, in order to our Certainty of Things? <hi>But we do not see the bare Essence of things.</hi> What is that <hi>bare Essence</hi> without the <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> belonging to it? It is <hi>that internal Constitution of things from whence those Powers and Properties flow.</hi> Suppose we be ignorant of this (as we are like to be, for any Discoveries
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100626:168"/>
that have been yet made, that is a good Argument to prove the uncertainty of Philosophical Speculations about the <hi>Real Essences</hi> of things; but it is no prejudice to us, who enquire after the <hi>Certainty</hi> of such <hi>Essences.</hi> For although we cannot comprehend the <hi>internal Frame,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of things, nor in what manner they do flow from the Substance; yet by them we certainly know that there are such <hi>Essences,</hi> and that they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from each other by their <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Essences</hi> of things as they are <hi>knowable</hi> by us, have a <hi>Reality</hi> in them: For they are founded on the <hi>natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of things. And however the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract Ideas</hi> are the work of the Mind; yet they are not meer Creatures of the Mind; as appears by an instance produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the <hi>Essence of the Sun, being in one single Individual;</hi> in which Case it is granted,<note place="margin">Book <hi>Chap. Sect.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Idea may be so abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that more Suns might agree in it, and it is as much a Sort as if there were as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Suns as there are Stars.</hi> So that here we have a <hi>Real Essence</hi> subsisting in one <hi>Individual,</hi> but capable of being multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied into more, and the same Essence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. But in this <hi>one Sun</hi> there is a
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100626:169"/>
                  <hi>Real Essence,</hi> and not a meer <hi>Nominal</hi> or <hi>abstracted Essence</hi>: but suppose there were more Suns; would not each of them have the <hi>Real Essence</hi> of the Sun? For what is it makes the second Sun to be a true Sun, but having the same <hi>Real Essence</hi> with the first? If it were but a <hi>Nominal Essence,</hi> then the second would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore there must be a <hi>Real Essence</hi> in every individual of the same kind; for that alone is it, which makes it to be what it is. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> are all true and real Men; but what is it which makes them so? Is it the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting a <hi>general Name</hi> to them? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, but that the true and <hi>Real Essence</hi> of a Man is in every one of them. And we must be as certain of this, as we are that they are Men; they take their Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of being Men from that common Nature, or Essence which is in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the <hi>general Idea</hi> is not made from the simple <hi>Ideas</hi> by the meer Act of the Mind abstracting from Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but from <hi>Reason</hi> and Consideration of the true Nature of Things. For, when we see so many <hi>Individuals,</hi> that have the same <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> we thence infer, that there must be something com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100626:169"/>
to all, which makes them of <hi>one kind</hi>: and if the difference of Kinds be real, that which makes them of one kind and not of another, must not be a <hi>Nominal,</hi> but <hi>Real Essence.</hi> And this difference doth not depend upon the <hi>complex Ideas of Substance,</hi> whereby Men arbitrarily joyn Modes together in their Minds; for let them mistake in the <hi>Complication of their Ideas,</hi> either in leaving out, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in what doth not belong to them, and let their Ideas be what they please; the <hi>Real Essence</hi> of a Man, and a Horse, and a Tree, are just what they were: and let their <hi>Nominal Essences</hi> differ never so much, the <hi>Real common Essence,</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> of the several Kinds are not at all alter'd by them.</p>
               <p>And these <hi>Real Essences</hi> are <hi>unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> For, however there may happen some variety in Individuals, by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Accidents, yet the Essences of Men, and Horses, and Trees remain always the same; because they do not depend on the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Men, but on the Will of the Creator, who hath made several sorts of Beings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us now come to the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Person.</hi> For, although the <hi>common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in mankind be the same, yet we see a difference in the several Individuals from
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100626:170"/>
one another: So that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are all of the same kind; yet <hi>Peter</hi> is not <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> is not <hi>Iohn.</hi> But what is this Distinction found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon? They may be distinguished from each other by our Senses, as to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Features, distance of Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that is not all; for supposing there were no such external difference; yet there is a difference between them, as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Individuals in the same common Nature. And here lies the true <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Person,</hi> which arises from that <hi>manner of Subsistence</hi> which is in one Individual, and is not Communicable to another. An <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, intelligent Substance,</hi> is rather sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the making of a <hi>Person,</hi> than the proper <hi>Definition</hi> of it; for a <hi>Person</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to something which doth distinguish it from another <hi>Intelligent Substance</hi> in the <hi>same Nature;</hi> and therefore the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it lies in the peculiar manner of Subsistence, which agrees to one, and to none else of the Kind; and this is it which is called <hi>Personality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how do our <hi>simple Ideas</hi> help us out in this Matter? Can we learn from them, the difference of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person?</hi> We may understand the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>abstracted Ideas,</hi> and particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100626:170"/>
by the Impressions of outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and we may find an <hi>Intelligent Substance</hi> in our selves by inward Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut whether that make a <hi>Person</hi> or not, must be understood some other Way; for, if the meer Intelligent Substance makes a Person, then there cannot be the Union of two Natures, but there must be two Persons.</p>
               <p>Therefore a <hi>Person</hi> is a compleat Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Substance, with a peculiar manner of Subsistence; so that if it be a part of another Substance, it is no Person; and on this account the Soul is no Person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it makes up an entire Being by its Union with the Body.</p>
               <p>But when we speak of Finite <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> we are certain that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Persons do imply distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, because they have a distinct and separate Existence; but this will not hold in an infinite Substance, where necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Existence doth belong to the <hi>Idea</hi> of it. And although the Argument from the <hi>Idea of God,</hi> may not be sufficient of it self to prove his Being; yet it will hold as to the excluding any thing from him, which is inconsistent with <hi>necessary Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi>; therefore, if we suppose a Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Persons</hi> in the same <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:100626:171"/>
it must be in a way agreeable to the infinite Perfections of it. And no objection can be taken from the <hi>Idea of God,</hi> to overthrow a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Co-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Persons</hi> in the <hi>same Divine Essence.</hi> For <hi>necessary Existence</hi> doth imply a <hi>Co-existence</hi> of the Divine Persons; and the Unity of the Divine Essence, that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be such a difference of <hi>individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> as there is among mankind. But these things are said to be <hi>above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> if not contrary to it, and even such are said to be repugnant to our Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That therefore is the next thing to be carefully Examin'd, whether <hi>Mysteries of Faith,</hi> or Matters of Revelation <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our Reason,</hi> are to be rejected by us. And a Thing is said to be <hi>above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> when we can have <hi>no clear and distinct Idea</hi> of it in our Minds: And, <hi>that if we have no Ideas of a thing, it is certainly but lost labour for us to trouble our selves about it;</hi>

               <p>We are far from defending <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to our <hi>natural Notions</hi> (of which I have spoken already) but that which we are now upon is, whether any Doctrine

may be rejected, when it is offer'd as a Matter of Faith upon this account, that it is above our Comprehension, or that we can have no <hi>clear Idea of it in our Minds.</hi> And this late Author hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to prove, <hi>That there is nothing so Mysterious, or above Reason in the Gospel.</hi>

New Testament Mystery is always used in the first Sense of the Word.</hi> And what then?

But how doth it appear, that the Word <hi>Mystery</hi> is always used in that Sense? When S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith in his first <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 3. v. 9. <hi>That the Deacons must hold the Mystery of Faith in a pure Conscience;</hi> doth he not mean there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the same <hi>with the Form of sound Words,</hi> which <hi>Timothy</hi> had heard of him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.

He makes <hi>God manifest in the Flesh;</hi> the first part of the <hi>Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi> If it extends to all the other things, doth it exclude this, which is the first mention'd? (And that our Copies are true, is already made to appear.) There is no Reason therefore to quarrel with our Use of the Word <hi>Mystery</hi> in this
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100626:174"/>
Sense; but the Debate doth not depend upon the Word, but upon the Sense of it.</p>
               <p>And therefore I pass over all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the bare use of the Word, as not coming up to the main Point; which is, Whether any Point of Doctrine, which contains in it something above our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension can be made a Matter of Faith?</p>
               <p>For our Author concludes from his Observations,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 145.</note> 
                  <hi>That Faith is so far from being an implicit Assent to any thing above Reason, that this Notion directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the end of Religion, the Nature of Man, and the Goodness and Wisdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we must not be frighted with this bold <hi>Conclusion,</hi> till we have Examin'd his <hi>Premises;</hi> and then we shall find, that some <hi>who are</hi> not <hi>great Readers, are no deep Reasoners.</hi> The first thing he premises is, <hi>That nothing can be said to be a Mystery, because we have not an adequate Idea of it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 75.</note> 
                  <hi>or a distinct View of all its Properties at once, for then every thing would be a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</hi> What is the meaning of this, but that we cannot have an <hi>adequate Idea</hi> of any thing? And yet all our Reason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our <hi>Ideas</hi> according to him, and our <hi>clear and distinct Ideas are by him made the sole Foundation of Reason.</hi> All
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100626:174"/>
our <hi>simple Ideas</hi> are said to be <hi>adequate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are said to be only <hi>the Effects of Powers in things which produce Sensations in us.</hi> But this doth not prove them <hi>ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi> as to <hi>the things,</hi> but only as to our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</hi> But as to <hi>Substances</hi> we are told, <hi>That all our Ideas of them are inadequate.</hi> So that the short of this is, that we have no true Knowledge or Comprehension of any thing; but we may understand Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, as well as we understand any thing else, for in Truth we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand nothing. Is not this a method of <hi>true Reasoning</hi> to make us reject Doctrines of Faith, because we do not comprehend them, and at the same time to say we <hi>comprehend nothing?</hi> For I appeal to the common Sense of mankind, whether we can be said to <hi>Comprehend</hi> that, which we can have no <hi>adequate Idea</hi> of? But he appeals to the Learned; for he saith, <hi>That to comprehend in all correct Authors is nothing else but to know.</hi> But what is <hi>to know?</hi> Is it not to have <hi>adequate Ideas</hi> of the things we know? How then can we know, that of which we can have no <hi>adequate Idea?</hi> For if our Knowledge be limited to our <hi>Ideas,</hi> our Knowledge must be imperfect and inadequate where our <hi>Ideas</hi> are so.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:100626:175"/>But let us lay these things together. Whatever we can have no <hi>adequate Idea</hi> of is <hi>above our Knowledge,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>above our Reason;</hi> and so all <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> are <hi>above our Reason;</hi> and yet he saith, with great Confidence, <hi>That to Assent to any thing, above Reason, destroys Religion, and the Nature of man, and the Wisdom and Goodness of God.</hi> How is it possible for the same man to say this, and to say w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In natural things we can have no <hi>adequate Ideas;</hi> but the things are confessed to be <hi>above our Reason</hi>; but in Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, to <hi>Assent to things above our Reason is against the Nature of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How can these things consist?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But these are not Mysteries.</hi> Yes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is of that Nature that we can have no <hi>Idea</hi> of it, is certainly a <hi>Mystery</hi> to us. For what is more unknown than it is known is a <hi>Mystery.</hi> The true Notion of a <hi>Mystery</hi> being something that is hidden from our Knowledge. Of which there may be several Kinds. For a <hi>Mystery</hi> may be taken for,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:100626:175"/>1. Something kept secret, but fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as soon as it is discover'd; thus <hi>Tully</hi> in his <hi>Epistles</hi> speaks of <hi>Mysteries</hi> which he had to tell his Friend,<note place="margin">Ad. Attic. 4.87. ed. R S.</note> but he would not let his <hi>Amanuensis</hi> know; no doubt such things might be very well understood as soon as discover'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Something kept from common Knowledge, although there might be great Difficulties about them when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd. Thus <hi>Tully</hi> speaks of <hi>Mysteries</hi> among the <hi>Philosophers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acad. 4.18.</note> particularly among the <hi>Academicks,</hi> who kept up their Doctrine of the <hi>Criterion</hi> as a Secret, which, when it was known, had many Difficulties about it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Something that Persons were not admitted to know, but with great Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it. Such were the <hi>Athenian Mysteries</hi> which <hi>Tully</hi> mentions with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, although they deserved it not:<note place="margin">De Leg. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 14.</note> but because they were not Communicated to any but with Difficulty, they were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mysteries.</hi> And this is so obvious a piece of Learning, that no <hi>great Reading,</hi> or <hi>deep Reasoning</hi> is required about it. Only it may be observed, that the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is opposed to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi> related to those who were <hi>initiated</hi> and not made <hi>Epoptoe; i. e.</hi> to those who
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100626:176"/>
did not throughly understand them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had more knowledge of them than such as were not <hi>initiated. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piodorus,</hi> in reckoning up the <hi>Degrees</hi> of Admissions, mentions the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So that they were properly <hi>Mysteries</hi> to such, who knew something; though there were other things farther to be discover'd, but they did not yet know what they were, as the <hi>Epoptoe</hi> did.</p>
               <p>From hence the ancient Christian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did not only call the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but more abstruse Points of Faith by the name of <hi>Mysteries;</hi> so S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> calls <hi>the Resurrection, a great and ineffable Mystery.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chrys. Hom. de Resurrect.</note> And <hi>Isidore Pelusiota</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Isidor. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. <hi>l.</hi> 2. Ep. 192.</note> 
                  <hi>That S.</hi> Paul, <hi>when he speaks of the great Mystery of Godliness, doth not mean that it is wholly unknown to us, but that it is impossible to Comprehend it. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> saith, it is therefore called <hi>the great Mystery of Godliness; because although it be now revealed to all, yet the manner of it is hidden from us, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, for this Reason it is called a Mystery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is in the way of <hi>Reading;</hi> let us now come to <hi>deep Reasoning;</hi> and see how strongly he argues against this Sense of the Word <hi>Mysteries:</hi> his Words are these; <hi>They trifle then exceedingly, and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100626:176"/>
discover a mighty Scarcity of better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who defend their Mysteries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity not Myst.</hi> p. 80, 81.</note> 
                  <hi>by this pitiful shift of drawing Inferences from what is unknown to what is known, or of insisting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on adequate Ideas; except they will agree as some do, to call every Spire of Grass, sitting and standing, fish and flesh to be Mysteries. And if out of a pertinacious or worse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, they will be still fooling, and call these things Mysteries, I'm willing to admit as many as they please in Religion, if they will allow me likewise to make mine as intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others, as these are to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is easie to guess whom these kind Words were intended for: And are not these very modest and civil Expressions? <hi>Trifling, Fooling; out of a pertinacious, or worse Humour;</hi> but why, <hi>Fooling about My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,</hi> to call such things by that Name, which are in some measure known, but in a greater measure unknown to us? and if these are real Mysteries in Nature, why may not the same term be used for Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith?</p>
               <p>And I think in so plain a Case, no great store of Arguments need to be used. But <hi>in these natural things,</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 84.</note> 
                  <hi>we have distinct Ideas of the Properties which make the Nominal Essence, but we are absolutely ignorant of the Real Essence, or intrinsick
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100626:177"/>
Constitution of a thing, which is the ground or support of all its Properties.</hi> Are not then (without <hi>Trifling and Fooling</hi>) these Real Essences <hi>Mysteries</hi> to them? They know there are such by the <hi>Ideas</hi> of their Properties, but know nothing of their <hi>Real Essence;</hi> and yet they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to be <hi>Mysteries?</hi> If they do understand them, why do they say, <hi>They do not, nor cannot?</hi> And if this be true, let them call them what they please, they must be inexplicable <hi>Mysteries</hi> to them. So that all this is mere quarrelling about a Word, which they would fain be rid of, if they knew how; but they involve and perplex themselves more by their own <hi>deep Reasonings</hi> against the <hi>Trifling</hi> and <hi>Fooling</hi> of others.</p>
               <p>But he saith, <hi>That some would have the most palpable Absurdities and gross Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to go down, or words that signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, because men cannot comprehend the Essence of their own Souls, nor the Essence of God, and other Spiritual Substances.</hi> We utterly deny, that any Article of our Faith contains in it any <hi>palpable Absurdities,</hi> or <hi>gross Contradictions</hi> (as I hope hath been proved already as to the Doctrine of the Trinity which is chiefly struck at) but surely your <hi>deep Reasoners</hi> may find
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100626:177"/>
a difference between <hi>gross Contradictions to our Reason,</hi> and barely <hi>being above it,</hi> or not having any <hi>distinct Conception</hi> of the Nature of it. And that is all that we assert, and which they grant as to all <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this be their Way of arguing, they may even return to <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, without any great lessening of their Understandings. But none are so bold in attacking the <hi>Mysteries of the Christian Faith</hi>; as the Smatterers in <hi>Ideas,</hi> and new Terms of Philosophy, without any true Understanding of them. For these <hi>Ideas</hi> are become but another sort of Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with such men; and they would reason as well upon <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> or upon <hi>Occult Qualities,</hi> and <hi>Substantial Forms,</hi> but only that they are <hi>Terms</hi> out of <hi>Fashion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we find that the change of Terms doth neither improve nor alter mens Understandings; but only their Ways of speaking; and ill Gamesters will not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Game one jot the better, for having <hi>new Cards</hi> in their hands. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we must see what Work they make of it.</p>

                  <hi>Although we do not know the Nature of the Soul, yet we know as much of it, as we do of any thing else, if not more,</hi> i. e. we really know nothing by any <hi>adequate Idea</hi> of it, but we must believe nothing, but what we have a <hi>clear distinct Idea</hi> of. Is not this a rare way of fixing the <hi>Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith and Reason? As to God and his Attributes,</hi>

others whom he calls <hi>Mysterious Wits?</hi> The Question is, whether any thing ought to be rejected as an Article of Faith, because we cannot comprehend it, or have a clear and distinct Perception of it? He concludes it must be so, or else <hi>we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Religion, and the Nature of Man, and the Wisdom and Goodness of God.</hi> Here is an Essential Attribute of God, <hi>viz.</hi> his Eternity. Am I bound to believe it or not? Yes, doubtless. But how can I comprehend this Attribute of Eternity? <hi>Very easily.</hi> How so? <hi>Do not you compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that it is incomprehensible?</hi> What then? Doth this reach the Nature of the thing, or only the manner of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception? <hi>If the Nature of the thing be, that it cannot be comprehended, then you rightly understand the Nature of the thing, and so it is not above your Reason.</hi> Let the Case be now put as to the <hi>Trinity;</hi> do you believe the Doctrine of it, as of Divine Revelation? No, <hi>God hath given me the Nature, and Faculties of a Man; and I can believe nothing, which I cannot have a distinct and clear Idea of; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I must have new Faculties.</hi> Will you hold to this Principle? Then you must believe nothing, which you cannot have a clear and distinct <hi>Idea</hi> of. Very true:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100626:179"/>
But can you have a clear and distinct Idea of what you cannot comprehend? <hi>A clear Idea, is that whereof the mind hath a full and evident Perception. A distinct Idea, is that whereby the mind perceives the difference of it from all others.</hi> Is this right? Yes. But can you have a full and evident Perception of a thing, so as to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it from all others, when you grant it to be <hi>Incomprehensible?</hi> If you have a <hi>full Perception</hi> of it, you comprehend its Nature, and especially if you can <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> it from all other things; but when you say, <hi>its Nature is Incomprehensible,</hi> and yet <hi>believe it,</hi> you must deny it to be necessary to Faith, to have <hi>a clear and distinct Idea</hi> of the thing proposed. And if it be repugnant to your Faculties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the <hi>Trinity,</hi> because you cannot have <hi>a clear and distinct Idea</hi> of it, for the same Reason, you must unavoidably reject his <hi>Eternity,</hi> and all other Attributes which have <hi>Infinity</hi> joyned with them.</p>
               <p>But we must stop here, because this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Undertaker hath said, <hi>That he despairs not of rendring Eternity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity as little Mysterious,</hi>

God. But if he was for ever, he must be from himself, and what Notion, or Conception can we have in our Minds concerning it?</q>

               <p>To this say they, <hi>To say a Person, or Thing is from it self is a Contradiction; it implies this Contradiction, it was before it was. And they are sorry an Eternal God must be a Contradiction.</hi> What a false and spiteful Inference is this?</p>

               <p>But I confess I aimed at shewing, that it was impossible for us to have any <hi>clear and distinct Idea</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I took in all possible ways of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, either by Gods being from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or his Co-existing with all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Time, without any Succession in his own Being; or his having a successive Duration. From all which I argued the Impossibility of a clear Notion of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And now what do these Men do? They dispute against one of these Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and very triumphantly expose, as they think, the <hi>Absurdities</hi> of it. And what then? <hi>Why then this Notion will not do.</hi> But I say none will do.</p>
               <p>I prove there can be no successive Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in a Being of necessary Existence; and that it is not to be conceived, how without Succession God should be present with the Being, and not Being, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and Performance of the same thing; and yet one of these ways we must make
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100626:181"/>
use of. From whence I concluded, That all we can attain to is, a full Satisfaction of our Reason concerning God's Eternity, although we can form no distinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it in our Minds. But when these Men instead of answering the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all the Notions of Eternity, only dispute against one Notion of it, they apparently shew the weakness of their Cause, if it will bear no other Defences, but such as this. For I take it, that the main Debate in point of Reason depends upon this, whether we can be certain of the Being of a Thing, of which we can have <hi>no clear and distinct Idea?</hi> If we may, then it can be no Objection in point of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we can have no <hi>clear and distinct Idea</hi> of the Matter revealed; since there can be no Reason to tie us up stricter in Point of Revelation, than we are without it. If we can be certain in Reason of many things, we can have no such <hi>Ideas</hi> of, what imaginable Reason can there be, that a Point of Faith should be rejected on that account.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I urged another Attribute of God, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Spirituality</hi> for the same Reason; <hi>viz.</hi> that we are satisfied in point of Reason that God must be a Spirit; and yet we cannot have a clear distinct positive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:100626:181"/>And what answer do they give to this? As wise as the former. Why truly, <hi>I had no cause to object this against them,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Very well! but doth my argument proceed upon that, or upon the not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>a distinct and clear Idea</hi> of a <hi>Spirit</hi>?

If they had answer'd this, they had said something to the purpose. To resolve all <hi>into God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom</hi> is a good answer from us, but not from them. For we think it our Duty to satisfie our selves with what God hath revealed, without prying into the manner of things above our Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but these Men who will receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they have <hi>clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Ideas</hi> of, ought to shew the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this, or else we must be excused on the same reason, if we allow the manner of the <hi>divine Subsistences</hi> in the <hi>same Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> to be above our Comprehension.</p>

               <p>And now of a sudden they are quite turned about; for before they were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for fencing and warding off Blows, but at last they come to the point, and own <hi>the being of God to be comprehensible by them; and that they have clear and distinct Ideas of God's infinite Attributes.</hi> This is indeed to the purpose, if they can make these things out.

               </p>
               <p>To this they reply,<note place="margin">P. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>That to comprehend the Being or Existence of God, is only this, to comprehend that God is, and if we cannot comprehend that, all Religion ceases.</hi> Is not this a fine turn?

who before them did understand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be, <hi>That we cannot comprehend that there is a God?</hi> This is not mere <hi>trifling,</hi> for it looks like something worse; and yet they presently after say, <hi>That to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a thing is to have a clear adequate Conception of it.</hi> And will they pretend to have such a one of the divine Essence, when they confess but a little before, <hi>That we converse every day with very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things,</hi>

                  <hi>none of which we comprehend, and that I might have spared my pains in proving it</hi>?

But for such as peculiarly belong to God as <hi>Eternity</hi> doth; and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100626:183"/>
of other Attributes as they belong to him, as they are <hi>infinite,</hi> so they are above our <hi>Comprehension.</hi> (1.) As to Eternity, say they, it is a <hi>clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Notion of Eternity, to say, it is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration without beginning and without end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we can have no <hi>clear and distinct Notion of Duration,</hi> when applied to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hath <hi>necessary Existence.</hi> For <hi>Duration,</hi> they say, <hi>consists in a Succession.</hi> And what <hi>Succession</hi> can there be in a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which <hi>always</hi> is the same, if there were no difference of times, <hi>i. e.</hi> God was the same Being before time was, and is the very same Being under all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of times; he hath not any other Duration now than he had before, and what Succession could there be where there was no time?

nor can apply <hi>Succession</hi> to a <hi>Being</hi> which hath <hi>necessary Existence,</hi> then we can have no <hi>clear and distinct Notion of God's Eternity.</hi> (2.) As to the <hi>Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of God's Perfections, they say, <hi>That although the Mind be in it self finite,</hi>

                  <hi>yet it hath an infinite Comprehension, for what is finite with respect to its Extension of parts may be infinite in other respects, and with respect to some of its Powers.</hi> But how doth it appear that we have any <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>comprehend</hi> what is <hi>infinite</hi>? All the <hi>Power</hi> we have extends only to <hi>adding and enlarging our Ideas</hi> without bounds, <hi>i. e.</hi> we can put no stop to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, but still they may go farther than we can possibly think, but is this an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Comprehension?</hi> So far from it, that this shews our Capacities to be finite, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our <hi>Ideas</hi> cannot go so far as our Reason. For our Reason tells us, we can never go so far, but we may still go farther: but it is impossible for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to have <hi>distinct Ideas</hi> of the infinite moments in an eternal Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the utmost Bounds of Immensity, or of the extent of infinite Power and Knowledge, since the very Notion of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> implies, that we can set no bounds to our Thoughts; and therefore although
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100626:184"/>
the <hi>Infinity</hi> of the divine Attributes be evident to our Reason, yet it is likewise evident to our Reason, that what is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> must be above our <hi>Comprehension.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. I come now to the last enquiry which is that if we allow things above our Reason, what stop can be put to any absurd Doctrine, which we may be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to believe?</p>
               <p>And this is that which our <hi>Vnitarians</hi> object in all their late Pamphlets. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to my Sermon they say, That on our principles, <hi>our Reason would be in vain,</hi>

But I did not expect to have found this <hi>Parallel</hi> so often insisted upon, without an answer to <hi>two Dialogues</hi> purposely writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on that Subject, at a time when the

Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> was used as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to bring in <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as that is now alledged for casting off the other.</p>
               <p>But I must do them that right to tell the World, that at that time a <hi>Socinian</hi> Answer was written to those <hi>Dialogues,</hi> which I saw, and wish'd might be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the World might be satisfied about it and them. But they thought fit to forbear; and in all their late Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets where this <hi>Parallel</hi> is so often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, there is but once, that I can find, any notice taken of those <hi>Dialogues,</hi> and that in a very superficial manner. For the main Design and Scope of them is past over, and only one particular mention'd, which shall be answer'd in its due order.</p>
               <p>But in answer to the general Enquiry, I shall endeavour to state the due Bounds between <hi>Faith and Reason,</hi> and thereby to shew, that by those grounds on which we receive the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> we do not give way to the Entertainment of any absurd Opinion, nor overthrow the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We have no difference with them about the <hi>Vse</hi> of our <hi>Reason</hi> as to the <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of a <hi>Revelation.</hi> For in this case, we are as much as they, for searching
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:100626:186"/>
into the grounds of our Faith; for we look on it as a <hi>reasonable Act</hi> of our Minds, and if we did not allow this, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our selves to believe without grounds. And if we have grounds for our Faith, we can express them in Words that are intelligible; and if we can give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Faith in an intelligible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and with a design to give others sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction about it, I think this is making <hi>use of our Reason in matters of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We have no difference with them about the <hi>use of our Reason,</hi> as to the <hi>true Sense of Revelation.</hi> We never say, that Men are bound to believe upon the bare <hi>sound of Words</hi> without examining the <hi>Sense</hi> of them. We allow all the best and most reasonable ways of attaining to it, by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, Languages, Versions, comparing of Places, and especially the <hi>Sense of the Christian Church</hi> in the best and purest Ages, nearest the Apostolical Times and express'd in solemn and publick Acts.</p>
               <p>By these <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> we are willing to proceed, and not by any late and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain methods of interpreting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>

matters as are offer'd to our Assent. For it is to no purpose to require them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, who cannot use the Faculties which are necessary in order to it. Which would be like giving the <hi>Benefit of the Clergy</hi> to a Man with a <hi>Cataract</hi> in both his Eyes. And it would be very unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to put his Life upon that Issue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could read or not, because he had the <hi>same Organs of Seeing</hi> that other Men had; for in this case the whole matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended not on the <hi>Organ</hi> but the <hi>Vse</hi> of it: This needs no Application.</p>
