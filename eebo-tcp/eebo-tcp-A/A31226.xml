            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Being one day in <hi>S. Pauls
Church-yard,</hi> amongſt
the <hi>Stationers,</hi> ſome
Books fell into my hands
lately ſet forth: Hiſtories of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
begun in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the year
1641. with the Wars and tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that followed on that occaſion;
and finding my ſelf in many places
cited, acting as a confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
which in plain Engliſh is as a
Rebel: I thought fit to publiſh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
ſetting forth my own ſtory (not
to excuſe the Rebellion, for all the
water of the Sea cannot waſh it off that
<pb facs="tcp:101258:4"/>
Nation, it having been begun moſt
bloodily on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in that
Kingdom, in a time of ſetled peace,
without the leaſt occaſion given) but
what I write, is chiefly to draw from
the world ſome compaſſion, my caſe
being ſingular, as I hope the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires
will make out. I take God to
witneſs, I never bad the leaſt hint of
the Rebellion, till being one night at
Supper with my Lord of <hi>Kery,</hi> at his
Houſe in that County; his Lordſhip
being a Privy-Counſellor, ſhewed me a
Letter which he then received from the
Juſtices, ſetting forth the attempt on
the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in the <hi>North,</hi> from whence
ſprung that unjuſtifiable War, in
which I was unfortunately engaged:
But on my repentance, puruſed by
my actings to bring on the firſt Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:101258:4"/>
and the Peace of 46. I had
many teſtimonies from the late King
of Bleſſed memory, and his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the now Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi>
that my faults were forgiven me. Since
I have always puruſed my duty in
faithfully ſerving the King; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his death, his Majeſty that now
reigns: for which, though moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,
I have received many marks
of his favours; and ſince his happy
Reſtoration, (for my better ſecurity)
hath given me his gracious Pardon;
by virtue of which, I have ſate in the
Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as being a
Peer of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now to gratifie the Reader for
the trouble given by theſe Memoires,
and to induce him to a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
I ſhall (God willing) e're

               </argument>
               <p>WHat induced me to write theſe
Memoires, is to anſwer a
wonder, that reaſonably may be made:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101258:6"/>
how I being a Peer of <hi>England,</hi> and an
<hi>Engliſh-man</hi> both by Birth and Deſcent
on all ſides, ſhould engage my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in their Wars: not
ſpeaking a word of their Language, and
having little in their Kingdom. I ſay
then, that I never deſigned it, but fell
into thoſe Troubles by chance, and
much againſt my will. The Story thus.
I was newly come from my Travels
abroad: where my Genius leading me
to ſee whatever was to be ſeen in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
I went of purpoſe to the Siege of
<hi>Turain</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> After my return, I
attended the King at <hi>Berwick,</hi> till the
firſt Pacification with the <hi>Scots.</hi> And
then, hearing that the <hi>Prince Cardinal</hi>
Governor of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi>
was preparing to March towards the
relief of <hi>Arras</hi> beſieged at that time
by the <hi>French:</hi> I paſs'd over again to
<hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artois;</hi> and ſaw an end
of that expedition, and <hi>Arras</hi> yielded
to the Beſiegers. In ſhort, my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
were to War, and ſo intended
to make it my Trade, by putting my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101258:6"/>
ſelf into the Service of ſome Foreign
Prince.</p>
               <p>To this effect, having ſettled my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in <hi>England,</hi> I made as I thought
a ſtep into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to do the like there.
But it proved a longer ſtay. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
take out of the enſuing Letter to me
from my Brother Colonel <hi>Mervin
Tuchet.</hi>
               </p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>HEaring your Lordſhip is writing
a <hi>Narrative</hi> of your concerns in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
during the late War, &amp; how you came
to be engaged: I having been at that
time with you, may poſſibly mind you of
ſome Paſſages, more in my knowledge than
yours. When the Rebellion broke forth
in the <hi>North,</hi> you were in <hi>Mounſter:</hi>
and on the News, you immediately repaired
to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to the Lords Juſtices, Sir
<hi>William Parſons,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Burlace:</hi>
where you acquainted them, with your
willingneſs, to ſerve the King againſt the
Rebels, as your Anceſtors had formerly
done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> on like occaſions. To
which they replyed, your Religion was an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101258:7"/>
Obſtacle. There being then a Parliament in
that Kingdom ſitting, you were reſolved to
ſee the Event, ſending me to your Houſe
at <hi>Madingſtown,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi>
to ſecure and defend it, in caſe there
were any Riſing in thoſe parts. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon my
coming, I found many poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtript:
whom I took into the Houſe and relieved,
defending them in the beſt manner I could.
Some time after, the Parliament being
diſſolved, you deſired of the Juſtices a
Paſs to go for <hi>England.</hi> But they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
you acquainted them that your Eſtate
there, was not in a condition to maintain
you in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and deſired that you might
be ſupplied with ſome mony, for your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
until ſuch time, that you could
apply your ſelf, to the Parliament in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for a Paſs to bring you over; which
they denied. You preſt them then to direct
you, what courſe you ſhould ſteer. To which
they replied: Go home and make fair Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
You took this Advice, and being
come; my Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi> and my Lady
Dutcheſs of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> ſoon followed;
and you were very well pleaſed with ſo good
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101258:7"/>
Company to ſpend your Proviſions. But in
a ſhort time, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> came and drove
away great part of your ſtock, to a village
near. It being night, you deſired me to
take your Servants and endeavour the
recovery. Which I did, bringing with
me two or three of the chiefeſt Conductors
of this Rabble. This enrag'd the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſo
much, as you conceiv'd I was not ſafe
there: and therefore ſent me to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to
attend the Juſtices Orders, and aſſure them
of your readineſs to return on a Call, they
ſending a Convoy. Which they promis'd
to do, as occaſion required. When I went
from you, you thought it neceſſary, that
I ſhould take with me, all the poor <hi>Engliſh</hi>
that were ſaved; and to let them go with
the Carts, which were loaden with Wool
for <hi>Dublin;</hi> leaving only one of them,
who was a Sadler, then my Lord of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trims</hi>
ſervant. In the paſſage neer <hi>Rath-Cool,</hi>
the Rebels fell upon them, and
barbarouſly killed ſome, and wounded
others: my ſelf and one more eſcaping by
the goodneſs of our Horſes. But a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of mine governing the Carts, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101258:8"/>
being an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> they took. And
whilſt they were preparing to hang him,
Sir <hi>John Dungans</hi> Eldeſt Son, <hi>Watt
Dungan</hi> came forth of his Fathers houſe
with a Party, and reſcued him with the
reſt of thoſe that were left alive, and
brought them ſafe to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where
I was gotten. The Sadler that I had left
in my Lord of <hi>Antrims</hi> Service, ſome
time after met me, complaining, that
coming for <hi>Dublin</hi> he had been taken by
the Rebells, by means of a Boy that ſerved
your Lordſhip: and if I would not give
him forty Shillings, being he was damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
(in ſo much) he would complain. I
told him, that the Boy he mentioned was
no Servant of yours; but kept out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to whip the Dogs out of doors:
being blind of an Eye, and lame of a Leg.
He replied, that although he were blind
and lame, he had a Note from my Lord
of <hi>Antrim,</hi> to have him apprehended by
thoſe that were neither blind, nor lame,
which he gave to them, who took him
Priſoner, and carried him to the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Leixlipp,</hi> kept by the Rebels. I bad
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101258:8"/>
him do what he pleaſed: for I would not
give him one Farthing.</p>
                     <p>The next I heard of it, was that he
had complained; and that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was Indicted of high Treaſon. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon
which I made my addreſſes to the Lords
Juſtices again, to let them know, that
they had not kept their Words with me,
in ſuffering this Clandeſtine proceeding
againſt my Brother; but however, I would
go and fetch you: and to that purpoſe
deſired them to let me have a party of
Horſe. But that they refuſed. I then
came down to you with ſome of my Friends,
and acquainted you with what had paſt.
You anſwered, that you knew nothing of it,
and went immediately with me to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin;</hi>
where you addreſſed your ſelf to my
Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as I did my ſelf in your
behalf to the Lord Juſtices and Council,
to acquaint them that you were come.
They replied, that they could ſay nothing
to it, till you appeared before them. Which
you did the next day; and then they Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
you to come the day following. At
which time without calling you in, they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101258:9"/>
committed you to Mr. <hi>Woodcocks Houſe,</hi>
one of the Sheriffs of <hi>Dublin.</hi> Now I
ſeeing this rigorous uſage towards you,
and being refuſed a Paſs for my ſelf to go
for <hi>England,</hi> made a ſhift to get away in
a ſmall boat, and go directly to the King
at <hi>York,</hi> and Petition him that you might
be ſent for over to be Tried here by your
Peers. But his Majeſties anſwer was, that
he had left all the Affairs of <hi>Ireland</hi> to
the Parliament. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which I went to
<hi>London,</hi> and Petitioned the Parliament
to the ſame effect. Their anſwer was, that
they could do nothing without the King;
of which I gave you an account by Letter.
This was the laſt Correſpondence I had
with you, being after that continually
ſerving his Majeſty in <hi>England.</hi> But
the King coming from <hi>Newark</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi>
he ſent me with Diſpatches to my Lord
Lieutenant, and Ordered me to go to you,
and uſe my endeavours to perſuade you to
haſten a Peace. You received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
as very agreeable, ſaying that
from the beginning of the War you had
always laboured for a Peace, and that you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101258:9"/>
hoped it would ſoon be done. Before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
I ſaw it proclaimed: and it goes
by the name of the Peace of 46.</p>

               <p>Now that you have ſeen what my
Brother writes of the occaſion of my
longer ſtay in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the deſign of my going thether:
I will hence forth in my own Method
go on with the Story of my own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
in that Kingdom. But to this end
I muſt once more place myſelf in <hi>Maden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtown;</hi>
whether, as you ſee in my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Letter, I was firſt retired by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Lords Juſtices. I continued
there ſome five or ſix Moneths after in
peace and quietneſs; and, for the greateſt
part of the time, in ſo noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
company as that of the Dutcheſs
of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Lord Marqueſs
of <hi>Antrim</hi> her Husband, who did me
that very great honour.</p>
               <p>In the mean while Parties were ſent
out by the Juſtices from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101258:10"/>
the Towns adjacent, to kill and deſtroy
the Rebels, and the like was done
through all parts of the Kingdom. But
the Officers and Soldiers did not take
care enough to diſtinguiſh between
Rebels and Subjects; but killed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places promiſcuouſly. On which
partly, and partly on other provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that preceeded, and ſome too that
followed, the whole Nation, finding
themſelves concerned took to Arms
for their own defence, and particularly
the Lords of the Pale did ſo: who yet
at the ſame time, deſired the Juſtices
to ſend their Petition to the King.
Which was refuſed. And, for their
farther diſcouragement, Sir <hi>John
Read,</hi> his Majeſties Sworn Servant (a
ſtranger to the Country, un-engag'd,
and an eye-witneſs of their proceedings,
then upon his journey to <hi>England</hi>) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with by them to carry their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance
to his Majeſty the late King
of ever Bleſſed Memory, and to beg his
pardon for what they had done, coming
to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and not concealing his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101258:10"/>
was put to the Rack for his good
will. The ſaid Lords having Tried this,
and other ways, to acquaint the King
with their Grievances, and all failing,
an open War broke forth generally
throughout the Kingdom, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
for me. One Encounter
happened in the ſight of my Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Richard</hi>
Vicount of <hi>Mount-Garret</hi> the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> The
latter was defeated. This Encounter
goes, by the name of the Battel of <hi>Kill-Ruſh,</hi>
and was fought the 15<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>April.</hi> 1642.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> after this being
to Paſs with his Army juſt by my Door,
ſome of his people being of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
came Galloping before, aſſuring
that my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> would be with
me in half an hour. On which, my Lady
Dutcheſs, and my ſelf be-ſtirred our
ſelves, and having two or three Cooks,
a good Barns Door, and plenty of Wine,
we patcht up a Dinner ready to be ſet
on the Table at my Lords coming in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:101258:11"/>
But ſome that came with him, turned
this another way, magnifying the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
beyond what it was, and
Publiſhing through the Army, that it
was a mighty Feaſt for my Lord of
<hi>Mount-Garrett</hi> and the Rebels;
and this through the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
paſt for Currant. I believe it
was much the Cauſe of that under-hand
villanous proceeding againſt me, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in my Brothers Letter. My La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Dutcheſs and my Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi>
ſoon left me going into their own
Country in the North. For a while I
Tided it out alone, till my Brother
fetcht me to <hi>Dublin.</hi> You have ſeen
by my Brothers Letter how I was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
and no hopes of any relief
from either the King, or Parliament
ſitting in <hi>England.</hi> So that after twenty
Weeks that I had remained in Priſon,
I was ordered to be removed to the
Caſtle of <hi>Dublin.</hi> Which Startled me,
and brought to my thoughts the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
who confiding in his Innocency loſt his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101258:11"/>
head. I concluded then, that Innocency
was a ſcurvy Plea in an angry time. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
I looked upon the Juſtices and moſt
of the Council to be of the Parliaments per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion.
Wherefore I reſolved to attempt
an Eſcape, and ſave my ſelf in the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Quarters. Which I did in this manner.</p>
               <p>After the Battel of <hi>Killruſh</hi> there
was one <hi>George Lidwidge</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi>-man
and Trooper left wounded in my houſe;
who being recovered, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of Kindneſſes received, often
viſited me in Priſon. I found ſo much
Fidelity in the man towards me, that I
truſted him with my deſign; deſiring
his aſſiſtance: which he promis'd. I
then, giving him Mony, ordered him
to buy me three Horſes for my ſelf and
two Servants, with Sadles and Piſtols:
which he did. And the next night juſt
as the Maid was to ſhut the Door, it
being dark, I ſlipt into the Street:
leaving my two men in the houſe, and
appointing them where they ſhould
find me in the Morning. About Nine
of the Clock they came out of the houſe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101258:12"/>
bidding the Maid make no noiſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that I was not well, and had
not reſted that Night. They coming
to me, the Guards of the Town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
and the Pattroles come in,
were ſent before with the Son of the
Trooper to the place, where our Horſes
ſtood, to have them ready: the Trooper
and my ſelf ſoon following, but I as his
Man carrying a Saddle under my Arm.
To be ſhort, we Mounted all on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back;
March'd as Troopers careleſly
out of the Town; and took our way
by <hi>Temple-Oage</hi> towards the Mountains
of <hi>Wicklow.</hi> Where being come, I
cared little for the Juſtices. But before
Dinner my Eſcape was diſcovered by
the people of the Houſe; and on Notice
given to the Juſtices, I was purſued by
a Party of Horſe taking their way
to my houſe at <hi>Madingſtown.</hi> In
the Night they inveſted it: but not
finding me, after having poſſeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of what I had within, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
they killed many of my Servants,
and Burnt the Houſe. I kept on my
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101258:12"/>
way towards <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> as much through
the Faſt Country as I could, till I arrived.</p>
               <p>Where I found the Town very full,
and many of my acquaintance: all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for their Natural defence; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no diſtinction made; or ſafety, but
in Arms. To this end they had choſen
amongſt themſelves, out of the moſt
eminent Perſons a Council, and gave
it the Title of the <hi>Supream Council of
the Confederate Catholicks of</hi> Ireland:
and formed an Oath of <hi>Aſſociation</hi> by
which all were bound to obey them.
They had made Four Generals of the
Four Provinces: <hi>Preſton</hi> of <hi>Leinſter, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of <hi>Mounſter, Owen-roe O Neal</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi>
and one <hi>Burk</hi> of <hi>Conaught:</hi> and being
to give Commiſſions they cauſed a Seal
to be made, which was the Seal of the
Council. I was ſent for to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to tell my Story, which I did. And
then being askt, what I intended to do:
I anſwer'd, To get into <hi>France,</hi> and ſo
to <hi>England.</hi> Upon which they told me
their condition, and what they were
doing for their preſervation; perſuading
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101258:13"/>
me to ſtay with them, being I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
in the Country, had three Siſters
Married amongſt them, was perſecuted
on the ſame ſcore they were, and
ruined ſo, that we had no more to loſe
but our Lives. I took two or three days
to think of this Propoſition; examining
the <hi>Model of Government,</hi> they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
againſt the meeting of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Aſſembly, and moſt particularly
their <hi>Oath of Aſſociation.</hi> Which Oath

               </argument>
               <p>ON the whole matter I returned
to this Council, thank'd them
for their good Opinion of me, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
my ſelf to run a Fortune with
them. Whether Anger and Revenge did
not incline me to it as much as any
other conſideration, I cannot reſolve.
This I well remember, that I conſider'd
how I had been uſed, and ſeen my houſe
burning as I paſs'd by: beſides, that I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101258:15"/>
was a light man, with no Charge, and
not any hopes of redreſs from the King,
who was then engaged in an Inteſtine
War. Now being thus a Confederate,
and having taken the <hi>Oath,</hi> they made
me one of the Council, and General of
the Horſe under <hi>Preſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> met the 24. of <hi>Oct.</hi> 1642.
It differ'd nothing from a Parliament,
other then that the Lords and Commons
ſate together, and not in two Houſes.
This you ſee was a force put upon us;
and we hoped in time, the ſtorm being
paſs'd, to return to our old Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under the King. We had many
learned in the Law amongſt us, whom
we encouraged to keep us, as near the
old Government as might be, holding
to the Ancient Laws of the Land.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Aſſembly</hi> without delay appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all the Council had done, and ſettled
a <hi>Model of Government. viz.</hi> that at the end
of every <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> the <hi>Supream
Council</hi> ſhould be confirmed or changed
as they thought fit. That it ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of 25. ſix out of each Province, three
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101258:15"/>
of the ſix ſtill reſident. The 25<hi>th</hi> was
my ſelf with no Relation to any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
but to the Kingdom in general.
Every Province had a <hi>Provincial Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
which met on Occaſions: and each
County had Commiſſioners for Applot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
money within themſelves, as it
came to their ſhares on the general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotment
of the Province. Many other
things there were, as to Government.
If a Letter came to them written in
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> it would be wonder'd at; and
hardly could one be found to read it. We
were not in caſe to bring to Juſtice thoſe
that begun the Rebellion. But I never
ſaw any of them eſteemed or advanced.
The <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> being put off, the
Generals fell to their work: and my
General took in <hi>Burras, Fort-Faukland,</hi>
and <hi>Birrh</hi> in the Kings County, where
I was with him.</p>
               <p>And I had the good Fortune to begin
my firſt commanding in the Wars with
an Action of Charity. For going to ſee
this Garriſon of <hi>Birrh</hi> before it marcht
out, I came into a great room, where
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101258:16"/>
many people of Quality were both men
and women. They with many Tears ſo
ſoon as they ſaw me, fell on their Knees,
deſiring me to ſave their lives. I was
aſtoniſhed at their poſture and Petition:
and, deſiring them to riſe, ask'd what
the matter was? They anſwered, that
from the firſt day of the Wars, there
had been continual action and much
blood ſhed between them and their <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Neighbours, and little Quarter on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide. And that therefore under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that I was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man,
ſome knowing me, they deſired that I
would take them into my Protection.
I doubted that there was too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for their fears, conſidering they
were to March two or three days,
through the Woods of <hi>Iregan</hi> and waſte
Countreys, before they came to <hi>Athy</hi>
their next friends Garriſon. I went
immediately to the General, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that I might command their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy:
which he granted. Then culling
out two hundred Horſe and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foot, in whom I had moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101258:16"/>
I March'd and delivered them
with their Baggage ſafe. They were at
leaſt eight hundred Men, Women and
Children. I was with this General the
18<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 42. when he was beaten
at <hi>Roſs</hi> by the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond;</hi>
and by Colonel <hi>Monk,</hi> ſince Duke of
<hi>Albermarle,</hi> at <hi>Timochoe</hi> in the Queens
County the 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 42. Yet
afterwards he beſieging <hi>Ballynckill</hi> in
the ſame County, I ventured once more
with him. Where he having Intelligence
that Major General <hi>Crawford</hi> was beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<hi>Ballybritas,</hi> a Caſtle belonging to
the Vicount <hi>Clanmaleer,</hi> he ſent me
with a Party of fifteen hundred Horſe
and Foot, to endeavour the ſuccouring
of that place: which I did. <hi>Crawford</hi>
drawing off, in paſſing the River of the
<hi>Barrow</hi> in a skirmiſh had his Thigh bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with a Muſquett-ſhot. I returned
as <hi>Ballynekill</hi> was rendred; and convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Garriſon too, as I had done the
other of <hi>Byrrh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this I remained at <hi>Kilkenny</hi>
with the <hi>Supream Council;</hi> and <hi>Preſton</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101258:17"/>
went into the lower parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
with the Army. Of whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
the Enemies Garriſons in the
County of <hi>Catherloe,</hi> and <hi>Queens Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
taking advantage, Alarm'd the
County of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> even to the Gates
of the City. I was then by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
commanded to go againſt them.
And therefore having gotten together
about 2000 men with ſome Cannon,
I Marched to <hi>Ballenunry</hi> in the County
of <hi>Catherloe,</hi> and took it, as alſo <hi>Clogre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan.</hi>
Where the County of <hi>Wexford</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
Mutined; but were reduced, and
ſome examples made, ſerved well for the
future. I Marched thence into the
Queens County, and Beſieged <hi>Ballile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>
Commanded by the <hi>Grimes</hi>'s a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
People, with a ſtrong Garriſon.
But a great breach being made, their
Succour came by the way of <hi>Athy.</hi> I
was not well at this Alarme, but laid
upon my Bed in my Tent. However I
made no great matter of it, knowing
the Succour could not be conſiderable.
But my Old Lord <hi>Richard</hi> Vicount of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101258:17"/>
                  <hi>Mountgarret</hi> being abroad, ſent me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that they were coming on in great
haſt, and ſtronger than I thought, both
in Horſe, and Foot, and were then near
the end of the <hi>Tougher:</hi> which is a great
way cut through a Bog, and I believe
in length at leaſt half a Mile. Now I
had a great Guard of Horſe and Foot
at my end of the <hi>Tougher,</hi> with a Line
thrown up before them. So I judged
the danger not great. However I got
on Horſe-back, taking with me 400
Horſe: and coming to my Guard, I
ſaw ſome of the Enemy on the <hi>Tougher</hi>
in their March. Whereupon I bad
my Horſe and Guards follow me, and
March towards them; thinking to
have fought them upon the <hi>Tougher.</hi>
But they retired, and formed on a plain
two Muſquet-ſhot off. I having paſs'd
the <hi>Tougher,</hi> prepared to Charge. But
they Drew off again, and did not ſtand
me till they had gotten through a Gap
in a Ditch with water to the Belly.
Being paſt they lined the Ditch with
Muſqueteers, drawing up their Horſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101258:18"/>
and Foot cloſe by to defend this Gap.
Sir <hi>Walter Butler</hi> with his Squadron,
begun the Fight; but being Wounded
in the Ditch with a Pike through his
Thigh, his men ſell off; and a ſecond
Squadron Charged and did the like. But
the Enemy ſeeing more Squadrons
coming on, in the ſmoke took their
advantage to run away: which we
could not ſee, till the ſmoke was over.
Then we followed, and could not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
them till they recovered <hi>Athy,</hi>
which was near. I gueſſed them to be
about three hundred Horſe, and ſeven
or eight hundred Foot. Their Succour
thus beaten in their view, the beſieged
Garriſon yielded on condition to March
out with their Arms. The ſmall Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons
in thoſe Parts made no reſiſtance.
I was much favoured in theſe my firſt
undertakings, by having been in my
youth a great Hunter in thoſe parts of
Deer, Wolves, and Foxes. So that
there was no paſſage in Bog or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or Ford in a River that I did not
know. This little beginning gave me
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101258:18"/>
ſome Reputation and as near as I could
what I wanted in experience was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by diligence and good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>

               <p>MY Lord of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> was all this
while Maſter of the Field in
<hi>Mounſter;</hi> having won ſome Battels,
beaten the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in all parts, and in a
manner ſubdued that Province, four or
five Towns excepted. And with theſe
he was going now to work, beginning
with <hi>Kilmallock</hi> in the County of <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:101258:19"/>
and ſitting down before it with
an Army of ſeven Thouſand men. This
Alarmed the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at <hi>Kilkenny:</hi> but moſt particularly
thoſe of that Province. Whereupon,
after many Conſults among themſelves,
they concluded at laſt to ask ſuccour of
the <hi>General Aſſembly;</hi> though they ſaw
but little hopes of any in that exigency:
for <hi>Preſton</hi> was far off with the Army.
Wherefore opening themſelves more
clearly, than perhaps they would have
otherwiſe done, they layed claim to
me, as having my Earldom and Eſtate
in their Province, though I was an
Officer of <hi>Leimſter.</hi> Alleadging farther
that their General was old and Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
and that if I had the Command
all would joyn in the defence of their
Country, and take new Courage. I was
preſent at this propoſition; and, though
I had ambition and vanity enough, did
heartily oppoſe it, having no proſpect
of any Succeſs. But my Lord of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kry,</hi>
being my great friend, and of that
Province, deſired the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101258:19"/>
me by vertue of the Oath of <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.</hi>
Which they did; and then there
could be no more reply. It being thus
ordered: and, which was purſuant to
it, that my Commiſſion under the Great
Seal of the Confederates to Command
in Chief for that expedition, ſhould be
immediately diſpatched: I was ask'd,
what Troops were near at hand? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that I knew of none, but of my
own Life-Guard of Horſe. 'Tis true
I had obſerved many ſtragling Horſe
in the Town; but they would not be
brought together without Mony. Some
Money was then given out, and by Ten
of the Clock next morning I had gotten
together Eighty Horſe, and put them
under the Command of <hi>Garrett Talbot</hi>
Brother to Sir <hi>Robert Talbot.</hi> Theſe
with my Life-Guard Commanded by
Captain <hi>Fits Gerrald,</hi> commonly called
<hi>Garrat Garrah,</hi> made in all one hundred
and twenty Horſe. With theſe I March'd,
accompanied with my Lord of <hi>Muskry,</hi>
ſince made Earl of <hi>Clancarty,</hi> and ſome
others of the Province. On the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101258:20"/>
of it I met about a hundred and
twenty Horſe more, moſt Gentlemen,
and formed into a Squadron. But at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel</hi>
I was received by the General of the
Province <hi>Barry,</hi> the Lieutenant-General
<hi>Purcel,</hi> and ſome other Officers with
ſeven hundred Foot.</p>
               <p>That night I had Intelligence, that the
Lord of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> had raiſed his Siege,
and March'd with four or five Thouſand
men into the County of <hi>Kerry.</hi> But
had ſent Sir <hi>Charles Vavaſor</hi> with ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or ſeventeen hundred men, to take
in <hi>Clohlea,</hi> a Caſtle then belonging to
the <hi>Condons.</hi> I Marched immediately
towards him, and before night Encamped
within three Miles of him; the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
only between us. My Brother
<hi>Richard Butler,</hi> Brother to the Duke of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> was ſent out the ſame night to
diſcover the Enemy. In the Morning
word was brought that the Caſtle was
taken, and the Garriſon after Quarter
given put to the Sword, and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Engaged. I loſt no time, but
March'd in all haſt with my Horſe to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101258:20"/>
his Succour: which joyned with his,
made up two hundred and forty, or two
hundred and fifty at the moſt. The
Foot marched alſo. But the old Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
came on ſo ſlowly that I had defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Enemy before he came within
two Miles.</p>
               <p>The manner thus. Sir <hi>Charles Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſor,</hi>
though he had taken the Caſtle,
remained ſtill in his Camp, till ſeeing
me on the Top of the Mountain above
him, come to ſuccour mine that were
skirmiſhing, he drew to Arms; but
being amongſt Hedges and Ditches, and
the Caſtle between us, I could not come
at him, till he marched towards <hi>Caſtle
Lions:</hi> where in a large plain he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But I, going by the advantage of
a great valley, came into the plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen,
almoſt as ſoon as he. And, having
ordered three or four Squadrons of Boys
on Horſe-back to poſſeſs the ground
from whence I came, I loſt no time in
the Charge; that Defeated his Horſe; who
to ſave themſelves broke in on the Foot.
Their Cannons were uſeleſs, being paſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101258:21"/>
the Black-water. This, with Gods
bleſſing, and a great ſhower of rain,
gave me the victory with little or no
loſs. Sir <hi>Charles</hi> that Commanded,
with ſeveral other Officers remained
Priſoners; their Cannon and Baggage
taken; all their Foot defeated; but
their Horſe for the moſt part eſcaped.
This happened on a Sunday, the 4<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>June</hi> 1643. about twelve a Clock at
Noon.</p>
               <p>Now having left the beſt advice I
could for the improving this advantage,
I took leave of the General with others
of the Province: and returning to <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny</hi>
gave the Aſſembly an account of
what had paſſed, in order to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>Soon after, the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> being broke
up, and a <hi>Supream Council</hi> choſen to
Govern in their abſence, I retired to
<hi>Kilkaſh</hi> my Brother <hi>Butlers</hi> houſe to
reſt my ſelf. The <hi>Council</hi> went to
<hi>Roſs:</hi> and whilſt they were there, a
Trumpet brought them a Letter from
the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> ſetting forth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101258:21"/>
his being appointed by the King to hear
our grievances, and to Treat for an
accommodation. The particulars of
the Letter I knew not; but the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
was quickly diſpatched with ſome
ſlight Anſwer. Which coming to my
knowledge, I repaired to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Council</hi> was returned. And
on Information finding what I had
heard to be true, I ſent for Sir <hi>Robert
Talbot,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Barnwel,</hi> Colonel
<hi>Walter Bagnal,</hi> and ſuch others as were
in the Town being well affected and
leading men of the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> though
not of the <hi>Council.</hi> Now being in my
Lodging, I acquainted them with what
underſtood: and, that if they would ſtick
to me, I would endeavour to give it a
turn. We all agreed on the way: which
was, To go to the Council then ſitting,
take notice of the Kings Offer, and
their Return, and to mind them, that
the Conſideration, and reſolutions
concerning Peace and War, the <hi>General
Aſſembly,</hi> reſerved to themſelves only:
and therefore to require that they would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101258:22"/>
ſend immediately a Trumpet of their
own, with a Letter to the Marqueſs of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> giving him to underſtand, they
had Iſſued Summons for a <hi>General
Aſſembly,</hi> in order to acknowledge the
Kings gracious ſavour in naming him
his Commiſſioner to hear our Aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
and redreſs them. This we put
in execution, and gained our point
without much reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi> being thus
brought into a Treaty, the Conſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Commiſſioners met at <hi>Seginſtown</hi>
near the <hi>Naſſe</hi> as his Excellency had
appointed, in order to a Ceſſation of
Arms. At which time all Parties laboured
to get into Poſſeſſion of what they
could. Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> after made Duke
of <hi>Albermarle</hi> March'd into the County
of <hi>Wicklow</hi> to take in the Harveſt, and
Poſſeſs ſome Caſtles. I being then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Council to go againſt
him, and having Rendevouz'd my
Troops conſiſting of about three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſe and Foot, at <hi>Ballynekil</hi> in
the County of <hi>Caterloe,</hi> Notice was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101258:22"/>
brought me that Colonel <hi>Monk</hi> was
March'd away in all haſt, to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the Lord <hi>Moor,</hi> then facing
<hi>Owen-Roe Oneal</hi> near <hi>Portleſter.</hi> I find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my ſelf now to have nothing to do,
thought it worth the while to endeavour
taking in <hi>Dulerſtown, Tully, Lacagh,</hi>
and all other Caſtles in the County of
<hi>Kildare,</hi> between the Rivers of the
Barrow and <hi>Liffe.</hi> Which I did, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Garriſons in them. This done I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt
the <hi>Barrow</hi> at <hi>Minſter-Evin,</hi> March'd
into <hi>Leix,</hi> and took threee or four
ſmall places. But as I was going on,
had advice from the Commiſſioners at
<hi>Seginſtown,</hi> that they had on the 15<hi>th

where <hi>Con-O Neal</hi> was killed with

Winter, leaving his Troops &amp; Crejaghts

the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> held at <hi>Waterford.</hi>
Where he ſet forth the lamentable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of his people, deſiring the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the other three Provinces:
and in the name of his Province, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to joyn to their Forces four
Thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe:
but withal declaring, that otherwiſe he
with his Forces and Creiaghts ſhould
be obliged to ſave themſelves in the
other Provinces: and ſo get ſubſiſtance
as well as they could. This laſt point
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101258:24"/>
of <hi>Owen O Neals</hi> Speech, beſides
their perſuaſion that the <hi>Scots</hi> would
not fail ſoon to follow him and viſit
them, made the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> come to a
quick Concluſion, and agree to ſend
ſix Thouſand Foot and ſix hundred
Horſe out of the other three Provinces.
So that the Army was to conſiſt of ten
Thouſand Foot and one Thouſand
Horſe. But it coming to the Queſtion
who ſhould be General of this Army,
they went to the Election after this
manner. The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> ſitting, thoſe they
thoughtfit to come in competition,
they cauſed their names, one under an
other, to be written down, and from
each a long Line drawn. Then at the
Table where the Clerk ſate, every
Member of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> one
after another with a Pen puts a Daſh,
on the Line of him that he would have
to be General. And to the end that
none ſhould mark more than once, four
or five were Choſen out of the <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
two of which were Biſhops, to
overlook this marking, being on their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:101258:24"/>
Oath. Now, contrary to <hi>Owen O
Neals</hi> exſpectation, who had deſigned
this Generalſhip for himſelf by which
he would be <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> I was choſen.
Which he took extremely much to
heart; as I have reaſon to believe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he carryed it fairly; and came to
Congratulate me; giving withal great
Aſſurances of his performance and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
to ſerve me. Next day a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was ſent me, with orders to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
all things for this expedition;
which I did. But the farther I look'd
into the matter, the worſe I liked it.
For I conſidered that I was now to make
War in a Country where I had never
been: and in a Country too where we
had not ſo much as one Town; but the
Enemy had many.</p>
               <p>That by all Intelligence they could
draw into the Field ſixteen or ſeventeen
Thouſand men. That if <hi>Owen O Neal</hi>
ſhould perform, and deal fairly with
me: yet all I was to expect did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
ten Thouſand Foot, and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſe. That having no Towns
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101258:25"/>
in the Province, we ſhould be forced
to bring all our Proviſions from the
other Provinces where I had my Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines.
That I muſt depend upon <hi>O Neal</hi>
for Intelligence. For by ſuch lights I
always Guided my ſelf in my former
ſmall undertakings. But that which
moſt of all troubled me, was that I did
not ſee how I could avoid a Battel, if
the Enemy had a mind to it: being I
was to make an Oſſenſive War. I had
alſo this other conſideration to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me, That although our Parties had
commonly the better; yet our Armies
had commonly the worſt. This was
experimented in ſeveral Battels. And
the reaſon was clear and obvious. Moſt
of all the great Towns in the Kingdom
were the Enemies and Gariſoned; and
of the few Towns we had, there was
but one, to wit <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> that would
receive a Gariſon. So that at our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of every Field as the Enemy
returned into their Gariſons, where
they were with their Officers and kept
in Diſcipline; ours were diſperſed all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101258:25"/>
the Kingdom over, into little Villages
and odd houſes; never ſeeing an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
till the next Campagne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to their Rendevous in
the beginning of every field like new
men half changed; and for the Horſe,
ſo haggled out in riding up and down to
ſee their friends, that they ſeem'd hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to draw their Legs after them;
and both Horſe and Foot with ruſty
Arms and not fixt. But how plainly
ſoever I ſaw my ill condition, I muſt
through as well as I could; yet withal
reſolving to avoid a Battel by all means,
and ſeek to make my War by Parties,
and Surpriſes, where new men are as
good as old. Now having more then
time before the Campagne, I was
commanded by the <hi>Supream Council</hi> to
March into <hi>Connaught</hi> to reduce ſome
of our own Party, which had ſet up
for themſelves in the County of <hi>Mayoe,</hi>
and had poſſeſſed <hi>Caſtle Carroe,</hi> and
<hi>Caſtle Barre;</hi> the former Commanded
by one <hi>Burk;</hi> the latter by the Lord of
<hi>Mayoe.</hi> I took with me two Thouſand
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101258:26"/>
men, and paſt the <hi>Shanon</hi> at <hi>Fort-fauk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
the Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrichard</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
me to paſs through his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Theſe Caſtles made little reſiſtance.
After they had yielded, I ſent my Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
under the Command of Sir <hi>James
Dillon,</hi> into the County of <hi>Roscommon,</hi>
to reduce the <hi>Armsbyes</hi> and ſome others
that held Gariſons and would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the Ceſſation. When he had
done his work, which he was not long
about, he return'd into <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and
lodg'd the Troops as he was ordered.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, I had gone to
<hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and ſet my ſelf to the
great Work; ſtill having ſome miſtruſt
of <hi>Owen O Neal</hi>'s performance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I deſired the Council, to grant me
four hundred Horſe and Dragoons more,
in caſe I could raiſe them without
Charge: which I did.</p>
               <p>The firſt Rendevous that I made in
order to this Field, was 1644 about
Midſummer, in the County of <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
at a place called <hi>Granard</hi> where I
had appointed three Thouſand Horſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101258:26"/>
and Foot with two or three Field-pieces:
intending there to have expected the
coming up of the whole Army, which
might be four or five days; for <hi>O Neal</hi>
was neer Encamped at <hi>Portleſter,</hi> and
the reſt were Marching as ordered. By
my ſpies, that met me at this Rendevous,
and came in haſt, all agreed that they
had left the Enemy near a certain Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
threeſcore Miles of; that they
were ſeventeen Thouſand ſtrong, with
one and twenty days Proviſion in
Oaten Meal, which they carried on
their own, and little Horſes backs;
no Cannon or other Baggage; and were
ready to March. I thought my ſelf pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſecure for that Night; but at twelve
of the Clock, one from <hi>Cavan</hi> aſſured
me that he had left the whole Army
there: and that their Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
would be with me in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
On this advice, I packt off as faſt
as I could, and gain'd <hi>Port-Leſter,</hi>
ordering the reſt of the Army to come
thither: and at the inſtant Commanded
a Colonel with five or ſix hundred
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101258:27"/>
Foot and a hundred Horſe to defend
the Bridge of <hi>Fienagh.</hi> It was of ſtone,
and a Caſtle on our End. I ſent with him
Shovels, Pickaxes, and Spades, with
plenty of Ammunition. The Enemy,
according to my Intelligence, came at
Sun-riſing into the Camp I had left,
and ſhewed themſelves the next day
before that Bridge. My unfortunate
Colonel, ſent over his Horſe to Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh;
and when they were far enough
out, on a ſudden the Enemy mingled
with them. Which was the cauſe that
our Foot could do nothing; but through
fear to kill their own, left Bridge,
Caſtle, and all free for the Enemy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this availed them little. For find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me well Poſted, though <hi>O Neal</hi>
was of another opinion, their Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhrunk, and being at leaſt twelve
days March from their own Country,
they ſtaid not to give me farther trouble,
but haſtened homewards.</p>
               <p>Now then I was at leiſure to call
on General <hi>O Neal</hi> for his four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Foot and four hundred Horſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101258:27"/>
reſolved to follow the Enemy, and
try my Fortune in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> as I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to do. He excuſed himſelf by
Reaſon of the continual Alarms in his
Countrey, that he could not at preſent
make good his Word; but withal aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
me again, that ſo ſoon as I came
into the Province I ſhould have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to complain. Having this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
I March'd on with my ſix Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Foot and a Thouſand Horſe and
Dragoons: and <hi>O Neal</hi> joyned to me
about two hundred Horſe and three or
four hundred Foot; his Creiaghts
Marching with us, being all the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
with their Cattle of that Province.
When he had drawn me on as far as
<hi>Toinregoah,</hi> I had intelligence that the
Enemy had revictualled themſelves, and
were returning to encounter me.
Whereupon I preſt <hi>O Neal</hi> very hard
to make good his Word. Who plainly
told me that he could not do it; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his people were all amongſt
the Creiaghts, and every one looking
to ſave what he had. In this ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101258:28"/>
I blamed my own Weakneſs in
being perſuaded with fair Promiſes, to
come ſo far into an Enemies Country;
however I was reſolved to ſee the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
then Encamped at <hi>Drummore
Jueagh.</hi> And therefore taking ſuch
Guides as <hi>O Neal</hi> would give me, and
leaving the Command of the Camp to
him, in the evening I March'd with
my Thouſand Horſe and Dragoons, and
fifteen hundred Commanded Foot.
Theſe I left on a Paſs about three Miles
from my Camp, to make good my
retreat; intending to fall with my
Horſe into their Horſe-Quarter. But,
whether Wittingly or Willingly in my
Guides, it was Sun-riſing when I came
within two Miles of their Horſe-Quarter.
And yet ſtill though I had loſt
my deſign, I would ſee the Enemy.
And to this end, perceiving ſome of
their Horſe at Graſs, I, being drawn
under a Hill near a little River, where
there was a Stone-bridge, ſent a Party
to take thoſe Horſes; which they did,
and brought them to me. But their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101258:28"/>
Guard of Horſe being near, after my
Horſe were come back, ſeized the
Bridge and defended it. I ſent men to
beat them off; but it would not do.
Then I ſent another Party; the ſame
ſtill. Whilſt this was a diſputing, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a hundred Foot coming over a
great plain. Then I Galloped down my
ſelf with ſome Officers, and more Horſe.
So paſſing the Bridge, I had the
cutting oft that hundred Foot, without
reſiſtance. A Party of mine purſued
the Horſe that ran from the Bridge;
but before they overtook them they
were met with another which routed
them. And others of mine put them
alſo to the run. Before this Fight ended,
moſt of the Horſe on both ſides were
Engaged. The Enemy at laſt drew off:
and ſo did I to my Army.</p>
               <p>Being returned to my Camp, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>O Neal</hi> with what had paſt,
and how the Enemies Army were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
according to my intelligence.
Whereupon he adviſed me to retire to
<hi>Charlemount,</hi> a Fort where he had a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101258:29"/>
Garison. I followed his advice, and
found it a very good Poſt, there being
a large plain joyned to it, on the
one ſide runs the black Water, and near
the Fort a Bridge over it; the reſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with Bogs and Mooriſh
Ground. My Horſe lay Encamped at
<hi>Benborb,</hi> on the other ſide the River.
At the ſame time that I came into this
place, <hi>Monro</hi> with his Army arrived at
<hi>Armagh</hi> about two or three Miles
diſtant, and there Encamp'd fortifying
himſelf. Thus neither of us being able
to Engage the other, we lay in pretty
good Correſpondence: and the ſmall
War we had was chiefly in cutting off
of Convoys. My Proviſions came
much harder to me than his to him: and
<hi>O Neal</hi> began to be very weary of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
aſſiſting me with Cows. So that
after two Months, I reſolved the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to gain my own Country:
ſeeing no hopes of any forces from <hi>O
Neal.</hi> Which to Effect, for I did not
deſire fighting, I cauſed a <hi>Tougher</hi> or
great way to be cut through the Bog,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101258:29"/>
near the Fort, leading to <hi>Toinregaoh</hi>
by which their Proviſions came. This
way being finiſht, I knowing their days
took my time, to paſs moſt of my
Horſe, and ſome Foot, ſhewing them
beyond the <hi>Tougher,</hi> as if that night I
intended ſtraight for <hi>Toinregaoh. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
having this Intelligence poſted away,
a great Party of Horſe and Foot to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his Convoy. But the night being
come I turned, and in ſtead of March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards <hi>Toinregaoh,</hi> paſt over the
Bridge with the whole Army: leaving
my Cannon and Baggage in the Fort,
with a ſtrong Gariſon, plenty of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
and all the Proviſion I could
poſſibly ſcrape to put in. That night I
March'd, and all the next day, taking a
great round before I could have my own
Country on my back; which having
obtained, in the County of <hi>Cavan</hi> I
faced towards the Enemy, about five
or ſix Miles from them. Which <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
knowing, and finding that I lay ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier
for my Proviſions then he did, raiſed
his Camp and March'd to his own
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101258:30"/>
Country. It being now late in the
year; I, thus Free of him, ſent a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Horſe and Foot to bring off my
Cannon, and what I left in the Fort;
and ſo March'd to <hi>Fienaegh,</hi> where
I met Commiſſioners from the <hi>Supream
Council</hi> to receive the Army, and lodge
them on the three Provinces, together
with fifteen hundred <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> men which
on my Order came to me out of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nought,</hi>
being of no Army but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to live by ſtrong hand; which
I could not admit. Thus ended the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> expedition, like to be ſo fatal to
the Confederate Catholicks of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
through the ſailing or ſomething elſe of
General <hi>Owen Roe O Neal.</hi> But after
all, the three Provinces had no reaſon
to complain of this Campagne. For
this Army they ſent, kept them from
being troubled either with <hi>Scots,</hi> or
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> People, that year.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus left the Army with
Commiſſioners, on Muſter, more
than eight Thouſand ſtrong, (for I
had been recruited with ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies)
I took my way to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> ill
pleaſed that the Treaty of Peace train'd
ſo long: and deſigned not to ſtir from
the Council till I ſaw it concluded. But
coming there, I found the <hi>Supream
Council</hi> in great Conſternation. For
<hi>Duncannon</hi> that Commanded the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of <hi>Waterford,</hi> was declared for the
Parliament: as alſo my Lord of <hi>Inchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
Commanding in <hi>Mounſter,</hi> who
before, had not only ſubmitted to the
Ceſſation, but carried with him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
number of his Troops into
<hi>England</hi> to ſerve the King. Now taking
there ſome diſguſt, as 'tis ſaid, becauſe
the <hi>Preſidency</hi> of <hi>Mounſter</hi> was given to
the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> he returns, and
declares for the Parliament, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101258:31"/>
by their Commiſſion as <hi>Preſident</hi> of
<hi>Mounſter.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Waterford</hi> now
preſſed the taking in of <hi>Duncannon:</hi>
making great offers to the Council of
large aſſiſtance. <hi>Preſton</hi> is named for
this work, and ſent with three or four
Thouſand men, Miners, and a good
Train of Artillery; it being within his
Province. And I having the curioſity
to ſee it, left the Council, and followed
him. I will relate the particulars of
this Siege, becauſe the only in form
that I ſaw in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He made
not any line of Circumvallation, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no ſuccour that could come on the
Land-ſide: but began his approaches
with two Attacks: and being come near
the place, joyned them with a line of
Communication: and then ran them on
divided to the two ends of the Curtain.
Thoſe within made a good defence, and
loſt nothing in ſix weeks, only the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
had made a lodging in the Ditch.
At this time two or three Parliament
Frigats arriv'd, with ſuccour of Men,
Ammunition, and Proviſions; coming
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101258:32"/>
to Anchor within leſs then Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot
of the Fort. But before they could
man out their Boats; ſo horrible a
Storm aroſe, that in eight or ten days
none could come on ſhore. Whereupon
thoſe within, being in deſpair, and
preſs'd with ſome eſſential want,
yielded.</p>
               <p>All this while my Lord of <hi>Inchiquin</hi>
over-ran <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and coming to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel,</hi>
the people retired to the Rock,
where the Cathedral Church ſtands,
and thought to defend it. But 'twas
carried by Storm, the Souldiers giving
no Quarter. So that within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Church, there was a great
Maſſacre, and amongſt others more
than twenty Prieſts and Religious men
kill'd.</p>
               <p>Towards the Spring the Council or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
me to go againſt him; and to
begin the Field as early as I could. The
Enemy in this Province had always
been victorious, beating the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
in every Place; never having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Check, but in the mentioned
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101258:32"/>
Encounter at <hi>Cloghleah.</hi> So that every
Gentlemans Houſe, or Caſtle was Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
and kept the Country in awe.
To begin this Field then, I made my
firſt rendevous at <hi>Clonmel,</hi> and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Encamped near it. Thither Dean
<hi>Boyl,</hi> now Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and then Married to my Lord of <hi>Inchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi>
Siſter came, and there he found
me. His buſineſs was to perſuade me,
to ſpare <hi>Donerail,</hi> and other Houſes, and
Caſtles, not Tenable. I anſwered, that
I deſired it, as much as he; though hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
they had annoyed the Country
equally, as if they had been ſtrong. I
told him in ſhort, I had order to
take all I could: and ſuch as I thought
not fit to Gariſon, to deſtroy. Yet, if
he pleaſed to cauſe the Gariſons to be
drawn out, and by Letters from the
Owners, to put them into my hands,
I would appoint ſome few men into
them, with Commanders in whom I
moſt confided, and make it my Buſineſs
to preſerve them, by interceeding to
the Council. The Dean and I parted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101258:33"/>
very good Friends. But whether he
could or no, prevail with my Lord of
<hi>Inchiquin</hi> or the Owners, I know not.
I am ſure, I heard no more from
him.</p>
               <p>Soon after, that is, about the 5. of <hi>Ap.</hi>
1645. I Marched towards <hi>Capper-Quin,</hi>
my Army conſiſting of about five
Thouſand Foot, a Thouſand Horſe,
and twelve Braſs pieces of Cannon,
ſome of twenty four, and others of
eighteen pound Bullet. Viewing the
place, I ſoon perceived where they
miſtook that Beſieged it formerly, and
after much time ſpent with great loſs of
men, were enforced to quit it. There
being a Town and a Caſtle that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it, they Attack'd the Town;
and I, on the contrary, the Caſtle;
which yielded, the Town could not
reſiſt. <hi>Drommane</hi> fell likewiſe into my
hands. Whilſt I was ordering theſe
places, I wrote a Letter to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of <hi>Lismore,</hi> a houſe of my Lord
of <hi>Corks,</hi> I think one Major <hi>Poor.</hi> I
endeavoured to perſuade him to put that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101258:33"/>
place into my hands, that it might be
preſerved: for let the Gariſon be what
he pleaſed; it could not reſiſt. I gave
him many reaſons why I deſired the
preſervation of that place, as if it were
my own. But he anſwered that his
Honour was above all: that he would
hold out to the laſt: and doubted not
of timely Succour. So I left Mr. <hi>Poor,</hi>
and Marched to <hi>Michaelſtown;</hi> which
after ſome ſhot of Cannon, was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
Then, having Intelligence that
ſix or ſeven hundred Horſe were come
over the <hi>Black-water,</hi> Marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, and at that time Drawn up,
on a Hill in the great plains of <hi>Roches</hi>
Country: I March'd the Army towards
them, not knowing whether my Lord
of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> might not be near with his
Army. But theſe Horſe, when we were
well in ſight, retired. Whereupon
Lieutenant General <hi>Purcel</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Officers and Gentlemen of
the Country) who had been viewing
them at near hand, came Galloping to
me, and ſaying that the Enemy were
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101258:34"/>
running away, preſt me earneſtly to
let him have my Horſe, for they had
them ſo ſure that they could not eſcape.
I making difficulty, they ſaid it was,
becauſe I knew not the Country. But
I ſaw ſo much that yielding to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
I ſhould be left expos'd in a great
Champion Country, with an Army of
Foot and Cannon, without Horſe. Yet
after all (which I count certainly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other my Follies) I ſuffered my
ſelf to be perſuaded: they March'd away
in great haſt: I followed ſlowly; and
coming to the <hi>Black-water,</hi> near the
Ford of <hi>Fermoy,</hi> drew my Foot and
Cannon into an old <hi>Danes</hi> Work; <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
being full of them. Having ſtaid
there pretty long, and hearing no News
of my Horſe, I began to be uneaſie.
But remembring that I had a Guard of
Horſe on ſome Beeves, that were for
the Proviſion of the Army, I ſent for
them. And at the ſame time, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
came <hi>Garrot Garrow</hi> with my
old Life-Guard of Horſe to me out of
<hi>Leinſter.</hi> Theſe and thoſe making in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101258:34"/>
all a hundred, I preſently took with
me, to ſee what became of the Troops
ſent with <hi>Purcel.</hi> But firſt I ordered
fifteen hundred Foot to ſtand in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Then finding by the Track, that
my Horſe had paſſed the Ford, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their way towards <hi>Caſtle-Lions:</hi> I
followed. Being come near the Top
of the Hill above the Ford, I left theſe
few Horſe I had with me drawn up;
and with ſome Officers went my ſelf to
the height to diſcover. Thence I ſaw
all the Enemy formed in a great plain,
with a ſhrub wood before them: and
my Horſe in haſt, Marching
through to Charge, having with them
a hundred Commanded Foot. But the
Enemy ſeeing the Squadrons broken, as
they came on the plain, gave them no
time, but Charged and Defeated them.
On ſight of this diſorder, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
purſuing, when they came near me,
I advanced, Crying out to my own
men, that they ſhould Rally behind
me. The Enemy, ſeeing theſe Freſh
Horſe, and not knowing but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101258:35"/>
might be near, purſued no farther,
but drew up. The fifteen hundred Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Foot that I had ſent for, ſoon
came to me. On ſight of which the
Enemy retiring to <hi>Caſtle Lions,</hi> I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
but could not engage them, it
beginning to be dark. Hence I March'd
to <hi>Malloe</hi> and took it, but with ſome
ſhot of Cannon, and left a Gariſon in it.
<hi>Donerail</hi> and <hi>Liscarrel</hi> made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.
But <hi>Miltown,</hi> a better place
and a good Gariſon, ſtood out. So that
I thought it would coſt ſome trouble.
But whilſt the Batteries were preparing,
2 or 3000 Boys belonging to the Army
that uſe to form themſelves into Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
having gotten Crows of Iron,
Pickaxes, and other Inſtruments, a
little before Sun-ſet fell on the place,
intending as I think, only to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Cows and Sheep within a Court,
which was walled. But Succeſs carried
them farther, and they took the Caſtle
by ſtrong hand. So all that ſide of the
<hi>Black-water</hi> being cleared, I ſent the
Army for ſome days into Quarters of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101258:35"/>
refreſhment: &amp; I went my ſelf to <hi>Kilmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi>
and other places where my Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
were. In the mean time my Lord
of <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> having taken <hi>Rosſtellan,</hi>
beſieged <hi>Ballymarter,</hi> a Caſtle belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Unkle, <hi>Edmund Fitz Gerrald
Seneſcal</hi> of <hi>Imokelle.</hi> My Army being
come together, I March'd to ſuccour it.
But there being a Flood in the <hi>Black-water,</hi>
I was hindred for two days. So
that when I came in ſight of the place,
I found it taken, and burning, and the
Enemy retreating, ſome to <hi>Cork,</hi> others
to <hi>Youghal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus loſt my deſign of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring
the place, and that, which I wiſht
moſt, Engaging the Enemy: I ſtaid
Encamped near this burnt Caſtle two
or three days: thinking what to do. At
length I got intelligence, that Colonel
<hi>Henry Obryan</hi> Brother to the Lord of
<hi>Inchiquin,</hi> and Lieutenant Colonel
<hi>Courtney,</hi> with ſeveral other Officers,
were come by Boat to <hi>Roſtellan</hi> to make
merry: and that, the Tide fallen, their
Boats were a ground, and ſo would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101258:36"/>
till High-Water. On the certainty
of this I loſt no time, but ſent immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
a Party to ſeiſe the Boats, lying
more than Muſquet-ſhot from the Caſtle;
following as faſt as I could with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
which being come up, I preſently
fell to the work, planting my Guns:
the Batteries made by my Lord of <hi>Inchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
not being deſtroyed. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the places yielded on diſcretion.
Hence I March'd to <hi>Caſtle Lions:</hi> which
after ſome battering yielded. I took
my March then towards <hi>Lismore.</hi> But
<hi>Cony-Caſtle</hi> lying on a Paſs in my way,
and ſending, on Summons, a deſiance,
I Encamped before it: thinking to
plant my Guns that Night. But the
Boys eaſed me of the Trouble, and took
it before it was dark by Storm, as they
did the former. I wrote again to the
Governour of <hi>Lismore,</hi> to put that place
into my hands, that I might turn the
Army another way; having as much
kindneſs for the owner as he could have.
But, not prevailing, I inveſted it. And,
having ordered the Batteries, left Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101258:36"/>
General <hi>Purcel</hi> to Command,
and trie if he could have better Succeſs
with that place now, than formerly he
had had, when he Beſieged it; and ſo
rode to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> as not willing to be
preſent at the deſtruction of a Houſe,
where I had formerly received very
many Civilities. At my return, being
five or ſix days after, I found the place
yielded, and the Gariſon Marching
out. After which, being Encamped
at <hi>Tallow,</hi> Intelligence was brought
that Colonel <hi>Mac William Ridgeway,</hi>
was gone from <hi>Cork</hi> into the County of
<hi>Limbrick</hi> with a great Party of Horſe
and ſome Foot. I Marched immediately
with all my Horſe, and fifteen hundred
Foot, ſtraight for <hi>Cork.</hi> Coming near,
I left the Foot to make good my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
About an hour in the night I
arrived near the Gates; and put my
ſelf on the way to <hi>Malloe;</hi> by which
<hi>Mac William</hi> was to return: and
gently Marching, met ſome of the
Enemy. They being charged made no
reſiſtance: but the night being extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101258:37"/>
dark, ſcattered. So, little execution
could be done upon them; though
ſome were killed, and others taken. In
this blind Scuffel Captain <hi>James Brown,</hi>
Brother to Sir <hi>Valentine Brown,</hi> a brave
Gentleman, was ſlain. By the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
we found that their Commander
<hi>Mac William Ridgeway</hi> had been killed
that day, ſhot out of a Caſtle in <hi>Roches</hi>
Country. Which way they had taken to
return with the Body, we could not
find. We marched a little forwards; but
it being ſo dark that nothing could be
done, I return'd with my Party to
<hi>Tallow,</hi> and March'd the Army towards
<hi>Youghal.</hi> All Caſtles on the way
ſubmitted on eaſie Terms. I will only
take notice of one, becauſe of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
though I have forgotten the
name of the place. I remember it was
a Caſtle that yielded early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without reſiſtance. Now preſently
after the yielding of it, the Weather
being very fair, I went a Hunting;
leaving Colonel <hi>Heneſey</hi> to ſee the
Quarter made good; which was to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101258:37"/>
March with their Arms, bag and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.
But the Soldiers having been
uſed to taking of places by ſtrong hand,
and ſo enriching themſelves by Plunder,
would have done the like by this, though
it had Conditions. To prevent any ſuch
matter, the Colonel and ſeveral Officers
went into the Caſtle, joyning with the
Gariſon in its defence. But the Foot
nevertheleſs fell on: and great ſhooting
there was on all ſides. Which I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
returned in haſt, thinking my Lord
of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> had attempted ſomething.
The Soldiers ſeeing me come ſooner
than they expected, ran all into the
Woods adjoyning. When I came to
the Caſtle, and Colonel <hi>Heneſey</hi> had
related the matter, I made the Gariſon
March out, according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
Then I began to enquire after
my Mutineers, cauſing the Trumpets
to ſound, and Drums to beat, for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all to their Arms. Some time it
was before theſe Gentlemen, could be
gotten together. Being now in order
of a Battel both Horſe and Foot, I went
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101258:38"/>
from Battallion to Battallion telling
them their Fault: and what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
might have been: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that they all merited Death.
Which they acknowledging, I added,
that ſome Juſtice muſt be done: and
asked them, whether they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
for examples ſake to deliver two
out of each Battallion, as it ſhould fall
amongſt them by Lots. They agreed.
But when they came to be Shot, I
thought the number too great, and
made them throw again for two only;
which Suffered. Being come before
<hi>Youghal,</hi> I Encamped looſly, thinking
to diſtreſs the place: and towards the
Sea near <hi>Crokers</hi> works, I ſent Major
General <hi>Butler</hi> with fifteen hundred
men, and ſome ſmall pieces to hinder
Succour that might come by Sea.
Whilſt this was doing, I in a night with
a Party and two peices of Cannon, paſt
the <hi>Black Water</hi> at <hi>Temple Michael:</hi>
and before day had my two Guns plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
at the Ferry point over againſt
<hi>Youghal,</hi> and within leſs than Musquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101258:38"/>
of two Parliament Frigats. At the
ſecond ſhot one blew up. But the Town,
endeavouring to requite my Kindneſs,
in a morning fell on Major General
<hi>Butler,</hi> and took one of his Guns. Soon
after this came a Fleet of Boats, and
bigger Veſſels ſent by my Lord of <hi>Inchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qnin</hi>
from <hi>Cork,</hi> with ſupplies of Men
and Proviſion, and ſuccoſred the Town.
On which I March'd off, and Triſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>led
out the remain of the Campagne in
deſtroying the Harveſt. Only a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my men attempted to plunder the
<hi>Great Iſland</hi> near <hi>Barries Court.</hi> But
being ill guided in Paſſing, and the Sea
Coming in ſooner than they counted,
their deſign failed. Beſides there were
of the Enemy that oppoſed their coming
on the firm Land. Captain <hi>Turlough
Obryan</hi> was killed by a looſe ſhot, out
of a Caſtle in the <hi>Iſland.</hi> Now it being
the latter end of <hi>November</hi> the Snow
falling, I retired to <hi>Capper-Quin.</hi> And
Commiſſioners being come to lay out
Winter Quarters for the Army: I left
it and repaired to <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> Thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101258:39"/>
my <hi>Mounſter</hi> expedition, and the

The <hi>Supream Council</hi> received him with

Kings County, lookt very cloudily;

on pretence of ſome Indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>The Popes <hi>Nuncio Joannes Baptiſta
Rinuccini</hi> Archbiſhop and Prince of
<hi>Fermo,</hi> being at <hi>Waterford</hi> in the head
of a great Congregation of Archbiſhops,
Biſhops, and other Clergy men Secular
and Regular: and having by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications
thus broken us: the
Lord Lieutenant by the advice of the
<hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of <hi>Truſt,</hi> ſent me to trie
if I could perſuade him to let the <hi>Peace</hi>
go on. But all I could do was in vain;
he declaring his Reſolution to oppoſe it
to the utmoſt. For all this my Lord
Lieutenant continued his deſign of
going into <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and I think to
<hi>Limbrick,</hi> and March'd with all his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But coming to <hi>Carrick</hi> a houſe of
his own, Word was brought him there,
that <hi>Mac Thomas</hi> had declared for the
<hi>Nuncio,</hi> and was drawn up near <hi>Clon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel</hi>
with three or four hundred Horſe.
I was ſent to him by his Excellency, as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101258:40"/>
thinking my Intereſt might have gained
ſomething on him, becauſe he had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
moſt of the Wars under my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
When I came and delivered
him my Meſſage, he anſwered me,
that he was engaged with the <hi>Nuncio,</hi>
according to his Conſcience, and would
not quit him. I acquainted his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
with this anſwer, and that I ſaw
no hopes of reclaiming this man. Yet
my Lord Lieutenant would go on, and
took his March towards <hi>Caſhel; Mac
Thomas</hi> Marching for the moſt part in
ſight of us. Coming near the Town,
and making halt, his Excellency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Notice, I think, from my Lord
<hi>Dillon,</hi> reſiding at <hi>Athlone,</hi> that <hi>O
Neal</hi> was Marching againſt him with
all the force he could make. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
my Lord was pleaſed to call me
to him: &amp; telling me his intelligence askt
my opinion what was to be done. I gave
it quickly, that he ſhould immediately
March back the ſhorteſt way, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to gain <hi>Laughlin</hi> Bridge. He
followed my advice. And, paſſing near
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101258:41"/>
                  <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> ſent his brother Sir <hi>George
Hambleton</hi> and my ſelf, to let the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
of that City know what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
he had from all hands. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
if they pleaſed, he would come to
them, with the Party he had, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
his Fortune with them. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Meſſage with all kindneſs
and duty: and anſwered, that if he
pleaſed to come to them, they would
ſerve him with their Lives; though
they did believe, it would be the loſs
of him and them together. On our
report his Excellency kept on his March
for the gaining of <hi>Laughlin:</hi> where
there was a Bridge that croſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the <hi>Barrow,</hi> and a Fort at the
end, on the County of <hi>Catherloe</hi>
ſide, Commanded by Colonel <hi>Walter
Bagnal.</hi> Having gained this point, we
loſt no time in our March to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
Where, coming near, I think the whole
people of the City came forth to meet
his Excellency, with as much joy as
ever man was received; having for
ſeveral days judged him and his Party
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101258:41"/>
loſt. Coming near the Subburbs, his
Excellency honour'd me with carrying
the Sword before him through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and into the Caſtle. I can give no
reaſon for it (beſides his own goodneſs)
other than that, I had been always a
promoter of the Peace, and the only
of the <hi>Confederate Catholicks,</hi> that
came with him, and never left him
in theſe his Adventures. The <hi>Nuncio</hi>
now thought all his own: committing
to ſeveral Priſons ſuch of the late <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Council</hi> and others as he called of
<hi>Ormonds</hi> Party. And having gotten his
Forces together, March'd them in one
Army though they took, for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conveniency in their March, two
different ways towards <hi>Dublin, O Neal</hi>
and <hi>Preſton</hi> as Generals Commanding
under him. They were noiſed ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and powerful, that in good
earneſt the people, Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
did not know what to make of it,
and ſhewed apprehenſion enough. His
Excellency perceiving this, as it was
too plain, called for me: and we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101258:42"/>
the whole matter. I took the
boldneſs to give my Opinion. Which
was, That this Army of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>
could no longer ſubſiſt in any place then
as they found Proviſion, where they
came. That neither of his Generals
ever had any Magazines during the War.
That they undertook this matter, in
Confidence of the plenty they ſhould
find in his Quarters. That I thought
it was a thing of too great hazard to
oppoſe them in the Field; and yet if
they were not ſtopped, they would come
on, and at leaſt live upon him till they
had eaten all. Laſtly, that on conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the whole, I thought it beſt
to prevent their coming too near. Which
could not be done any other way then by
deſtroying the Quarters. His Excellency
was of the ſame Opinion: and therefore
ſent Orders immediately, to all people
within eight Miles of the Town, to
bring in whatever they had: giving them
three or four days for it. And what was
found abroad after the time prefixt,
Parties were ordered to burn and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101258:42"/>
deſtroy; particularly Forrage and Mills:
for now all the Harveſt was in. This
was all effected, before the <hi>Nuncio</hi> and
his Army were come to <hi>Kilcullin-Bridge.</hi>
And yet how diſappointed
ſoever they were they advanc'd as far
as <hi>Leixlip</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> both which
places, lying within three Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
one of an other, and ſix from
<hi>Dublin,</hi> they made their Head-quarters:
<hi>Preſton</hi> at <hi>Leixlip,</hi> and <hi>Owen O Neal</hi>
at <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> the <hi>Nuncio</hi> with his Council
remaining at <hi>Seginſtown,</hi> ſome ſix Miles
farther off. But not being able to live long
by the Air: for from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
they expected not much: and the
continual rains and prodigious ſwelling
of the River <hi>Liffy,</hi> hindering that little
that was coming to them (for all the
Bridges over it were broken and great
jealouſies (even more than the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
old ones) ariſing 'twixt the two
Generals, and 'twixt the <hi>Nuncio</hi> alſo
and <hi>Preſton:</hi> they returned ſeveral ways,
in greater haſt than they came.</p>
               <p>The Quarters being deſtroyed; and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101258:43"/>
                  <hi>Athlone</hi> betrayed to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> by <hi>Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
a Fryer; and the Harbour of <hi>Dublin</hi>
blockt up by Parliament Men of War:
my advice was ask'd by his Excellence
in this extremity, with which of his
Enemies he ſhould Treat? I anſwer'd,
that I was confident he had reſolved
that before, there being no queſtion in
the caſe. For giving up to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when the King ſhould have <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
he would have <hi>Ireland</hi> with it;
but to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> and his Party, it might
prove far other ways, and the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
remain ſeparate.</p>
               <p>What weight this diſcourſe had, I know
not. But immediately my Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
engaged himſelf in a Treaty with
the Parliament.</p>
               <p>During which Treaty, his Excellency
was forced to March into the County
of <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> and other parts to feed
his people. Where we were not much
at our eaſe. For by <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> we
were kept in continual Alarme.</p>
               <p>Now all being agreed for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the places under his Command to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101258:43"/>
the Parliament, I took my leave of his
Excellency reſolving to go for <hi>France:</hi>
though with much grief of heart to leave
this Noble Lord, who had ſhewn ſo
much Loyalty, Juſtneſs and ſteddineſs
in his proceedings during theſe Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions;
even from the meeting at
<hi>Seginſtown,</hi> to the Concluſion of the
Peace, made with the <hi>Confederates;</hi> and
now again to the giving up of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> For which
I doubt not but he ſhall remain in Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as he deſerves, a Fixed-ſtar, by the
light of which others may walk in his
ſteps.</p>
               <p>But alaſs! whilſt this Noble Lord
was acting above board with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,</hi>
there was another Game
playing under him and in the dark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Earl of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and
thoſe of the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s party. This Earl
I know did pretend large Commiſſions
from the King. But of his Treating a
Peace, it was ſo ſecret that I never knew
it (though I was at that time of the
<hi>Suprcam Council</hi>) till that after the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101258:44"/>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Tuam</hi> was killed, the
Peace made with him was known at
<hi>Dublin;</hi> it being found in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
Pocket; and the benefit of it
earneſtly pretended by the <hi>Nuntio</hi> and
his Party, but as reſolutely refuſed and
rejected by my Lord Lieutenant. This
Peace goes by the name of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
Peace.</hi> However the <hi>Nuntio</hi>
having this colour, improves it: and
by his Emiſſaries of the Clergy inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
to the People, his threats of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
thoſe that ſhould accept
of <hi>Ormonds</hi> Peace, as they called it.
This broke and divided the Catholicks
extremely. Which the <hi>Nuncio</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
followed it with a Thundring
Excommunication to that effect.</p>
               <p>Now let the failour of this Peace lie
at whoſe door it will, 'tis no raſhneſs
to ſay, That Story mentions not any
one thing that had ſo fatal a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
For if this Peace had gone on,
the King had preſently been ſupplyed
with great forces from <hi>Ireland,</hi> both
of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh:</hi> and ſo probably
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101258:44"/>
might have been prevented, the enſuing
mischiefs that ſhortly after happen'd
both to him and all his Loyal Subjects
throughout his Dominions.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had a more particular ill
Fate than the reſt by this breach of
Faith. For albeit they, diſcovering
their Error, did, not long after, mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavour to make amends the beſt
they could by a ſecond and very ſolemn
Agreement; which their Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſigned, and themſelves confirmed
and Sealed it with the blood of more
than twenty Thouſand of their beſt
men, who loſt their lives to maintain it:
refuſing in the mean while all offers of
Peace, and that even to the very laſt,
from the Parliament: yet ſince his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
happy Reſtauration, their Eſtates
are, by the <hi>Acts of Settlement,</hi> given
away; ſome very few excepted. As if
<hi>all the Confederate Catholicks</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi>
had been as guilty as thoſe who begun
the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>North:</hi> or as thoſe
that were the <hi>only Authors</hi> of breaking
the <hi>Peace</hi> of 46.</p>

alſo was come thither, a new <hi>Treaty</hi>
was ſet on Foot, between him and the

called ſince the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Forty
eight.</hi> What Agreement there was
between my Lord Lieutenant and my

               <p>But to introduce my own Story, I am
to tell you, That in the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Forty ſix</hi>
there was an Article by which it was
left to the Confederate Catholicks to
name certain perſons, for General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
to whom my Lord Lieutenant
was to give Commiſſions. Now I
having ſerved them long, as has been
ſeen by the Story; and the ſame Article
being confirmed in this <hi>Peace:</hi> they
named me, as they had done in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
to be General of the Horſe of the
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
approved, and accordingly
gave me a Commiſſion, and ſoon after
ſent me into the <hi>Queens County</hi> with
five Thouſand Foot, a Thouſand Horſe
and ſome Cannon to reduce the Fort of
<hi>Leaſe,</hi> (otherwiſe called <hi>Mary-Borough</hi>)
<hi>Athy</hi> and other Gariſons, poſſeſt
by <hi>O Neals</hi> people. Theſe Troops,
for the moſt part, were Commanded
by Sir <hi>Tho. Armſtrong,</hi> Colonel <hi>Treſwel,</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:101258:47"/>
and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers: men that
had always followed my Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
fortune: and had been recruited
and reinforced out of their Winter-Quarters,
as <hi>Kilkenny</hi> and ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
about.</p>
               <p>With them having well executed my
Order, without any conſiderable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
I Marched to <hi>Laughlin-Bridge,</hi>
and Encamped, giving an account to
his Excellency what had paſs'd: and
that I would there expect his farther
Orders. But 'twas not many days,
before my Lord Lieutenant, the Lord of
<hi>Inchiquin,</hi> Lieutenant General of the
Army, the Lord <hi>Taaf</hi> Maſter of the
Ordnance, <hi>Mr. Daniel O Neal</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of his Excellencies Guards of
Horſe, with other Generals, and the
whole Army of my Lord <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> and
ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiments joyned us. So
with a goodly Train of Artillery, we
paſſed the River <hi>Barrow,</hi> and that night
Encamped in the County of <hi>Catherloe.</hi>
Where ſomething paſs'd in point of
Command, that gave me ground to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101258:47"/>
judge my ſelf wronged. Beſides I was
haraſſed by my Marches and Labours
in the <hi>Queens County.</hi> In conſideration
of which, his Excellency, at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
gave me leave to retire, for the
refreſhing my ſelf: and his Excellency
Marched on and inveſted <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, being returned to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> I
found the City in an uprore. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
and iſſue of it, take as followeth.
One Father <hi>Caron,</hi> at that time Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary
General of the Recollects all
over <hi>Ireland,</hi> being in <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the abuſes of ſome of his Order
there, was by the <hi>Commiſſioners of Truſt</hi>
deſired to remove one <hi>Brenan,</hi> and ſix
or ſeven more, out of the Monaſtery
of that Town, and ſend them elſewhere
to be kept under Diſcipline. The reaſon
of this deſire was, That thoſe men, were
notoriouſly known to be ſtill moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſticklers for the ways of the <hi>Nuncio:</hi>
and that they made it their buſineſs to
incenſe the people anew againſt the
Peace; alienate them from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and draw them wholly to <hi>Owen
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101258:48"/>
O Neal,</hi> who yet ſtood out againſt all
agreement with the King.</p>
               <p>To ſatisfie ſo juſt a demand of the
Commiſſioners, Father <hi>Caron</hi> appoints
a day for <hi>Brenan</hi> and his Aſſociates to
depart <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and go to the ſeveral
other Convents, which he had appointed
for them. And becauſe he found by
their Anſwers, they were reſolv'd not
to obey him: the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of <hi>Truſt,</hi>
upon notice thereof, more effectually
reſolve to force their obedience to his
Commands, by ſending them away
conducted by Guards, but yet Guards
of Roman Catholick Souldiers, to the
Convents appointed them by him, who
was their undoubted Spiritual Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior.</p>
               <p>Of this reſolution of the <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
of <hi>Truſt, Brenan</hi> and his refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
brethren having timely notice: and
ſeeing very well there was no ſence for
them againſt this flail, but by that of
ſome extraordinary means: and then
reflecting on their intereſt, as Natives
in the Town; for three or four of them
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101258:48"/>
were ſo, as one, by name <hi>Rooth,</hi> was
Brother to the Mayor: beſides, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
mightily in the common people,
whom they had already poſſeſs'd with
many lies: but above all perſuading
themſelves, that no Catholick durſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to violate the Sanctity of their
Habit, or priviledge of their profeſſion,
by laying violent hands upon them;
and Proteſtants there were none in
Town at that time; which they knew
very well: what do they conclude at
laſt? even very Religiouſly to raiſe a
moſt dangerous Tumult: and that by
the moſt damnable malicious lye that
could be forged.</p>
               <p>When the day appointed was come,
they by themſelves and their Emiſſaries,
inform the heads of the rabble abroad,
and throughly poſſeſs them, That the
Commiſſary and Father <hi>Peter Walſh,</hi>
with ſome five or ſix more of their
Company, men that had always ſtood
up for the Kings Government, <hi>had
privately introduced a number of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of</hi> Inchiquins <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Iriſh <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101258:49"/>
into their Convent, and there
clothed, in the Habit of that Order,
all of them like Friers; of purpoſe
to ſeiſe at night thoſe few Religious
men that remain'd unalterable in their
obedience to the Apoſtolick See: and for
that cauſe, and unknown to any, at ſuch
a time of darkneſs and ſilence, either to
drown them in the River</hi> Neoir <hi>that runs
by their Garden; or waſting them over
it by Boat, to lead them to a more cruel
Death elſewhere, in ſome unknown place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This lie enſlam'd ſo the meaner ſort
in the Town and Suburbs (pretty well,
before it, prepar'd by many other inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
that upon a ſuddain vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them force their way into the
Monaſtery, curſing &amp; exclaiming againſt
thoſe that would turn away their
Friends. And then, arming themſelves
with what ever came next to hand; and
with all fury imaginable attacking a
little Caſtle, whereinto the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with his company had withdrawn,
they force this too. Nor could Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General <hi>Bellew</hi> and Captain
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101258:49"/>
                  <hi>Dillon</hi> hold out long. Theſe two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
ſo ſoon as they ſaw the door of
the Caſtle flying open, ruſh'd in among
the firſt, and with their Swords drawn
plac'd themſelves on the narrow ſtairs
that lead up to the Garret; whether
the Commiſſary and his Aſſociates were
now gotten. But the odds was too great,
and their two Swords were too ſhort
and weak, againſt ſo many more ſpits
and poles. So they alſo being beat from
their Poſt; the Commiſſary, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with him had no retreat, but to
the Battlement, through the Garret
window. The ſhutter of this window
was pretty thick and of Oak: and for
that reaſon faſtened by them, as well
as they could, in the outſide towards
themſelves. Which they had ſcarce
done, when the Aſſailants, gotten up
to the Garret, with ſtones and rafters
pelt at this laſt defence.</p>
               <p>And now the Fathers, utterly deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of life, lay themſelves on their knees,
praying to God, and ſhrieving one an
other. Onely Father <hi>Walſh</hi> put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101258:50"/>
in another poſture. Which was,
Standing at a corner of the Battlement,
and Speaking and Preaching thence as
from a Pulpit to the people: not only
diſcovering their great Error, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
the horrour of what was a
doing; but upbraiding them alſo with
the greateſt ingratitude imaginable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
himſelf. And then asking them
(for it began to be dusky) did not
they know him, that lived ſo many
years among them? Or were they ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
it was he that was chiefly
ſought for to be murdered? And yet
did not they remember, it was he alone
that with the hazard of his own life,
but two years before, did ſave them all?
Their Mayor and Aldermen from being
hang'd at their Gates by <hi>Owen Roe O
Neal?</hi> Their whole City from being
Sack'd by his then victorious exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Army? And their Caſtle from either
receiving in an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Garriſon; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeiz'd upon a few days after, by the
<hi>Nuncio</hi> himſelf in perſon?</p>
               <p>To this utmoſt extremity were theſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101258:50"/>
Beſieged Fathers brought, only one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Window leaf, a board that was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
an inch thick, and it a forcing too,
parting them and Death: when I had the
good Fortune to reſcue them. For, juſt in
that nick of time, I came to Town, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with two or three Trumpets,
about a dozen Horſe, with five or ſix
Gentlemen (of which Sir <hi>George Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
was one) and ſome Footmen.
And, being inform'd of the matter, I
Gallop'd preſently with thoſe of my
Company to the place; had a charge
ſounded; and fell in among the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
firing of Piſtols, and crying <hi>Kill,
kill, kill.</hi> The multitude hearing the
Trumpets, and ſeeing the fire (for
'twas now grown dusky) and knowing
my voice, found themſelves ſurpriz'd,
and thought themſelves betray'd; as
knowing the Army to be far off in their
March to <hi>Dublin;</hi> and therefore imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
routed and run away; though
they had brought thoſe in the Caſtle
ſo low; that (to ſpeak within compaſs)
they could not hold out half a quarter of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101258:51"/>
an hour. Theſe Fathers being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
after four hours defence; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
who Governed this Siege: and
found it to be ſeven or eight Fryers in
a houſe by, the chiefeſt of them the
forementioned <hi>Brenan,</hi> and <hi>Rooth.</hi> I
call'd for them down. And whilſt I
was ſpeaking, came to my aſſiſtance the
Town Major, one <hi>Archer,</hi> with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Muſquetiers, and preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Mayor and Aldermen.
Whom after I had ratled ſoundly for
ſuffering this diſorder, I Commanded
to lay hold of theſe Friers and carry
them Priſoners to the Caſtle. At which
they ſtaggering, and this <hi>Brenan</hi> a ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Frier, ſaying he would fain ſee
what man durſt, Toutch his Habit:
I laying hold on him ſaid, Lies the
Enchantment there? And after this the
Mayor, Town Major, and all the reſt
carried them away Priſoners to the
Caſtle, as I had appointed.</p>

               </argument>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:101258:52"/>
               <p>NOw after a while that I had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
my ſelf a Hunting, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to <hi>Limbrick:</hi> and there lay;
cauſing by fair and foul means all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
both in that City and County, to
bring in what remained, due to the
King of their Aplotments. Having
got ten Thouſand pound together, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
it to Sir <hi>George Hambleton</hi>
Treaſurer of the Army. My Lord
Lieutenant now wrote to the <hi>Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
of Truſt</hi> ſitting at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> to let
me know, that I ſhould come to the
Army, and that all difficulties concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Command ſhould be removed to my
Satisfaction. I obeyed, and Sir <hi>George</hi>
and my ſelf with our ten Thouſand
pound went to the Army; which we
found in their March, removing from
the <hi>Phenix</hi> ſide of <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Rath Mines,</hi>
where they Encamped.</p>
               <p>But my Lord of <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> ſoon after
acquainted his Excellency with ſome
Letters he had received from his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in <hi>Mounſter,</hi> that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101258:52"/>
land there. Which if ſo, all his Towns
would revolt, if not prevented by his
ſpeedy repair thither, with ſome or all
his Army. In Order to this, my Lord
of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> deſired his Excellency's
Conſent that he might March away
with eleven hundred Horſe: and his
Excellency imparted all to me. At
which I was infinitely ſurprized, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the whole Army too weak for the
work in hand. I remember my Lord
Lieutenants Anſwer. But 'tis not my
buſineſs to ſpeak more of this Subject,
having been always kept a ſtranger to
the undertaking of this Siege. 'Tis
enough for me to tell you here, that my
Lord of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> with eleven hundred
Horſe March'd away: and you may
imagine many more. Soon after this,
happen'd the Defeat before <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, not long after, that, <hi>Cromwell</hi>
with his Army Landed there; March'd
to <hi>Tredath;</hi> and took it with all the
Towns in thoſe parts. My Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
not being able to ſtand before
him, retired with what Troops he had
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101258:53"/>
to the County of <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> Where my
Lord of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> came to him, and in
a ſhort time they formed a good Army.
For, beſides my Lord of <hi>Inchiquins</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
many <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Regiments of Foot joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them: <hi>Owen O Neal</hi> having by this
time, though too late for himſelf and
the King's ſervice, come in upon <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
which he ſign'd upon his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
after he had been rejected by the
Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> being retired to <hi>Dublin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd
his Army; ſitted himſelf for a
new undertaking; and took his March
by the Sea ſide through the County of
<hi>Wicklowe</hi> to Beſiege <hi>Wexford.</hi> My
Lord of <hi>Inchiquin</hi> was ſent to oppoſe
him. They met on the Strand in the
County of <hi>Wexford</hi> towards <hi>Glaſcarrig:</hi>
fought; and my Lord was Worſted.</p>
               <p>My Lord Lieutenant being with his
Army come to <hi>Roſs,</hi> and fearing a want
of men within <hi>Wexford;</hi> I, knowing
the Town and Country about it, offer'd
to attempt the Relief. My Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
my good Will, and ordered me
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101258:53"/>
as many Regiments of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Foot, as
made fifteen hundred men. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels
were my Lord of <hi>Eveah,</hi> and
one <hi>Mac Coffre,</hi> alſo I think another,
and appointed two hundred Horſe to
eſcort us. I took a great compaſs and
came before day to the Ferry, near Sir
<hi>Thomas Eſmond's</hi> houſe called <hi>Ballin-Treman,</hi>
who as I remembred was with
me. Then leaving the Horſe for my
return, I Paſſed that Arm of the Sea
in Boats: and having delivered the Foot
to Sir <hi>Edmund Butler</hi> the Governor;
I took the ſame way homewards as I
came.</p>
               <p>The Town thus Manned was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable,
as to <hi>Cromwel</hi> by force.
Yet he took it by the advantage of a
Caſtle that was betray'd unto him by
the Governour, one <hi>James Stafford.</hi>
This Caſtle, was ſtrong, and ſtood about
two or three hundred Paces from the
Wall. The Communication with the
Town could not be Cut. So that the
Danger was leaſt there, if Treachery
had not been in the Caſe. But the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101258:54"/>
Caſtle being betray'd, it Maſtered all
that part of the Wall. So <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s
Force<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s entred, and made almoſt as
great a Slaughter as at <hi>Drogheda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord Lieutenant then with his
Army, retired over the River of <hi>Roſs,</hi>
and encamped on the County of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny</hi>
ſide. From whence his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ſent me into the County of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
to <hi>Paſſage,</hi> over againſt <hi>Bally-hack,</hi>
to look after the relieving of <hi>Duncan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
Beſieged by ſome of <hi>Cromwels</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
I think <hi>Ireton</hi> Commanded. And
for all there were Parliament Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, I ventured one morning with
a Boat, and got into the place, to the
Governour a brave Gentleman, one
Colonel <hi>Wogane,</hi> whom my Lord
ſometime before had ſent to Command:
and with him, beſides the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
about a hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers,
who had ſerved the King in the Wars
of <hi>England.</hi> He from the higheſt part
of the Rampart, ſhewed me how the
Enemy lay. After I had well conſidered
all, I offered to ſend him that night by
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101258:54"/>
Sea, eighty Horſe Sadled and with
Piſtols, if he would mount them with
ſo many of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
day, with them and ſome Foot,
make a ſharp Sally. He lik'd it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
but doubted my part, for
putting in the Horſe, it being about
three miles by Sea. I bad him leave
that to me.</p>
               <p>Having thus concluded, I took my
Boat, returned, and ſet my ſelf to my
Buſineſs. The Tide ſerving at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the night, and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Boats, I Commanded eighty
choice Horſe to come to the Sea ſide.
Where, making the Horſemen alight,
I cauſed the Horſes to be Boated, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome to hold them. They entred
the Place, and all was executed as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned;
great Slaughter made, and the
Cannons ſeiſed. For the Confuſion
amongſt the Enemy was great, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that they judged it, the falling in of
an Army from abroad, hearing and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
horſes, and knowing none to be in
the Fort. Our people retiring before
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101258:55"/>
day, the Enemy raiſed the Siege in the
morning, and Marched off.</p>
               <p>His Excellency ſhortly after this,
made me Governour of <hi>Waterford:</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I went, with a Thouſand men.
But the Town would not admit them
entrance. On which I, after ſeveral
days diſpute, being in deſpair, Marched
away in the night.</p>
               <p>All this while the Armies were not
idle. For <hi>Cromwel,</hi> after the rendition
of <hi>Wexford,</hi> came to <hi>Roſs:</hi> making a
breach, took it: paſſed the River there:
Marched through the County of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny</hi>
to <hi>Carick:</hi> and paſſing the River of
the <hi>Shower</hi> into the County of <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
March'd on into the County of
<hi>Cork;</hi> where all my Lord of <hi>Inchiquins</hi>
Towns opend their Gates to him.</p>
               <p>The particular actings between the
Armies, I muſt leave to thoſe that know
better; for I was ſeldom with them,
but imployed up and down, as you ſee.
The perſons principally intruſted by my
Lord Lieutenant for the Government
of the Army, were my Lord of <hi>Inchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:101258:55"/>
and my Lord <hi>Taaf,</hi> till the Spring
following.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cromwel</hi> began to move again,
having drawn his Forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and had gained one Captain
<hi>Tickle</hi> to ſecure him a Gate or two
of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> when he ſhould think ſit.
The Plague ſtrangely raged now in this
City: as it had done for a long time
in all our Towns. And <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
having left his Gariſons in the County
of <hi>Cork,</hi> in good Order, was advanced
into the County of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> in his
way to the Siege of <hi>Kilkenny.</hi> I, having
nothing to do, went one morning ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Fox-Hunting, as I was accuſtomed
all the Winter. My Lord Lieutenant
joyning me in my way, ſaid, he would
ſee what we did. Being a little farther
out of Town, he began to tell me how
he had diſcovered this Treachery of
<hi>Tickle; Cromwels</hi> approach; and his
deſign to Beſiege this place. After
ſome diſcourſe it was not long, before
my Lord came to the point, and told
me that it was reſolved in Council that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101258:56"/>
he ſhould immediately repair into the
County of <hi>Clare,</hi> &amp; from thence and the
adjacent Countries endeavour theraiſing
an Army to attend the Motions of
<hi>Cromwel:</hi> and that, in his abſence, he
ſhould appoint me Commander in chief
of the Province of <hi>Leinſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Any man may judge how I was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
with this honour. But my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
though I thought my ſelf loſt
by it, obliged me to a Submiſſion. So
I caſt my ſelf at my Lords Feet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of me as he pleaſed. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
with all neceſſary Orders di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched,
his Excellency with his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and <hi>Commiſſioners of Truſt</hi> left <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi>
and went ſtraight to the County
of <hi>Clare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I loſt no time, and beſtirr'd my ſelf,
making Major <hi>James Walſh</hi> Governour
of the Caſtle, and Sir <hi>Walter Butler</hi> of
the City. I did all I could to furniſh
it with Men, Proviſion, and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of all ſorts: then March'd out
my ſelf leaving the Gariſons ſtrong,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101258:56"/>
about two hundred Horſe and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> now having left <hi>Caſhel,</hi> and
being on his March to <hi>Callen,</hi> I went
to <hi>Catherlow,</hi> hoping to have met there
ſuch Troops from all parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
as I had ordered. But thoſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in the lower Divident under the
Command of the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> intirely
failed, being about the number of two
Thouſand five hundred Foot, and ſix
or ſeven hundred Horſe: and in their
ſtead I received a Letter from his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
as if he were ſending them in great
haſt. But they never came, though I
repeated often my Orders.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and other Troops not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I knew not well what to do. For
I had only with me 800 Foot of the
Province, and an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Regiment of
twelve hundred more. Sir <hi>Thomas
Armſtrong</hi> Commiſſary General of the
Horſe, a brave Commander, was my
chief Counſellor. His Regiment, with
my Lord Lieutenants Commanded by
Colonel <hi>Treſwel,</hi> and ſome other
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101258:57"/>
Troops, made up near a Thouſand
Horſe.</p>
               <p>At this time an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man was brought
unto me, taken by ſome of my Guards;
who, being to be examined, deſired to
ſpeak with me alone. Which being
granted; he produced a piece of yellow
Wax, in form almoſt round; which he
was to ſwallow on occaſion. Within
it there was Note from <hi>Huſon</hi> to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
intimating that he with his Forces
were on their March from <hi>Dublin</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; but deſired his Orders in
reſpect that I lay in his way. Having
Copied the Note, I roul'd it in the
Wax, as I had it. And the fellow
having aſſured me of his return with
<hi>Cromwels</hi> anſwer I truſted him, &amp; ſuffer'd
him to go on his way. The ſecond
or third day he came to me, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
me another piece of Wax, as the
former, with <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Order to <hi>Huſon</hi>
incloſed; which I kept. However
<hi>Huſon</hi> held on his March, and paſs'd
the River <hi>Barow</hi> eight or ten Miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:101258:57"/>
Now though I was not of ſtrength to
meddle with his Army, I made ſome
advantage of my Intelligence, and
Marched to <hi>Athy</hi> a Town with a Bridge
eight Miles above on the ſame River;
where <hi>Huſon</hi> had a Magazine, with
ſeven hundred men in Gariſon: and,
coming before it about an hour before
Sun-ſet, I took it by Storm, with all
the Gariſon Priſoners at diſcretion.
But the place not being tenable, I
ſlighted it: and not knowing what to
do with my Priſoners, I made a Preſent
of them to <hi>Cromwel;</hi> deſiring him by
Letter, that he would do the like with
me, as any of mine ſhould fall into his
power.</p>
               <p>But he little valued my Civility.
For in a very few days after he Beſieged
<hi>Gowran,</hi> where Colonel <hi>Hammond</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
and the Souldiers Mutining
and giving up the place with their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
he cauſed this Gouernor <hi>Hamond</hi>
and ſome other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers to be
ſhot to Death. Which being done,
and all other places in the County of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101258:58"/>
                  <hi>Kilkenny</hi> cleared by him, he ſalls to work
and Beſieges <hi>Kilkenny</hi> it ſelf. Whereupon
I took my March to <hi>Baliraget</hi> within 7
Miles of him. But finding my ſelf too
much expoſed there, I Marched into <hi>Oſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and made my head Quarter at <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town,</hi>
a place belonging to Mr. <hi>Fits
Patrick.</hi> Whence I ſent again to the
Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> to come unto me with all
the Force he had. He gave me ſtill fair
promiſes (as before) but never came.
I then with the advice of Sir <hi>Thomas
Armſtrong</hi> and Colonel <hi>Treſwel,</hi> reſolv'd
with my Party to enter <hi>Kilkenny.</hi>
Which was eaſie to be done; the ſide
where the River runs being open, but
when I came to our Rendevous, my
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> Regiment appeared not, but
were Marched away to their own
Country; alleadging they came to Fight
againſt men, but not againſt God.
Their meaning was becauſe of the
Plague.</p>
               <p>This Deſign being thus broken, and
a great breach made in the Wall near
the Caſtle, which had been aſſaulted
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101258:58"/>
two or three times, and no hopes ever
to be Succoured; I ſent Orders to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
to make Conditions when they
thought fit, and both to joyn at the ſame
time, though the Caſtle might hold out
two or three days longer than the Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> being thus Maſter of <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenny,</hi>
I retired into the Kings County.
Where, underſtanding that <hi>Carloe</hi>
Caſtle was Beſieg'd, I appointed a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous;
intending to attempt the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.
But coming to the place, I found
not half my Foot. The reſt were March'd
into <hi>Mounſter,</hi> I know not by what
order.</p>
               <p>Now finding my ſelf thus uſed: and
reflecting on ſeveral other hardſhips
put upon me ſince the <hi>Peace of</hi> 48 in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of ſucceſs, I left <hi>Leinſter,</hi> and
went to my Lord Lieutenant in the
County of <hi>Clare.</hi> Where I rendred
him an account, how I had been failed,
to the end he might do as he thought
fit.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Had not been long there attending
his Excellency, before <hi>Ireton</hi> ſate
down before <hi>Limbrick,</hi> on the County
of <hi>Limbrick</hi> ſide, leaving <hi>Tomond's</hi> ſide
open. His Excellency repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and, being come near the end of
the Bridge, ſent to the Mayor, to let
him know that he was there, with
ſome Troops, and ready to enter with
them for the defence of the place. The
Mayor having conſulted his Brethren,
made excuſe as if they had no need of
relief. Several Meſſages paſs to and fro,
till at length his Excellency loſing all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
declared unto them that if they
would not receive and obey him, he
would leave the Kingdom. All would not
do. And ſo, turning aſide, he called me
to him, and told me that he was in good
earneſt, and would be gone: but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101258:60"/>
me to ſtay, and keep up a
Buſſel as long as I could; it being the
Kings Service. I was very unwilling
to remain behind, ſeeing he took with
him my Lord of <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> my Lord
<hi>Taaf,</hi> Colonel <hi>Daniel O Neal,</hi> and other
his friends. But the ſound of the Kings
Service ſo Charmed me, that I aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
my own Judgment, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to what his Excellency ſhould Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
He then gave me a Commiſſion
to be Commander in chief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Mounſter,</hi> and the County of
<hi>Clare;</hi> having before that of <hi>Leinſter.</hi>
Thus qualified, together with my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
General of the Horſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
his Excellency gave me Poſſeſſion
of his Troops there ſtanding in their
Arms, together with his Life-Guard to
ſerve me as they had done him; and, as
I counted, they were in all about two
Thouſand Foot, and a Thouſand Horſe.
His Excellency for my better encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
aſſured me, that he would
leave a Commiſſion for my Lord of
<hi>Clanrickard,</hi> to be Lord Deputy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:101258:60"/>
Now my Lord being gone, and not
ſuffering me to accompany him more
than a Mile, I went into the Town
addreſſing to the Mayor and Aldermen.
I told them how I was left, and ask'd
them whether they were pleaſed with
it, and would obey me? They took
no long time to conſult, but ſubmitted
themſelves to my pleaſure. On which
I immediately viſited their Walls: and
at the ſame time took a view of the
Enemy: whom I judged to be very
looſe and expoſed, if vigorouſly aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
On which, I reſolved, in the firſt
of the night, to draw my Troops into
the Town, and a little before day to
make a ſharp Sally. On what Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
I know not, but <hi>Ireton</hi> raiſed
his Siege, and marched off in the
night. This done, I returned my
Troops to their Quarters and remained
my ſelf in the Town, till I had ſent
my Orders to all Officers, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſeveral Provinces, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to my Lord of <hi>Muskry</hi> then
in <hi>Kerry,</hi> ordering him to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101258:61"/>
ſo ſtrong as he could, and that I
would ſoon be with him to encreaſe his
Forces. Which I performed, paſſing the
<hi>Shanon</hi> about twelve miles below <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi>
with two thouſand men. And
though the River was full of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Ships and two miles over, yet I
had not the leaſt loſs. 'Tis true I took
the night, and landing in <hi>Kerry</hi> near
<hi>Drombeg,</hi> I marcht till I came to my
Lord of <hi>Muskry</hi> at <hi>Tralie.</hi> Having
acquainted him with what had paſt,
and ordered what I would have done,
particularly in raiſing of Forces, I left
my men with him, and returned to
<hi>Iniſs,</hi> my Reſidence in the County of
<hi>Clare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where being come, and a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd,
I went to <hi>Portumne</hi> to viſit the
Marqueſs of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> and came
there before Dinner. He bad me very
Welcome. After Dinner, I deſired to
retire my ſelf for an hour or two. He
brought me to my Chamber, and
asked, Whether it would not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
that he took a Pipe of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101258:61"/>
by me; I ſaid, no, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
yet, ſhewed my ſelf melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.
He did what he could to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
it: but I pretended withal not
to be very well, and ſpake to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of his that ſtood at the Door, to
bring me a Glaſs of Sack: My Lord
was much pleaſed with that, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for a Bottle.</p>
               <p>Now, my Point was to get him to
take the Government, by accepting
the Commiſſion left by my Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant:
yet I ſpeak nothing of it,
hoping he would begin; which he
did. The paſſages on this ſubject
are too long to relate here. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we parted, I got him to ſend to
the <hi>Commiſſioners of Truſt,</hi> (theſe were
men named by the Confederates, and
agreed to by my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> to
ſee the performance of the Articles of
Peace) then ſitting at <hi>Loghreah,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
them to ſend him his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:
for he would take upon him
the Government. And to loſe no
time, I gave him the beſt account I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101258:62"/>
could of the Forces in the Kingdom,
as well Friends as Foes. For he during
the War had been no more than a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator,
beloved and reſpected of all, and
might have ſo continued, had not his
great Loyalty drawn him to take up
this Commiſſion: which was little leſs
than to Sacrifice himſelf and his, only
to give the King time to trie his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
with <hi>Cromwell:</hi> their Armies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near <hi>Sterling</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near together, as the Kings Letters
to us imported, brought by <hi>Deane
King,</hi> an Expreſs newly come. We
agreed at this meeting, that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſhould immediately raiſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Horſe as an addition to the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Forces of <hi>Conaught,</hi> and that I
ſhould march with my thouſand Horſe,
out of the County of <hi>Clare</hi> to the
<hi>Silver Mines</hi> in the County of <hi>Tippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,</hi>
paſſing through <hi>Limbrick</hi> in the
night, and be at ſuch a day and hour
at the Rendevous, and there I ſhould
meet fifteen hundred Foot, that he
would ſend with a good Officer. His
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101258:62"/>
Part was little more than croſſing the
<hi>Shanon</hi> at his door, and marching four
or five miles; no Enemy in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>I complied punctually with my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the Mayor of <hi>Limbrick,</hi> as I
marched through the City, on demand
gave me a hundred Foot. The Alarm
of my March was ſoon given to Sir
<hi>Hardreſs Waller,</hi> or my Lord <hi>Brochil,</hi>
or both, lying near <hi>Kilmallock</hi> with
great Forces. They purſued me; and
I coming to our appointed Rendevous,
no news there was of the fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Foot. Having loſt this Anchor,
I was put to my Wits ends. But not
having much time to think, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
coming on, I reſolved to thruſt
into the next Faſtneſs, and ſave my
ſelf as well as I could. But there was
a Caſtle of the <hi>O-Machers</hi> that ſtood
in the way, poſſeſt by the Enemy. And
there being no other paſſage, I ſent to
the adjacent Villages, and got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Crows of Iron, Pickaxes, and
what elſe that could be found neceſſary;
and making my Horſe-men to alight,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:101258:63"/>
I fell a Storming the Caſtle. Which
with the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Limbrick</hi>
Foot, in three or four hours time was
yielded. I left my hundred men in
this place to ſecure the Paſs. Now
being pretty ſafe, I lodg'd that night
at my eaſe, where Collonel <hi>Fitz Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick</hi>
came to me, who had for ſome
time kept in thoſe Faſtneſſes with a
good Party of Foot and ſome Horſe.
My men being well refreſhed, I took
the plain Countrey near <hi>Burras:</hi> and
after entring the Woods at the foot of
the Mountain <hi>Sleau Bleauma,</hi> I met
Sir <hi>Walter Dungan</hi> then Commiſſary
General of the Horſe, as was Ordered.
He brought with him only three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horſe; but I finding my ſelf ſtill
purſued with Horſe and Foot, beſides
what were gathering round on all ſides,
I took leave of Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> ordering
him to return from whence he came,
and to ſtop all Forces that I had ſent
for, as well from <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> as <hi>Leinſter.</hi>
So I with my thouſand Horſe marched
into <hi>Conaught,</hi> paſſing by the Bridge
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101258:63"/>
of <hi>Athlone.</hi> Being there, I poſted to
<hi>Loghreah,</hi> where my Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> was,
with a <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> ſitting in his
Houſe. I, coming into his Chamber,
found with him about a dozen princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
men of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> deputed to
him; ſetting forth the deſperate Eſtate
of the Nation, with the impoſſibility
much farther to hold out. Beſides,
that there were now come to the
Town, Mr. <hi>John Grace,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John
Bryan</hi> Commiſſioners from the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or their Commander in Chief,
offering greater Conditions than was
reaſonably to be expected, as the caſe
ſtood. Whilſt this Addreſs was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
my Lord was glad to ſee me
come in, and ordered them to repeat
what they had ſaid. I ſeemed much
ſcandalized at the ill timing of their
Propoſals: and therefore preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
my diſlike to it. Then by my
Lords permiſſion, weary and dirty, as
I was, I went down into the Aſſembly,
as a Peer being a Member, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
my deteſtation of what they had
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101258:64"/>
in hand: demonſtrating, that if thoſe
fifteen hundred men, commanded by
one Collonel <hi>Burk</hi> had not failed, I
had probably now been Maſter of the
Field: beſides, that the noiſe of a
Treaty might deſtroy all what could
be hoped for of good from the Kings
Endeavours againſt <hi>Cromwel;</hi> that His
Majeſty, as his own Letters ſpoke,
both to my Lord Deputy and my ſelf,
made no doubt, if he could gain fourty
eight hours march before <hi>Cromwel</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>England,</hi> his buſineſs was done,
becauſe all were ready there to joyn in
aſſiſting him. And, that he therefore,
conjured us not to hearken to any <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
with the Enemy. Then I ſet forth
the ſtate of the Forces of the Kingdom
on all ſides, and concluded very ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt the two <hi>Parliament Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners.</hi>
So that they haſtily packt out of
Town, and the Aſſembly let the matter
fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reynolds</hi> now beſieged <hi>Tecrohan</hi> in
<hi>Meath;</hi> and my Lord Deputy came to
<hi>Tyrrels Pace</hi> about twelve miles from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101258:64"/>
it, with two thouſand Foot and ſeven
hundred Horſe. A Councel of War
being held, I propoſed, that our Horſe
ſhould alarm the Enemy, whilſt the
Foot attempted to ſuccour the Place,
taking their March through the Bogs.
'Twas alledged by all impoſſible to be
done. For coming near the place,
there were two necks of Land that did
almoſt meet: and that between them
there was a great Way or <hi>Tougher,</hi>
with a large Ditch of Water on each
ſide, which muſt be ccoſſed: and that
in all likely hood the Enemy would plant
their Guns on the firm Land, at both
ends of this <hi>Tougher,</hi> and bring the
ſtrength of their Army to defend that
Paſſage; there being no other way,
ſeeing we had not force to attempt
them on the firm Land. I heard all
this, and knew it well; yet, did not
agree to the Impoſſibility of entring
the place. Then addreſſing my ſelf
to the <hi>Deputy,</hi> I begged pardon if I
gueſſed at the thoughts of the Officers
preſent; which was, that I being Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101258:65"/>
of the Horſe might well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
this Undertaking: For, I was
to be with the Horſe, and ſo to have
no ſhare in this Danger. But to ſhew
them the contrary, I deſired his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
to give me the Command of
this party of Foot; which he did: and
himſelf to march with the Horſe to
alarm the Enemy on another ſide. It
being thus determined, I entred the
Bog (which was eight miles long)
with my two thouſand Foot, and his
Excellency took his March as was
agreed. Coming in ſight of this
<hi>Tougher,</hi> I found the Enemy expecting
as we had ſuppoſed, for they ſaw me
Marching from the firſt entring into
the Bog. I then put my men into the
beſt Order I could in three Diviſions:
two to attempt paſſing the <hi>Tougher,</hi>
the third to ſtand ſtill, faceing two or
three Battallions, that were drawn on
my right hand; fearing they would
fall on my Flank or Rear. I March'd
on with my two Diviſions. Coming
within Shot, they raked me with their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101258:65"/>
Cannon, and great Volleys of ſmall
Shot. But I advanced ſtill, and my
men fought it on the <hi>Tougher</hi> with
handy blows, making thoſe that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it, retire to their Horſe which
ſtood drawn up at each end of the
<hi>Tougher</hi> or firm Land. Seeing this
go ſo well, I look'd back, and ſaw my
third Diviſion, which was to ſtand
ſtill, coming after me. I ran to it,
crying to the Officer that Commanded,
to attack the Battallions which he was
commanded to look after: on this, he
turned to his men, and ſpake ſomething
in <hi>Iriſh</hi> that I do not know, and
March'd two or three hundred Paces,
in ſuch a faſhion, that I could not tell
whether he intended Fighting or Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away. But coming to the Point
where he muſt declare, he plainly run
away, and all his Party followed him.
which when the two Diviſions, that
had paſſed the <hi>Tougher</hi> ſaw, they March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on into the Place: and I was left
alone, only ſome Gentlemen with me;
and by the favour of the night, for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101258:66"/>
now it began to be dark, I got off:
and by the next morning returned to
<hi>Terrils Pace,</hi> where I had left my Lord
Deputy: who had all the Story before
my coming, and ſending out took
this Captain that had cauſed this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
who, by a Council of War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condemned, was ſhot to Death.
His name was <hi>Fox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this <hi>Ireton</hi> was not idle, knowing
our weakneſs too well, and that I did
only keep up a Buſſel, till the King and
<hi>Cromwel</hi> had decided their Quarrel. He
therefore again ſate down before <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi>
with a powerful Army, on the
County of <hi>Limbrick</hi> ſide. I, with
what Force could be drawn together,
March'd to <hi>Killalow,</hi> and there En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped.
He kept a Guard on his ſide
the River, as I did againſt him at <hi>Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans-Bridge,</hi>
and Caſtle <hi>Conel.</hi> We lay
in this manner a long time: he attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
nothing either on the Town, or
River, which was not yet for deable in
any place.</p>
               <p>My Lord <hi>Deputy,</hi> being at <hi>Galway,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:101258:66"/>
ſent me a Letter in all haſt to come to
him. On my Arrival he told me, that
the <hi>Abbot of St. Katherine</hi> was in the
Harbour, and in his Company many
Officers with a quantity of Arms, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
and other Materials for War.
That they were ſent by the Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> who pretended by ſome
agreement to be <hi>Protector Royal</hi> of the
Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with Power over
all our Forces, and Places. And that
he was to continue that Title and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
till after the War ended, he
were reimburſt all his Expences; and
his Damages ſatisfied. I was much
ſtartled at this News. For though I
ſtrugled to keep up a Buſſel, I never
intended to buy it ſo dear as to give
Footing, or colour of Pretence or Title
to any Foreign Prince. And having
heard my Lord all out, I took the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ask him, how far he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this matter. He proteſted
before God, and upon his Honour,
that he never gave Commiſſion for any
ſuch Treaty: and, as to the thing he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101258:67"/>
knew no more than what he had told
me, other then that the <hi>General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
then ſitting in the Town, were in
great joy for this Succour, and preſt
him earneſtly for the reception. But
I found him entirely againſt it.</p>
               <p>Being thus ſatisfied, I deſired him to
leave the matter to me, and let me deal
with the Aſſembly. Immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I went and found them on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
To which in my time I ſpake,
and with much Deteſtation of the thing,
declared all Traytors that were for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this ſuccour on thoſe terms: and
that I would not ſit more to hear of this
Stuff, but return to my Forces, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what I had to do. My Lord <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty</hi>
was much pleaſed with this round
Diſcourſe: and publickly approved it.
So the Abbot with what he had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from whence he came.</p>
               <p>At my return (which was without
delay) to <hi>Killalow,</hi> I found all quiet.
And, whether <hi>Ireton</hi> had Information
of this Paſſage, I know not; but by a
Trumpet I received from him a long
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101258:67"/>
Letter, four ſides of Paper cloſe written
in a ſmall hand. The drift was, to ſet
forth the juſtneſs of the Parliaments
proceedings; their great Power;
how ſhort a time I could ſubſiſt; what
ill Company I was with, and threw
what durt he could on the King I ſerved,
but concluded with great value of my
perſon; pitying my Condition, and
offering me, that if I would retire and
live in <hi>England</hi> privately, I ſhould not
only enjoy my Eſtate, but remain in
ſafety with the eſteem and favour of the
Parliament. I immediately ſhewed this
Letter, to Father <hi>Peter Walſh,</hi> my
then Ghoſtly Father, whom I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found faithful to the King, and
a lover of his Country. With his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
by the ſame Trumpet, I anſwered
all his Points: and rejected his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
concerning my own perſon: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
him withal to ſend no more
Trumpets with ſuch Errands, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he would not have the Meſſenger
ill Treated. From this time there was an
end of all Meſſages and Letters between
us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:101258:68"/>
Now <hi>Ireton</hi> remained ſtill and quiet,
without any action or attempt, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the coming of Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> on
my back, or the fall of the River.
Both came together, and beſides that,
a third unlucky accident. For now
ſome days I had kept Guards towards
<hi>Conaught,</hi> when <hi>Ireton,</hi> by Treachery of
the Officer one Captain <hi>Kelly,</hi> made
himſelf Maſter of <hi>Bryans-Bridge.</hi> 'Tis
called ſo, though there be no Bridge.
Whilſt I was haſtening with ſome
Troops to oppoſe, having left the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Paſs at <hi>Killalow</hi> to Colonel
<hi>Fennel,</hi> he cowardly or Treacherouſly
quitted it, and with all his Party fled
into <hi>Limbrick.</hi> Where, upon the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Town, which was not
long after, <hi>Ireton</hi> with more than his
ordinary juſtice, hanged him. Some
ſay he was carried to <hi>Cork,</hi> and that it
was done there. He pleaded for his
Defence, not only this Service, but
how he had betrayed me before <hi>Toughal.</hi>
But his Judges would not hear him on
his Merit, but bid him clear himſelf
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101258:68"/>
of the Murders laid to his charge.</p>
               <p>Now receiving Letters from my Lord
<hi>Deputy,</hi> of Sir <hi>Charles Coots</hi> approach; I
haſtened to him with what Troops I had
left, <hi>viz.</hi> about three hundred Horſe, and
found him drawn into <hi>Loghreah</hi> with
his Forces, not being able to keep the
Field againſt <hi>Coot,</hi> who was twice his
number. The Enemy did not think fit
to attempt him, and were gone by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my coming. About this time
<hi>Athlone</hi> gave up to them: and ſo did
<hi>Limbrick</hi> to <hi>Ireton</hi> ſome few Months
after. In the mean while my Lord
<hi>Deputy</hi> and my ſelf, with what Troops
we had, retired towards <hi>Jerchonnoght,</hi>
under the Covert of the River that
runs by <hi>Galway:</hi> and ſo ſhifted up and
down, till Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> came before
the Town on <hi>Loghreahs</hi> ſide, and had
taken a Caſtle a little above on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Then we retired into <hi>Galway.</hi> Where
we had not long been, before we heard
of the Kings Defeat at <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man now would think, that this
Noble Lord had diſcharged his part. Yet
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101258:69"/>
his Zeal carried him farther. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch'd
me for <hi>France</hi> to the King, by
the way of <hi>Iniſſ-bofin</hi> for the River of
<hi>Galway</hi> was full of Parliament Ships)
with orders to ſet out the ill ſtate of his
Majeſties Affairs in that Kingdom. And
that nevertheleſs to ſerve his Majeſty, he
intended after <hi>Galway</hi> ſhould be loſt, to
make a Mountain War, and give the
Enemy trouble for ſome time; if his
Majeſty would but ſend him five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Barrels of Powder, with Match
and Bullets proportionable, and ſome
Arms, and appointed me to return with
them to <hi>Iniſs-bofin,</hi> a fit place for our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine:
it being a large Iſland, lying of
<hi>Jerchonnoght</hi> three Miles into the Sea;
in which we had a ſtrong Gariſon. 'Tis
ſurrounded with Rocks: and has but
one entrance; where there is a pretty
good Harbour for Frigats and ſmall
Men of War. I here Shipped my ſelf,
and landed at <hi>Breſt,</hi> ordering the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
that brought me to expect my
orders. The Captain was <hi>Antonio Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſipp</hi>
of <hi>Brugis.</hi> We had a ſharp fight
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101258:69"/>
with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that we met in
the way, but foul weather parted us.
No great hurt was done, other than
that the Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> was Killed in
the Cabbin, 'tis thought by the Wind
of the Bullet or Fear, for he had not
the leaſt ſign of any hurt, and lived
near a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Being Landed, I took poſt for St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi>
where I found the King, Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mother
and my Lord of <hi>Ormond.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
my Letters of Credit, and in a
day or two had my Audience. They
ſeemed to take it to heart, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
Cardinal <hi>Mazerine,</hi> and the chief
Miniſters. But the truth of it is, that
the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Affairs were at that
time ſo much in diſorder, by reaſon of
the Civil War, that nothing could be
done. Having this Anſwer, the King
gave me a Letter to my Lord <hi>Deputy,</hi>
acknowledging his good Service: or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
him that he ſhould make the
beſt conditions for himſelf and Party
that he could: and expect a better ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Having thus diſcharged my
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101258:70"/>
Commiſſion, I diſmiſs'd my Frigate:
and with the Kings permiſſion, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
my ſelf in the Service of the Prince
of <hi>Conde;</hi> who was then joyned with
the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> But firſt, I ſent by a
ſafe hand his Majeſties Letter away to
my good Lord of <hi>Clanrickard.</hi> Of
whom I have ſaid ſo much already, that
I need add nothing but my own eſteem
for his worthy Memory as a pattern of
Loyalty. Between my leaving him,
and his laying down Arms, I can give
no account; but have heard that he was
driven to great extremity.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It remains now, that I give thoſe
few Reflections more upon my ſelf,
which may let the Reader know, to
what, next God's bleſſing, I impute
that eſteem and fortune I had among
the Confederate Catholicks of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In my beginning I was a great Party<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
But conſidering my ſelf and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
but young beginners, I meddled
with nothing that was not almoſt ſure:
remembring that young Hawks muſt
be entred on weak game.</p>
               <p>Having Marſhal-law, it was certain
Death to take from any of our Friends
the worth of a Hen. But withal I had
care that my Soldiers ſhould not want.</p>
               <p>If any thing happen'd of that kind,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101258:71"/>
I ſent out a Party with a ſure Officer,
to bring in ſo many Beefs: and at his
return to tell me where he took 'em.
Then I iſſued my Order to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
to applot on the County or
Barony, from whence the cattle came,
their value, and immediately to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Owners; which was always
allowed out of their Contributions.
This I held conſtantly during the War.</p>
               <p>An other of my Rules, no leſs
punctually obſerved, was, That if by
accident any want fell out to be in the
Army, I kept no Table, and eat no
better than the Soldiers did. Though
otherwiſe, I did generally keep a good
Table: and my Officers were welcome
to me.</p>
               <p>I never took the worth of a crown
for my ſelf, either from Country-man,
Officer, or Soldier; but lived ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my bare Pay. Though the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
never ſtinted me; but left me at
liberty to take beſides, what I ſhould
think fit out of the Treaſure, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
March'd along with the Army,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101258:71"/>
and was diſpoſed of by my Orders.</p>
               <p>I was a good <hi>Providore,</hi> and had my
Magazines well furniſhed, and ſeated
as I was to make the War. For men
eat every day, but Fight ſeldom.</p>
               <p>My Soldiers I called my Children:
and really had a Fatherly love and care
for them. And they by their duty,
bravery, and affection, made me a full
return.</p>
               <p>I puniſht ſeverely; which made my Orders
to be well obſerv'd: and rewarded bountifully,
according to my power.</p>
               <p>If an Officer, or Soldier, had done a brave
Action: I treated the Officer ſome days at my
Table: and took all occaſions by talking to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his glory; and ſeldom either Officer, or
Soldier went without advancement, or other
reward.</p>
               <p>I made it my buſineſs always to March and
Encamp ſo, as not to be engag'd to Fight:
without an enemy would come on great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>My Intelligence and Spies coſt me very dear.
But I had good.</p>
               <p>Whenever I Fought, or had a mind to Fight;
coming in view of the Enemy, and being in
order of Battle, I rode to all the Battallions and
Squadrons, to obſerve their looks. And then,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101258:72"/>
with a cheerful countenance, acquainting them
them truly with what I knew of the Enemy,
and our Condition, I told them my own opinion
for Fighting: and, if they liked it, I would go
on; otherwiſe, not. This I did to engage them
in judgment, as well as duty.</p>
               <p>I made it my buſineſs to get my Troops
good Winter-Quarters. But, during the Field,
I was very ſtrict in my Muſters. And ever and
anon, being not in danger of an Enemy, I made
the Battallions and Squadrons March by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies:
that I might know their number juſt.
For a General will be cozen'd if he brings his
men to Fight on ſworn Relations.</p>
               <p>I ſuffer'd no Officer to take from a Soldier
the worth of a penny. I do not remember, that,
during the time I ſerv'd the Conſederate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
they ever gave me any Inſtructions
what I ſhould do; but left all to my ſelf. Which
made their buſineſs go the better.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now conclude theſe Reflections, with
the greateſt Reflection of all, which is on my infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
obligation to Almighty God; who hath ſo
protected me, that to this hour, neither in thoſe
Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any other that I have been in
ſince, either Army, or Party of Army, great, or
ſmall, was ever beaten ſo by an Enemy, as to loſe
their ground to the end of the Fight, where I
Commanded in Chief.</p>
