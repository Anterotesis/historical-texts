            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A Prince, who with the ſame ſpirit and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection led his People in their <hi>Battels,</hi> and in all

their Acts of Worſhip and <hi>Religion;</hi> Went In and Out before the Congregation as conſtantly to the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> as the <hi>Camp.</hi> And therefore, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Books of the Old Teſtament (a good part whereof are but <hi>Davids</hi> Commentaries, ſhort and ſummary Memorials of his glorious Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,) afford matter enough for the admiration of Captains and Commanders in War: So is his Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> a rich Treaſure and Magazine of Heavenly Meditations, where every Pious Soul may find ſomewhat ſuited to its condition, fit to aſſiſt its infirmities, and improve it's Graces. If we can, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> adviſeth, form our ſouls <note place="margin">In Pſal. 30.</note> by the affection of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> tune our hearts to the <hi>Aire</hi> and ſpirit of <hi>Davids</hi> raptures, we ſhall meet in theſe Divine Compoſitions, that which is able to kindle Zeal, inflame Love, mellow and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate holy Sorrow for ſin; to give Wings to our Prayers, and carry our Petitions with ſpeed and force into Heaven; to animate and enliven our Praiſes, and make our <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> like thoſe of Angels and Beatified Spirits; To actuate all the good Reſolutions which any of theſe Affections, our Love, our Fear, the ſenſe of our own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, or Gods abundant Mercies, have begun in our hearts.</p>
            <p>In ſuch plenty and variety, I could not be long to ſeek for words proper to our preſent occaſion: And ſuch will this Pſalm appear to be; A <hi>Pſalm</hi>

of <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> ſo the TITLE calls it, teaching us in few words how we ought to demean our ſelves in a <hi>War,</hi> for the procuring good ſucceſs to our Armies, and making that ſucceſs happy to us when we have obtained it.</p>
            <p>In the three firſt Verſes, <hi>David</hi> being ſought for by his Enemies (as we lately were by ours) <hi>prayes againſt them;</hi> That was his <hi>Courſe;</hi> He always began his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with God, contending and wreſtling with Him for a bleſſing and aſſiſtance. He durſt not lift up his hands even againſt the Enemies of God (yet what durſt not <hi>David</hi> do?) till he had firſt lifted them up in humble Supplication to the Lord his ſtrength, <hi>Who taught his hands to war, and his fingers to fight.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 144. 1.</note> This being done, his Courage breaks out like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he doubts not of <hi>ſlaying</hi> his <hi>Thouſands</hi> and <hi>Ten Thouſands.</hi> So in the <hi>4th.</hi> and <hi>5th.</hi> Verſes, he becomes his own Prophet, promiſing himſelf Victory. For who can reſiſt him, who hath <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence</hi> for his Second? Or how can any Enemy maintain a Fight againſt that Captain, who hath before-hand defeated and broken their Forces by his Prayers, aſſur'd his Conqueſt before he put on his Armor. Then in the laſt Verſes, which are my Text, <hi>David</hi> concludes where he began, thankfully acknowledgeth Gods goodneſs in his Deliverance, and the Diſſipation of his Enemies, obliging himſelf to a return of dutifull affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſervice, in conſideration of ſo great Mercies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93430:4"/>
received; and thoſe, as they are the eſſential parts of a <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> ſo ſhall they be of my <hi>Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will begin with that which is firſt in the order of nature, though laſt in the words; The <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,</hi> which is <hi>double;</hi> of the <hi>Benefit,</hi> and the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:</hi> The <hi>Benefit</hi> is likewiſe <hi>two-fold,</hi> conſiſting of a <hi>Deliverance</hi> and a <hi>Victory: David</hi> is delivered from all his trouble, all the treacherous plots and attempts of his Adverſaries; And <hi>his eye hath ſeen his deſire upon thoſe Adverſaries;</hi> and of all this, <hi>God</hi> is confeſſed the ſole Author. <hi>He hath delivered me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Am to begin with the <hi>Benefit</hi> acknowledged, and with that part of it which is here called <hi>Deliverance;</hi> and that being in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, not a <hi>Reſcue</hi> from actual miſchief or diſtreſs, but only a diverſion of a <hi>Danger</hi> coming toward him, is ſuch a <hi>Negative mercy,</hi> as we ſeldom trouble our ſelves to conſider, much leſs to acknowledge and give thanks for: How many hundreds of Perils hath every one of us eſcaped, in our Perſons, Fame, and Fortunes, which we never dreamt of? The watchful Providence of God maintaining a continual guard over us, waking and caring for our good, while we ſleep, and perhaps neglect both our ſelves and him that keeps us. Would we but meditate a little upon the infinite accidents oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the courſe of things, the infirmities of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93430:4"/>
our natural frame and temper, with the nice and curious contexture of our parts, the conſequences of our Diſorders, the malice of our enemies, and of the Devil; all or any of which, may eaſily ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our days, or make them miſerable: And from hence admit theſe two evident <hi>Deductions;</hi> 1. That in this eſtate it is morally impoſſible for a man to continue <hi>one</hi> day, were not the goodneſs of God particularly intent upon his Preſervation. 2. That it is a double mercy to be kept from <hi>danger,</hi> and from the <hi>knowledge</hi> of it too: Becauſe had we a diſtinct apprehenſion of all the evils to which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, our fear and ſollicitude muſt needs be a continual rack and torment to our Souls: This contemplation would (I aſſure my ſelf) cauſe every Perſon here preſent to add in his private <hi>Cloſet-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions</hi> one new <hi>Laud</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> to God for his Deliverance from the Dangers which he never thought of. But how little ſoever we are affected with theſe unknown Perils and Eſcapes, wherein our eye is not ſharp enough to diſcern the <hi>ſmall thred</hi> by which a <hi>Calamity</hi> hangs over us, or the <hi>hand</hi> that holds it from falling on our heads: Yet when a conſiderable Danger comes cloſe, and ſtares us in the face, when the Clouds gather apace, and the sky looks black about us, then we apprehend a Storm, and bethink us of a ſhelter and retreat: When death ſurrounds us, when the <hi>Peſtilence walks in darkneſs,</hi> and the ſword <hi>deſtroyes at noon day,</hi> caſting down <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93430:5"/>
beſides us,</hi> and <hi>Ten thouſands at our right hand,</hi> then <hi>Qui habitat in adjutorio,</hi> is a ſeaſonable <hi>Hymn:</hi> Then 'tis a valuable Priviledge to retain unto Providence, and have an Intereſt in Gods favor, that he may defend us <hi>under his wings, and we may be ſafe under his feathers.</hi> 'Tis great pitty that after ſuch convictions, <note place="margin">Pſal. 91.</note> ſo devout Applications and faſtning of our Souls unto the hand of God, we ſhould <hi>ſtart like broken bowes;</hi> fall off again from the confeſſed Anchor of our hope: When God ſays <hi>to the Deſtroying Angel, It is enough,</hi> that we ſhould ſay ſo to our ſelves too: If he ſtrike, or our enemies threaten no longer, that we neither pray, nor repent, or praiſe any longer: But as ſoon as ever the skie clears up, and <hi>the light of Gods countenance breaks through,</hi> and diſpells the clouds which had begirt us, the very thought of what hath paſt, ſhould in the ſame moment blow away likewiſe, and we forget that ever we had need of Gods protection, or that he interpoſed to deliver us. <hi>David</hi> did not ſo, he hid himſelf in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> the <hi>Ziphites</hi> bordering upon his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſcover him to <hi>Saul,</hi> who comes with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſeiſe him, but is diverted and drawn back again by the <hi>invaſion</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtines: David</hi> could not let ſuch a preſervation paſs, without compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this <hi>Pſalm</hi> before us in memory of it, as he hath done divers other upon the like occaſions, that there may remain an Eternal Monument of his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dutiful reſenting God Bleſſings; an indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93430:5"/>
Record and Character of a generous grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which is always paying, and yet always owing, and charging it ſelf with what it payes. All this hath been ſaid, becauſe I doubt not but the great <hi>Deliverance</hi> we <hi>now</hi> celebrate, had many Deliverances in it which we know not; And I fear, leſt we forget ere long thoſe which we do this day own and acknowledge, as we have already too apparently done the <hi>ſtupendious</hi> occaſions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Thankſgivings.</hi> Queſtionleſs, ſome miſchiefs were projected, which have eſcaped the vigilance and ſagacity of thoſe who diſquiet themſelves to preſerve our ſecurity: And ſome have been pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by their wiſdome, which we of the <hi>many</hi> have no ſenſe of. From all theſe we are freed, (for a while at leaſt) and therefore they ought all to be put upon the account, that our <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> may be compleat and commenſurate to its Cauſes; for otherwiſe, there is enough in our open direct Deliverance, to take up all our Affections, and exerciſe all our Faculties in the beſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments we can make.</p>
            <p>To conceive it aright, take this <hi>obvious</hi> Truth into your thoughts, That <hi>the greateſt Preparations imaginable may be defeated;</hi> the moſt formidable ſtrength may be diſordered and broken by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſlight accidents. Conſider, when two <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> meet in the Field, how little inconſiderable things (impoſſible to be prevented or foreſeen)

oftentimes turn the <hi>Scale,</hi> and caſt the main iſſue and ſucceſs of a Battel beyond all recovery. And then, contemplate the Fortunes of a Nation put into <hi>Planks</hi> of a few inches thick, expoſed to wind and weather, to the mercy of the Sea, and the danger of their own Proviſions, which <hi>one</hi> ſpark of <gap reason="illegible: deleted" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And (ſuppoſe theſe various hazards avoided, yet) a Force equal to Themſelves muſt be encountred upon ſo unfaithful footing as the face of the <hi>Ocean</hi> affords: Then tell me, whether to come off ſafe from ſo dreadfull an adventure, be not a Deliverance for which we ought (in the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> Phraſe) <hi>to rejoyce with trembling? Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. If you ſay, that <hi>every Ship</hi> is a diſtinct and ſeveral <hi>Caſtle,</hi> a new Fort, which will endure a Battery and Siege by it ſelf; and therefore thoſe diſmal <hi>Routs,</hi> which upon the miſcarriage of <hi>one</hi> Troop, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ruine Land Armies, are not to be feared in a <hi>Navy,</hi> which can diſpute a Victory ſo often over: I muſt return, that we had ſo much of our Intereſt in one Bottome, that we might have bin undone at a <hi>Blow:</hi> I need not ſuppoſe ſuch a ſhot as fired the Enemies <hi>Admiral:</hi> That cruel Bullet, which took off thoſe brave <hi>Noble Perſons,</hi> and came ſo near a <hi>Royal one,</hi> hath taught me, that to be preſerved from ſuch a Danger, to be delivered from all our <hi>Trouble,</hi> eaſed of all our anxieties and pangs of ſoul in ſo deep a Concern, and with no

            <p>Before I ſpeak of the Parts by themſelves, give me leave, by the way, to obſerve, That even in that <hi>Oeconomy</hi> wherein God deſcended to a minute-preſcription of every part and circumſtance of his worſhip: Yet he left room and invitation for ſome <hi>ſervices</hi> to be <hi>voluntarily</hi> and freely performed, as the inſtinct of their own devotion ſhould prompt them to it; which muſt make it ſtrange, that any ſhould affirm it unlawful for the Chriſtian Church, which is in that behalf left ſo much at liberty and diſcretion, to ſerve God with any thing which is not by himſelf enjoyned; and withal, put us in minde, that although (God knows) we are all far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to accompliſh the whole of what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us: Yet he muſt be a very ſtupid obſerver of Gods mercies, or his own need of them, who ſhall not ſometime finde a warmth and zeal exciting him to particular expreſſions of his love to God, and ſorrow for ſin, in inſtances not <hi>expreſly</hi> commanded, but flowing from the abundance of his own heart: And if ever that be fit for us, it is certainly moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming upon <hi>ſuch great</hi> occaſions as now, when God hath poured out the riches and treaſures of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſo abundantly upon us. For all which we cannot but of our penury return him ſome <hi>Mites;</hi> poor, but hearty <hi>Oblations</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> which the ſame Goodneſs that calls for them, will alſo accept.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93430:14"/>
I begin with our Praiſes and Thankſgivings; and to that part of our return, methinks we ſhould ſoon be perſwaded; it being ſo eaſie and ſo cheap a ſervice, to ſpeak well and honorably of him that is all Good, will coſt us no labor or ſtudy; the ſubject will looſe the ſtrings of our Tongues and make us eloquent. And to offer him the <hi>Calves of our lips</hi> will coſt us <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 2.</note> no money: If our <hi>Praiſes may aſcend as Incenſe,</hi> and the lifting up our voice be an acceptable <hi>Evening Sacrifice,</hi> the thriftieſt Votary will afford God ſo much.</p>

contradiction, as I can find no name bad enough to call it by: This will put you to it, and diſcover whether you believe your ſelves, when you profeſs to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your Victory from God; if it be his gift it muſt be received with Reverence, and entertained with Spiritual Holy rejoycing; not Senſual Revellings, and Bacchanal Rites: If you think God the Author of all your ſucceſs, you will ſo comport your ſelves, as that he may continue and increaſe his favor to you; you know the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> tells you, there were ſome perſons on whom Chriſt could not do ſo many <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> as he <hi>would,</hi> becauſe <hi>of their indiſpoſition:</hi> And <note place="margin">Marc. 6. 5.</note> I muſt tell you, we may ſo indiſpoſe our ſelves, as that God cannot do us the good he deſires; mercy it ſelf will reſtrain him, becauſe it would be cruelty, not kindneſs, to caſt away bleſſings on thoſe who abuſe them to their hurt, corrupt and envenome his grace by turning it into wantonneſs. But that I may not ſeem too ſevere, I will ſhew you how you may ſafely let your affections looſe without danger of exceſs or intemperance, and profitably ſpend what I deſire you to ſpare; make that a ſweet ſmelling Sacrifice to God, which otherwiſe might provoke his wrath, by being a fuel to your ſin: It is by perfecting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the Free-will-offering in my Text, adding the <hi>Oblation</hi> to the Praiſe and Thankſgiving.

THe <hi>Free-will Offering</hi> was part given to God, and part ſpent in feſtival entertainment of Men. For Gods part, perhaps, you will think your ſelves ſecure, and well diſcharged of it, becauſe all Sacrifices are aboliſhed under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. 'Tis true, all the Ceremonial Typical Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the <hi>Law</hi> are ſo: But why ſuch an Act of Natural Religion, as preſenting God with ſome part of the good things he hath given us, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his bounty, and as an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Thankfulneſs, ſhould be thought a piece of antiquated <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> I know not; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if we conſider, that <hi>Abel</hi> offered ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and God accepted it, many Ages before he ſpake any thing to the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And we Chriſtians have ſo much more to thank God for then they had who lived before or under the Law. Certainly, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to ſerve God with all our heart, and all our ſtrength, meant not to interdict our ſerving him with ſome part of our ſubſtance. Surely, the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> thought ſo, who in their Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> made always an Oblation in <hi>Kind,</hi> of Bread and Wine, and other Proviſions; part whereof was conſecrated for the Sacrament, and part eaten in a common Feaſt of Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. And we ſtill, as far as we obey the Commands of the Church, preſerve ſome

footſteps of this Practice, in our offering for the uſe of the <hi>Poor</hi> (in whom God's hand is every where held out to receive our free-will Offerings) before the <hi>Communion.</hi> But not to enter into new occaſion of Diſcourſe in the end of my Sermon: We know that God, even when he commanded <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> regarded them not for themſelves, as the Prophets often tell the <hi>Jews;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> himſelf <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. very particularly rejects them all: But in the ſame <hi>Pſalm</hi> tells us what Offerings God will always be delighted with, <hi>Offer unto God thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and pay thy Vows.</hi> Thanks and Praiſes will <note place="margin">Verſe 14. 23</note> be an acceptable honour, and ordering our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation aright will procure Salvation: Which the <hi>Chaldee paraphraſeth</hi> thus; <hi>Repreſs thy evil deſire, and it ſhall be accepted as a Sacrifice of Confeſſion.</hi> To mortifie a <hi>Luſt,</hi> is to ſlay a <hi>Goat,</hi> and more. To lay your hand upon a brutiſh Affection, as they did theirs upon a Beaſt, devoutly giving it up, abandoning it freely for Gods ſake, is the nobleſt Wave-offering imaginable. This is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to <hi>preſent your ſelves a lively Sacrifice, holy, accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto God, which is a reaſonable</hi> Chriſtian <hi>ſervice,</hi>

make your Charity ſwell, and over-flow thoſe banks wherewith avarice and hard-heartedneſs uſe to incloſe it; and that no man will go <hi>out</hi> of Town without leaving a Bleſſing behind him, that he may carry one with him.</p>
