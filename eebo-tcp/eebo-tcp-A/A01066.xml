            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Early the next morning, <hi>Dionisius</hi> attended by his noble men, rode forth to m√©ete the Prince, some thr√©e miles from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whome he most louingly imbraced, and welcommed with exc√©eding courtesie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> maruelling at this vnexpected kindnesse in him, said: Most high and magnificent King, I being altogether vnworthy of this your exc√©eding fauour, most humbly intreate your pardon to my presumption, desiring you to impute my rashnesse to my youth, which hath attempted this boldnesse, without any hope in the least degr√©e how to deserue such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> taking him by the hand, desired him to leaue off those sp√©eches, for that h√©e est√©emed his Court and Countrey insufficent to entertaine him according as h√©e desired, telling him that h√©e was the most welcome guest to his Court, that might be: wherewith they ioyfully departed towardes the Cittie, but as they roade, they heard a most gr√©euous grone in the Thicket of a Woode hard by. Whereupon <hi>Dionisius</hi> commaunded his Knightes to beset the Wood on euery side, himselfe, <hi>Parismus,</hi> and diuers Noble men, entered the Thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, where they found an Armed Knight most grieuously wounded: At which pittifull spectacle, <hi>Dionisius</hi> alighted from his Horse, viewed his face, and knew him to be his trustie Knight <hi>Osiris,</hi> whome h√©e most dearely loued. Wherefore h√©e commaunded him to bee conueyed to the Court, that his owne Phisitians might looke to him, and binde vp his wounds.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time the King, <hi>Parismus,</hi> and diuers Knightes, made diligent searche in the wood, but coulde finde no creature there, and thereby no certaintie how <hi>Osiris</hi> should be thus wounded. That departing discontented, the
<pb facs="tcp:16915:6"/>
King was certified that there was great hope of his recouery, who speaking to <hi>Parismus,</hi> said; Most noble Prince, I hope this mischaunce hath not disquieted you, for I would be sorie you should conceiue any occasion of sadnesse thereat, but I trust by that time <hi>Osiris</hi> be recouered, w√©e shall easily come to the knowledge hereof.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, replied <hi>Parismus,</hi> I haue no cause to be gr√©eued for my part, but to see your Maiestie hereby disquieted. Ind√©ed said <hi>Dionisius,</hi> it some what gr√©eueth me, because <hi>Osiris</hi> is one that I loue, being well worthy thereof, for his vertues do farre exc√©ed many mens, of whose faith and fidelitie I haue had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient triall, that a more loyall Knight cannot be found. By this time they were come to the Pallace gate, where was the Qu√©ene with all her traine of Ladies, to welcome <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> which was a most pleasing sight to beholde, that the Prince with the suddaine viewe of theyr beautie, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into a d√©epe studie, from which h√©e was reuiued by the Qu√©ene, who most gratiously welcommed him, saying: In all kindnesse, I bid your honour welcome into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> where we will indeuour to requite your friendship in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to vs.</p>
                     <p>Most vertuous Qu√©ene (quoth h√©e) for this your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fauour, both my selfe and all that is mine, shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bound to do you dutifull seruice. The glory of the Pallace made <hi>Parismus</hi> maruaile, this honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, the sumptuous banquets, the rare Musick, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant showes, too tedious to rehearse, made him thinke that Fame had altogether darkened the glory of that place, that all his sences were replenisht with varietie of delight.</p>
                     <p>At such time as <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and the Prince, entered the Court, <hi>Laurana,</hi> hearing of the Princes comming, standing at her Chamber windowe, viewed them well, and knew, or at least thought that to be <hi>Parismus,</hi> that came with her father, noting well his gallant &amp; comely proportion, said to one of her maides named <hi>Leda,</hi> Is not yonder Knight that accompaineth my

Why quoth <hi>Laurana,</hi> this Court cannot long containe such guests: wherewithall she went to dinner, f√©eling a kinde of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in al her parts, which s√©emed strange to her, for euen then loue began to kindle in her tender heart, which yet shee did not well vnderstand, but afterwards grewe to a burning heate, as shall be declared.

                     <p>To relate the conference the King and <hi>Parismus</hi> had, were tedious, and imperitinent to the Historie.

At last reuiuing his sences that were dulled with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, h√©e suddenly sighed, and smiling said (fearing his heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had bene noted) your Maiestie may peraduenture note my sadnesse: the remembrance of your Knights iniury, maketh me study how he should be so gr√©euously wounded, and no man found that should act the same (which words h√©e onely spake to excuse himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Surely answered the King, some man by secret treachery hath wrought him that harme, which at more conuenient time we shall finde the truth thereof, which I would effect with all sp√©ed, but that I hope to be ascertained by himselfe, whom my Physitions say is in good estate of amendment. With these and

many other sp√©eches. Dinner being fully ended, <hi>Dionisius, Parismus,</hi> and the Qu√©ene, walked into a most pleasant Garden, where after a while he was entertained with a most costly and rare banquet, prouided in an Arbour or banqueting House, adioyning to a Groue fraught with many pleasant Birds, whose sw√©ete har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie much augmented the pleasure of the place, all things being most artificially contriued for delight, which when <hi>Parismus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, hee then began to thinke with himselfe, how shall I s√©e the Princesse <hi>Laurana,</hi> for whose sight I haue vndertaken this trauell, whose delightfull presence shall refresh my tired sences, and expell those inward cares wherewith I am thus perplexed. But when he sawe none but the King and Qu√©ene, h√©e was much troubled in his minde, to thinke what might be the cause, that th√©e whose fame had long since come to his knowledge, was not to be s√©ene, that by constrained mirth, h√©e past away the time in such Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and other pastime, as the King entertained him withal, which were such, as he much wondred at. And night being come, with all statelinesse that might be, h√©e was by them conducted to his Lodging, which was most sumptuously adorned with most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and rich hangings, that the place s√©emed a new Paradice, for there wanted nothing that might either delight the eare or eye. Lodgings for his Noblemen, Knights and seruants, were placed in such manner, that they s√©emed by their scituation to be gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to their Lords person: hauing then taken his leaue of the King and Qu√©ene, he betooke himselfe to his rest.</p>

                     </argument>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter <hi>Parismus</hi> was come to his Chamber, hee called to him <hi>Oristus,</hi> the onely man whome he trusted, and asked him how h√©e liked the Court of <hi>Dionisius.</hi> My Lord (quoth h√©e) the small continuance I haue had therein, might be suficient to excuse me from sensuring thereof, but to satisfie your demaund, I doe est√©eme and thinke of it, as a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, and Honorable place. But said <hi>Parismus,</hi> what if thy Lord shal here purchase that which shal be worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> death vnto him, vnlesse hee haue remedie? what wouldest thou then thinke? I would my Lord said he, speake my opinion, if I knewe whence the originall of that euill should proc√©ede. From my selfe said <hi>Parismus,</hi> for thus it is. Thou I am sure hast heard of the renowned <hi>Lauarana,</hi> and of the Hnoourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that is spred of her Beautie and vertues, which driueth me into manifolde thoughts, because I cannot beholde that beautie, therefore I impart my minde to thee, as to the onely man I trust, that vnlesse I can by thy meanes haue some hope of comfort, I will both curse the houre of my Natiuitie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine hereafter in continuall griefe: therefore counsell mee what I were best to doe herein.</p>
                     <p>My Lord saide <hi>Oristus,</hi> since it pleaseth your Highnesse so much to fauour me, as to chuse mee to be your ayde herein, I wil most faithfully, &amp; speedily, do to my vttermost to accomplish

your desire. I pray th√©e then doo it, said <hi>Parismus,</hi> with all speeds, for my restlesse passions require counsaile. I haue, said <hi>Oristus,</hi> some acquaintance with Lord <hi>Remus,</hi> who is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fauoured of the King, continually Resident in the Court, and well beloued of all, by whose meanes I do not doubt, but both to haue some certain knowledge of the Princes, as also soone to bring you to her speech, &amp; according as you haue put me in trust, so I will vse all the meanes I can to purchase your content.</p>

so that I thought if my dutie to k√©epe him from better studies, with my homely talke: so th√©e kindly saluting them, told <hi>Oris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> he was welcome to her fathers court, and therewith depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Quoth <hi>Oristus,</hi> My Lord, is this the Princes <hi>Laurana,</hi> of whome I haue heard such rare commendations in <hi>Bohemia?</hi> it is said h√©e, the very same, and the most vertuous and courteous Lady that liueth this day, who very seldome commeth abroad, but continually giueth her mind to practise excellent qualities, amongst other vertuous Ladies. During this there talke, they had walked about the Place, to the end that <hi>Oristus</hi> might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the statelynesse thereof, who hauing s√©ene all things, and knowing which was <hi>Lauranas,</hi> lodging, was in some measure comforted by that knowledge. Thus the day being spent, and the King returned from hunting, <hi>Parismus</hi> came to <hi>Oristus,</hi> and required of him if h√©e had heard of <hi>Laurana,</hi> and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort there was for him. My Lord (quoth he) I haue beheld her, and heard her heauenly voyce, which is able to astonish any man with her exceeding beautie, relating vnto him all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference h√©e had with the Lord <hi>Remus,</hi> which did greatly reioyce him to heare, and so betooke himselfe to his rest, where he spent the most part of the night, in meditating how to come to talke, or haue a sight of her. Uery early the next morning, taking a booke in his hand, h√©e went into the Garden that was vnder <hi>Lauranas</hi> Chamber window, where hauing walked a while, hee spied her looking out, that h√©e stood as one halfe amazed to behold her wonderfull beautie, for though h√©e had neuer s√©ene her before, yet his fancie perswaded him it was shee, which perceiuing, slipping backe, called <hi>Leda</hi> vnder her, asking herif shee knewe the Knight that walked vnder her windowe, who certified her it was the Prince of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> whereat <hi>Laurana</hi> blusht so exc√©edingly, that her heart s√©emed to leape within her, then secretly looking out, she diligently beheld him, taking such general view of his comelinesse, that presently her fancie began to commend his person f√©eling in her selte a kinde of delight to behold him: but <hi>Parismus</hi> s√©eing her gone, began to reprous

I cannot protest, but performe the part of a faithfull seruant, my true heart shal not harbour vntrouth, but I rest yours, to preserue or destroy. If your excellency would admit that I might come to speake with you, then would I giue you farther assurance of my fidelitie, which if you vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to graunt, it shall be no way to your disparagement: and as from your selfe I first receiued my wounde of disquiet, so let your clemencie saue my perplexed miserie. And thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting with this poore paper my life, into your custodie, I cease.</p>

When <hi>Laurana</hi> had read the Letter, shee began to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with her selfe how shee should accomplish his request, in such sort, that it might no way blemish her honour, nor giue him cause to suspect that she were light, to be so easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for shee esteemed her credit more then her life, and his loue more then both. At last shee resolued to answer his Letter, and giue directions to <hi>Leda</hi> how he should come to talke with her, and no man priuy thereto but themselues: and calling <hi>Leda,</hi> told her that shee should deliuer the answer to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Letter, and withall this message. That if hee would take the paines the next night, he should finde her in the Arbour at the farther end of the Garden, that was vnder the window, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight, vpon condition that her maide <hi>Leda</hi> might be with her, and that hee should bring no man with him, for that he might easily come thither without danger. <hi>Leda</hi> being vp earely, hyed her with all speed to <hi>Parismus</hi> Chamber, where being come, shee deliuered the message <hi>Laurana</hi> gaue her in charge, which reioiced <hi>Parismus</hi> to heare, and withall the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Letter, which when hee had receiued, at the first he was vnwilling to teare the Seale that her sweet hand had impressed: oft viewing the superscription, but hoping the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents within would bring more ease to his heart, then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view, he opened the same, and read as followeth.</p>

Thus spending the day which he thought to be longer then three daies, he againe returned to his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber, esteeming the time too long, and a thousand times wishing the approach of the appointed houre. <hi>Laurana</hi> in the meane time, being not vnmindfull of her promise, only with <hi>Leda</hi> was gon down into the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, by a doore that opened out of her lodging: where being come, <hi>Scinthias</hi> was proud to giue light vnto her maiesticall presence, and by the cleerenesse of her splendor, had any beheld her, she might haue beene esteemed to surpasse the comelinesse of <hi>Diana,</hi> walking in her chaste conceits.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:16"/>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> somewhat before the houre, was likewise gone forth in his night gowne, with his sword vnder his arme, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the gate hee was wont to goe in at into the Gardeine, found it shut, and hauing no others meanes, hee gotte ouer the wall, and was gotten into a secret place to entertaine loue with a surfetting delight: but when hee beheld his diuine Goddesse enter into the Arbour, his heart was so surprised with ioy, with her presence, that at his comming to her, he could not vtter a word, but with great reuerence taking her tenderly by the soft hand, which he was afraid to touch without her leaue, at last he said, Most vertuous Lady, since it hath pleased you to grant me this exc√©edsng fauour, I here vowe, that I will not speake a word, nor do any thing that shall not accord with your minde. My Lord, said <hi>Laurana,</hi> had I not presumed vpon your vertue, I would not thus haue come hither. Which kinde sp√©ech, so much imboldned <hi>Parismus,</hi> that he imbraced her in his armes and kist her, and sitting downe together, folded each in the others armes. <hi>Parismus</hi> began to recount vnto her his loue, and how that his comming to <hi>Thessaly,</hi> was onely to doo her seruice, vowing neuer to depart if she would not accept him for her poore seruant: with many other kind protestations proc√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from his vnfained affection, that <hi>Laurana</hi> being wounded with his intreaties, could not chuse but accept of his loue, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these speeches.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, for that I am perswaded of the constancy of your loue, and for that you vouchsafe to profer such kindnesse to me that haue not deserued the same, I will manifest that which rather I should conceale, for that you may suppose my y√©elding so soone, might proceed of light bred affection: but my Lord, I assure you, that at such time as I sawe you comming first into this Court, my heart was then suprised, (procured as I thinke by the Destinies) that euer since I haue vowed to rest yours assured to commaund, so that you way pretend my wrong: and therefore committing all that is mine to giue into your handes, I here giue you affurance of truth, and true constant
<pb facs="tcp:16915:16"/>
loue. Thus they spent the night in kinde salutations and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous imbracings, to the vnspeakeable ioy and comfort of them both. <hi>Leda</hi> all this while walking about the gardens, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looking about her, espied a light in <hi>Oliuiaes</hi> Chamber, whereof shee gaue those two Louers intelligence. <hi>Parismus</hi> thought that newes vnwelcome, whereby being compelled to depart, which was done with much heauinesse, <hi>Parismus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to know, when shee would vouchsafe him her presence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which shee told him should be at his appointment, for that she now was his to dispose of: so with many a sweet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing they parted. <hi>Laurana</hi> going into her chamber said, in that she had so soone lost his companie, and could not tell what misfortune might befall him, and glad in heart to recount and think of his passed promise. <hi>Parismus</hi> quickly got ouer the wal, and was soone safely come to his chamber, where he recounted to <hi>Oristus</hi> his happy successe in loue, asking his counsell how hee might procure <hi>Dionisius</hi> good liking, to effect the mariage betwixt them, which first he thought to motion himselfe, then he thought that <hi>Dionisius</hi> would not like thereof, without the consent of his father first had, and also might blame <hi>Laurana</hi> of vndutifulnesse, if he knew it were with her priuity. Againe he thought it best to send <hi>Oristus</hi> into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to giue his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge thereof, and to entreat him to send Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to that effect. Contrarily, he thought that in the meane time, some other of greater birth then himselfe, might demand her in marriage of the King, and so haue the first grant, though he were sufficiently assured that <hi>Laurana</hi> should neuer yeelde her consent. Being in this perplexity, he could not resolue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing, but walking in the garden to ease his heart with some recreation, he met the King, with him were the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Sicanus,</hi> sonne to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> though vnknown. The King for the more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble entertainment of his guests, made one most royall banquet for all in general: the Qu√©en, &amp; a gallant traine of beautifull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, were there likewise, which was not a custome amongst
<pb facs="tcp:16915:17"/>
the rest: it fell so out, that <hi>Parismus</hi> was seated right opposite to the Princesse <hi>Laurana,</hi> which agreed to his hearts desire, wherby he had meanes to satisfie himselfe with beholding that inestimable Iewell, which as farre excelled all the rest of the Ladies as the Sunne doth the Moone, or white his contrary: who with such comely modesty behaued her self, that her looke did rightly resemble a countenance ful of mild, vertuous pitty, able to rauish a multitude, being also not a little glad, that she had occasion to bestowe a kind looke on her <hi>Parismus. Sicanus</hi> more narrowly marked <hi>Lauranaes</hi> behauiour then any other, because his comming was onely to request her in marriage of her father, and though both the young Princes were very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect: yet <hi>Sicanus</hi> curious eye, found, or at lest suspected, that there was some loue betwixt them, which they full little thought of, hauing their hearts busied with more pleasant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations: and euer after that, <hi>Sicanus</hi> inwardly malised <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus</hi> in his heart.</p>
                     <p>Dinner being ended, the Knights spent some part of the afternoone in dauncing, when being ended, euery man betooke himselfe to what exercise liked him best. <hi>Dionisius</hi> and Lord <hi>Remus,</hi> accompanied the Princesse <hi>Laurana,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Isabella,</hi> to their lodgings, which made <hi>Sicanus</hi> to fret inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to thinke that <hi>Parismus</hi> his onely enemy as he thought, had gotten such possession in <hi>Lauranaes</hi> loue, which might debarre him of his wished hope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> s√©eing Lord <hi>Remus</hi> talking to <hi>Isabella,</hi> saluted <hi>Laurana</hi> with these speeches: My deare Lady, although I confesse my selfe farre vnworthy that kindnesse you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted me, yet I humbly request one farther fauour at your hands, which is, that you would vouchsafe to meet me tomorrow night, in that happy place where I receiued the first assurance of your comfortable kindnesse, for my passions are so extreame, that my life would perish, were it not onely maintained by enioying your loue, where I would impart a secret to you, that now I haue no time to vtter.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:17"/>
My Lord said <hi>Laurana,</hi> you need not vse such intreaties to her, that is not vnwilling, neither hath she power to deny your request. The Queen comming into the place where they were, caused <hi>Parismus</hi> with a heauy sigh to depart, and Lord <hi>Remus</hi> with him, betwixt whom there began a firme league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Now Lord <hi>Remus</hi> beare great affection to the Lady <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> and had oftentimes solicited his suit vnto her, which she in a manner yeelded vnto, which made <hi>Parismus</hi> the rather chuse him for his companion, by k√©eping him company, to haue the oftner accesse vnto <hi>Laurana.</hi> The King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Sicanus,</hi> were walked into the Garden, where they were encountred by the king, vnto whom the king of <hi>Hungaria</hi> began to declare how that the Prince of <hi>Sparta</hi> and himselfe had a matter to treate with his Maiestie, if hee would vouchsafe them audience, from the mighty King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who hauing a great desire to be allyed to him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hard manifold reports of the vertuous <hi>Laurana,</hi> had sent them to intreat a marriage betwixt her and <hi>Sicanus,</hi> his sonne and heire of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was there present with them, though vntill this time vnwilling to make himselfe known. <hi>Dionisius</hi> most kindly embraced him, telling him, that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe much honoured with his company, and that since it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his father to treat of alliance betwixt them, he would giue his consent willingly, so that he would first get his daughters good will, whom he would not willingly match contrary to her liking, promising to vse his commandement vnto her for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof. For which <hi>Sicanus</hi> thanked him. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing spent the day in this and such like talke, supper was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: which being ended, they betooke themselues to their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Laurana,</hi> my chiefest care is, to s√©e thee married according to thy state, which hath made me send for thee, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thou hast already placed thy affection or no: otherwise there is come into this Country, a King of great estate and honourable parts, sonne and heire to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who concealed himself vntil yesterninght, in whose behalfe the king of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> are come from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to craue thee in marriage.

                        <hi>Laurana</hi> answered, My deare Lord and Father, I humbly thanke you for the manifold benefits receiued by your fauour, being yet at libertie from all, knowing it my dutie to haue your consent before I would presume to match my selfe, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

His importunate demaunds (which he buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon her fathers promise, and his owne hope of assurance) she answered so wisely and curteously, that his loue thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, but his hope was no whit augmented, that s√©eing such a vertuous resolution, or in maner absolute deniall to his sute, he was perswaded, <hi>Parismus</hi> was the onely man that hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his loue, which the rather vexed him, because h√©e sawe his vertues of euery man commended, and himselfe by the beauty of his excelent gifts disgraced, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer after he sought all meanes he could to worke his harme. And fearing that he should be frustrated of his expectation, began very narrowly to prie into the behauiour of <hi>Laurana</hi> towards <hi>Parismus,</hi> that they coulde at no time talke, if h√©e were in companie, but would still b√©e attentiue to their sp√©eches, nor seldome were they at any time togither, but h√©e would be in their companie, dissembling a countenance of great frindship to <hi>Parismus,</hi> hauing tha grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occasion to crosse their loues, because of the motion h√©e had made to <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and of the kings sp√©ech to <hi>Laurana.</hi> In this sort he continued his iealous behauiour, yet farre from the least hope of procuring <hi>Lauranas</hi> fauour.

for him, which she thought to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fittest place for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conference, for that she was now fully assured of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable meaning, so directing him the way, he quickely found <hi>Laurana,</hi> who was come to the staites head to meete him, whom he kindly saluted, and she as louingly welcomed him, spending their time in sweet gr√©etings, but farre from any thought of vnchastenesse, their imbracings beeing grounded vpon the most vertuous conditions that might be: and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together vpon the beddes side, <hi>Laurana</hi> taking <hi>Parismus</hi> by the hand, the teares standing in her eies, told him all the speeches her father had vsed vnto her, and of <hi>Sicanus</hi> loue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating to him all that had passed betwixt them, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely gr√©eued <hi>Parismus</hi> to heare, not that hee doubted her change, but for that hee was thereby disappointed of the first grant from <hi>Dionisius,</hi> whom he was fully perswaded would haue giuen his consent. Deare Lady (said <hi>Parismus)</hi> since these mischances are vnfortunately happened, I know not how to remedy them: but it resteth only in your power, either by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him loue, and so to destroy me, or still continue your sauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kindnesse towards me, and thereby purchase displeasure of your parents, which would be more greeuous vnto me then death. My Lord, replied <hi>Laurana,</hi> you n√©ede not vse these spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or any way trouble your mind, for I promise and protest, that the losse or displeasure of my friends, nor any other misery or torment whatsoeuer, shall make me any way infringe that promise I haue made to you: for your loue is more dearer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me then my life: but I desire you to tell me how I may any way worke your content, and I will doe it? More shee would haue spoken, but the Christall teares that fell from her eies, and extreame hearts sorrow, to s√©e <hi>Parismus</hi> so sad, stopt her speech, who likewise was drawn into such admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to think of her kindnesse, that he could vse no words to comfort her, but with his ch√©eke wiped away the wet teares that bedeawed her face, and bestowed sw√©et kisses on her corall couloured lips. At last he said, Deare <hi>Laurana,</hi> deare <hi>Laurana,</hi> I would desire you
<pb facs="tcp:16915:19"/>
not to thinke, that I any way cal your loyalty in question, but vsed those sp√©eches only to assure you, that whatsoeuer pleaseth you, I count my greatest blisse: but since you vouchsafe to grant me that fauour, to be content to endure your Parents displeasure for my sake, that am vnworthy of that kindnesse, I will heereafter so fully rest at your command to doe whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer lieth in my small power, that you shall say <hi>Parismus</hi> is not vnwilling, though vnable to be sufficiently tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>kful. Thus thinking too much of their stole time, spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t about those vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant newes, they began to vse words of more comfort, which were such as porceeded from the kindest friendship that might be. For so pleasantly sw√©et were their louely ioies, and true hearted meanings, that it far surpassed the admirable kindnes of Louers, but might be tearmed the true substance of perfect pleasure: wherein these two harmelesse soules continued the greatest part of the night with such ioy, that had <hi>Sicanus,</hi> who most enuied <hi>Parismus,</hi> s√©ene and beheld them, he would neuer haue attempted to part such knide friendship. Now the dismall houre of their parting being approached, by reason of the light that the Sunne began to giue vnto the Chamber, <hi>Parismus</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Laurana</hi> in his armes, drawing sweete breath from her lippes, told her that now (to his griefe) he most leaue her to be courted by his enemy <hi>Sicanus,</hi> relating vnto her the long wars that had passed betwixt their fathers, and the late peace that was conciuded, and how that he knew <hi>Sicanus</hi> at his first comming into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> desiring her to let him vnderstand such newes from her as did concerne their loue, which she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him she would, and withall, that she would neuer y√©eld to loue him that was an enemy to <hi>Parismus,</hi> but would hate her owne heart, if it should but thinke a thought to wrong him.

While they were striuing with <hi>Parismus</hi> in this sort, it chanced y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was a knightas he s√©emed in armour, that heard the noice, &amp; hasting by guesse so well as he could to the place, at last he came to the place where <hi>Parismus</hi> lay couered, and looking about hee could s√©e no body, but might perceiue the earth troden, &amp; all to be smea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with blood, and the mosse torne vp, and remooued from his naturall place, and looking attentiuely, he sawe the lumpe of mosse &amp; leaues, where vnder <hi>Parismus</hi> lay couered, which was the onely preseruation of his life: for the mosse lying close about him, kept the ayre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> foorth his woundes, otherwise he had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.

That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other thought to be pacified withal, he was perswaded that he might be gone so farre in search of his hawke, that h√©e could not attaine to the Cittie that night, and therefore might lodge by the way, and so come home the next morning.

Shee told him that shee was daughter vnto a Knight of the Prouince of <hi>Salmatia,</hi> whom one of those Outlaws had violently taken forth of her fathers Orchard, in reuenge of a wrong he said her brother had done him: withall she told him the whole manner of her comming thither. Whereby <hi>Parismus</hi> vnderstood, that she was the very same, in whose rescue <hi>Osiris</hi> was hurt.</p>
                     <p>By this time the Outlawes were come in, whereby the Uirgin left off her speech, bringing in with them good store of money which they had taken from honest passengers. <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> lying very weake, yet marked wel their behauiour, which made him maruell that men could be so inhumane, as by their owne reports they seemed to be, wishing himselfe with <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who he thought would accuse him of disloialty, or that hee made choise of some other: if shee did not so misdoubt him, then the sorrow he thought she endured for his losse, which
<pb facs="tcp:16915:25"/>
might some way come to her knowledge, so galled him to the heart, that his inward passions would not suffer his outward physicke to doe him any good, and the continual care he was in did much hinder his health: being likewise as much tormented with remembrance of the grant that <hi>Dionisius</hi> had made to <hi>Sicanus,</hi> concerning the marriage twixt him and <hi>Laurana,</hi> who he thought might now be inforced to yeelde her consent, when she was out of hope of recouering him: this griefe farre exceeded all the rest, that all the whole company began to note his sorrow, for he was scarce able to containe himselfe within the bounds of reason. In these perplerities he continued by the space of three months, in all which time, he could not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his health. Where we will leaue him, to speake of <hi>Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> who by tract of time, hauing somewhat mittigated the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of <hi>Parismus</hi> want, (most of his Knights being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted home into <hi>Bohemia, Oristus</hi> onely excepted, who by no meanes could be drawne to leaue <hi>Thessaly,</hi> because there he had lost his Lord) began to conferre about the marriage of <hi>Laurana,</hi> being often importuned by <hi>Sicanus,</hi> who caused the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> to be earnest sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciters in his behalfe: at whose instance, <hi>Dionisius</hi> promised to giue them answere the next day: therefore sending for <hi>Laurana,</hi> he demanded of her how shee fancied Lord <hi>Sicanus,</hi> who was a most honourable Gentleman, and one euery way worthy to be beloued, telling her that he had giuen his sul co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and therefore it stood not with her vertue to s√©eme strange or shew her selfe vndutifull. <hi>Laurana</hi> hearing her fathers spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, being much amazed, stood still and gaue no answer a good space; at last kneeling downe, shee began in this sort: I most humbly intreat your Maiesty, to vouchsafe to heare my words with patience, and not to impute any thing I shall desire at your highnesse hands, to vndutifulnesse: I cannot as yet fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Prince, though I confesse my selfe farre vnworthy the honour you proffer me, but haue presumed (vpon your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable promise, not to marry me to any without my liking,) to
<pb facs="tcp:16915:25"/>
fuse the offer <hi>Sicanus</hi> maketh, for that my fancy perswaded me, he shall bring some sorrow to your highnesse, and al the rest of this Court and Countrey: as also for that I am vnwilling to this with my better, but would intreate your maiesty (if your highnesse will needs haue me marry) rather to bestow mee on some honourable Gentleman of my degree, but most of all my desire is to continue this my happy life, wherein I entend (with your gracious liking) to spend the length of my daies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> wondring to heare her answer, began to waxe somewhat angry with her, and told her, that it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shee should marry with him, and he would haue it so. My deare Lord and Father, quoth sh√©e (because I am yours whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to dispose of) I humbly craue that I may haue a monthes respite to aduise my selfe, and then I will accomplish your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: which he granted, and so left her. <hi>Laurana</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, began to weigh in what estate she was, and how to auoid this iniurie the should doe to her selfe, for her honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise past to <hi>Parismus,</hi> and to him for his loue, that she deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, rather to destroy her selfe, then y√©eld to marry him, whom she accounted her deare loues enemy: and with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution went to her lodging.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sicanus</hi> the next morning attended <hi>Dionisius</hi> answer, who told him, that his daughter had giuen her consent, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he would grant her a months respite to consider of her duty therein: wherewithall he was highly contented, being now fully assured (as he thought) of his desire, and began more boldly to visit <hi>Laurana,</hi> who little esteemed his friendship, though he vsed her kindly, but farre from any shew of loue, to the intent to breed no suspition in him, of that shee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

                     <p>The King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and Prine of <hi>Sparta,</hi> beeing much ashamed of <hi>Sicanus</hi> behauiour, in whose company they came, desired <hi>Dionisius</hi> not to impute his impiety any way to their dishonour, for that they would foreuer abhorre him for that monstrous act, and rest ready to defend him, if euer he should stand in need of their aide, to reuenge this iniury: who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to stay still with <hi>Dionisius,</hi> if they could, to driue out of his minde the remembrance of this mischance. <hi>Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> being most extreamely ouercome with rage, and griefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to take the murther of <hi>Parismus</hi> with such sorrow, that he determined to spend the rest of his daies out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of all men, and the next morning (giuing delay no scope to hinder his purpose) hauing disguised himselfe that he could not bee knowne, in Palmers weedes, hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted secretly from the Court: and first tooke his course to trauell into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to heare whether <hi>Parismus</hi> Father had knowledge of the death of his sonne, or no. Dinner time being come, <hi>Dionisius</hi> was wanting, which made the Queene maruell, for that he was not wont to bee absent, but thinking hee was gone alone by himselfe to meditate, made no great enquiry: but after Dinner, going her selfe to seeke him, could by no meanes finde him, which made her make open enquiry, yet none could heare of him, that vpon the sudden there beganne such an vproare (when they had searched all the Place, Gardens, Orchardes, walkes, and

Diuers Knights went in search of him, but could not finde him, and yet saw him, but knew him not: for they often met with him in Palmers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, and asked him for himselfe, which made him oftentimes in minde to returne, but yet his former determination conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued firme.</p>
                     <p>These newes of <hi>Sicanus</hi> departure, and of <hi>Dionisius</hi> want happened in two daies, yet neither of them was come to the knowledge of <hi>Laurana,</hi> who absented her selfe from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by reason of the extreame care shee endured for <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus: Sicanus</hi> treason, and <hi>Parismus</hi> murther was concealed from her by <hi>Leda,</hi> who loued her dearely, and therefore would not suffer it to come to her hearing: but contrary to <hi>Lauranaes</hi> thought, and <hi>Ledaes</hi> expectation, <hi>Oliuia</hi> the Qu√©ene came to her lodging, wringing her hands, and making a great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and espying her, said: O daughter, what shall betide vs? that villaine <hi>Sicanus</hi> hauing murthered <hi>Parismus,</hi> hath likewise destroyed thy Father. <hi>Laurana</hi> hearing her mothers speeches, stood as one amazed, not once sitting, speaking, or mouing hereie: at last thinking it was strange newes to bee true, said; d√©ere mother, I trust these vnwelcome newes cannot be true, nor that your grace speaketh of proofe: whereupon the Qu√©ene told her all that had happened to <hi>Parismus,</hi> by <hi>Sicanus</hi> procurement, wherewith <hi>Laurana</hi> (not beeing able to heare the rest that her Mother would haue vttered) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fel downe amongst the Ladies dead, who indeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to recouer her, but were not able to bring her to life againe,

Lord <hi>Remus</hi> beeing a man of great wisdome and gouernment, began to weigh the fickle estate of the people and Countrey, who hauing beene a long time subiect vnto peace, therefore were not able to endure the brunt of warre, and that it was likely <hi>Sicanus</hi> would seeke to reuenge himselfe against them, and take, if he could, out of their hands the Princesse <hi>Laurana,</hi> heire apparant to the Crowne, and thereby get the kingdome into his possession, which the Thessalians could not endure: reuoluing these thoughts in his mind, he came to the Qu√©en, and the rest of the Nobles, and requested her and them together, to haue some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Countrey, and not to shew themselues vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to defend themselues from further mischiefe: whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell all liked well, especially <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who with the consent of the rest of the P√©eres, made him Lord Regent of the Country: vpon which charge committed to him, hee presently gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for mustring of men, and fortifying of Castles, and places of defence, appointing Captaines and Gouernours, vnder whose charge hee committed those places of defence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a short space brought all things to such perfection, that the Countrey was well fortifyed, and able to resist a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>

betwixt them, began so braue a combate, that their Armour began to flie in p√©eces, and the bloud by reason of their wounds issued out of many places, especially from the Persian knight, whom <hi>Parismus</hi> so firecely assailed, that he draue him onely to ward such such blowes as <hi>Parismus</hi> lent him: which <hi>Parismus</hi> espying, taking the aduantage, strooke a forcible blow at his arme, and parted the same quite from his body.</p>
                     <p>The Persian s√©eing himselfe brought to that lowe estate, turned his Horse and fled towards <hi>Sicanus</hi> Camp, which so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed <hi>Sicanus,</hi> that he thought the blacke Knight (for so they called him) to be some monster in the shape of a man, sent to torment them, who notwithstanding these their combats, s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be as fresh as he was in the beginning, still attending if any durst make any further combate.</p>
                     <p>The Qu√©ene of <hi>Thessaly, Laurana</hi> the young Queene of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> Lord <hi>Remus, Oristus,</hi> and <hi>Osiris,</hi> hauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the comming of these Persians to the Citie, were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the toppe of a tower to behold their Campe, and at their first comming they beheld the arriuall of <hi>Parismus</hi> in the black armour, and the thr√©e noble combats hee had fought with the Persian knights, which made them maruell greatly who that knight might be, that had so valiantly slaine three of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. While they were in this meditation, <hi>Laurana</hi> hauing wel markt the black knight, began to suppose that it might be <hi>Parismus,</hi> but againe, she thought that was impossible, at last shee saw a great troupe of Knights assaile him all at once, which made her call and cry, helpe, helpe, her sences being so farre drawne with feare and remembrance of <hi>Parismus,</hi> that shee neither thought of the place where shee was, nor in whose company. Lord <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Oristus,</hi> seeing this braue and worthy knight in such distresse, issued forth of the City with twenty thousand horsemen, and commanded forty thousand of the best Souldiers to come out an other way on the backe of the Persians, vnder the conduct of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther braue Noble man: all this while the blacke Knight
<pb facs="tcp:16915:35"/>
so brauely and couragiously defended himselfe, that before the <hi>Thessalians</hi> were come to his rescue, hee had slaine aboue forty Persians: but being vnable to striue with so many, hee was constrained to lose his weapon. Contrarily, Lord <hi>Remus</hi> sudden issuing out, so amazed the Persians, and made such slaughter amongst them, that they quickly set the black knight at libertie: who hauing recouered his horse, being cheared with the comfortable sight of Lord <hi>Remus,</hi> and his trusty knight <hi>Oristus,</hi> with his sword made such hauocke amongst the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, that none durst abide his comming, but wheresoeuer hee went, hee made a large lane for the rest to follow him.</p>
                     <p>The Persians by this time hauing ioined all their forces together, thronged by such multitudes vpon the Thessalians, that they were constrained somewhat to retire, but in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treit, the blacke knight sent the Ghosts of many Persians to hel, and behaued himselfe with such magnanimity that all the whole army were amazed at his valour. By this time the Thessalian footmen assailed the Persians on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side, which draue them into such a feare, that thousands of them were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to flie: but seeing no hope of safety by flight, were so amazed, that their force was quite turned into cowardise: which the Thessalians perceiuing, assailed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> with such fury, that they had destroied in a short space, a great number of them that al the earth was stained with the blood. The black knight still followed his enemies with such furie, that (by the death of many Persians) he was gotten into the middest of the whole army, where he found <hi>Sicanus</hi> incouraging his Souldiers, and knowing him by the richnesse of his armour, ran at him with such force, that with a mighty blow hee beate him quite from his horse, and had it not bin for the two brethren of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> who attended on him, he had beene troden to death. The blacke knight stil rushing amongst the thickest of the Persians came where <hi>Oristus</hi> was vnhorsed, &amp; assailed grieuously, who seeing him in that distresse, laid on his blowes with such swift
<pb facs="tcp:16915:36"/>
furie, that happy was he that could get him farthest from him: by which meanes <hi>Oristus</hi> recouered his horse. Thus all the day the battell continued, to the terrour of the Persians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Thessalians, and honour of the blacke knight: who behaued himselfe with such magnanimity, that both the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, and Thessalians admired his valor. Like wise the qu√©ene and <hi>Laurana,</hi> (who all this while beheld the battell) could not otherwise iudge, but the blacke Knight to be the most valiant Knight of the world.</p>
                     <p>Thus the day being spent, the Thessalians sounded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treit, which the Persians were glad of, onely the black knight went away discontent, for that he thought he had not yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recompenced his kind loues fauours: but secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed himselfe vnseene of any) vnto the wood wherein was his Caue.

                     <p>Lord <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Oristus</hi> (hauing retired their men into the City) sought for the blacke Knight, but could not finde him, which made them maruell what should become of him, whose behauiour had beene such, as it made him knowne to all the whole Army: but seeing themselues frustrated of seeing him, they gaue order for such as were maimed, and hauing viewed their whole troupes, found but a thousand Thessalians mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and with great ioy went to the Pallace: where they were ioyfully receiued by the Qu√©ene and <hi>Laurana,</hi> and relating the whole circumstance of their exploit, their chiefest talke was of the worthy fortitude of the blacke knight.</p>

at last he espied <hi>Osiris</hi> comming towards the Cittie, who had prepared in a readinesse twelue thousand Thessalian horsemen, and had lodged them some twelue miles from the Cittie, and knowing him to be a man of most rare curtesie, he saide vnto him: Worthy Knight, might I be so bold as aske this one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, wherefore such a multitude of souldiers haue begirt this cittie?</p>

Ind√©ed we are but a handfull in respect of the Persians, but the greatest hope we haue is in God, and we are also much comforted by the aide of a black knight (for so we call him, for that h√©e is vnknowne) whose valour is able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort a multitude of Persians, who haue already tasted of his inuincible force: for first he slewe thr√©e of the stoutest Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in thr√©e single combattes, and at last, he defended himselfe against a multitude of them, that like cowardes came running vppon him, but at last h√©e was ayded by Lord <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> who seeing his person indaungered by so vnequall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, issued out of the Cittie with their power (but before they could come to him, he had slaine fortie Persians) at which time by the asistance of that worthy Knight, there died of Persians almost fiftie thousand: amongst the rest, this blacke knight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered <hi>Sicanus</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and at one blowe, ouerthrew both horse and man, that had he not bene taken vp, he had then bene troden to death: but this is our care, that we knowe not what is become of him, for h√©e priuily got himselfe from forth of the field. Whilest <hi>Osiris</hi> was telling this newes vnto the Palmer, diuers were gathered about him to heare his talke, by which meanes the report of the blacke knight came to the knowledge of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the Prince

This message being so secetly dispatches, that the The ssali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had no knowledge thereof, by which meanes they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tinued in great security and ioy for the great victorie, they with the aide of the blacke knight had made against the Persians: yea so secure would they haue beene (had not the remembrance of <hi>Parismus</hi> death somewhat calmed their exceeding ioy) that the Persians might many times haue surprised them, but the blacke Knight was still such a lette vnto them, that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could attempt nothing but he would discouer it, by which meanes, the Thessalians had knowledge thereof. Many daies continued the Persians before the walles of <hi>Thebes,</hi> neuer giuing any assault, nor once comming foorth of their Trenches, which caused the Thessalians to count them halfe vanquished. During which time, <hi>Parismus</hi> (knowne by the name of the blacke knight) did fight many braue combats with the Persians, by which meanes the Court of <hi>Dionisius</hi> was filled with the resounding ecchoes of exc√©eding praises made in commendation of his prowes and vnconquered chiualry, but most of all they wondred at his strangenesse to bee knowne, and the rather, for that none could learne where hee made his abode, knowing that it could not bee farre from the Citie. The Persian messenger made such expedition in performing his message, that in short space there were gathered together of sundrie nations, another mighty Army: first came the king of <hi>Natolia,</hi> being nearely allied to the Persian, with a great army of Natolians, the King of <hi>Libia,</hi> with thirty thousand Libians, and the King of <hi>Licia,</hi> with forty thousand men at armes, and of <hi>Phrigia</hi> twenty thousand: and to repaire the decayed campe of the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> came fifty thousand.

                     <p>These Combattants were no sooner parted, but the Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian horsemen by a priuie Watch-word, from out the Citie, rushed suddenly vpon the Persians at vnawares, who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no such matter, and had their mindes otherwise busied, so that before they could be in Armes to defende themselues, the Thessalians had made a great slaughter amongst them, which the black Knight perceiuing, though he were gr√©euously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, made such hauock among the <hi>Persians,</hi> that al men d√©emed him rather to be a Diuell then a mortall creature, with whom <hi>Pollipus</hi> met, but would not once offer to offend him.</p>

during which time the Thessalians had receiued much dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage by their enemies, growing into feare of Famine, for that their victuals beganne to waxe scant, their courage being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise somewhat abated, for that they saw not the black knight in all that time come into the field, as his wonted manner was: therefore they concluded by a generall consent to Parley with the king of <hi>Persia,</hi> and appointed Lord <hi>Remus</hi> to be the messenger: who comming to the Persian king, told him that <hi>Dionisius</hi> king of <hi>Thessalie</hi> did desire to parley with his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whom he knew not that he had any way offended. Whose message, the Persian King kindely accepted, and vpon his Kingly promise protested to continue a truce for that day, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potniting the place of meeting, to be on the Greene before the west gate of the City: whither he came with the Kings that were with him, and <hi>Sicanus</hi> his Sonne: whither also <hi>Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> and the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with all the rest of the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates on the Thessalian party likewise came.

As hee was walking alone, hee was encountred by <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and <hi>Oliuia</hi> the Queene, not accompanied by any: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindely saluted each other, <hi>Dionisius</hi> beganne to talke of the worthinesse of <hi>Parismus,</hi> and telling him

that he est√©emed him the most fortunate man liuing, to be the father of so vertuous a child, enting so farre into commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, that the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> thought he could haue no fitter time to motion the marriage then that, and therefore answered; My Lord, I thanke you for entring into such good liking of my Sonne, whom I cannot discommend, for that he hath well deserued honor, but I haue an humble sute vnto you and the Queene heere present, in his behalfe, which if you will vouchsafe to grant, both he and I shall be bound vnto you for the same. <hi>Dionisius</hi> and <hi>Oliuia</hi> earnestly requested him to manifest the same. My Sonne (saith hee) intreated me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest your honourable fauour, to contract a marriage betwixt him and your most vertuous Daughter, vnto whom hee hath wholly dedicated his affections, that I am now become an humble sutorin his behalfe. <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and the Qu√©ene hearing his request, were so exceeding glad thereof (beeing the onely thing they desired) that taking the King of <hi>Bohomia</hi> by the hand, they told him, they were highly contentedit should be so. Thus al things falling out to their contentments, they parted for that time: <hi>Dionisius</hi> the next day assembled al his counsell and noble men together, and there me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tioned the contract vnto them, who most willingly consented therto, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the newes of this marriage was soone published, that it came to the hearing of <hi>Sicanus,</hi> who being inraged with griefe and shame, abandoned the company of all Knights, and in short time grew to such a desperate conceit of his impaired honour, that with griefe thereof hee died, which brought some heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the rest: but his death was soone forgotten, for that his Father est√©emed him not worthy the name and estimation of a King, and had lately growne into great dislike of him, and altogether fauoured the next Sonne <hi>Lennilus,</hi> who farre excelled his brother <hi>Sicanus</hi> in vertuous qualitie.

cunningly made, by expert workemen, and proclaimed a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe to be made there for seuen dayes, against all commers.

The Prince of <hi>Sparta</hi> had his Tent pitcht at the first entring into the Listes, being as white as milke, shewing his single estate, on the toppe whereof, was artificially framed a Golden Sunne, which with his splendor beautified the Listes. This dayes tryumphe was performed by the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and his Knightes, with exc√©eding valour, himselfe hauing vnhorsed aboue fortie Knights, of straunge Countries, and had giuen to him by the Bride a payre of siluer Gloues, made by the cunningest work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world.</p>
                     <p>Thus in great royaltie, to the exc√©eding pleasure of the beholders, was the first day spent, till the darke euening caused the knights to giue ouer, and betake themselus to their nights repose.</p>
                     <p>Early the next morning the knights were summoned to the Listes, by the sounde of Trumpets, the chiefe Champion for that daye, was Lord <hi>Remus</hi> of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> richly mounted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a Thessalian st√©ede of Iron graye, his Tente pitcht n√©ere vnto the other, being of the colour of the Raine-bowe: on the top whereof, was artificially tramed a swift running Hart, whereby the countrey of <hi>Thessaly</hi> was famous: before him, went foure Pages richly attired, carrying some seuerall scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions: on the first, was portraited his Mistresse picture: on
<pb facs="tcp:16915:61"/>
the second, thr√©e siluer Doues, signifing his innocencie, farre from vaine ostentation: on the third, a bleeding hart: and on the last, a man s√©eming desperate: who behaued himselfe with no lesse valour, then the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> to the great ioy of his Lady <hi>Isabella.</hi> The third day the worthy knight <hi>Pollipus</hi> was chiefe challenger, who had his tent richly picht ouer against the Stage, being of the colour of blood, on the top whereof stoode a Lion Rampant, his st√©ede furnished with costly abilaments of beaten Gold, his armour after the Phrigian maner, whose matchlesse chiualry vnhorsed that day an hundred knights, and woon the prize from all the knights that encountred him. The fourth day Lord <hi>Osirus</hi> of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> was chief challenger, whose tent was pitcht in maner of a hollow tr√©e, from whence hee is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, so artificially ouerspred with mosse, that hee seemed to be nothing but a lumpe thereof, running vp and downe the fielde, but so honourably hee behaued himselfe, that hee was allotted that dayes conquest.</p>
                     <p>The fift day Prince <hi>Lemulus,</hi> sonne to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> was chiefe challenger, whose tent was of the colour of the skie, his abilaments was of the colour of Azure, beset with starres of Gold, who behaued himselfe with great honour most part of that day: but at last he was encountred by the valiant King of <hi>Frize,</hi> by whome he was vnhorsed, by reason that his st√©ede stumbled, &amp; so the conquest returned to the aduerse partie. The King of <hi>Frize,</hi> vnhorsed afterwardes many worthy knightes, to his exc√©eding commendation,</p>
                     <p>The sixt day the King of <hi>Frize</hi> was challenged ouer the aduerse partie, who had not continued long, but hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horsed by the King of <hi>Libia,</hi> who most part of that day bare away the Prize, vntil he was encountred by <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and by him vnhorsed: <hi>Guido</hi> for that day bare away the Prize, hauing vnhorsed many hundred Knights, and was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to atchiue the chiefest honour of the Turnament. The seuenth day <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> came with great triumph into the Listes, hauing his Tent pitcht in full view of the whole

assembly, being of the colour of the bright gold, supported by foure Elephants, himselfe mounted vpon a coloured steede, most richly behung with abiliments of beaten gold, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himselfe most part of that day, to the shame of the Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salian and Persian Knights, that the whole assembly admired his valiantnesse. Which <hi>Pollipus</hi> seeing, notwithstanding his daies trinumph was past, yet hee armed himselfe, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Guido</hi> most brauely. The first cariere they met and broke their staues onely: likewise they had some fiue or sixe courses more, in which maugre all the force <hi>Guido</hi> vsed, he could not once moue or disaduantage <hi>Pollipus. Pollipus</hi> likewise was extreamely vexed, that he could not vnhorse <hi>Guido,</hi> that each of them being sufficiently stirred to wrath, addressed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for an other encounter, when they met with such furie, that they were both vnhorsed, which <hi>Guido</hi> seeing, forgetting where he was, and disdaining to bee encountred by <hi>Pollipus</hi> any longer, drew his sword, and <hi>Pollipus</hi> did the like, when they began to combat, which <hi>Dionisius</hi> espying, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Heralds to part them, and being both mounted againe, ready to make further triall for the victory: the Iudges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the mischiefe that might arise (for that there beganne to be a tumult in the field) sought to appease the Champions, and disswaded them to giue ouer, and so let the honors of those triumphes rest, to both of them, which <hi>Guido</hi> in great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine refused, without hearing what answer <hi>Pollipus</hi> would make.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laurana</hi> by the aduise of <hi>Parismus,</hi> sent messengers to <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus,</hi> to request him for her sake, to giue <hi>Guido</hi> leaue to ende that daies challenge, for that he himselfe had sufficiently shown his Knightly chiualrie, withall she sent him one of her gloues. Whose command <hi>Pollipus</hi> presently obeyed, being a Knight of exc√©eding courtesie, whereby he wan more honour then <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> could atchiue by the conquest. The rest of that day <hi>Guido</hi> vnhorsed many Knights and was like to carrie away the honour of the Triumph, maugre all all Knights that

afterwards encountred him, which gr√©eued <hi>Parismus</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. With all noting his pride, he secretly stole from the stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and presently armed himselfe in armor which he had caused to be made of purpose, seeming to be olde, torne &amp; rustie, but yet of as good proofe as might bee, being made of the purest Lydian st√©ele, his abiliments &amp; furniture, seemed to be such as had lyen vp vnvsed seuen winters, and all to bee eaten with Moathes, his st√©ede he made to trotte like a countrey Cart horse; and his plume was of russet feathers: &amp; accompanied with some thirty of his knights, attired like rude Countrey fellowes with battes and staues on their necks, and in a manner in the midst of the Thracians victories, h√©e entereth suddainly and rudely into the Lists, s√©eming ind√©ede to be a very naturall Countrey peasant, elected by a companie of rude fellowes to make pastime, and being espyed of the people, h√©e was welcomed with exceeding showts and laughters, that now the eyes of all the beholders were bent vpon him: being come to the list, he offered to run, but <hi>Guido</hi> disdained to cope with one so base, to whom <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Knightes came and tolde him, their Maister came to runne with one but himselfe, and therefore hee should either breake a Launce, or else they would beate him out of the fielde.

Deare Mistresse, quoth she, if you would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iafe to heare me speak, then I would not doubt but to ease your heart of some of the care you so impatiently endure.

<pb facs="tcp:16915:71"/>
and weigh the estate that we are in, and then I doe not doubt, but your wisedome will consider, that it is better for you to preserue your selfe for his sake, then by destroying your selfe, be guiltie both of your owne death and his too.

They hauing heard this Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits strange discourse, wondered at the cruelty of <hi>Bellona,</hi> and were confounded in their thoughts with the danger they should endure to conquere their inchantments, that sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they could not tell what to determine off: but crauing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of <hi>Antiochus</hi> for their rude behauiour towards him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> before they knew not, most louinglie saluted him. <hi>Parismus</hi> said that hee would the next morning without delay trauell thitherwards. My Lord (quoth <hi>Pollipus)</hi> were I sure to abide a thousand deaths, I would beare you company, for I would not now loose your sight, nor abstaine any hazard for your sake.</p>
                     <p>The next morning they were earely vp, determining to leaue <hi>Adonius</hi> with <hi>Antiochus</hi> in his Caue, but notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their perswasions, he would not stay, but what with teares and humble intreaties, he obtained <hi>Parismus</hi> consent: who was vnwilling to haue him goe, least hee might bee hurt in this attempt. <hi>Antiochus</hi> conducted them vntill they were within the sight of the Castle, but then left them, returning to his Cell, Inuocating and praying after his manner, for their good successe.</p>
                     <p>When they had well viewed the Castle, which was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully seated vpon a strong Rocke, incompassed with a mighty huge d√©epe Lake, they sought round about the same, but could finde no passage thereto: hauing neither bridge nor other way to goe on foot. At last they heard a little Bell ring within the Castle, which was by the Watch, by the sound thereof, giuing warning to those that were appointed to keepe the same: vpon which noise, they saw a boat with six armed Knights in it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards them, assoone as they were landed, <hi>Parismus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> who was lord of the castle: one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, come with vs, quoth he, &amp; thou shalt soon s√©e, wherwith they began to lay hold on them.

                     <p>The Ferrie men s√©eing their sixe Champions lie weltring in their purple gore, ranne towards their boate, but <hi>Adonius</hi> seeing his Master and <hi>Pollipus</hi> had slaine their enemies, was before gotten down into the same, and seeing the Rowers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards him, and <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Pollipus</hi> pursuing them thrust the same past their reach, by which meanes they had soone taken these slaues, and put them to death, who by no meanes would manifest any thing of the secrets of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Parismus</hi> comming to <hi>Adonius,</hi> most kindly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him, and with exceeding praises extolled his wisdome in performing this exploit to <hi>Pollipus,</hi> who admired to s√©e so great wisdome in so yong y√©eres, but his wit and wisdome was such, that had they knowne the party, they would haue more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his vertue.</p>
                     <p>By meanes of this boate, they had passage vnto the other side of the riuer, where they were no sooner landed, but they heard such a hideous noise within the Castle, such Thundring and ratling in the Skies, that it would haue amazed the stou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Champion in the world: but they were nothing abashed thereat, sauing <hi>Adonius</hi> stood quaking and shaking with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame feare, when issued out of the Castle two mighty huge proportioned Monsters, s√©eming rather to be Diuells then naturall men, who assailed these two worthy Knightes with such, fury that had they not nimbly auoyded their blowes, they had at that very instant perished: who

                     <p>At such time as they awaled, they were exc√©edingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to see themselues in that manner imprisoned: and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus,</hi> was so enraged with extreame sorrowe that h√©e tare his haire, &amp; re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t his garments, rayled on his misfortune, cursed his destinies, and vexed his owne hart with extreme pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of sorrowe, that his sp√©ech was returned into bitter sighes, and his sences forgot their former vertue, and he was so desperately sad, that no griefe might be compared to that he endured.</p>

Uertuous Lady (quoth she) I haue long diligently marked the doleful plaints you secretly vtter, which maketh me muse, that you hauing no cause at al, shuld spend your daies in such heauie sort, wheras you might (if you plesed) inioy such happy delights as many thousand ladies wold wish for. You are here in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie place in my opinion, where nothing is wanting that might procure your content, where no iniurie is offered you, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you indure some secret griefe, I know not what to coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of your discontent: and the loue of <hi>Andramart</hi> in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment faire Lady, should bring you that happie consent, that yet you neuer enioyed the like, who in all respects beareth such an intire affection to your selfe, that whatsoeuer he hath or can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

Which in some sort, reioyced <hi>Laurana</hi> to s√©e, but he still ran vp and downe, raging in such cruel sort, that his seruant fled from his presence, and hid themselues for feare of his furie.

These discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, draue them to the trial of their vttermost wits, for by the perswasion they had to finde <hi>Laurana</hi> there, they determined (though the attempt were neuer so dangerous) to make tryall thereof, or <hi>Parismus</hi> rather determined to be detained there as a prisoner, then to leaue any thing vnperformed, whereby he was put in any comfort of his long &amp; wished expectation.

This exploit was so suddenly performed, that those within the Castle had no knowledge thereof, which fell out well for the two knights, who quietly rested in that place,

being no way moiested that night, but were exc√©edingly gr√©eued to heare the groues, cries, and gr√©euous complaints, of such as remained in prison, which continued in such misery, as it were too heauy to report. Early the next morning, these Noble min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Knights, hauing with wise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>sideration, weighed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test perill of this their attempt, attended their fittest opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which thus fell out.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by reason of their number, shut too the same againe, and run vnto <hi>Andramart,</hi> who hearing their report, presently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded 20. of his best knights to arme themselues, himself likewise ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himself, and went down to the gate, which he commanded to be opened, &amp; s√©eing no more but only two knights, (himselfe not vouchsafing to speake to them) commanded his seruants to carry them to prison, by which meanes they had occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within the gates, when drawing their swords they stood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their defence, which <hi>Andramarts</hi> men began to laugh at, thinking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> foolish to resist them: but it fel out to their sorrow.

this Castle (as I suppose) then know that we are such as goe in search of a lost friend, whom we assuredly thinke thou vniustly detainest, for none but thy selfe wouldst do such a discourteous d√©ed: as also hearing of the trechery thou vsest to trauellers, and the continuall outrages thou attemptest by Sea, whereof wee haue had sufficient triall, we determinately came, aswel to find our lost frind, as also to requite the discourtesie we haue found by thy seruants, since which our comming thou knowest what we haue begunne, and our determination is to goe forwards, vnlesse thou wilt vouchsafe of curtesie to let vs see the prisoners thou detainest, which if thou deniest assure thy self we are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bent to purchase the thing we came for, or in pursute therof, hazard our dearest bloud: therefore resolue vs what thou wilt do, for we challenge thee, if thou hast any spake of honourable Knighthood, to shew the same, in honourable, and not in treacherous sort, which will make our reuenge more sharpe. <hi>Andramart</hi> hearing the speeches of the valiant <hi>Parismus,</hi> could not well tell in what sort to answer him, one while purposing to detaine them in that place: but not confidently trusting the strength thereof, that thought was soone vanished, Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to coniecture that <hi>Laurana</hi> was the Lady, in whose search they came: with all remembring that she should be taken from him, which was more grieuous then a thousand deathes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to offer them the sight of the prisoners, fearing that they would otherwise doe him some mischiefe.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> presently sent a messenger to <hi>Barzillus,</hi> to certifie him of theyr happy successe, who leauing the custodie of the Passage to his trustiest Souldiours, came to be partaker with them in theyr reioycings.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16915:105"/>
to conceale the same from <hi>Parismus,</hi> which made them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maruell.

Which draue them all into an admiration, that <hi>Adonius</hi> and <hi>Leda</hi> seeing her teares, could not refraine from partaking with her in that sadnesse, but (as the custome of Women is) wept for company. <hi>Parismus</hi> maruelling what was the cause of her sorrowe, and desirous to knowe the same, for that his heart therewith was exc√©edingly tormented, most earnestly intreated her to vnfolde the cause of her griefe, that he might (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Laurana</hi> beeing vnwilling in the least degr√©e to shewe her selfe vndutifull to his will, began to declare the manner of her bringing to that place by the Pyrates, after they had betrayed him on the coast of the Desolate Iland, as also the kindnesse she had found at <hi>Andramarts</hi> handes, and how that from time to time, he had vsed her in most honourable sort.</p>
                     <p>But my Lorde (quoth shee) <hi>Andramart</hi> had a Sister na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Adamasia,</hi> who many times vrged m√©e to yeelde to Loue her Brother: Which when shee could effect by no perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: First shee imprisoned my Seruant <hi>Leda,</hi> next shee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde from mee (the cause of this my sadnesse,) my young Sonne, that was borne in this vnluckie place, whome I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be named <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and with cruell torment afflicted my bodie, and daylie caused two Olde-Women to whippe me in most cruell sort, which I was contented to endure. But when shee sawe that all this would not preuaile, she caused the Nurse that kept <hi>Parismenos,</hi> to come vnto mee with a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,

And the very day when you entered in fight in this Court, he caused mee to be lodged in the place where you found m√©e. The greatest cause of this my sadnesse is, the losse of my young Sonne, whose death was vntimely, and whose presence would haue expelled such sadde thoughts as haue possessed my minde: and disquieted the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie content I should receiue by your honourable presence.</p>

                        <hi>Parismus</hi> hauing heard the summe of her Tragicall report, could not chuse but grieue, especially to think of the miserie she had indured, and the death of his young Sonne, whom he had neuer seene, that what with his, and <hi>Lauranaes</hi> sadnes, all the whole company were growne into heauinesse.

                     <p>And though there was no likelyhood fore him to attaine her Loue, yet the extreamitie of his affections were such, that hee thought he could no way content himselfe better, then to spend the rest of his life in her seruice, still purposing (according to a most noble and constant Resolution,) neuer to desist from
<pb facs="tcp:16915:106"/>
shewing the true zeale he bare to purchase her fauour. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee could spend many houres in secrete complaintes and Protestations of his true and loyall Loue: wherin (according to the humours of Loue-sicke people) h√©e thought hee did in some measure ease his heart. Which behauiour of his, <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> well noting, (as beeing infected with the selfe-same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease) would oftentimes interrept him in his sadde Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with such conceytes, that <hi>Pollipus</hi> woondered to s√©e such wisdome in a Boy: but by reason that shee was taken to be no other then a Boy, he entred into no d√©eper consideration of her actions. In the silent Night time <hi>Violetta</hi> did with such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse affect his complaintes, that when h√©e sighed, sh√©e likewise sighed: and if h√©e chanced at any time to complaine of his hard Fortune, <hi>Violetta</hi> would as often blesse the happie time, and houre when shee first saw him, and that shee was so happie to be beloued of so honourable a Knight.

loued a Damsell named <hi>Violetta,</hi> whose excellent Beautie, and vertuous gifts, haue so inthralled my Senses, that I feare me Boy, it will be to m√©e a cause of perpetuall heauinesse.

If sh√©e should not regard you (qd. she) according to your hearts content, I should account her the most discourteous Lady liuing: and were I in her case, I would indure a thousand deaths, rather then shewe my selfe ingratefull to so honourable and kind a friend: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would see the issue of your loue, I desire you that I may be partaker with you in your Trauells: For though I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnworthie to be est√©emed of you, yet if you would vouchsafe mee that kindenesse, I would both shewe my selfe dutifull and diligent, and also rest continually bound vnto you for the same.

that in his opinion, he should do her wrong to reiect her loue, which should proceede from a vertuous inclination, vsing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie perswasions to that effect.

Your loue to me (that am vnworthy thereof) and the little account I seeme to make of the same, hath brought you to that weakenesse you remaine in, which if so it be, I am most heartily sorrie: but for that I am now departing this countrey, I would now satifie you in any thing I could: therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to mitigate the extremity of your passions, which I cannot salue, for that long since, I vowed my seruice vnto a Lady in <hi>Thessalie,</hi> vnto whom I am bound by many inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable bonds of passed promises: neither can I be disloyal to her without impeachment of mine honour, which is the only Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell I most est√©eme: then let me perswade you to abstaine from louing him, that cannot shew himselfe so kind as he would, and you deserue, but banish from your minde, all good conceit or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of me, that must against my will be ingrateful: and if in any other sort, I may do the thing with hazard of my life that may content you, I am h√©ere readie to accomplishe your wil. And in my absence do not accuse me of inhumanity, for I may not nor will not, do any Lady wrong: vpon whose fauour, my life, if it were ten thousand times dearer, dependeth. <hi>Freneta</hi> hearing his resolute and vncomfortable words, fell in a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swound, which her maide perceiuing, laboured to reuiue her againe: in the meane time, he departed to <hi>Parismus,</hi> and hauing solemnly taken their leaue of the King and Qu√©ene, who endured their departure with great heauinesse, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to their ships, and soone launced into the maine, and with

The streets, windowes, house tops, &amp; euery place were so befraught with a bundance of people, as there was almost no passage left for them to get the Pallace. <hi>Violetta,</hi> among all the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her carefull father, standing in his dore, weeping to see the myrth, al else inioyed but himselfe, who continued in great hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse for the losse of his daughter: which sight attainted her heart, with such griefe, that the passage of her Christall teares, issued with such abundance, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the companie wondred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, when all else indured great pleasure being come to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace they were on all sides welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>med with vnspeakeable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Dionisius</hi> caused most costly meate to bee prouided, for their repast, and in the meane time caused <hi>Parismus</hi> to sette downe by him, and <hi>Laurana</hi> by her mother, accompanied by <hi>Clariana</hi> &amp; <hi>Isabella,</hi> three of the fairest creatures that euer eye beheld.

of my friend <hi>Pollipus,</hi> haue we escaped the great dangers wee fell into: therefore I bes√©ech your highnesse, est√©eme of him, as the onely preseruer of your childrens liues whose noble wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath still preserued vs, and his prowes mightily defended vs, without whom, wee had neuer enioyed this happy houre to s√©e your honourable presence. <hi>Dionisius</hi> hearing his sp√©eches rose from his seat, and embraced <hi>Pollipus</hi> with great kindnesse, yeelding him many thankes. Thus repleat with exceeding ioy on all sides, they spent the rest of the day, in kinde salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pleasant communication, each friend with other.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Arly the next morning, <hi>Pollipus</hi> Armed himselfe, causing his Horse to bee prepared in a readinesse, and comming where <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisius</hi> was seated in his Royalty, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the noble and Gallant States that were in his Court, humbled himselfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knee, and said:</p>
                     <p>Most mighty King, I cannot render you thanks sufficient, for the least fauour I haue receiued at your hands. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, I am now bold to presume into your presence, to request consent to a matter, that much concerneth me: which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, you will rather iudge to proceed from folly, then wisdome. For so it is, most Noble King, that I haue made a vow to trauell in search of a friend. In which trauell I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to spend the rest of my wearisome life, without whose presence, my life will be hatefull vnto me. Then I beseech your Highnes to shew me that fauour, as I may obtaine your fr√©e consent to depart at this instant, for my heart hath vowed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to rest in any place, vntill I be fully assured of my friends prosperity. <hi>Dionisius</hi> hearing his request, was sorie so soone to leaue him, and therefore taking him vp most kindly by the hand, he said.</p>
                     <p>Most worthy Knight, to whom both my selfe and all mine are much bound, it were a hard matter I would deny you: but in this let me intreat you to stay some few daies with vs, that we may make you some small recompence for your paines, and
<pb facs="tcp:16915:114"/>
not so soone leaue vs, who are much delighted with your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: and rather let me perswad you to leaue off this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the dangers incident to trauell are many, and your selfe haue lately sufficiently tried, and if that in short space you doe not heare tydings, according to your content, you shall haue all the furtherance I can giue you, to doe what seemeth best to your selfe.</p>
                     <p>My Lord (replyed <hi>Pollipus)</hi> my staying in this place can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleasure you, but rather be offensiue, for that my sorrowes without some good hope of comfort, will exceed the limits of reason: neither will it (I hope) delight your Maiestie to see my griefe, which I can by no meanes auoide. Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your Highnesse, not to intend me any further honour, but let me haue your licence to depart that haue already sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tasted of your bounty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> s√©eing his intention, vsed all manner of frindly and kinde perswasions to dissawde him from his purpose, but he as earnestly intreated his consent, for his heart was oppre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with that care, that no other thought could take place in his Fancies, but very shortly hee determined to beginne his trauels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Violetta</hi> s√©eing that nowe or neuer was the time to worke his and her owne content, resolued to manifest her selfe, and with her best diligence attended him all that day, fearing least he should depart secretly, and at night when he went to his bed, (not with intent to sleepe, but to poure forth his vsuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations) <hi>Violetta</hi> likewise was with him, shewing a sad countenance to see his sorrow.</p>
                     <p>But when she had tenderly coucht her selfe by his manly side, shee could not deuise how to growe into conference with him, being strooken with such a delightfull feare, to discouer her self, as she had neuer felt the like. At last she said, most miserable knight, I am sure now you giue no credit to my words, because you find not <hi>Violetta</hi> here, according as I promised you shold: neither haue I any comfort to attain the fauor at your hands I
<pb facs="tcp:16915:115"/>
expected, because your pensiunesse will not permit me. But might I bee so bold as to craue one request at your hands, which if you please to vouchsafe me, I promise you, that you shall find my words before spoken true (for that I know where <hi>Violetta</hi> is) and promise you againe to doe more for you with her, then any liuing, but her selfe. Tush boy (quoth <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus)</hi> doe not goe about to delude me with fond sp√©eches, for thou canst not performe any thing that can further mee heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. My Lord said shee, doe but trie me once more, and if I faile, then let mee endure the most heauy doome of your euerlasting displeasure. <hi>Adonius</hi> (quoth hee) if it bee to pleasure th√©e any way, I will galdly do it, for the friendship I haue found in th√©e: then I pray thee as thou louest me, and tendrest the sorrowes I indure, do not delay me with thy sp√©eches, for I know they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from kindnesse, to make me forget my sadnes, and not to do me any benefit in the thing thou speakest of, for I shall neuer be so happie as to be beloued of her, who I feare me left her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house to shun my company. But notwithstanding the little hope of comfort I conceiue by thy meanes to pleasure th√©e before I depart, tell me what it is thou demandest, and if it bee in my power thou shalt obtaine it. <hi>Violetta</hi> was ashamed to vtter her minde in that place, but being sure he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her blushing Ch√©ekes, said: the request that I make is this, that you will giue mee your faithfull promise, that at such time as it is you hap to meete <hi>Violetta,</hi> and obtaine her good will, that the first night you will not offer to doe any thing that may tend to her dishonour. Upon mine houour said <hi>Pollipus,</hi> I will not doe any thing whatsoeuer disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her will, for so deare doe I esteeme her, that I would rather destroy my selfe then shee should be any way displeased with me. Then know, worthy knight (quoth she) I am that <hi>Violetta</hi> you so earnestly enquire after, I am the party that haue so long time procured your discontent, and I am shee whose absence you haue so oft bewailed, and now I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to manifest my selfe vnto you desiring you to pardon
<pb facs="tcp:16915:115"/>
my hard hartednesse, that haue so long concealed my selfe, and thereby procured your disquiet. <hi>Pollipus</hi> hearing her speeches, could not tell what to say, being halfe perswaded it was she, by remembring her countenance, and the behauior she had vsed in al, their trauels: as also calling to minde her kindnes, &amp; now at length her owne speeches, could not resolue what to do, for that his fancy still perswaded him it was not <hi>Violetta.</hi> And on the other side, he had a mighty perswasion it might be she: at last he said. I know not what to coniecture, nor how to behaue my selfe, nor whether I should call you <hi>Adonius,</hi> or <hi>Violetta,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how vnlikely it is she should be so kind to me, and how certaine I am that <hi>Adonius</hi> hath done me manifold pleasures. Then sweet <hi>Violetta</hi> (if you are she) resolue mee of this my doubt, being thereby driuen to that hopefull despaire, that I know not whether my fortune be better or worse then it was. <hi>Violetta</hi> shrinking a little back, said. Pardon me d√©ere <hi>Polipus,</hi> for I am your vnworthy friend <hi>Violetta,</hi> that haue in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, made triall of my fortune, and your friendship. <hi>Pollipus</hi> then tooke her most louingly in his armes, not offering other then his former promise did permit. Yet he was in a doubt still, and could not be quiet, vntill he had vsed such kind meanes (yet farre from dishonour) as thereby he found shee was a virgin, and no Page and therefore assured himselfe it was <hi>Violetta:</hi> and folding her delicate and tender body in his manlike armes which he had oftentimes before imbraced, but not with such kindnesse, banishing all sadnesse from his sorrowfull heart) with sweet and delightfull tontent, he embraced her with that kindnesse that long parted Louers enioy, when they so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly meete, spending the rest of the night in pleasing and delightfull communication, and remembrances of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kindnesses, which augmented their ioyes to an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding height. Oftentimes <hi>Pollipus</hi> would haue exceeded the limits of his former promise: but shee reserued that fauour, for the more honourable delight of their Nuptiall Bedde, but with many pleasures, such as true and loyall kindnes yeeldes.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:116"/>
Thus these two kind friends spent the time, <hi>Violetta</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her selfe most happy so enioy so constaut a friende, as shee had found him by certaineties in their trauell, and hee esteemed himselfe as happie, that hee was beloued of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi> that had not refused to hazarde her selfe in many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for his sake. At last, their minds being both at quiet, and satified with blisfull content, these two faithfull louers fell fast a sleepe, <hi>Parismus</hi> enduring much heauinesse for his friends departure, could scarcely entertaine a minutes rest to his troubled head, therefore he was earely vp, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to perswade <hi>Pollipus</hi> (if he could) from vndertaking that iourney: and presently after these louers were a sleepe, hee entred his Chamber, where contrarie to his premeditated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he found him fast a sleepe: and <hi>Adonius</hi> in most louing sort, laying one hand vnder <hi>Pollipus</hi> head, and the other embracing his manly breast: s√©eming in his conceit, the delightfullest sight that euer he beheld: the supposed page being so beautifull, that had hee not knowne him, hee would haue iudged <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe had been there, to comfort <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> with her sweet embracings. But seeing his deare friend in such quiet and sweet rest, he withdrew himselfe, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate how to worke his friends comfort, and stay his iourney. By which time, the Sun had lightned all the Chamber with his golden brightnesse, the clearenes of whose splendor, shining full vpon these louers, awaked <hi>Pollipus,</hi> but <hi>Violetta</hi> still lay sweetly slumbring, and <hi>Pollipus</hi> shadowing her with the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, arose, and soone found <hi>Parismus</hi> walking at his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doore, who seeing him, said. My deare friend <hi>Pollipus,</hi> I had thought to haue found you ready armed to depart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your resolution yesterday, but I hope you are rather determined to alter that purpose, and stay with vs, who desire nothing more then your companie: and were not <hi>Adonius</hi> well known to me I should thinke you had embraced some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Goddesse in that kinde sort: but notwithstanding, let me intreate you stay some longer time with vs, which was the
<pb facs="tcp:16915:116"/>
onely cause of my comming vnto you at this instant. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you for all the friendship that hath passed betwixt vs, bring mee so much more in your debt, by obtaining this fauour at your handes. My Lord (quoth, <hi>Pollipus)</hi> I must confesse I am too sluggish to bee found sl√©eping at this instant, while my minde should b√©e busied with more weightie matters. Ind√©ede, according to your saying (my Lord) I thinke I haue either imbraced some goodnesse, or a more diuine creature: for my former resolution to trauell is quite dissolued, and my heart at more quiet then it hath bin: for my deare <hi>Violetta</hi> hath bene so kind as to visite me this night, shewing my heart that cause of ioy, as for euer while I liue, I shall account my selfe bound to her: and because your honor hath both bin acquaintd with my loue, and al my intents, &amp; haue vouchsafed me that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour that I shall neuer requite, I wel shew yon the cause of my gladnesse. <hi>Violetta</hi> hath disguised her selfe, and bin with vs in all the time of our trauels, and <hi>Adonius</hi> is now cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ged to <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi> and hath discouered her selfe vnto me, which was more strange to me then it may s√©eme to you. <hi>Parismus</hi> hearing his sp√©eches, called her fauor to remembrance, &amp; perfectly knew that it was <hi>Violetta,</hi> wondering that in so long time as sh√©e was in the disguise of <hi>Adonius,</hi> h√©e could neuer perceiue the same, nor once suspect it, which affected his heart with exc√©eding ioy: and taking <hi>Pollipus</hi> by the hand, they walked together to <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who greatly reioyced at his happy newes, &amp; presently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Leda</hi> to carrie apparell vnto her, and all things that were necessarie, which sh√©e presently executed, and at her comming founde <hi>Violetta</hi> newly awaked, and tolde her that <hi>Laurana</hi> had sent her that apparell, which <hi>Violetta</hi> was well contented with. <hi>Parismus, Pollipus,</hi> and <hi>Laurana,</hi> by this time were come where she was, who stood with a bulshing cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance like <hi>Venus</hi> intrapt in <hi>Vnlcans</hi> net, but <hi>Parismus</hi> tooke her by the hand, &amp; said: Blush not vertuous damosel, for it reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth my hart to s√©e you here, could you be so vnkind as in all the time of your trauell, neuer to make your selfe knowne till
<pb facs="tcp:16915:117"/>
now? Well, I s√©e you haue wisdome in making your choice, and well haue you deserued to be beloued of <hi>Pollipus,</hi> who I am sure will performe no lesse, neither n√©ede you any more trial of his loue, for that you haue b√©ene priuie to many infallible proofes thereof. <hi>Violetta</hi> kn√©eling vttered these sp√©eches, I thanke your honour, that vouchsafe mee this extraordinarie fauour, as to visite mee, that haue shewed my selfe vnworthie thereof: but I trust I n√©ed not now stand vpon nice tearmes to this worthie knight, for that I may bee fully assured of his fidelitie: neither can I s√©eme straunge, hauing b√©ene so long time acquainted with his loue.

Then I desire you let your heart repose that good trust in me, that no miserie, calmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, death, nor affliction, shall cause me once, in wdrd or deede, to be disloyal to your selfe, that vouchsafe me the heauenly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse I desire.</p>

For comming one day into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, I found (amongst other things) this History of Parismus roughly penned by him, and carelesly cast by in loose papers, as minding that it should neuer haue come to the presse. But I gathering them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and reading them, found the inuention so pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the matter so delightfull, and the Stile (although plaine,) yet so pleasing, as (liking it,) requested him to suffer it to come abroad, assuring him, that it could not but be generally well liked of the better sort.</hi>

performed the same, doe not you (I pray you.) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him in his first attempts, but kindely accept his will meaning intention, which was to please al, and displease none. So shall you winne him, to finish what hee hath promised, that is, the second part: which I protest, I will hasten him to doe with as much speede as may bee. Fare yee well.</hi>

                     <p>When she had wept her fountaines drie, shee then began to accuse her selfe of Follie, that would not stay in the place where hee left her: then a certaine perswasion entred her heart, that he was dead, which tooke such d√©epe roote, that of a long time no other thought would take place, which made her think the Tapers which gaue her Light burnt blue: which likewise added a further setled resolue in her Fancie, that it was so ind√©ede.

                     <p>Which dismall words strooke such a sudden griefe vnto her heart, that there she fell downe at his feete in a Traunce: but when by theyr industrie she came to her selfe againe, her amazed countenance, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable grones made the teares trickle downe her ch√©ekes, and s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in that dangerous estate, conueyed her to her bedde, whose vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sences were so abated and extinguished, that for a long time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding theyr vttermost endeuours, shee seemed no otherwise, then as one bereft of sense: and in that lamentable estate shee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued many dayes.</p>

It may bee the Wilde beastes haue secret Dennes, whereinto they haue drawne her Body, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other mischaunces may be befallen her, that she was subiect vnto, and yet still be hidden from our knowledge: Neyther let that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you (quoth <hi>Parismus,)</hi> but rest contented, and your care that way shall soone be eased; but depart with m√©e to the Court, to comfort your selfe with some Sustenance, and I will presently giue order to haue this Woodde so throughly searcht, that you shall plainely finde shee hath not miscarryed.

that shee was hindred by the 2.

violence? <hi>Violetta</hi> with teares trickling downe her crimzen ch√©ekes, answered: yea, that villaine. <hi>Archas</hi> would haue done me violence, had not you so Fortunately come to my rescue: But I thinke the Diuine prouidence, hath sent you hither so happily to preserue me from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring lust, whose dishonorable minde is fraught with all villanies: accursed be the day that first brought mee to this hatefull place, to fall into his loathsome power, that contrary to Nature, hath done mee this outrage.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Violetta</hi> was striken into a sudden amazement to heare her detested counsell, thinking to haue found some comfort in her sp√©eches: In so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that with extremitie of Passions, shee was readie to giue vp the ghost.

hat none may knowe thereof, and that onely hee satisfie himselfe with your Loue without asking questions, or entring into any talke, which may renue the remembrance of your former griefe: and when w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these conditions you haue agreed, my self will supplie your roome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by safegard your Honour, and satisfie him: which may well be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, considering that his desire being nothing but Lust, he easily will be drawn to condescend to your conditions: which once done, let me alone to execute the rest: for I am so well acqnainted with his fashions, that it shalbe long before he descrie our deceit.</p>

                        <hi>Violetta</hi> hearing the circumstance of her Talke, promised to doe all things according to her counsell, if shee herselfe meant faithfullie. Which <hi>Sorana</hi> assured her of, by many Protestations, and so left her in some comfort, hoping by this meanes to bee ridde from her Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Louer.</p>
                     <p>Assoone as <hi>Sorana</hi> was departed, she presently goeth to <hi>Archas,</hi> (pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forward with as great a sting of foule Lust, as raigned in him) and told him, that sh√©e had talked with <hi>Violetta</hi> about his sute, which shee was perswaded she would yeeld vnto, but that shee was bashfull: and by his speeches, rather hardned, then any way mollified: but (qd. shee) Trie her euen now, and whatsoeuer shee bindeth you vnto by conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that promise you to performe: and when you know her minde, tell mee what shee sayes, and I may peraduenture counsell you what to do for your furtherance: for she is worthy to be beloued, and kindely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and in my Iudgement, you did amisse, to vse her so rudely as you did in the Orchard; For forced kindenesse is not worth estimation, but consent in Loue breedes the sweetest delight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Archas</hi> presently put her counsell in practise, and came to <hi>Violettaes</hi> chamber (who was then studying how to rid her selfe from his custody) and very kindly saluted her, crauing pardon for his last offence, excusing himself by many reasons, and alledging as many perswasions, that she could not in reason denie his request: his Loue being grounded vppon the truest foundation of perfect constancie, of Uowes, Oaths, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, to dedicate himselfe, his life, and all that hee had to be at her command. <hi>Violetta</hi> (casting down her eyes to the earth, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing countenance, to think how much it went against her heart, to vse him kindly: asking pardon of <hi>Pollipus,</hi> in her secret thoughts, for dooing him that vnwilling wrong) at last made answer, that she could in some sort be contented to grant his request, if he would promise to performe

what she should inioine him too, which he vowed and protested to fulfil in euery respect. Then she concluded with him as <hi>Sorana</hi> had counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to do, which liked him exc√©edingly well, &amp; quoth she, for a pledge hereof, giue me that ring which you so much est√©em, which he gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ber, and at his departure receiusd from her a gentle kisse, which she wisht might proue as deadly poyson to his heart, being greatly discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with her selfe for shewing him that fauour.</p>

                        <hi>Archas</hi> presently with a ioyfull heart went to <hi>Sorana:</hi> and tolde her all that had passed betwixt him and <hi>Violetta:</hi> which she willed him in any wise to performe: and s√©eing sh√©e hath bound you from talke, what n√©ede you care for speaking, sith you may enioy what otherwise you desire: and she finding you so willing to condiscend to her requests, will b√©e the easiler drawne to y√©elde you any courtesie. <hi>Sorana</hi> being parted from him, imediately came to <hi>Violetta,</hi> and tolde her all that he had made her priuie vnto, and withall saide, that for her sake onely she vndertook that taske, (which was nothing so, but of a most inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate desire to beastly lust, which <hi>Violetta</hi> well noted:) and thus they spent the day in much idle talke, vntill euening drawing nigh, sh√©e left <hi>Violetta</hi> in her chamber, and went vnto that sw√©ete bedde, which she had neately drest for <hi>Archas,</hi> perfuming her selfe with many odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous waters, deuising all meanes she could to k√©ep her selfe vnknown from him, being affected with great desire for his approach.

The damzel casting her eyes vp to him, which before were sadly fixed, on the earth, said, Sir Knight, to discduer the whole circumstance of our mishap, would aske more respit then the time will now permit: because if we be surprised by our tariance, w√©e are like to be partners with him in death. This Knight was named <hi>Tyrides,</hi> sonne to the noble Duke <hi>Amasenus</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> being brought vp in the Court of the renowned King of <hi>Libia:</hi> who being with the Princesse <hi>Venola,</hi>

And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time, in the presence of all his Court, demaunded the cause of the combate betw√©en him &amp; <hi>Argalus,</hi> which he requested as well to knowe the truth thereof himselfe, as to satisfie the suspitious mindes of many that inwardly maligned the discontented Knight, vnto whom he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the truth in manner as is before set downe, saying: This my lord is the truth of his misaduenture, whom I neuer iniured, but alwaies estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as my friends. <hi>Amasenus</hi> was glad that no cause of discontent could be conceiued against him, by any other of his Knights, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied him, because his noble gifts darkned their glories: but yet his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and kind behauiour in short time expelled that roncor, and they that before were his enemies, began to make good estimation of him, &amp; his fame began to spread it selfe in most parts of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer behelde him, grew into admiration of his strength, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>panied with such bewtie, as his youth y√©elded: that had they not knowne the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by his prowesse, they would haue taken him for some disguised La-Ly. Whilest the knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> remained in <hi>Amasenus</hi> court, the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> appointed a generall triumph, to be heldfor certaine daies, the occasion whereof is this.</p>
                     <p>He had one onely daughter, named <hi>Phylena,</hi> whose beautie was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to none: and her gifts of nature were such, as made her much spoken of in many countries: insomuch that many knightes came as sutors to obtaine her loue, but she had secretly betrothed her selfe to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> one of the knights of her fathers court, without her parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: by meanes of whose beautie, the Court of <hi>Thrace</hi> was full of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant knights that sought her lone, that the King was much troubled in minde how to bestow her: and s√©eing that she did not fancie one more than another, he appointed a general triumph to be held for seuen daies, and whosoeuer bare away the prize the last day, shuld marry his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Intending thereby to ende his doubt and care that way: thinking, that though his daughter had not a rich and Princely husband, yet shee should haue a valiant Champion to defend the price of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:144"/>
Amongst the rest of the Knights, there was <hi>Guido,</hi> who had long time sued to obtayne her Loue, who now reioyced at this Decr√©e, hoping by his valor to beare away the Bride. There was <hi>Trudamor</hi> of <hi>Candie,</hi> who thought none equall to him in strength: and therefore none more forward against the time of the appointed triumph. There was <hi>Drio</hi> of <hi>Scicil,</hi> who had sayled from his owne Countrey thither: who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by his strength at seuerall times slue thr√©e Lyons, who came with resolution to winne <hi>Phylena</hi> for his Wife.

                     <p>The report of this great Triumph came to to the knowledge of the Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> whose minde was kindled with an earnest desire to goe thither, that he requested <hi>Amasenus</hi> consent, who being desirous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way to pleasure him, gaue him sufficient Coyne to furnish him of all things, fit for such an attempt. Who caused a most rich Armour of gr√©ene to be made, shadowed with Tr√©es of golde, presenting a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. In his shielde he bare this deuise; A naked man leading a Lyon, with this <hi>Motto</hi> vnderneath, <hi>Ouergone with Discontent:</hi> Wherein the expert Artsman had so cunningly imitated his Fancie, that a man by his Armour and shielde, might easily vnderstand his meaning. The appointed time of Triumphe drawing nigh, <hi>Amasenus</hi> with a gallant troupe of Knightes, amongst whome the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> was chiefe, came to the <hi>Thracian</hi> Court, whome the King honourably receiued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amasenus</hi> hauing don homage to che King, pitched his Tent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Court-Gates, vpon a little hill, hard by the appointed place for Triumph: where likewise hard by him were the Tents of <hi>Guido, Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor, Drio,</hi> and the three valiant knightes of <hi>Candie: Tristramus, Tennulus,</hi> and <hi>Babulus,</hi> in whose companie were a number of valiant knights, that came thither: Some to make tryall of theyr valour, and some of purpose to winne the faire <hi>Phylena.</hi> Likewise there were the Tents of the young King of <hi>Arragon:</hi> who came accompanied with a number of valiant knights hoping to beare away the Prize, that all the Plains were filled with Tents. There might you see knights breaking staues, practising themselues against the day of Triumph.

Wherewith, not suffering her to make him answere, assuredly perswaying himselfe she was guiltie in both, he thrust his sworde quite through her body, and there in that vndecent sort left her, giuing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a grone, with the date of her life.

Sh√©e had not long stayed in that place, but thee behelde an Aged man, whose yeares made him stoupe to the Earthwards, carrying a few drye sticks vnder his arme. <hi>Violetta</hi> thinking, she might repose some confidence in his vertues, because of his years, drew towards him: Who s√©eing so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull a Lady, in that vnfrequented place vnattended, exc√©edingly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled, to whom she saide.

inuocate the Heauens to graunt you Felicitie, and my Reward suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to content you for your paines.

And for that I s√©e your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell (vpon what occasion to m√©e as yet vnknowne,) hath both wearyed you, and this colde Earth whereon you sat, may endanger your health, giue me your hand, &amp; I will y√©eld you what aid my weake strength wil permit, to guide you to my Cell, which is hard by. Doo so good Father (quoth she) and I thanke you most heartily: Where I will disclose to you my vnfortunate mishap; That saide, shae leand her selfe vpon his aged arme, so weary with Trauell, that she scarce could set her f√©ete vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grassie earth, for hurting them. His Cell, it was no other but a hollow Caue, which the poore Did-man by his owne industrie, had cut and vndermined vnder the side of a Rocky-hill. Which was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued, hauing his lodging seuerall from the rest. And so artificially had he framed his Chimney, that through a hollow Uawt, he conueyed the smooke, at the foote whereof, ran a most pleasant spring, where the cleare Water striuing with the smooth pibbles, made a burbling noise, where the comfortable beams of golden <hi>Phoebus</hi> had full force. On the other side was a sw√©et spring, where the birds kept continuall pleasant recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Harmonie.

                        <hi>Panuamus</hi> continued Fight against him a good space, but being vnable to cope with so mighty an Enemy, was by reason of so many grieuous Wounds, in the ende left by him for dead: Which done, <hi>Brandamor</hi> s√©eing our flight, hasted after vs: But before hee could come at vs, we attained the Castle, and rescued our selues from his possession. But when he saw himselfe disappointed, he made as though he had departed from hence, and contrary to our thoughts, hee hidde himselfe secretly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Bushes.</p>
                     <p>My Mother being ouercome with extreame sorrow for my Fathers death, neither regarding doubt nor daunger, went backe, with hope to recouer him, whom <hi>Brandamor</hi> surprized, and carried away with him, hoping by her Imprisonment, to winne her consent to y√©elde mee into his hands.

the truest Knight liuing, from his former constant resolue, to adore her beautie, and forsake his former vowes, onely to attend her person, for so diuine are her liniaments, and so rare her perfections, that her fame is euen spred through all the regions of the world. <hi>Barzillus</hi> hearing him enter into a new discourse of her beautie, and that in such affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate sort, hauing before in his fancy said enough, beganne to laugh at him saying:</p>

By which time a number of Knights were vpon the Battlements viewing their combat, and seeing the Knight that kept the Tent foyled, burst into an exceeding laughter, and so departed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barzillus</hi> hauing foyled the Knight, for that the night drew nigh, withdrew himself from the Golden Tower into a pleasant valley, and there stayed that night.

You shall haue occasion enough to exercise your Armes, against such as would steale your Lady, which this Knight intendeth not; therefore returne to your Tent, &amp; defend her beautie there, which none here gainsaieth. <hi>Tellamor</hi> hauing ended his sp√©ech, intreated <hi>Barzillus</hi> to depart with him, which the Knight of <hi>Candie</hi> s√©eing, he returned towards the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tower.</p>
                     <p>By the way as they were returning towards <hi>Panuamus</hi> Castle, <hi>Tellamor</hi> delared to <hi>Barzillus</hi> how fortunately he came to knowledge of <hi>Violetta,</hi> which exceedingly reioyced <hi>Barzillus</hi> heart: but when hee vnderstood <hi>Pollipus</hi> misfortune, hee was contrarily affected with as great desire to set him at libertie: which communication shortned their iourney, and in the end arriued at the Castle.</p>
                     <p>The newes of their approach soone came to <hi>Violettas</hi> hearing, who knowing both <hi>Tellamor</hi> and <hi>Barzillus,</hi> welcommed their presence with such effusion of teares, that for a space she could not vtter a word; but her floud being somewhat stinted, saluting them most kindly, shee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered these sp√©eches:</p>
                     <p>Your presence worthy friends bringeth great comfort to my heart, after my tedious toyle of misery, what thanks my vndeseruing heart can y√©eld, I render you for the paines you haue taken for my sake: for I know you vndertooke this trauell to finde me out, that am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee so well est√©emed of you, much lesse vnable to make you the least part of amends. You may s√©e to what poore estate I am brought by the treachery of a disloyal Knight, who hath caused my misery, your trauell, and <hi>Pollipus</hi> imprisonment, intill I was succoured by this courteous Lady, whose friendshippe hath succoured mee from famish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>This homely attyre I vndertooke for my quiet passage: but misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes still awayie my miserable steps, which no disguise can preuent: with that her teares burst into a floud againe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barzillus</hi> being mooued with her teares, was ready to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate her griefe in the manner she did; but at last he sayd.

we haue all the reward we expect for our trauels, now we haue found you, for so much are wee bound to that worthy Knight <hi>Pollipus,</hi> and the most noble and gracious Prince <hi>Parismus,</hi> (who is likewise tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled in your search) that we account our liues well imployed to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them and you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Violetta</hi> hearing that <hi>Parismus</hi> was trauelled in her search, was almost ouercome with passionate affection of his kindnes, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what sorrow <hi>Laurana</hi> would endure for his absence, with sighs she said: I of all most vnfortunate, to be the cause of that noble knights trauell, which many wayes hazard his safetie, and br√©ede much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet in the Bohemian Court, but especially to that most vertuous, courteous, and honourable Princesse <hi>Laurana:</hi> whose sorrow I know will be most exc√©eding, and all procured by my vnlucky destinie, that am altogether vnworthy to be esteemed of them, nor in any degr√©e to be so highly regarded.</p>

                        <hi>Tellamor</hi> likewise grieuing to s√©e her sorrow, comforted her with these words; Dears Lady, cast off these sad cares, and let no disquiet thought trouble you, for what is past cannot be recalled, but all is now amended by your recouery, whose death we all greatly feared. By this time <hi>Panuamus</hi> had prepared their dinner, which was serued in after the best sort: to which, hee and <hi>Clarina</hi> welcomed them with great kindnesse. <hi>Clarinas</hi> heart being somewhat comforted by their company, hoping by their meanes to s√©e the downefall of <hi>Brandamor,</hi> and her Mothers release.</p>
                     <p>When they had well refresht themselues, and heard <hi>Violletta</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the whole circumstance of her misfortunes, they beganne to deuise what course to take to set <hi>Pollipus</hi> at libertie, which they found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to doe by force, because the strength of the place was inuincible: at last, they determined the next morning to trauell, to try if Fortune would any way fauour their attempts. After they had spent some time in these sp√©eches, and euery one fully resolued what to doe, <hi>Bazillus</hi> saw a payre of Chesse standing on a side Table, which hee went vnto, and began to place the men in order, which <hi>Panuamus</hi> espying, came to him, and saide; That if hee pleased, he would play a game with him, wherewith <hi>Barzillus</hi> was contented.</p>

                        <hi>Clarina</hi> s√©eing them busie at Chesse, tooke <hi>Violetta</hi> by the hand, and requested her to walke into the Garden: Lady (quoth <hi>Violetta)</hi> so pleaseth you, this knight may beare vs company. Then taking <hi>Tella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi>

                        <hi>Tellamor</hi> s√©eing her so busie, was vnwilling to interrupt her quiet content: Withall, viewing her sweete beautie and prettie gestute, his minde was Affected with great pleasure to be holde her, and her care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nipping the Flowers, with her white hand, exceedingly graced her perfections, that his heart inwardly panted with a sudden motion of delight: and his Fancie beganne so much to commende her sweete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, that euen then his affections entertained a secrete motion of loue. Whilest he viewed her thus precisely, she suddainely cast her eye vpon him, thinking he had bene still in his dumps, but perceiuing how stedfastly he beheld her, a suddaine blush attainted her, that therewith the sweete Rostate colour glowed in her cheekes: Which hee likewise perceiuing, came towardes her, and with great Reuerence, folding her precious hand in his, saide.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16915:161"/>
                        <hi>Pollipus</hi> at libertie: therefore he thus said. <hi>Argalt,</hi> We know not how to trust a man of thy nature and disposition, which thinkest euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall action lawfull to further thy diuellish driftes, and regardest ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertue nor Knighthood, but onely thy will: therefore if we should enioyne th√©e to any thing, thou wouldst disloyally break thy Oath, and soone forget what thou vowedst to vs to performe: and contrary to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, rather betray vs to thy Treacherie: but if thou wilt saue thy life, assure vs to set at liberty the Lady <hi>Madera,</hi> and the worthy Knight <hi>Pollipus,</hi> and on that condition we will let th√©e goe fr√©e. <hi>Argalt</hi> being glad of his sp√©eches, vowed and protested with infinite Protestations, to fulfill theyr request within thr√©e dayes, vpon which condition, they let him depart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Algalt</hi> being gone, beganne to consider what promise hee had made them, and by what meanes he had escaped death, and how courteously vpon his Oathes they had saued his life, and gaue credence to his sp√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: Which with intended resolution he purposed to accomplish, and being entred the Castle, comming to <hi>Brandamor</hi> (Wounded and faint with bl√©eding, he declared to him all that had happened) requesting his conset to accomplish theyr demaund, which hee had bound himselfe by Oath to performe. <hi>Brandamor</hi> hearing his Wordes, fell into a bitter rage against him, and vttered these sp√©eches. Why Brother (qd. hee) consider you not what daungers might ensue, if I should accomplish your request? and withall, doo you not remember the Ualour that is in this Knight <hi>Pollipus,</hi> which might by his Libertie bring vs all in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: As for the Ladie <hi>Madera,</hi> I regarde not, if I send her hence: For now I esteeme her Daughters beautie, which was the cause I haue so long time detained her: Then if you please, send her vnto them, and let them seeke the performance of the rest how they can: For what n√©ede you regarde your Promise, being out of theyr danger? <hi>Argalt</hi> hearing his sp√©eches, perceyuing hee could perswade him no way, was content with that.

                     <p>And coming to <hi>Madera,</hi> (who still continued in her her heauy dumps) he told her that her time of Libertie was come, and that shee should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Pollipus</hi> still standing at the Window, saw and beheld when <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus</hi> came, who (by all likelyhood) he thought he knew to the worthy Prince of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which stirred such a resolued courage in his heart, that with maine force he slue the Iaylors man his k√©eper, and so raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Chamber to Chamber, vntill he came to the place where <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> was, being continually attended and Guarded by ten Knightes: Whome <hi>Pollipus</hi> (nothing regarding his Nakednesse, desperately As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayled with his Barre of yron, continuing so long Fight, and with such Courage, that hee had soone slaine the one halfe of them: and the other beeing terrified with his feare, fledde from him, and fast boulted and barred the Doore, with such strong deuises, that it was impossible for him to get out that way.</p>
                     <p>In which time, the cowardly Gardyants made such an horrible outcrye, that both <hi>Argalt,</hi> and all that remained in the Castle, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Armed themselues: And some of them issued out to <hi>Brandamor,</hi>

Then both together stepping to the window, saw the combattants, and beheld the danger <hi>Parismus</hi> was in, and the comming of the strange Knight to his rescue, and withall, how valiantly hee ouerthrew the Gyant, which when he had seene, he thought in his fancy that hee had neuer before beheld so valiant and comely a Knight.

(For <hi>Parismus</hi> thought him to be some Knight that knew him. <hi>Venola</hi> likewise thought him to be some Knight that sought her loue, but both were deceiued.) Now this Knight was the Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> the occasion of whose comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, shall be declared in the next Chapter, who beeing drawne by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall instinct, so much reuerenced <hi>Parismus,</hi> that he thought hee could not sufficiently expresse his loue towards him, and though hee neuer saw him before, yet such a secret impression of reuerence towards him, was stirred in his heart, that he desired nothing more, then to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his sight: and although he had not the least thought that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus</hi> was his father, nor he one perswasion that the other might be his sonne, yet both of their hearts were stirred with an earnest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted expectation of friendship and neerenesse of acquaintance. And the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> noting the others behauiour that <hi>Parismus</hi> was some great personage, hearing him to desire him to discouer himselfe, made this answere.</p>
                     <p>Right noble Knight, at your command I will vnarme my selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a farre borne stranger to this countrey, neither haue I any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this place, but by misaduentures forced to wander through the world, to seeke that which I haue not yet found, nor scarce know if I meet withall, being onely fortunate to arriue in this place, to make some, triall of my strength in your defence: which said, he presently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed himselfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> beholding his youth, beganne (withall the rest) to admire his valour, accompanied with such young yeeres, that embraced him in his armes, he could not by that courtesie expresse his good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> likewise reuerently kissing <hi>Venolas</hi> hand, said. Most noble Lady, my comming to this place, was to set you at liberty, and also to reuenge the death of the courteous Knight <hi>Tyrides,</hi> sonne to the good Duke <hi>Amasenus</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> vnto whom I am infinitly bound: that had I thousand liues. I would venture them all in his behalfe that now is dead.

                     <p>

When these cerimonious saluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were past, they went to Dinner. <hi>Pollipus</hi> diligently noted the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> his countenance, proportion, and gesture, thinking it his Fancie, he neuer saw a Knight more like <hi>Parismus:</hi> that his minde was inwardly styried with a great destre to knowe his Name and his byrth.

                     </argument>
                     <p>AFter that the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> had wonne the chiefe honour of the triumph, in the Court of the king of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and had giuen away the Kings daughter to <hi>Remulus,</hi> with her Fathers consent therto, and the solemnization of the wedding past and performed with great royalty, the king calling to minde the valour of the knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> and how prodigally he gaue <hi>Phylena</hi> to another, whose beauty might haue satisfied a mighty Potentates liking: and withall, how little he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his heire, by which meanes afterwards, hee might haue come to the highest type of dignity, and to the high honour to bee King and Qu√©en of so mighty a nation: wondred what might moue him to refuse those offers: sometimes thinking it proceeded from want of wisdome: then againe he supposed, a Knight endued with such bountiful and rare gifts of prowesse, could not chuse but likewise enioy sufficient wisdome to consider the valew of such gifts. And entring into a further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof, he began to coniecture that he was sprung of some great personage which might be the cause thereof, and for that hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, he thought that to be the very truth. Then againe he called to remembrance what <hi>Amasenus</hi> had told him, about his comming into that country, that he was by these thoughts grown into such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be satisfied therin, that he sent for the Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> and in the presence of the Queen, <hi>Amasenus, Remulus, Phylena,</hi> and al the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, of gallant knights that came to the triumph, he said as followeth. Worthy knight, whom I so much affect, that if it in my power lye, to doe you any more honour then I haue heretofore proffered, I would willingly do it, for you valour deserueth euerlasting commendations.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:167"/>
I haue offered you my Daughter in marriage, and withall intended to haue adopted you my Sonne and heire, both which you haue refused, yeelding your interest in my daughter to <hi>Remulus,</hi> and therewith left the inheritage I adioyned to her marriage, which were both worthy of regard, for that such gifts are seldome giuen: which maketh me send for you, desiring to be satisfied for your comming in the one, and also to knowe of whence, and what you are, if I can without offence to you, obtaine the same.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> made this reply. Most high and mighty King, I will vnfold the truth of all to satisfie your demand: I confesse your Maiestie did so much honour me, as my life shall bee alwaies ready at your command in quitall of the same: and your Princely gifts are of such estimation, as I confesse my selfe farre vnworthy to possesse them: but that they might haue beene bestowed of the greatest Potentate in the world, which I neither refused, nor lightly esteemed, but alwaies regarded, as of precious and inestimable valew: not drawne thereto by any want of consideration of their worthinesse, but for the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble respect I beare to loyalty. For should I haue presumed to haue wed your Princely daughter, I should haue done her great iniurie, and thereby parted the vnited hearts of true and loial friends. For pleaseth your Maiesty, at the first I intended with a ioyfull heart to haue clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my interest in that sweet Princesse loue: but I was commanded the contrary by an vndoubted meane, (which if it so please you, I will in priuate vnfold) as also perceiuing the true friendship betwixt her and that noble knight <hi>Remulus,</hi> past with consent of both their harts: I should haue esteemed it either in my selfe or in any other, an acte of great dishonour and impietie, to part those firmed bands of friendship, which if I had dissolued might haue turned their sweet intent into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented miserie, neither could I so rudelie presume to challenge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in so sweet a Ladies loue without desert, which is not attained by armes, but by loyaltie: which was the cause that I yeelded my interest vnto him, that had taken possession in her gentle heart, before my comming: and for my birth, I know not my Parents, but the truth of all that is manifest to me, the noble Duke <hi>Amasenus</hi> hath made you priuie vnto.</p>
                     <p>The King hearing his answer, greatlie commended his honourable minde, saying: Thou worthy knight, if there bee any meanes left wherein I may pleasure you, doe but aske, and you shall assuredly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

                     <p>Dinner time beeing come, a most costly and sumptuous feast was prepared: whereunto <hi>Maximus</hi> inuited all his Nobles, and <hi>Camillus</hi> and the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> amongst the rest as his chiefest, where they were most honourably entertained, sumptuously feasted, and kindely welcommed.</p>

                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> on the contrary side, gouerned himselfe with more moderation, for he hauing attained such good successe as his heart did wish, was therewith for the present contented: hoping that fortune that had beene so fauourable to him, would not suddenly alter her countenance, but still continue her aide to his furtherance: whome <hi>Maximus</hi> likewise diligently noted, hauing suspition that hee likewise came for <hi>Angelicas</hi> loue, though he dissembled the contrary, of which he could perceiue no likelihood by his merry countenance, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him onely to suspect <hi>Camillus</hi> and not him.</p>

Hauing written this letter, and sealed it with his signet, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sent the same by certaine of knights to the Golden Tower, who as effectually dispatched their iourney, as he had giuen them straight charge, and arriuing at the Golden Tower, deliuered the Letter to <hi>Maximus,</hi> who hauing read the same, and well considered the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which augmented his hatred and suspition already begunne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> presently comming to the place where hee was in talke with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> he caused him to bee apprehended, and without any other iudgement, caused him presentely to be cast into a denne of Lions, to be deuoured.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> was no sooner put into the denne, but the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made an exceeding roaring, that those without assuredly iudged him deuoured, and himselfe expected nothing but that terrible and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death: but the Lyons, who by nature will not harme those of Roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bloud, spared his life, and not so much as offered to touch him, but were rather terrified with his presence.

                     <p>O Sister (quoth he) this place is the harbour of cruelty, tyrannie, and dishonour, which in times past hath beene famous, and a receipt of honour, but shortly will be hated and shunned, as odious and ominous, and all procured by the foolish Diuining of a wicked Harlot, that hath filled my Fathers head with such fancies, that hee forgetteth himselfe, his Honour, and Kingly behauiour, and giueth credit to none but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and parasites, imprisoning his children, murthering his friends and s√©eking the subuersion of honour, and honourable knights.

                     <p>The Queene seeing <hi>Angelica</hi> somewhat well recouered, departed vnto <hi>Maximus,</hi> who by that time had knowledge of <hi>Collimus</hi> death, and was meditating how to chastise <hi>Marcellus</hi> for that presumption:

                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fame</hi> all this time remained in the Lions denne, carefully deuising which way to get out of that place tyring his senses, but finding no meanes of release.

My freinde, I s√©eke not thy life, but mine owne safety, beeing as thou seest, preserued by Diuine prouidence by the Kings cruelty, by him vniustly cast into this place, without any cause of offence: but wrongfully, as thou maiest perceiue by my preseruation: for if my facte had deserued punishment, no doubt I could not haue escaped the crueltie of these executioners, hauing endured great danger of famish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> being yet somewhat troubled in his minde about the Letter the King of <hi>Lybia</hi> had sent, and desirous to be satisfied of the truth therein, taking the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> aside, from the hearing of the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, said as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Sir Knight, although I haue shewen you this fauour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which my fancie often perswaded mee to refnse, yet vrged by the good will I beare you, and for other considerations which I will yet conceale from you, I could not choose but reioice at your safety, and worke what meanes I can for your preseruation: yet there remaineth a grudging in my conscience against you, vntill you assure me by your faithfull oath, to satisfie me of the truth of my doubt without fraud: for if that be true which is alleaged against you by the affirmation of a king, you deserue the punishment my Father inflicted vpon you, and rather to be generally hated, then beloued at all. Most honourable Knight (quoth he) I know my selfe so cleare from all such villany, as that I sweare and protest by my life, by Heauen, and by all the good that euer I expect, which I desire to turne to my destruction, it I tell you not the very truth.</p>
                     <p>Then (quoth <hi>Marcellus)</hi> the same day that the King my Father caused you to be throwne into the Lyons den, the king of <hi>Lybia</hi> sent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certaine of his Knights, with a Letter, wherein he accused you to haue most shamefully dishonoured his Daughter <hi>Venola,</hi> desiring my Father to dispatch you out of the way: for your life and nothing else might appease his ire: which was the cause of his cruelty.</p>
                     <p>My Lord (quoth the knight of <hi>Fame)</hi> vpon mine honour, my former oath, and by all other truth and fidelity, this accusation is most vniust, false, and vntrue: which if I may by your fauour in whose hands my life now resteth) haue liberty to approue, I will maintaine the contrary, euen in the gates of the king of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and cause my accusers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the contrary: neither did I euer seeke loue at that Ladies hands, by whose dishonourable meanes this false accusation is raised against mee.</p>
                     <p>Deare friend (qd. <hi>Marcellus)</hi> you haue said inough, and I rest assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied of your loialty. The knight of <hi>Fame</hi> was so inwardly vexed with this accusation that he was halfe mad with griefe, but chiefly, for that hee thought it was come to <hi>Angelicas</hi> hearing, and might bee a meanes to cause her vtterly to forsake him: which appalled his sences, with extreame vexation, that he stood like one transformed.</p>

the World, and that he did both loue and honour him as himselfe, and would neuer forsake him whilest hee liued, but continue his faithfull friend for euer. Hauing in this sort made a new league of amitie, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> left the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> to his priuate meditations, promising to returne to him very shortly, going directly to <hi>Angelica,</hi> whome hee found continuing her woonted sadnes: For shee could by no meanes be comforted, but still augmented her Loue, by remembring the <hi>Knight of Fames</hi> person, to whom she bare such intire affections, that she resolued neuer to Loue any other Knight, but determined to spende the whole date of her life in single estate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> sudden Approach brake off her silent pensiuenesse, by his countenance shewing a heart replenisht with ioy, which hee vttered in this sort. <hi>Angelica</hi> (qd. hee) cast off this sadde countenance, for I bring you newes of more comfort: for the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> is liuing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by admirable meanes.

                        <hi>Angelica</hi> then verily belieuing his wordes, saide: Good brother tell me how he doeth, for whose safetie I reioyce? For of all the Knights that euer I behelde, I neuer liked nor loued any so well: desiring you withall, to k√©ep my counsell, (hauing bewrayed my secrets to none else) and not let him know so much as I haue tolde you.

                     <p>Then fastening a Rope about the <hi>Knight of Fames</hi> middle, and after that (With many fayre promises and protestations of perpetuall Friendship) they had taken theyr leaues, the K√©eper and <hi>Marcellus</hi> lette him downe: Who was so heauie, by reason of the waight of his owne bodie, and his Armour, that they had much adoo from letting him fall, and being in the Uessell, was like to sinke in the same. But with much adoo (and great daunger of Drowning) by reason of the tottering and vnsted fastnes of the Uessell, which with euery little Weyght more on one side then on the other, was ready to ouerturne, hee got on to the Bancke, which was so st√©epe vpwards, that h√©e had much adoo to clime vp the saine, but was oftentimes readie to fall downe backwardes into the Lake vnder him, which was of an exc√©eding great and huge depth:
<pb facs="tcp:16915:194"/>
but hauing happily escaped both those daungers, h√©e departed towards Saint <hi>Augustins</hi> chappell, according to such dyrections <hi>Marcellus</hi> had giuen him to finde the same. <hi>Marcellus</hi> and the K√©eper drewe vp the Uessell, and betooke themselues to theyr rest.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> had not well remembred <hi>Marcellus</hi> sp√©eches, and therfore hauing gone some halfe mile from the Golden Tower, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to wander out of the way, he tooke vp his lodging vnder a Cipresse Tr√©e, spending the whole Night in manifolde meditations, of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his businesse: Being oftentimes in great doubt, and dispairing of neuer s√©eing <hi>Angelica</hi> again, drawne to that feare by reason of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Iealousie, and the diligent Watche hee had set in euery corner of the said Tower, but especially at the entrance: Where none went out and in, but the Gardiants searched them, that his minde was sometimes wrackt with dispaire<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and sometimes animated to comfort by the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red trust he had in <hi>Marcellus.</hi> The Night b√©eing by him in this sort spent, in the Morning hee betooke himselfe againe to his Iourney, and with ease found out Saint <hi>Austins</hi> chappell: and knocking at the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell doore, it was iong before any came, but at last he beheld olde <hi>Iabin</hi> standing behinde him; Who had bene abroade very early, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, whome the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> most kindely saluted. <hi>Iabin</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling to s√©e one in Armour, demanded what he would haue?</p>

hearing, she said: Brother, How can this be effected, when you s√©e so many impossibilities to hinder our intent, that we shall but spend much labour to little effect, and also rather bring my Fathers heauy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against vs, then reape any comfort? Whose crueltie you s√©e is such, that hee will, if h√©e should finde out our drifte, punish vs with seueritie: Besides, if it should come to that passe: What excuse could you finde to pacifie his ire? Therefore I thinke it best, that wee neuer hazard our selues, but rather be contented with our quiet estate, least a worse mischaunce light vpon vs thereby.</p>
                     <p>Syster (quoth <hi>Marcellus)</hi> your counsell is good, but yet heare what I shall say: The life you leade is but miserable, being kept like a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner; Whereas, if you could but winne this liberty, you should enioy your fill of hearts content, and be a meanes to rid my Father and vs all from the doubts we may now endure. Besides, if you loued that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knight; Whose constancie to you-wards is without compare, you would for his fake refuse no perill. Why brother (qd. she) what n√©ede you make any such doubt when I haue said sufficient alreadie, vnlesse you thinke me to dissemble? For such is my loue and good Will, that I will more willingly vndertake any means to attaine his company, then he can desire: not drawne by your perswasion, but of my own voluntary will: which haue made some doubt of this attempt, because I am feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of your ill, and carefull of your good: but whatsoeuer you shal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile me vnto, I will execute. Which said, they began to studie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult how to bring their businesse about: but were so confounded in their thoughts, that they thought it altogether impossible.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Maximus</hi> being ridde of <hi>Camillus</hi> company, and assured of the Knight of <hi>Fames</hi> death, gaue his minde to more quiet, then during the time of their being there h√©e had done: and being wearie with care, thought to recreate himselfe by some exercise: therefore h√©e appointed the very same day to ride on hunting: and to that intent h√©e was early vp, sending for <hi>Angelica</hi> to goe with the Qu√©ene, euen at that instant when sh√©e was deuising with <hi>Marcellus:</hi> which opportunitie fell out most conueniently to further their intent, which <hi>Marcellus</hi> told her he would determine of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> immediately went downe with the messenger: and with the King and Qu√©ene, <hi>Marcellus</hi> and diuers others departed out of the tower. <hi>Marcellus</hi> all that day kept diligent company with <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> vntill the king being earnest in pursuite of the game strayed from
<pb facs="tcp:16915:195"/>
them: the Qu√©ene likewise was absent, and most of <hi>Angelicas</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diants, sauing some sixe, b√©eing indeede such as <hi>Marcellus</hi> had before made priuie to his intent, who had firmely protested to k√©epe his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile: which opportunitie <hi>Marcellus</hi> tooke, and presently conueyed <hi>Angelica</hi> towards Saint <hi>Austins</hi> Chappell: being without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Parke, when they thought themselues farre inough from the King, they were vnawares set vpon by a company of strange knights, who offered by force to carrie away <hi>Angelica.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> being somewhat astonisht thereat, drew his sword, and being before well prouided, withstood them. <hi>Angelicas</hi> gardyants did the like: that on a suddaine there began a cruell combat betwixt them, vntill <hi>Marcellus</hi> was gr√©euously wounded, one of his company slain, and the rest in as great danger as might be: but being a knight of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©eding courage, he defended himselfe most valiantly. So long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the fight, that in the meane time, some of the kings company, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the charge of <hi>Angelica,</hi> mist her, which h√©e soone declared to the king, who commaunded his knights to poste euery way by seuerall troupes: himselfe and the Qu√©ene well guarded, tooke the readiest way out of the Parke: which was the same way <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> had taken, and hasting, came to the place where they were, in the hottest of their skyrmish.</p>
                     <p>The straunge knights espying the King, presently fledde away, with all possible sp√©ede, whom many of the <hi>Natolians</hi> pursued so farre, vntill they might descrie a band of Souldiers: wherewith they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all expedition possible, and certified the King thereof, who presently hasted to the Golden Tower, with the Qu√©ene, <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> in his companie: and by reason of the straungers h√©e saw in fight with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> h√©e hadde not the least suspition of <hi>Angelicaes</hi> entended flight: and maruailing what that Armie should meane, h√©e sent out spyes to viewe of what force they were, who hauing done in all poynts accordingly, they went and certified him that they were tenne thousand Souldiers, but they could not discerne vnder whose conduct.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximus</hi> fearing the worst, presently sent letters to the Nobles of his Land, with all expedition to muster vp theyr forces, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey them to the Golden Tower: and also caused most diligent watch and warde to be kept.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:196"/>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> being most grieuously Wounded, was like wise with all cure tended by the Kings Physitions, to whom <hi>Angelica</hi> repaired: and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him alone, she said as followeth.</p>
                     <p>What misery awayteth my hard Desteny, that am thus disastredly deteyned from my wished content? My euill presaging minde, did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell this misfortune, which hath thus frustrated our desire, and which is more miserable, brought you to this dangerous estate: but most of all withhold me from the fight of my beloued, and causeth him both to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his cares, and suspect our loyaltie. What will he thinke when he seeth no performance of that which was promised, but still stayeth for our comming, and yet be frustrated? For the knowledge of our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, can by no meanes come to his hearing. Would to God that I had ended my accursed life, by the hands of those enemyes, rather then to haue suruiued to endure this extreame care. No hard fortune can be compared to that I endure, no care comparable to my griefe.</p>
                     <p>First, to s√©e you thus grieuously Wounded: Next to be disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our desire: and lastly, to frustrate the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. What shall w√©e now doe? How shall wee recure this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap? Or what meanes is there left, that may adde the least comfort to our hearts in this extremitie? In st√©ed of the content I expected by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying his presence, I am returned to my woonted bondage: and s√©e my Friends almost murdred and enuironed with foes. Peace, peace, (qd. <hi>Marcellus)</hi> good <hi>Angelica,</hi> ceasse these complaints, and in this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, imitate the olde Phrase: Make a vertue of necessity, and with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience giue attendance for better successe: For now in these perplexities, there is small hope of present amendment: For that Worthy knight no doubt is of such Wisedome and prudent gouernment, that hee will iudge the best of our estate, and carefully prouide for his owne safetie. With that <hi>Angelica</hi> burst foorth into abundante of teares, saying. Aye m√©e poore Wretch, I shall neuer then s√©e him againe. With that shee departed, wringing her handes, and making great lamentation, so that <hi>Marcellus</hi> s√©eing her sorrowe, was ready to worke his owne decay by his vexation.</p>
                     <p>Nowe those Bandes of Souldiers belonging to <hi>Camillus,</hi> who presently after his departure from the Castle of the Golden Tower, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during manie restlesse Passions, for the want of <hi>Angelicaes</hi> presence, with whome hee was full greatly in Loue: with all sp√©ed mustered vp
<pb facs="tcp:16915:196"/>
those forces, and brought them by shipping towards the Tower, with intent to besiege the same, and suddenly to surprise <hi>Maximus</hi> vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and so to get the possession of <hi>Angelica:</hi> and comming towards the Golden Tower with a few in his company, whilest the rest mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched after him, he met <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> and knowing them, thought without any more trouble to take her away, but was disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as is declared.</p>
                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fame</hi> being with olde <hi>Iabine,</hi> spent much part of the day in conference with him, maruelling that hee heard not from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus:</hi> but when it was darke night, his minde was rackt with exc√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding care and vexation, and being without any hope of his comming, hee was as much grieued how to satisfie <hi>Iabine,</hi> whom hee thought would now suspect him of falsehood: and might suppose hee came not from <hi>Marcellus.</hi> Therefore he said as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Father, I maruell that I haue not heard from <hi>Marcellus,</hi> according to his promise, which maketh mee thinke that some crosse mischance hath hindred him, that may breed in you some misconceit of mee, that haue in his name come vnto you, which if you doe, you shall much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie me: for it was he that sent me hither, as I could assure you by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers probable reasons.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight (quoth he) I pray bee not troubled with any thought, for you are welcome to me, though <hi>Marcellus</hi> had not sent you, which I make no doubt of, but so well doe I loue him, as that whatsoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in his name, shall by the strickt obseruance I beare to that name, command me any seruice.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards they went to their repast, with such sparing diet as the Priest vsed, and after Supper to bedde: where the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> could take no rest at all, but yet lay very quietly, because he was loath to trouble his Host: with which restraint of liberty of speech, and other passions that opprest his sences, he endured that tedious night in great torment, which seemed longer then many nights would haue done, if he might haue had liberty to vtter his lamentations, which boiled in his breast like the violence of a mighty flame pend within a small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.</p>
                     <p>Early the next morning, <hi>Iabine</hi> went foorth for to prouide food, and left the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> alone, who then vttered many complaints, but at last finding fault with himselfe for vrging that effeminate kind of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, he striuing to ouermaster his passions, which the more hee

The Knight to <hi>Fame</hi> alighting, comming to him that he had ouerthrowne, thus said.</p>
                     <p>Knight, thou n√©edest not to haue fledde from me, for I intended thee no harme, but was desirous to knowe some newes of th√©e, which if thou wilt tell me, I will let thee depart: otherwise thou shalt neuer es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape my hands. The knight maruelling to heare him speake, whom he thought had bene a ghost, made this reply. Pardon me good sir, for I tooke you to be another then I s√©e you are, but if I may know what you will commaund me I will doe it. (Quoth he) tell me how fareth <hi>Marcellus?</hi> Sir (quoth he, at this instant helyeth very weake, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of many grieuous wounds h√©e receiued not long since: where h√©e declared the whole trueth of that which had happened by <hi>Maximus</hi> meanes, since which time (quoth h√©e) the King hath set such secrete watch about the Tower, that none goeth in nor out without his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> hauing heard his sp√©eches, departed backe to <hi>Iabine,</hi> to whom hee declared the trueth of all that he had heard, being very sory for <hi>Marcellus</hi> hurt, and well waying euery circumstance of that report, thought that when <hi>Marcellus</hi> was gotten with <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi> out of the Parke so slightly attended, it was to come to him: which added some comfort to his heart, being fully assured thereby, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> had not forsaken him.</p>

Worthy knight, I am glad that I haue found you here, for were you abroad, there are such a number of Knights in search of you, that it were impossible to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape them. For m√©e (qd. he) I thinke you are deceyued. Yea (qd. he) if you are called the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> and lately escaped out of the Lyons den. With that his colour changed.

Syr Knight (qd. <hi>Iahin)</hi> I think it best that you trauell in search of them, and that presently: in the mean time these troubles by forgetfulnes wilbe well ouer-blowne, &amp; then you may haue the better opportunity to go forwards w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any intent you shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward put in practise: for if you stay here, you may vnfortunately be descryed, or the Kings iealousie is such, that hee will leaus no meanes vnattempted to worke your death.</p>

Father (quoth he) your counsell is good, which I will put in practise, not voluntarily, but forced thereto in regard of mine owne preseruation: requesting this one fauour at your handes, that you would by some meanes remember my humble dutie to that honourable knight <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus:</hi> and tell him that it shall not be long ere I returne: desiring him in the meane time (according to his former curtesie, which hath bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended farrebeyond my desert) to remaine my friend, and remember m√©e to <hi>Angelica.</hi> I will (quoth <hi>Iabine)</hi> fulfil your request in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.

The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> liked his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice exc√©edingly well, and armed himselfe in that armour, which was very rich and costly, guilded all ouer with gold and Amell, without any deuise to be knowne by: and in that armour the next night h√©e de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, taking his leaue of olde <hi>Iabine,</hi> with many courtesies, being most vnwilling to leaue his company: and parting with a heauy heart, for that hee went to vndertake a newe trauell, which might detaine him long from returning to <hi>Angelica:</hi> and by good fortune, that night h√©e gat out of the countrey, and past the search of the <hi>Natolians,</hi> whom h√©e did not care to m√©ete withall, but that he would not thereby hinder the speede of his iourney.</p>

And now drawing nigh the Court, in the afternoone when the sunne had with his scorching beames made the season hotte, h√©e heard a gr√©euous complaint, as it s√©emed to his hearing, of some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed ladie, which made him stay to listen which way that crie came, and by the voyce, drawing nigh vnto the place, he espied vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of a heape of Elmes, a knight in Armour, and a Lady at his f√©ete, who were the same that made that mone.

But I pray you (quoth he) let me know your name, for that I haue I am sure s√©ene you about the Forest of <hi>Adre?

                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fame</hi> then immediately remembring her, but b√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnwilling to discouer himselfe, questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ed no more with her, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asked her what that knight was: Sir knight (quoth she) I know him not, nor why he hath offered me this outrage.

Now it hapned, that <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> at that very instant was in the court, who espying <hi>Violetta</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by two knights, the one of them being greeuously wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded and as it were by his countenaunde, &amp; manner of forced comming, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming captiue to the other, and not knowing of any misaduenture that had befallen her, wondred thereat: and comming to her, not wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what sort to salute those Knights, being ignorant of the cause of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ming, he dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded where she had bin?

afternoone, attended by my damozell, I went forth of the court into the groue adioyning to the garden, to recreate my selfe in the cooly shade: where I had not long stayed, but this discurteous Uillaine surprised me, and caught hold of my damzel, who made great exclamation, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my harme, whome he bound both hand and foote: threatning if she made any noyse to murther her. Which done, he tooke me by violence, and halling and pulling me most rudely and discourteously, would haue conueyed me I know not whither, vntill this valiant Knight by good fortune, hearing my complaints, redeemed me from his tyrannie. The King hearing her speeches, commanded the knight to discouer himsefe, but he being exceedingly ashamed, and loath to be knowne, refused the same: but at last, by some of the Bohemian Knighs was vnarmed, when presently <hi>Violetta</hi> knew him, wherewith she gaue an exceeding start, as if she had beene affrighted at his sight. <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Pollipus</hi> likewise knewe him, certifying the King, that it was <hi>Archas,</hi> that had before offered the like villanie to <hi>Violletta,</hi> which the King well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
                     <p>Then he said: Cruell tyrant, what excuse canst thou inuent to shelter this villanie: what canst thou alleage in thy defence, but that thou oughtest to suffer the most reproachful death that can be inuented; but this censure will I giue of thee, not to fauour thee, but to deale iustlie with that Knight, whose Prisoner thou arte, and therefore, as hee by right hath conquered thee, so wee will that hee shall be thy iudge.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> had all this while diligently viewed <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naes</hi> bewtie, her countenance, and euery part of her behauiour, that he tooke great delight in viewing her, but hearing the kings speech, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed his head: whom <hi>Parismus</hi> soone knew, and most louingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced: likewise <hi>Pollipus</hi> &amp; <hi>Violetta</hi> knowing him, saluted him with many courtesies: when presently <hi>Parismus</hi> declared vnto his father, that it was the famous knight that was called the Lnight of <hi>Fame.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King hearing that it was he, of whome he had heard so many honourable reports, rose from his kingly seat, and embraced him most louingly: and euery one in generall, seemed to be most exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with his presence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laurana</hi> beholding his countenance, felt an exceeding throbbing suddainly possesse her heart: withall, such a violent blushing <unclear>flasht</unclear> in

This alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration being wrought in her by a naturall instinct, which shee was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> not vnmindfull to satisfie <hi>Violettaes</hi> wrong, by some reuenge against <hi>Archas,</hi> most humbly thankt the King for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him so much, by giuing him authority to giue his Doome: but (qd. he) I most humbly intreat your Highnes to pardon mee, and desire your Wisedome, to whome hee hath bene offensiue, to vse him as you please: For it were great presumption for mee in this straunge place to censure of him in your Maiesties presence.</p>
                     <p>Then the King called <hi>Archas,</hi> commaunding him to declare what mooued him to commit that outrage to <hi>Violetta?</hi> but h√©e assuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of no lesse then death, would make no answere: Wherevpon the King commanding him to bee had to Prison, appoynted that the next day he should loose his head: Which was accordingly performed: Who might peraduenture haue bene pardoned, but that his owne conscience accused him more then those whome hee had offended, and so according to his owne follie which had brought him to commit all those Wicked acts, euen so hee was his owne Iudge: For that his guiltie conscience would not suffer him to aske pardon. After this iudgement giuen, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans minde was in quiet, hauing sufficiently scanned the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Violettaes</hi> misfortune.</p>

When suddenly the place where they were, beganne to waxe darke, that they could scarce s√©e one another, and they heard a voyce, which they knewe not from whence; Which said, <hi>Parismus</hi> welcome thy sonne <hi>Parisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> long time absent from th√©e: thou n√©edest not doubt of it, for none is so like th√©e in Heroicall qualities; Which saide, the darknesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vanished.</p>
                     <p>By this they all assuredly knew that the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> was sonne to <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Laurana;</hi> Who likewise assured himselfe that hee had found his Parents<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that presently he kn√©eled downe: Whom <hi>Parismus,</hi> the King, the Qu√©ene, and <hi>Laurana,</hi> most louingly all at once incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with theyr kinde embracings, reioycing most exceedingly for ioy that he was found, being vnable by Words, Welcoms, Embracings, or otherwise, to expresse their gladnesse. <hi>Parismus</hi> reioycing that hee had so valiant and vertuous a Sonne, the King and Qu√©ene glad that in theyr olde Age they sawe so vertuous an imposprung foorth of theyr issue to succ√©ede in the Kingdome.

                     <p>Many dayes afterwards the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> who now shall assume his right and proper Name <hi>Parismenos,</hi> continued in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Court, honourablie entertayned, and highly est√©emed of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> States: Who grue into an exc√©eding loue towards him, and was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued of the King and Qu√©ene, but especially of his Parents, who thought themselues moste happie and blessed, to haue such a Sonne: Whose fame was spredde through most places of all the Worlde, and that euery mans eares were filled with the report of his most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable d√©edes.</p>
                     <p>Now that <hi>Parismenos</hi> had thus happily attained the knowledge of his Parents, the want whereof had long time filled his minde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> care, no other thought but of <hi>Angelicas</hi> Loue could take place in his heart, which (though his cause of ioy otherwise was sufficient) filled his sences with sadnesse, and quite extinguisht those delights, that they s√©emed to trouble his minde, rather tedious then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fortable: adding no ease to his cares, which were augmented to an exc√©eding height, by reason of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus</hi> cruelty, which he saw was so much aggrauated against him, that he knew it a thing impossible for him to attaine the least fauour at his hand: Who likewise kept <hi>Angelica</hi> Guarded so strongly, and so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly pryed into all her actions, that it was impossible any way, eyther to come to her sp√©ech, or send to her: that with diuersitie of the cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his hart was tormented, his countenance darkned, and h√©e spent his time most commonly in sadnesse: beeing s√©eldome drawne to any myrth: Which was generally noted of all men, but especiallie of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana,</hi> who could neuer be quiet but onely in his company.</p>

When h√©e had done this, he hasted to his other place of charge: Where when he came, he found his fellow Watchman staying for him, but fast asl√©epe, with the Keyes of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle gate lying by him: Whom <hi>Parismenos</hi> caught in his armes, and before he could recouer his sences, threw him from the Battlements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lake, where he was drowned: Which done, hee went backe to <hi>Angelicaes</hi> Chamber, and opening the doore, entred in, and found <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> in her bad fast a sl√©epe; Whom was in minde at the first to haue awaked her, but beholding her in so sw√©ete a slumber, the awfull regard he bare to her would not suffer him to be so bolde, but still hee stoode by her a good space, being desirous to awake her, yet fearfull to disturbe her quiet rest: at last <hi>Anna</hi> awaked, who continually was her Bedfellow.

they hadde it not, then beganne a corontuersie amongst them, enquiring who it was that came out last, but the truth thereof they could not learne, that they began to suspect each other, and that she that had the key had lost the same, and would not be knowne thereof: that at last they began to knocke first softly, and then hard, but none made answere, which draue them all into an extreame perplexitie, and with much ado, to rid themselues of that fear, they got vpon the doore, where at there comming they could not finde <hi>Angelica,</hi> but found some of her ornaments cast in the middest of the floore: that then with wringing their hands, tearing their haire, and renting their ornaments, they made such an outcrie and exclamation, that all the court rung thereof: which caused the Queene, the Nobles and almost all the whole court gather to that place, where the Queene being come, and knowing the cause of their sorrow sat down amongst them, opprest with care, and vttered these speeches: Peace, peace, giue ouer this vaine lamentation, for you know not for whom you mourne, it was not <hi>Angelica</hi> you had the custodie of, therefore cease your laments, and giue me leaue to mourne, that haue iust cause: who am a partie of all these woes, that at once haue lost the company of both my deare children, and all procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Maximus</hi> misdoubt, who left <hi>Angelica</hi> in the maiden Tower, who is stolen from thence, and now my sonne <hi>Marcellus</hi> with <hi>Dulcia</hi> is likewise fled.

                        <hi>Maximus</hi> was so enraged with his sp√©eches, that hee aunswered: What madnes doth possesse thy minde, that standest vpon such termes of resistance, when thou seest thousands of Armed Souldiers to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe thy life? thinkest thou with boasting sp√©eches to auoid my displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and disappoint my reuenge? no, wert thou the greatest Potentate in the World, thou couldest not escape my hands: With that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Knights to apprehend him by force; Who presently began to enter vpon him, but hee (by reason of the narrownesse of the Way) stoode in his owne Defence, and flewe the first that came; and after him another, and behaued himselfe so couragiously, that which of them first entred, first dyed: and had they all assayed to enter that way, he would haue slaine them all.</p>

By this time the <hi>Getulians</hi> had beaten downe a great part of the Chappell, and rushed violently vpon <hi>Parismenos:</hi> Who disdained to be forced to y√©eld, before they could ouercome him, sent many of their ghosts to hell, but in the ende by their multitude, hee was so thronged,

that he could not lift his armes to strike another blow, and so was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to y√©elde, whome <hi>Maximus</hi> commaunded to be first bound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> seeing this, with w√©eping eyes humbled her selfe vpon her knee to her Father, and saide; I beseech your Maiestie vse that Knight honourablie, on whose safetie my life dependeth: More she would haue said, but <hi>Maximus</hi> cut her off with these sp√©eches; Poore, shamelesse, and disobedient creature, Pleadest thou for him, and not rather for pardon for thy owne shamelesse d√©edes? Holde thy tongue: for I will not heare th√©e speake a Word more. With that hee commaunded them all to be apprehended, and so he departed with them to the Court: first impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and Gyuing him withboltes and fetters of Iron, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting him into a most leathsome, stinking, and darke Dungeon. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> he caused likewise to be discrobed of her Ornaments, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Prison, with <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Dulcia,</hi> vntill they had more leysure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermine of them. <hi>Marcellus</hi> at the instant intreaties of the Qu√©ene and Nobles, he did not Imprison, but with many rebukes and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches banisht him his presence: vowing if that euer he came in his sight, he should loose his head.</p>
                     <p>To rehearse the seuerall complaintes <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Dulcia</hi> made, would bee tedious to reccount, and too grieuous to recite, for they were such as would force salte teares from Tyrants eyes, pierce the stonie Rockes, and mollifie the hardened-Hearts of the most rude, cruell, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and inhumane monsters in the whole Worlde, being hardly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, scantly Dieted, and badly Lodged: That <hi>Maximus</hi> often hearing theyr plaints, pittied their Laments, yet therewith was rather drawne to more seueritie, then any way mollified.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:219"/>
Many dayes being past, <hi>Maximus</hi> assembled all his Noble P√©eres, and Estates of the Countrey togither, to determine what to doo with <hi>Parismenos,</hi> against whome many Accusations were layde, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the breache of their Lawes, especially that of <hi>Angelicaes</hi> Rape: Which was amongst them punished with death, and that so seuerely, as that none escaped; whom the King in open Audience condemned to dye the same death that theyr Lawes yeelded, which was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Dulcia</hi> likewise they condemned to perpetuall imprisonment: but for the Kings children, by the Lawes, they were to stand at their Parents disposition.</p>
                     <p>This Newes was soone conueyed to <hi>Marcellus</hi> knowledge, which strooke an exceeding torment to his heart: Which rather then he would endure to s√©e, h√©e would execute his owne death desperately, to saue his Friend, that hee fared like a Madde-man, and wheresoeuer he became, hee made those that beheld him wonder, to s√©e him so altered in gesture, and so suddenly that hee quite forsooke the Court, and continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Lady <hi>Panoraes</hi> house, so secretly, that none knew what was become of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hauing continued many daies in the loathsome dungeon, maruelling that he could heare no newes from <hi>Angelica,</hi> and also that <hi>Marcellus</hi> had forgotten to y√©eld him comfort in his greatest extremity, thought that eyther they were imprisoned, or else that the King in his Furie, had executed some cruell reuenge vpon them. These cares on the one side were sufficient torments, and his harde imprisonment and cruell vsage on the other side, enough to kill the stoutest heart, that had he not bene preserued by admyrable and strange operation, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue endured those calamities. At last hee beganne to dispaire of all hopes, and suddenly to recall his Sences, and with more comfort to studie howe to release himselfe: And amongst many thousands of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises which came into his Fancie, he deuised how to entice the Keeper to come into the Dungeon, which hee thus contriued. The next time the Iaylor came to bring him his vsuall Dyet, he fained himselfe to bee exc√©edingly sicke, and groaned as though hee had gasped for his latest breath. The Iaylor hearing him make such moane, asked him what hee ayled. To whome <hi>Parismenos</hi> saide: Good Iaylor, the date of my life is now at an ende, so that I neuer looke to s√©e the day light againe, b√©eing of all men most vnfortunate, to ende my wretched life in this place, that might haue liued in great dignitie in mine own Countrey:
<pb facs="tcp:16915:220"/>
but now past hope of all comfort: onely to th√©e am I able to doo good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I die, I haue good store of Golde and Iewells about m√©e, which I will giue vnto thee, if thou wilt but doo thy endeuour to saue my life, for that I am yet in hope of his mercie: and withall, I will declare vnto th√©e, where thou shalt haue more Riches then thou wilt euer be able to spend. All this will I doo for th√©e, if thou wilt helpe me out of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable life, to y√©elde me same of thy helpe, for that I am fallen, and am not able to rise. Manie other perswasions <hi>Parismenos</hi> vsed, which wrought so effectually with the Iaylor, that inticed with hope of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Wealth, and past feare of him that was so weake, hee opened the Dungion without any feare or doubt, (being thereto guided by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niue prouidence) and came to <hi>Parismenos;</hi> Who no sooner sawe him within reach of his armes, (retaining a most manly courage notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Weakenesse) gathering all his strength together, caught holde on him and ouerthrewe him, and getting vppon him with swifte crawling, for that he was not able to stand by reason of his Boltes, and hauing him vnder him, neuer left strugling and striuing with him, vntill he had strangled him. Then taking the Bunch of Keyes vp, hee loosened and vnlockt all the Bolts that were fastened to his legs, necke, and other parts of his bodie: Which when hee had done, prostrating himselfe vpon his Kn√©es, he praised God for that happie successe: Then presently without delay, hee stript off all the Iaylors Apparell, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled himselfe therwith, casting his body into the further ende of the Dungion, and so went out, and locked the Dungion doore after him.</p>
                     <p>By this time it began to be darke: Which was a meanes to further him in his escape, that in the Iaylors apparell he went into the Court, with the keyes at his gyrdle, and the Iaylors Fanchion, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ware about him, and met with diuers, passing by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspition, and from thence hee got out at the Court-gates, beeing of euery one taken for the Iaylor.</p>

the Campes, h√©e would there m√©ete him, and conclude a peace for one day, which the king of <hi>Natolia</hi> accepted. When they were met, <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> began as followeth: Prince of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> what is it thou crauest at my hands? or wherefore hast thou brought, contrary to the lawes of Kings, a band of souldiers into this countrey, where thou act not to set foote without my license? <hi>Natolian</hi> Tyrant (quoth hee) I come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d√©eme my sonne, whome thou hast murtheren contrary to lawe, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and equitie, whose blood I require at thy vniust and cruell hands, also to reuenge the manifolde wrongs thou hast done him, by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall and false accusation of the King of <hi>Libia</hi> here present. <hi>Parismus</hi> (quoth he) I haue done nothing to thy son, but according to the lawes of this land, which punisheth rape, especially of a Kings daughter, with death. My sonne (quoth he) neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mitted any such act, but carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Angelica,</hi> with her willing consent, whereby he is vniustly iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: withall, I demaund her of th√©e, as of right belonging vnto him, for that sh√©e is his betrothed wife, whome I will haue before I leaue <hi>Natolia,</hi> or s√©e the ruine of th√©e and of thy kingdome: therefore y√©elde her into my custodie. With that <hi>Santodeloboro</hi> stept forth and saide: Thinkest thou Bohemian to commaund vs in this place, thou art too weake, therefore be gon quickly, or thou shalt soone s√©e so many Moores here, as shall confound thy sences with amazement.

Many other sp√©eches past betwixt them, wherewith in the ende <hi>Maximus</hi> was so enraged, that he sware by heauen and earth, that hee would rather s√©e his own death, his countries wracke, and <hi>Angelicaes</hi> destruction, before she should be giuen to his custodie, and so departed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> was exc√©edingly troubled when he heard <hi>Maximus</hi> sp√©eches, whom he knew to be of so cruel a disposition, that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ind√©ede s√©e her death, then be crost of his will, that he continued in great care and continuall torment of minde.

<pb facs="tcp:16915:226"/>
and his posteritie, that it is not valor, but wilfulnesse, that maketh him resolute: theyr foes likewise, are so much weakened by the last slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we made amongst them, that if wee can giue them another sudden Onset, they will be vtterly dismayed: Besides, the Kings eldest sonne <hi>Marc,</hi> is my deare Friend, on whose faith and fidelitie, I durst repose my life: Who if he could attaine the Cittie, would be ready to aide vs; Therefore so pleasath you, let vs giue the Onset, when they are in their dead sl√©epe, which will bring such terror and amazement to their harts, that they will be like men amazed. <hi>Parismus</hi> hearing his Words, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his counsell very well: And thus hee contriued this businesse, the Band should be diuided into thr√©e parts: the one to be vnder the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of himselfe, the other vnder <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and the third vnder <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus:</hi> Which was so secretly done, that the <hi>Getulians</hi> had not the least knowledge thereof.</p>
                     <p>About midnight, when all things were at silence, and the <hi>Getulians</hi> voyde of suspition, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> left theyr Tants, and <hi>Pollipus</hi> with his forces gaue the Onset, violently rushing into the <hi>Getulians</hi> Camp, on that side was next them. <hi>Parismenos</hi> went betwixt them and the Citie. And the Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> marched about with his forces and inuaded them on the backe side. The Getulians being then in their d√©epe sl√©epe, and without the least thought of any such inuasion, were so amazed with this assault, that they ranne vp and downe, some wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponlesse, and some halfe armed, and some with their swordes onely: and the Bohemians in the midst of them, making an exc√©eding slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Libia</hi> and <hi>Santodelodoro</hi> were so eager, that they ran vp and downe calling for their Armour, and crying out, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, courage. And being armed, they began to courage their amazed souldiers, with many comfortable sp√©eches, but the Bohemians were so thicke amongst them, and had so much disordered them, that some of them lost their liues as they were putting on their armour: others were slaughtered, euen whilest the sl√©epe were in their eyes: others strooken dead, as they were lifting their armes to strike the first blowe: and some slaine before they could recall their sences from amazement: there might one heare the dismall grones of murdred soules: there might one perceiue slaughter in her royaltie, and reuenge filleth his thirstie heart with blood: feare stood trembling in his right hew, terror appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Moores gastly lookes, and victory on the Bohemians swords.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:226"/>
The Prince behinde them, slaughtering some before they could looke backe. <hi>Pollipus</hi> before them with his furie, parting the soules from the bodies. And <hi>Parismenos</hi> with his bloody Swoorde, cutting off theyr passage to the Citie. The Prince met with <hi>Santodelodoro,</hi> and made him fl√©e to saue himselfe from death. <hi>Pollipus</hi> met with <hi>Pridamor,</hi> and gaue him so many Woundes, that hee durst no longer abide his sight: <hi>Parismenos,</hi> turned backe the King of <hi>Lybiaes</hi> steppes, hasting to the Cittie, and pursued him with such eager chase, and gaue him so manie grieuous Woundes, that had hee not withdrewe, and held himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst a throng of <hi>Lybians,</hi> he had died by his hands. All the <hi>Natolia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s</hi> were amazed, terrified, discouraged and confounded in their thoughtes, being so cruelly and valiantly assaulted by the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to flie and forsake the Campe, euery one shifting to saue his life: ther was such a cry, that the noise therof was heard into the Citty. The Cittizens, supposing there had bin some mutiny in the Camp, amongst Souldiers, ranne out at the Gates: Which aduantage <hi>Parismenos</hi> soone espyed, and got their possession. Then began the Cittizens to crie out, and ran with amazed terror: the Beacons were set on fire, the bels rung out with a confused noise, &amp; euery signe of amazement was made. This noise soone came to <hi>Maximus</hi> hearing, who vexed with a <hi>chaos</hi> of confused thoughts, caught vp a sword, and in a desperate furie ran into the Citie, the Knights be tooke them to their Armor, the Ladies forsooke their Beddes, wringing their hands, and making great lamentations. <hi>Angelica</hi> affrighted with their cryes, apparelled her selfe, not knowing what this great tumult should pretend. <hi>Marcellus</hi> likewise was with the noyse awakened from his sl√©epe, and leauing <hi>Panoraes</hi> house, with his Sword in the one hand, and his Doublet in the other, ran out into the open str√©etes, to s√©e what might be the cause of this vprore. By this time the str√©etes were filled with Souldiers, and <hi>Parismenos</hi> was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Court-gates: Where he met with <hi>Maximus</hi> the King, but would not offer to touch him: Who like a furious, mad, and desperate man, ranne amongst the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Souldiers, brandishing his sword, and slaughtering such as stood next him, where he met with <hi>Marcellus</hi> ranging about, starke mad with griefe; Who desired him to withdraw himselfe, least he were destroyed by the common-Souldyers: but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing his counsell, and ouercome with mad Frenzie, rushed in amongst the thickest of them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By this time <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> was come to the Court, fearing least the Souldiers should enter, and affreight the Qu√©ene and <hi>Angelica,</hi> Where hee found <hi>Parismenos,</hi> though vnknowne, k√©eping the Entrance, running at him most furis ously; To whom <hi>Parismenos</hi> saide: <hi>Marcellus</hi> holde thy hands, here is none but Friends. With that word he saide; Who art thou that knowest me? I am (qd. he) a friend to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and wish you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your selfe into the Court, least you be hurt amongst my souldiers. <hi>Marcellus</hi> hearing his sp√©eches, stept within the Court-Gates. By this time the Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Pollipus</hi> had put the <hi>Natolian</hi> forces to fleight, and taken <hi>Santodelodoro</hi> and <hi>Pridamor</hi> prisoners, the king of <hi>Lybia</hi> was fled, the common-Souldyers had ransackt the Campe, and beganne to sacke the Citty, vntill the day began to appeare: and the Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Pollipus</hi> hauing attained victorie, gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement that none vpon paine of death should offer to enter any of the Citizens houses.</p>
                     <p>The Nobles s√©eing what slaughter the <hi>Bohemians</hi> had made, how the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Lybians</hi> were fledde, and the Cittie ready to be sackt, came to the Qu√©ene, and certified her the trueth of all. Who missing <hi>Maximus,</hi> carelesly ranne into the Cittie to s√©eke him, renting her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and making exc√©eding mone: and at last found him troden to death, and not slaughtered by mans force, but by the brute Beasts: ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting her selfe carelesly and desperately vpon his dead Corpes, vttering many lamentable sp√©eches, vntill the Nobles withheld her, from dooing her salfe violence, which shee often intended, and taking vp the dead kings corps, carried him to the Court with great lamentation.</p>

                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> camming to <hi>Parismus,</hi> with a kinde behauiour, said; Most Noble Prince of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> I bes√©ech you stay your incensed wrath, and s√©eke not the Ruine and Destruction of this Cittie and vs: For <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> being dead, there is none that will make resistance, but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine you with willing harts, being alwaies vnwilling to haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued you to s√©eke this Reuenge: but that it was not in vs to contradict <hi>Maximus</hi> will: Who was rather ledde and ouerruled by rags then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise: Therefore we y√©elde our selues to your mercie. <hi>Parismus</hi> beeing certified that it was <hi>Marcellus</hi> whome loued <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

                     <p>Noble Prince, thinke that I sought no way to iniure you, but to red√©eme my Sonne, and reuenge his wrong: Which now the iust Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens haue executed in my behalfe: but what restitution can be made me for his lesse: Whose vntimely death was noted by <hi>Maximus</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?

Which wordes <hi>Marcellus</hi> spake in the hearing and presence of all the Nobles and P√©ers of his Land: who likewise (notwithstanding the slaughter the <hi>Bohemians</hi> hadde made) willingly ratified his sp√©eches, with their vnconstrained consent.</p>

that knowledge: for an excending feare of his death doth still trouble my Sences, which if I were assured of, then would I soone resolue to followe him, for that without him, I am not, for in him I liue, and in his death my life confisteth. With that an exceeding ouer-flowing of teares stopt the passage of her speeche, that for inward hearts sorrowe, she could not vtter a word more.</p>

Which superstitions custome, is in such vse, and of such high regard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, that they account it not lawfull for any to marrie, before they haue performed those rights, reputing them for accurst, that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the same, and est√©eming them inricht with many blessings, that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute those superstitions, with most deuotions. The manner whereof is this: the Brides are adorned with rich Ornaments, and Crowned with Garlands of Flowers, and in that sort they go to the Temple, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by one Damozel, which carrieth their incense, which is balles of Frankensence, and Rosewater which themselues cast into the fire, that burneth vpon the Alter: Which done, <hi>Hymens</hi> Priest sayeth certaine prayers, and vseth to blesse them with many inuocations, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise done, the Bride continueth after that saying many praiers to <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> such as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Uotaries haue framed.

The doore being fastned by the Priest, the knights returned backe to the Court, and the Ladies departed vntill the time of her returne, which would be within thr√©e houres. The Priest wanting something that belonged to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, went into the house to fetch the same, where h√©e was no sooner entred, but he saw certaine knights, who suddainly laid hands on him. The Priest maruelling at this outrage, demaunded what they were, and therefore they came, to whom one of them said: We come for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> and her we will haue: and therefore speake but a word more and thou diest. With that one of the chiefest of them, demmaunded 2. of his seruants to k√©epe him fast. Which done, he alone with one more, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Temple, where he found her staying for the Priest, <hi>Angelica</hi> s√©eing two Knights in Armour enter the Temple, was with that sight suddenly agast, fearing some trecherie, as ind√©ed it fell out. For one of those knights came to <hi>Angelica,</hi> and told her, that she must goe with him. Which said: he tooke her by the hand to lead her out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: with that <hi>Anna</hi> began to shrike and cry out, but the other knights drawing foorth a dagger, swore that if she did offer to cry he would split his heart. <hi>Ang.</hi> well vnderstanding, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this vilanous act was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>plotted by treacherie, thus said. Uillain, what outrage is this thou offerest, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will thou conuey me, what treason dost thou intend? Peace Lady (quoth he) for I must and will carrie you with me: neither make any resistance, for that which I came for, I will perform. Then he tooke her by the arme, and led her with force out of the Temple, into the Priests house, where she saw the Priest bound. And from out of his house they conueyed her into a Litter, which was close, that though sh√©e made great lamentation, yet she could not be heard, and causing <hi>Anna</hi> to mount vp behinde a knight, they carried them away with the Priest: which they did so closely and with such expedition, that they escaped away vndsecried, by reason the Temple stood on the outside of the Citie.</p>

Now this Knight that carried away <hi>Angelica,</hi> was the barbarous King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> named <hi>Irus,</hi> who long time before <hi>Parismenos</hi> arriuall in <hi>Getulia,</hi> had bin a sutor to <hi>Angelica,</hi> but was denied her by <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and departed from thence in a discontented vaine, who hauing soiourned many daies in <hi>Getulia,</hi> was well aquainted with their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, and hearing all that befallen in the Court, and of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> death, had manie daies awaited this opportunitie, well knowing before that she would come to <hi>Hymens</hi> Temple, to offer the acusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med sacrifice: came at the very instant and surprized them, and hauing past without suspition out of the suburbs of the Citie, hasted with all sp√©ede h√©e could towards his countrie. And by the way as h√©e went, they entered at thicke wood, where <hi>Irus</hi> purposed to rest himselfe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which way to take, fearing to be surprised, for that he knew she should be soone mist: he had not stayed there long, but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried by certaine Knights that ltued in those woods: the cause of whose abode in that place shall be declared in the next Chapter: who hearing many lamentatons that <hi>Anna</hi> made, set vpon <hi>Irus</hi> whome they thought to be a personage of great estate, and by the richnesse of his Armour, which was on the skirts and sides enamelled and besette with rich stones, all ouer besette with bl√©eding hearts of Azure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Irus</hi> s√©eing himselfe thus beset, drew his sword in his defence, with that one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> companie blew a horne, wherewith there suddenly came out tenne in Armour, with the rest of their fellowes, equalling the number that was with <hi>Irus,</hi> betw√©ene whom began a most sincere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which continued so long, that there were some flaine of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Hymens</hi> Priest, in this time secretly stole away. And <hi>Angelica</hi> being in the Litter, looked out thereat, beholding that cruell fight, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling what those should be, that had stolen her from the Temple, and what those should be that sought to rescue her from them, but sh√©e was so exc√©edingly opprest with terror, that her vitall sences were readie to y√©eld vp her latest breath.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Irus</hi> Knights were most of them, slaine, and some gr√©euously wounded, sauing <hi>Irus,</hi> who being a Knight of resolued cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, continued the combat with great valour against his assailliant, who seemed to be a Knight of exceeding courage, as he was indeed, and by his strength soone brought <hi>Irus</hi> within his mercie: who fearing his death, desired the Knight to holde his hand. Tell me then what thou

I will not (quoth he) tell th√©e my name, but I am of <hi>Tunis, Angelica</hi> hearing that word, gaue a sudden shrike, wherewith the Knight looking backe, beheld her most exc√©eding beautie, which was beautified with her Garland of flowers, that h√©e stoode as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat, taking her rather to be a diuine, then a mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: that he said.

                     <p>In this sort continued they all many dayes, being voyde of all hope, but onely to heare some Welcome newes by such Knightes as were gone in searche of <hi>Angelica:</hi> Whose diligence they knewe would bee great in that behalfe.</p>

                     <p>H√©e was no sooner gone, but he was as soone mist at the Court, for whose absence great sorrow was made. And the next day many of his Knights went in search of him: From whome hee secretly shrowded himselfe, and sawe some of them: Whome had they s√©ene him, they could not haue knowne him in that disguised Armour.</p>

                     <p>Knight (quoth hee,) What art thou that offerest me this outrage? I knowe th√©e not, neyther haue I offended th√©e.

to this estate, espied another Knight comming out of the wood, which made him leaue <hi>Irus,</hi> and follow him, and ouertooke him at the woods side, to whome he saide: Knight, Who art thou? The Knight looking backe, seeing his swoord bloodie, and his Armour battered, seeming to haue come from some cruell skirmish, and disdaining at him to be so peremptorily examined, answered. What art thou that examinest me in this place?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> being exceedingly enraged before by the smart of some Wound he had before receiued, saide. I am one that will knowe what thou art before I leaue th√©e: and with that word, strooke at him. The Knight likewise drawing his swoord to reuenge that blowe, but he was farre vnable to withstand <hi>Parismenos,</hi> that he was soone by his vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Chiualrie most grieuously Wounded, and in some parte disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: <hi>Parismenos</hi> striking another forcible blowe at him, hit him right where the Armour was broken, and with violence the Sworde pierced his heart, and h√©e fell downe dead, without speaking a word. Which done, <hi>Parismenos</hi> pulled off his Helmet, to see if he knewe him, but he knew him not.</p>
                     <p>Syr <hi>Iconius</hi> hearing the noyse of the clashing of theyr Armour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then abroade, drewe towards the place where <hi>Irus</hi> lay, gasping for breath: Whome hee presently knewe to bee the same Knight from whom he had before rescued <hi>Angelica,</hi> and putting off his Helmet, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently knew him to be his d√©ere friende <hi>Irus,</hi> for whose sake he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. So that taking him vppe, he conueyed him to the Caue, with great diligence, labouring to reuiue him, which by his Industrie h√©e at last attained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anna</hi> comming to haue a sight of this Knights comming in, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently knewe him by his Armour to be the same that had with violence taken both <hi>Angelica</hi> and her out of <hi>Hymens</hi> Temple, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Knights his name, they answered, none of them knew him, for none but <hi>Iconius</hi> knewe him. <hi>Angelica</hi> being now somewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recouered, <hi>Anna</hi> made knowne to her what shee had s√©ene, but could not learne the Knights name. <hi>Anna</hi> (qd. she) neuer enquire his name, but viewe him well, and thou shalt soone finde him to bee <hi>Irus,</hi> King of <hi>Tunis:</hi> For diddest thou not heare him say, how that he was of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> when <hi>Iconius</hi> rescued mee from him?

by his approach: For <hi>Iconius</hi> and hee are of such familiaritie, that whereas before I had almost woonne his consent to conuey mee to the <hi>Getulian</hi> Court, I am now out of all comfort of that, for <hi>Irus</hi> will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeke to conuey me into <hi>Tunis:</hi> So that now I feare mee, I shall neuer see my beloued Knight <hi>Parismenos,</hi> but must bee subiect to his power, Who I know will according to his barbarous disposition, vse me badly: that I know not <hi>Anna,</hi> what to doo in this extreamitie, but rather then I will subiect my selfe to his Will, I will sooner bee the executioner of mine owne death, and first rippe my accursed heart out of my troubled brest.</p>

                        <hi>Anna</hi> then comforted her by many perswasions, putting her in some hope, yet in the ende to attaine a happie issue, to all these vnfortunate Euents. <hi>Parismenos</hi> hauing slaine the Knight, returned to the place where he left <hi>Irus,</hi> but found him not: Which made him maruell what was become of him, thinking that he was escaped and fled.</p>
                     <p>And againe, being weary and somewhat Wounded, he got himselfe to his secret couert, to rest, where he determined to spend the remnant of his life: Where he continued many dayes after; In which time <hi>Irus</hi> being in the Caue with <hi>Iconius,</hi> had recouered his health, and knewe <hi>Iconius</hi> his olde Friende, to bee the man that had before endaungered his life, by taking <hi>Angelica</hi> from him, and leauing him to <hi>Parisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> for which hee had now made him amends, by bringing him to his Caue that was likely to perish, so that when he came first to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these things he vttered these speeches.</p>

I haue long since heard of your Banishment from the <hi>Getulian-</hi>Courte, and onely for my sake: And withall, hearde how strictly <hi>Maximus</hi> sought your life: Who beeing come to my knowledge, I sought diligently to find you out, with intent to haue carryed you with me into <hi>Tunis:</hi> but since I haue now so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily found, and haue much more cause to loue you: let me intreate you to leaue this Desart, and depart with mee to <hi>Tunis,</hi> where I meane to preferre you to greater Dignitie and honour then euer you haue had in <hi>Getulia.</hi>

                     <p>Good Friende <hi>Iconius</hi> (quoth he) I will declare vnto you the truth of all. Then he declared the truthe, how hee had stolne <hi>Angelica</hi> out of <hi>Hymens</hi> Temple, and how she was rescued from him in that place. And withall, declared all that he knewe of the estate of <hi>Getulia:</hi> and of his latest comming from thence: and how he met with a Knight in that Woodde, that had brought him by his valiant behauiour n√©ere his death.</p>

                        <hi>Iconius</hi> hearing the report of the varietie of his Aduentures, made him this answere. Pardon mee Noble <hi>Irus,</hi> for it was my selfe that tooke the Lady <hi>Angelica</hi> from you, not knowing who you were, who is within this Caue.</p>

                        <hi>Irns</hi> hearing his sp√©eches, caught him in his armes for ioy, saying. My deare Friende <hi>Iconius,</hi> Was it you that tooke <hi>Angelica</hi> from me? How was it, that I knewe you not, nor you mee? And how fortunate, and tenne thousand times blest may I bee by your meanes, if you will but continue my trusty friende, as heretofore you haue bene, by letting me onely haue a sight of <hi>Angelica?</hi> My Lord (quoth he againe, I haue not forgotten, nor yet once diminished my former friendship, but will commit the custodie of <hi>Angelica</hi> to none but your selfe: For none but your selfe are Woorthy of her, or none so Woorthie: only if you please to follow my counsell, doo not at the first motion your former sute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, but vse her kindely, and rather for a time dissemble the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of your passion: for I perceiue shee is most d√©epely inthralled to the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Knight <hi>Parismenos,</hi> that to make any other Loue to her at the first, will rather increase her Affections: but when shee is without hope of finding him againe, then time will soone alter her minde, for Womens affections are subiect to varietie. <hi>Irus</hi> then tolde him, that he did like his counsell exc√©edingly well: and withall, y√©elded him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thankes, for that hee hadde so found his most true and loyall friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>

What eyes that haue beheld such Crueltie, can abstaine from sheadding infinite floods of brinish salt teares?

And when all these are happened, and so any occasions of discontent concurred togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet in the middest, one mischiefe greater then all the rest is befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to mee.</p>

                     <p>Good Ladie cast aside all such feare, for <hi>Irus</hi> shall not so much ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule mee, as once to make me falsifie my Word: Neyther doo I thinke hee is of any such disposition; but if hee b√©e I care not: For what I haue promised I will vndoubtedly performe: and would haue done it before this time, but that your health would not permit the same.</p>
                     <p>Many other sp√©eches past betw√©ene them, till at last <hi>Iconius</hi> left her, and going to <hi>Irus,</hi> tolde him all the sp√©eches that had passed betw√©ene him and <hi>Angelica:</hi> Who by <hi>Iconins</hi> counsell dissembled his affection: and though he were often in <hi>Angelicaes</hi> company, he made no shew of such earnest Loue, yet carelesly made recitall of his former deuotions: Which he so cunningly dissembled, that <hi>Angelica</hi> began to rest in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Iconius</hi> fidelitie: and in a perswasion that <hi>Irus</hi> had also giuen ouer his hote Loue, and by that meanes she began to gather more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to her abated spirits; Which by reason of those great troubles she had past, and her late Sicknesse, were brought into a weake operation.

which <hi>Iconius</hi> still made his excuse, to the frustrating of her desired departure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> likewise all this time, wandred vp and downe the Desart, liuing poorely vpon hard and wilde fruite, and lying vpon the earth in his armor, that the haire which then begun to bud, had with a carelesse groweth shadowed some parte of his face, which was growne to a great length, and his complexion so much altered by care, that h√©e could hardly be knowne of those that were familiarlie acquainted with him before.

Why (quoth he) did hee that d√©ede? Because (quoth she) <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> would not giue consent to his wicked Lust. Where is he now (saide hee?)</p>
                     <p>

I know not, answered <hi>Anna,</hi> neyther doe I care. With that <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> perceiuing the tract of blood that went out of the Chamber, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the same to his bed: Which he found all bestained therewith: and againe, followed the blood to the Caues mouth, that hee was assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>Irus</hi> was slaine, that in a monstrous rage, he ranne in againe to <hi>Anna,</hi> saying: <hi>Irus</hi> is murthered, and you haue done the d√©ede.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anna</hi> then, knowing her selfe guiltie, stoode as one confounded with feare: but at last reuiuing her selfe from her dumps, shee said: If I did murther him, I did it but to saue my owne life, and <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaes</hi> honour. With that hee was so enraged, that hee drue his Sword, and in a furie would haue slaine her, but that she with sp√©ede ranne out of the roome, and hee after her, ready to strike her dead. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismenos</hi> hearing that noyse, and s√©eing <hi>Iconius</hi> pursuing the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell, being of a quicke conceit, euen as the blow was descending, stept vnder the Sword, and caught the blow: Which otherwise had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d her life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iconius</hi> being inraged, strooke another at him, vntill <hi>Parismenos</hi> drawing his Sworde, saide: Holde your hands, and knowe whome thou strikest, or I will gore my Sworde in thy heart blood. Pardon me good Knight (quoth hee) Rage made me forget my selfe. What Damozell is that (quoth <hi>Parismenos)</hi> you would haue slaine? It is (quoth hee) one that hath murthered my deare friend. By this time some of them had caught <hi>Anna,</hi> and brought her backe; Whom <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> offered againe to haue slaine, but that <hi>Parismenos</hi> hauing s√©ene her countenance, knewe her: and staying <hi>Iconius</hi> againe, saide. Be not so rash without aduisement, to lay such violent handes on a sillie Damozell, and before you execute reuenge, be better aduised, and first knowe the truth of the fact she hath committed, and vpon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion sh√©e was vrged thereto.</p>
                     <p>I will not (quoth <hi>Iconius)</hi> followe your counsell, but now shee hauing confest the d√©ede, I will be seuerely reuenged by her life, and nothing else shall make me satisfaction for his blood, which shee hath shead.</p>
                     <p>Discourteous Knight (qd. he) art thou voyde of humanitie, or doo I wish th√©e to doo any thing that disagreeth to reason? I sweare by Heauen, let but a haire of her head perish by thy accursed hand, and
<pb facs="tcp:16915:242"/>
thy death shall be the ransome: Here doe I stand in her defence, and therefore the prowdest of you all touch her, and if you dare. With that <hi>Iconius</hi> said: Doest thou requite my friendship in this sorte, to take part with my enimies? or tell me, Doost thou know that Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell, that thou standest so peremytorily in her defence? I doo nothing but that which euery Knight is bound vnto: Which is, to defend La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wrong: Neither doo I know this Damozell, but will defend her, for that shee is a Lady: vntill I may know, Whether you offer this outrage against her wrongfully, or by iust desert: Which once tryed, doo then what thou wilt with her. Then <hi>Iconius</hi> said. Damozel, tell me why thou sluest him? <hi>Anna</hi> made this answere: Hee offered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to <hi>Angelica,</hi> and with his ponyard attempted to slay her: Who will tell you the truth of all. With that, they altogether went into the roome where <hi>Angelica</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> beholding her, hadde much a doo to withholde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from bewraying what hee was: but yet with constrained for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, be stood still, and heard her declare <hi>Irus</hi> Wicked behauiour, and in what manner she hadde wrought reuenge against him.</p>
                     <p>With that <hi>Iconius</hi> saide: Wicked Woman, couldest thou not haue wrought some other meanes to disappoint his intent, which I can hardly belieue, but that thou must murther him? Heauen nor Earth shall not throwde th√©e from my furie: For being the vntimely death of that louing, kinde, and couragious King, neither shall any thing but thy destruction appease my wrath, for the losse of my deare friende <hi>Irus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hearing him name <hi>Irus,</hi> saide: Was it that treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and disloyall villaine, <hi>Irus,</hi> that slaue? Damozell thou hast well reuenged the wrongs he hath done me, vpon his own accursed head; and therefore will I be thy defence, and shielde th√©e from harme. For had I met him my selfe, I would haue done no lesse then thou haste: for he was the most dishonourable Knight that euer drewe breath.</p>
                     <p>But tell mee (quoth hee) to <hi>Iconius,</hi> What art thou that offerest such cowardly violence to resistlesse Ladies, and imprisonest them in such sort, and also bearest so disloyall a minde, as to vpholde him in his villanie?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iconius</hi> was so enraged with his Words, that hee saide: Base
<pb facs="tcp:16915:242"/>
Uillaine: Did I but lately take th√©e vp as a Runaway, and brought th√©e to my Cell, of pitty to succour thy distressed estate, and doest thou thus requite my kindenesse, to become my examiner?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hearing his sp√©eches, so much disdained them, that he let driue at him with irefull violent blowes, and with such furie, that he draue <hi>Iconius</hi> backwards out of the roome: and withall, gaue him so many Woundes, that had not some of his Associates stept to him, he had bene slaine: When thr√©e of them at once assailed <hi>Parismenos,</hi> but by his inuincible valour, first one of them, and then another lost their liues: Which <hi>Iconius</hi> s√©eing, he would very faine haue stayed to haue spoken to him, but his hart being set on reuenge, and desirous to haue the Possession of <hi>Angelica</hi> againe, followed his fight with such rigour, that he had well neere slaine <hi>Iconius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this time some of the other came in; Who s√©eing <hi>Iconius</hi> in such danger, by the valour of that one Knight, admired his Chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and stept to rescue him from his violence: Which when they had done, <hi>Iconius</hi> saide, Knight, tell mee what thou art, that knowing thy Name, I may know whome it is I resist? My name (quoth he) is <hi>Parismenos.</hi> With that <hi>Iconius</hi> floong away his sword, and said; Most honourable Knight, I yeeld my selfe to your mercie, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name doo I honour, vowing that it is against my Will, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I offended you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hearing his words, saide. And if thou b√©est my friente (quoth he) I am sorie, not that I met th√©e, but that I haue hurt th√©e: Which saide, hee entred into the Roome where <hi>Angelica</hi> was, and comming to her, not being able to vse any delay, but forced by desire to comfort her heart, by giuing her knowledge of his safetie, pulling off his Helmet, that she might behold his face, he saide. My deare La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Angelica,</hi> behold your poore Friende <hi>Parismenos. Angelica</hi> then knowing him with a modest behauiour, clasping, her Arms about his necke, and sealed a number of sw√©ete kisses vpon his Lippes: Whth done, and withdrawing her armes againe, her Eyes melted into a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of teares, and afterwards saide; Welcome my deare Lorde <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismenos,</hi> ordeyned yet to be my blisse. Well haue I now preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against calamitie, for your sight hath banisht him my brest: how miserable and daungerous was my Estate once this day: and how

But ten thousand times more then happie doe I account my selfe to bee so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of you, that haue neuer deserued such fauour, but by my euill Fortunes haue brought you into these calamities.

                     <p>In these and such like sp√©eches, did they expresse their ioyes, for eache others presence and preseruation, till <hi>Parismenos</hi> buckling on his Helmet againe, went out to s√©e whether <hi>Iconius</hi> did pretend any treacherie against him, but him he found vnarmed, and his knightes dressing his Wounds: and s√©eing <hi>Parismenos</hi> still armed (as fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to disarme himselfe) he gaue him such assurance of quiet, both by his owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Earely the next morning, <hi>Iconius</hi> returned to the Desart, and certified <hi>Parismenos</hi> of that which h√©e had done, which was this: There was then in the harbor, a ship of <hi>Italie,</hi> that was readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part towards that Countrey, vnder the gouernment of <hi>Theoretus,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Marchant, with whom <hi>Iconius</hi> had ag√©ed for their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, not telling him what they were that should goe with him, and withall, promised him to returne that forenoone, or not at all. <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos</hi> hearing his sp√©eches, was exc√©edingly glad thereof, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made <hi>Angelica</hi> acquainted therewith, who most willingly gaue her consent: and presently they departed towards the Hauen, being in all but eight persons. And comming to the ship, they were kindly receiued of <hi>Theoretus</hi> the Maister. Who hauing sped his voiage, and hauing no other thing to stay for, the winde seruing, hoysed sayle, and with a merry gale, they launched into the d√©epe. <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos</hi> comming to <hi>Theoretus,</hi> demaunded which was the nearest course for <hi>Germanie,</hi> for that he was bound thither? Sir (quoth he) if it so please you, after I haue landed in <hi>Italie,</hi> and dispatched some businesse I haue there importance, I will be then ready to conuey you to the nearest Hauen that lieth towards these parts, so that you will content me for my voiage,</p>
                     <p>My friend (quoth <hi>Parismenos)</hi> if thou wilt do me this friendship, I will content th√©e to the vttermost of thy demaund. Then h√©e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the place where <hi>Angelica</hi> was, comforting her with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red trust of a happie and sp√©edie voiage.</p>
                     <p>Many daies they continued on their course with prosperous successe, till <hi>Teoretus</hi> assured them h√©e was within two daies Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Italie,</hi> where accordingly he arriued, where <hi>Parismenos</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> refreshed themselues, vntill <hi>Theoretus</hi> had ended all his businesse, and was growing to a composition with <hi>Parismenos.</hi> It fortuned that there was then in the place where they arriued, a Knight of <hi>Slauonia,</hi> named <hi>Arenus,</hi> who had secretly beheld <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicas</hi> beawtie, and was so surprised therewith, that he beganne to deuise what meanes to vse to possesse her, and hearing that they were bound for <hi>Germanie,</hi> and supposing <hi>Parismenos</hi> had b√©ene her husband, h√©e vsed the more expedition, his dsire b√©eing growne to that extremitie, in the small time of their abode, that he thought it
<pb facs="tcp:16915:245"/>
impossible for him to liue without the fruition thereof. And often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times growing into conference with <hi>Theoretus,</hi> h√©e vnderstood the trueth of all by his report. And <hi>Arenus</hi> finding some hope to bring him to condiscend to his practise, vpon a time h√©e begaune to commune with him, and in the end concluded with him for a summe of money, to conuey them for him into what place h√©e would. With whom <hi>Arenus</hi> dealt so couningly and so strictly, that he bound him by many oathes to performe the same: which h√©e for greedinesse of the summe of money, was most resolutely determined to doo.</p>
                     <p>Now the time of departure being come, <hi>Theoretus</hi> (with a dissembling countenance colouring his intended villanie) came to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismenos,</hi> and tolde him that his businesse was now ended, and the winde fitly serued for their departure.</p>

Which caused her to conceyue a perswasion by the kinde and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full entertainment sh√©e hadde found in <hi>Osirus,</hi> that the <hi>Thessalians</hi> were people of an exc√©eding courteous disposition; Whereas many other People, both poore and Noble, were rude and barbarous, that she might thinke her selfe a thousand times blest, that shee had made choyse of so Honourable a Knight as <hi>Parismenos</hi> was, and one that was sprung from the Race of such noble Parents, and such naturall, kinde, and louing subiects, that her heart with these cogitations, s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be absolutely happie, and her Sences were filled with such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull content, that in these heauenly Meditations, shee fell into a quiet and easefull rest.</p>

And at such time as they were awaked, had all things in such Cerimonious kinde, and stately manner ministred vnto them, that they could not choose but admyre the same, being loath to motion theyr departure to the Court, least <hi>Osirus</hi> should thinke they did not accept of his kinde entertainment.</p>
                     <p>Whilest all remained in this great delight in <hi>Osirus</hi> Castle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port had blazed into the hearing of diuers of the Nobles and knights of the Kings Court, the Ioy and great Feasting was kept by <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> Which was made knowne in such sort, that they were assured some great Personages were arriued there, but none knewe who they were, that this newes was so open in the Court, that it came to <hi>Dyonisius</hi> hearing: Who most of all maruelling thereat, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now fully recouered his health, determined for his Recreation after his long Sicknesse, onely with <hi>Parismus,</hi> and some fewe of his Knights, to progresse secretly to <hi>Osirus</hi> Castle, both to recreate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to know what those should be he entertained, and especially, for that hee loued <hi>Osirus</hi> exc√©edingly well: Which determination hee made <hi>Parismus</hi> acquainted with, and the next day accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the same. (Which was the thirde day that <hi>Parismenos</hi> had

                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> still stayed with the rest of the knights without the doore, <hi>Osirus</hi> soone espyed <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and suddainelie starting from his seate, vppon his knee did his reuerence: <hi>Vdalla</hi> and the rest that knewe him did the like. Whilest <hi>Dionisius</hi> said: <hi>Osirus,</hi> you see a bolde guest comes without bidding, but it you had beene kinde, you would haue made mee pertaker of your mirth. <hi>Parismenos</hi> was so amazed, that a good while he could not tell how to behaue himselfe, but perceiuing that it was the King, h√©e with <hi>Angelica</hi> drewe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and humblie prostrated themselues before him vppon their kn√©es, b√©eing vnable by the suddainnesse of their ioye to speake. <hi>Dionisius</hi> not knowing them, and maruelling to s√©e them kn√©ele, was halfe astonisht, vntill <hi>Osirus</hi> to ridde him from that doubt, saide. My Lord this Knight is sonne to the Noble Prince <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus.</hi> Before h√©e could say any more, or <hi>Dionisius</hi> once salute them, <hi>Parismus</hi> was entered, who at the first knewe <hi>Angelica,</hi> and by her his sonne, whom otherwise h√©e should not haue knowne, h√©e was so much altered, whose suddaine sight, so vnexpected, and so farre from his thought, and so contrarie to his expectation, and so impossible to his perswasion, made him tansformed into a kinde of admiration, whether it might be possible that it was they, or that it was some elusion: but <hi>Parismenos</hi> likewise espying him in such a studie, immediately rose from the ground, and vpon his kn√©e did him reuerence, and <hi>Parismus</hi> embraced him with a most kinde, louing and ioyfull behauiour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> likewise knowing him, bent her deuotions with all humble reuerence to shewe her loue and dutie, whilest hee raised her from the ground, and embraced her in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber armes, beeing vnable to expresse his ioye to see them there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> likewise embraced them with great kindenesse, and
<pb facs="tcp:16915:250"/>
Welcommed them with teares of ioy. Oftentimes folding <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos</hi> in his armes with a louing behauiour, and holding <hi>Angelica</hi> by the hand, beeing loath to let the same goe, and vnable to expresse his inward ioy, that he, <hi>Parismus</hi> and all the rest, were possest with such content, as would aske a skillfull penne to describe.</p>
                     <p>Their welcomes, kinde embracings, gentle speeches, and other signes of contented ioy, were such as passeth my vttermost skill to relate, or decipher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> then desired them to seate themselues againe at their banquet, and hee and <hi>Parismus</hi> would beare them companie: then they againe seated themselues and himselfe by <hi>Angelicas</hi> side, vsing her so kindly, so louingly, and so familiarly, and with such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mirth, pleasantnesse, and merry countenance, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicas</hi> heart was possest with ioy thereat: <hi>Parismus</hi> admired the same, <hi>Parismenos</hi> reioyced thereat: And <hi>Osirus</hi> and <hi>Vdalla</hi> tooke exceeding ioy thereat, hauing not a long time seene him so pleasant.</p>
                     <p>They would haue wayted, but he commaunded them to sit downe and be merie. The Noble men that came with him, which was Lord <hi>Remus,</hi> and diuers others, hee commaunded to sit downe, vttering these speeches. My Noble Children, the great ioy I conceyue for your presence is such, that it filles my sences with exceeding content. and were <hi>Oliuia</hi> and <hi>Laurana</hi> here, I would make account this were the best, most pleasing, most contented, most royall, and delightfull day that euer befell: but since they are absent, let vs be merrie: <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> bidde vs Welcome, for we are all your Guests. <hi>Parismenos</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> Welcome into <hi>Thessalie:</hi> Welcome to your Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so exceedingly Welcom, as your hearts can wish. <hi>Parismus</hi> who would haue thought that these had bene with <hi>Osirus,</hi> what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Destinie hath brought them hither?

                     <p>Well, did but <hi>Oliuia</hi> and <hi>Laurana</hi> knowe of theyr being heere, they would not be absent.

But first let vs refresh our stomackes with <hi>Osirus</hi> costly cheare, and afterwards we will desire to know the occasion and manner of their arriuall into the Country, which was neuer absolutely happy before this time. Then they all seated themselues againe in great content. <hi>Dionisius</hi> not suffering <hi>Angelica</hi> to sit from him, but close by his side, betwixt them and the Queene, euery one expressing exceeding ioy for their vnexpected safetie and arriuall in the Country. After dinner was welnie ended, which was ouerpast with pleasurable content on all sides, and was performed by <hi>Osirus</hi> in great pompe, <hi>Parismus</hi> desired <hi>Parisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> to declare what misaduenture had befallen him, since his priuate departure from the Court at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> and by what occasion they arriued in the atplace.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Parismenos</hi> declared the truth of all, how he met with <hi>Angelica,</hi> of <hi>Irus</hi> death, <hi>Arenus</hi> and <hi>Theoretus</hi> treason, and of their preseruation by the Fisherman, which greatly delighted them all to heare. <hi>Dionisius</hi> then said, which is <hi>Iconius?</hi> Then <hi>Parismus</hi> called for <hi>Iconius,</hi> and he presently came: whom <hi>Dionisius, Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
