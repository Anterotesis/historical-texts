            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Early the next morning, <hi>Dionisius</hi> attended by his noble men, rode forth to méete the Prince, some thrée miles from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whome he most louingly imbraced, and welcommed with excéeding courtesie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> maruelling at this vnexpected kindnesse in him, said: Most high and magnificent King, I being altogether vnworthy of this your excéeding fauour, most humbly intreate your pardon to my presumption, desiring you to impute my rashnesse to my youth, which hath attempted this boldnesse, without any hope in the least degrée how to deserue such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> taking him by the hand, desired him to leaue off those spéeches, for that hée estéemed his Court and Countrey insufficent to entertaine him according as hée desired, telling him that hée was the most welcome guest to his Court, that might be: wherewith they ioyfully departed towardes the Cittie, but as they roade, they heard a most gréeuous grone in the Thicket of a Woode hard by. Whereupon <hi>Dionisius</hi> commaunded his Knightes to beset the Wood on euery side, himselfe, <hi>Parismus,</hi> and diuers Noble men, entered the Thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, where they found an Armed Knight most grieuously wounded: At which pittifull spectacle, <hi>Dionisius</hi> alighted from his Horse, viewed his face, and knew him to be his trustie Knight <hi>Osiris,</hi> whome hée most dearely loued. Wherefore hée commaunded him to bee conueyed to the Court, that his owne Phisitians might looke to him, and binde vp his wounds.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time the King, <hi>Parismus,</hi> and diuers Knightes, made diligent searche in the wood, but coulde finde no creature there, and thereby no certaintie how <hi>Osiris</hi> should be thus wounded. That departing discontented, the
<pb facs="tcp:16915:6"/>
King was certified that there was great hope of his recouery, who speaking to <hi>Parismus,</hi> said; Most noble Prince, I hope this mischaunce hath not disquieted you, for I would be sorie you should conceiue any occasion of sadnesse thereat, but I trust by that time <hi>Osiris</hi> be recouered, wée shall easily come to the knowledge hereof.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, replied <hi>Parismus,</hi> I haue no cause to be gréeued for my part, but to see your Maiestie hereby disquieted. Indéed said <hi>Dionisius,</hi> it some what gréeueth me, because <hi>Osiris</hi> is one that I loue, being well worthy thereof, for his vertues do farre excéed many mens, of whose faith and fidelitie I haue had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient triall, that a more loyall Knight cannot be found. By this time they were come to the Pallace gate, where was the Quéene with all her traine of Ladies, to welcome <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> which was a most pleasing sight to beholde, that the Prince with the suddaine viewe of theyr beautie, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into a déepe studie, from which hée was reuiued by the Quéene, who most gratiously welcommed him, saying: In all kindnesse, I bid your honour welcome into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> where we will indeuour to requite your friendship in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to vs.</p>
                     <p>Most vertuous Quéene (quoth hée) for this your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fauour, both my selfe and all that is mine, shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bound to do you dutifull seruice. The glory of the Pallace made <hi>Parismus</hi> maruaile, this honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, the sumptuous banquets, the rare Musick, and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant showes, too tedious to rehearse, made him thinke that Fame had altogether darkened the glory of that place, that all his sences were replenisht with varietie of delight.</p>
                     <p>At such time as <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and the Prince, entered the Court, <hi>Laurana,</hi> hearing of the Princes comming, standing at her Chamber windowe, viewed them well, and knew, or at least thought that to be <hi>Parismus,</hi> that came with her father, noting well his gallant &amp; comely proportion, said to one of her maides named <hi>Leda,</hi> Is not yonder Knight that accompaineth my

Why quoth <hi>Laurana,</hi> this Court cannot long containe such guests: wherewithall she went to dinner, féeling a kinde of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in al her parts, which séemed strange to her, for euen then loue began to kindle in her tender heart, which yet shee did not well vnderstand, but afterwards grewe to a burning heate, as shall be declared.

                     <p>To relate the conference the King and <hi>Parismus</hi> had, were tedious, and imperitinent to the Historie.

At last reuiuing his sences that were dulled with pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, hée suddenly sighed, and smiling said (fearing his heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had bene noted) your Maiestie may peraduenture note my sadnesse: the remembrance of your Knights iniury, maketh me study how he should be so gréeuously wounded, and no man found that should act the same (which words hée onely spake to excuse himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Surely answered the King, some man by secret treachery hath wrought him that harme, which at more conuenient time we shall finde the truth thereof, which I would effect with all spéed, but that I hope to be ascertained by himselfe, whom my Physitions say is in good estate of amendment. With these and

many other spéeches. Dinner being fully ended, <hi>Dionisius, Parismus,</hi> and the Quéene, walked into a most pleasant Garden, where after a while he was entertained with a most costly and rare banquet, prouided in an Arbour or banqueting House, adioyning to a Groue fraught with many pleasant Birds, whose swéete har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie much augmented the pleasure of the place, all things being most artificially contriued for delight, which when <hi>Parismus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, hee then began to thinke with himselfe, how shall I sée the Princesse <hi>Laurana,</hi> for whose sight I haue vndertaken this trauell, whose delightfull presence shall refresh my tired sences, and expell those inward cares wherewith I am thus perplexed. But when he sawe none but the King and Quéene, hée was much troubled in his minde, to thinke what might be the cause, that thée whose fame had long since come to his knowledge, was not to be séene, that by constrained mirth, hée past away the time in such Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and other pastime, as the King entertained him withal, which were such, as he much wondred at. And night being come, with all statelinesse that might be, hée was by them conducted to his Lodging, which was most sumptuously adorned with most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and rich hangings, that the place séemed a new Paradice, for there wanted nothing that might either delight the eare or eye. Lodgings for his Noblemen, Knights and seruants, were placed in such manner, that they séemed by their scituation to be gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to their Lords person: hauing then taken his leaue of the King and Quéene, he betooke himselfe to his rest.</p>

your desire. I pray thée then doo it, said <hi>Parismus,</hi> with all speeds, for my restlesse passions require counsaile.

And though the smal tryall you haue of my truth, may discourage you to credit me: yet notwithstanding my vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, I desire you to imploy me any way, thereby to try how willing I will be to merit your fauour. Sir, quoth <hi>Laurana,</hi> I thanke you for your kindnes, neither can I blame your spéeches if your meaning be good. But as I am vnworthy to entertaine such a seruant, so would I not willingly trust him I know not, but heareafter when your disguise is banished, as I shall sée good I will entertaine you. Noble Lady, said <hi>Parismus,</hi> I haue taken this habit only, thereby to be so happy, as to make manifest my affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deserue your fauour: that if you wil vouchsafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a right of my good meaning, you would say, he that profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his seruice, would refuse to do it to any but to your most worthy selfe.

farre lied in the bonds of friendship, &amp; good liking to <hi>Parismus,</hi> that she was altogether vnwilling to leaue his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany: by this time the rest of the maskers hauing ended their speeches, the sound of the musick made them remember their third measure, which being ended, <hi>Parismus</hi> kissing the Princesse hand, with a heauy sigh, left her in the place where he found her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to depart, <hi>Dionisius</hi> comming vnto them, said: Most courteous Knights, I know not what entertainement to giue you, for that you are to me vnknown: but request this at your hands, that you take a banquet my daughter hath prouided: which words caused <hi>Parismus</hi> to bee willing vnto, because it was the Princesse doing, whose presence was the sweet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiue of his life. Your Maiestie (answered <hi>Parismus)</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs so kinde a proffer, that wee cannot (beeing bound at your command) deny your request: so vnmasking himselfe, hee came with great reuerence to <hi>Dionisius,</hi> who knowing him, imbracing him, said, hee was glad he had no worse sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse then that, and that he was much indebted vnto him for honouring his Courts with his pastime.

All the assembly greatly commended <hi>Parismus,</hi> being much delighted to behold his vertuous behauiour, and was indeed worthy to be accounted the Prince of curtesie. The Queene then told him, she had beene his secret counsell, keeper, and he humbly kissing her hand, thanked her, and being come to the place where the banket was prouided, <hi>Dionisius</hi> told them, he would leaue them to be welcommed by the Queene and <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana,</hi> whilest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

many others speeches which delighted her to heare, and him to vtter, that they were so farre delighted one in anothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that it was death for them to part, she not knowing that his loue was grounded vpon such firme resolue, nor he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing she would so kindely accept his proffred seruice.

                        <hi>Laurana</hi> making all the haste she could to be rid from the company of <hi>Isabella,</hi> and other Ladies that accompanied her, because her heart was desirous to meditate of her loue, went into her chamber, where being alone much troubled in her thoughts, she votered these speeches. How happy am I to bee thus disquieted with the sight of <hi>Parismus,</hi> not knowing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his words proceed of custome or affection: I that was earst at liberty, am now become captiue to mine owne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and inthralled to a stranger. What of that, peraduenture he is in the same mind I am, neither haue I any cause to doubt but that his words proceed from the good will he beareth me, and that the intent of his comming to my Fathers court, was onely for my sake, as he saith: might I be happily assured of the truth of these doubts, then would my disquiet mind rest high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contented: and vntill that time I shall but spend my time in endles care, and heauines: if these words proceeded from the depth of true meaning, then will he stil prosecute the suit heee hath begun: neither haue I any cause to suspect his honorable meaning. Well, I will content my selfe so well as I can, and séeke some meanes whereby to be assured, and rid my pensiue heart of these doubts. Earely the next morning, she called <hi>Leda</hi> vnto her, saying, that she had a secret to impart vnto her, that
<pb facs="tcp:16915:13"/>
did concerue her life and honour, and therefore willed her to be secret, telling her all that had passed betwixt <hi>Parismus</hi> and her: and how that vnlesse she might be certaine of his intent, she should but consume her selfe with care.</p>

When <hi>Laurana</hi> had read the Letter, shee began to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with her selfe how shee should accomplish his request, in such sort, that it might no way blemish her honour, nor giue him cause to suspect that she were light, to be so easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for shee esteemed her credit more then her life, and his loue more then both. At last shee resolued to answer his Letter, and giue directions to <hi>Leda</hi> how he should come to talke with her, and no man priuy thereto but themselues: and calling <hi>Leda,</hi> told her that shee should deliuer the answer to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Letter, and withall this message.

Thus spending the day which he thought to be longer then three daies, he againe returned to his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, esteeming the time too long, and a thousand times wishing the approach of the appointed houre. <hi>Laurana</hi> in the meane time, being not vnmindfull of her promise, only with <hi>Leda</hi> was gon down into the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by a doore that opened out of her lodging: where being come, <hi>Scinthias</hi> was proud to giue light vnto her maiesticall presence, and by the cleerenesse of her splendor, had any beheld her, she might haue beene esteemed to surpasse the comelinesse of <hi>Diana,</hi> walking in her chaste conceits.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:16"/>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> somewhat before the houre, was likewise gone forth in his night gowne, with his sword vnder his arme, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the gate hee was wont to goe in at into the Gardeine, found it shut, and hauing no others meanes, hee gotte ouer the wall, and was gotten into a secret place to entertaine loue with a surfetting delight: but when hee beheld his diuine Goddesse enter into the Arbour, his heart was so surprised with ioy, with her presence, that at his comming to her, he could not vtter a word, but with great reuerence taking her tenderly by the soft hand, which he was afraid to touch without her leaue, at last he said, Most vertuous Lady, since it hath pleased you to grant me this excéedsng fauour, I here vowe, that I will not speake a word, nor do any thing that shall not accord with your minde. My Lord, said <hi>Laurana,</hi> had I not presumed vpon your vertue, I would not thus haue come hither. Which kinde spéech, so much imboldned <hi>Parismus,</hi> that he imbraced her in his armes and kist her, and sitting downe together, folded each in the others armes. <hi>Parismus</hi> began to recount vnto her his loue, and how that his comming to <hi>Thessaly,</hi> was onely to doo her seruice, vowing neuer to depart if she would not accept him for her poore seruant: with many other kind protestations procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from his vnfained affection, that <hi>Laurana</hi> being wounded with his intreaties, could not chuse but accept of his loue, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these speeches.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, for that I am perswaded of the constancy of your loue, and for that you vouchsafe to profer such kindnesse to me that haue not deserued the same, I will manifest that which rather I should conceale, for that you may suppose my yéelding so soone, might proceed of light bred affection: but my Lord, I assure you, that at such time as I sawe you comming first into this Court, my heart was then suprised, (procured as I thinke by the Destinies) that euer since I haue vowed to rest yours assured to commaund, so that you way pretend my wrong: and therefore committing all that is mine to giue into your handes, I here giue you affurance of truth, and true constant
<pb facs="tcp:16915:16"/>
loue. Thus they spent the night in kinde salutations and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous imbracings, to the vnspeakeable ioy and comfort of them both. <hi>Leda</hi> all this while walking about the gardens, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looking about her, espied a light in <hi>Oliuiaes</hi> Chamber, whereof shee gaue those two Louers intelligence. <hi>Parismus</hi> thought that newes vnwelcome, whereby being compelled to depart, which was done with much heauinesse, <hi>Parismus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to know, when shee would vouchsafe him her presence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which shee told him should be at his appointment, for that she now was his to dispose of: so with many a sweet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing they parted. <hi>Laurana</hi> going into her chamber said, in that she had so soone lost his companie, and could not tell what misfortune might befall him, and glad in heart to recount and think of his passed promise. <hi>Parismus</hi> quickly got ouer the wal, and was soone safely come to his chamber, where he recounted to <hi>Oristus</hi> his happy successe in loue, asking his counsell how hee might procure <hi>Dionisius</hi> good liking, to effect the mariage betwixt them, which first he thought to motion himselfe, then he thought that <hi>Dionisius</hi> would not like thereof, without the consent of his father first had, and also might blame <hi>Laurana</hi> of vndutifulnesse, if he knew it were with her priuity. Againe he thought it best to send <hi>Oristus</hi> into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to giue his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge thereof, and to entreat him to send Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to that effect. Contrarily, he thought that in the meane time, some other of greater birth then himselfe, might demand her in marriage of the King, and so haue the first grant, though he were sufficiently assured that <hi>Laurana</hi> should neuer yeelde her consent. Being in this perplexity, he could not resolue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing, but walking in the garden to ease his heart with some recreation, he met the King, with him were the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Sicanus,</hi> sonne to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> though vnknown. The King for the more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble entertainment of his guests, made one most royall banquet for all in general: the Quéen, &amp; a gallant traine of beautifull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, were there likewise, which was not a custome amongst
<pb facs="tcp:16915:17"/>
the rest: it fell so out, that <hi>Parismus</hi> was seated right opposite to the Princesse <hi>Laurana,</hi> which agreed to his hearts desire, wherby he had meanes to satisfie himselfe with beholding that inestimable Iewell, which as farre excelled all the rest of the Ladies as the Sunne doth the Moone, or white his contrary: who with such comely modesty behaued her self, that her looke did rightly resemble a countenance ful of mild, vertuous pitty, able to rauish a multitude, being also not a little glad, that she had occasion to bestowe a kind looke on her <hi>Parismus. Sicanus</hi> more narrowly marked <hi>Lauranaes</hi> behauiour then any other, because his comming was onely to request her in marriage of her father, and though both the young Princes were very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect: yet <hi>Sicanus</hi> curious eye, found, or at lest suspected, that there was some loue betwixt them, which they full little thought of, hauing their hearts busied with more pleasant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations: and euer after that, <hi>Sicanus</hi> inwardly malised <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus</hi> in his heart.</p>
                     <p>Dinner being ended, the Knights spent some part of the afternoone in dauncing, when being ended, euery man betooke himselfe to what exercise liked him best. <hi>Dionisius</hi> and Lord <hi>Remus,</hi> accompanied the Princesse <hi>Laurana,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Isabella,</hi> to their lodgings, which made <hi>Sicanus</hi> to fret inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to thinke that <hi>Parismus</hi> his onely enemy as he thought, had gotten such possession in <hi>Lauranaes</hi> loue, which might debarre him of his wished hope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> séeing Lord <hi>Remus</hi> talking to <hi>Isabella,</hi> saluted <hi>Laurana</hi> with these speeches: My deare Lady, although I confesse my selfe farre vnworthy that kindnesse you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted me, yet I humbly request one farther fauour at your hands, which is, that you would vouchsafe to meet me tomorrow night, in that happy place where I receiued the first assurance of your comfortable kindnesse, for my passions are so extreame, that my life would perish, were it not onely maintained by enioying your loue, where I would impart a secret to you, that now I haue no time to vtter.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:17"/>
My Lord said <hi>Laurana,</hi> you need not vse such intreaties to her, that is not vnwilling, neither hath she power to deny your request. The Queen comming into the place where they were, caused <hi>Parismus</hi> with a heauy sigh to depart, and Lord <hi>Remus</hi> with him, betwixt whom there began a firme league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Now Lord <hi>Remus</hi> beare great affection to the Lady <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi> and had oftentimes solicited his suit vnto her, which she in a manner yeelded vnto, which made <hi>Parismus</hi> the rather chuse him for his companion, by kéeping him company, to haue the oftner accesse vnto <hi>Laurana.</hi> The King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Sicanus,</hi> were walked into the Garden, where they were encountred by the king, vnto whom the king of <hi>Hungaria</hi> began to declare how that the Prince of <hi>Sparta</hi> and himselfe had a matter to treate with his Maiestie, if hee would vouchsafe them audience, from the mighty King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who hauing a great desire to be allyed to him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hard manifold reports of the vertuous <hi>Laurana,</hi> had sent them to intreat a marriage betwixt her and <hi>Sicanus,</hi> his sonne and heire of <hi>Persia,</hi> who was there present with them, though vntill this time vnwilling to make himselfe known. <hi>Dionisius</hi> most kindly embraced him, telling him, that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe much honoured with his company, and that since it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his father to treat of alliance betwixt them, he would giue his consent willingly, so that he would first get his daughters good will, whom he would not willingly match contrary to her liking, promising to vse his commandement vnto her for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof. For which <hi>Sicanus</hi> thanked him. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing spent the day in this and such like talke, supper was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: which being ended, they betooke themselues to their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Laurana,</hi> my chiefest care is, to sée thee married according to thy state, which hath made me send for thee, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thou hast already placed thy affection or no: otherwise there is come into this Country, a King of great estate and honourable parts, sonne and heire to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who concealed himself vntil yesterninght, in whose behalfe the king of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> are come from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to craue thee in marriage.

His importunate demaunds (which he buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon her fathers promise, and his owne hope of assurance) she answered so wisely and curteously, that his loue thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, but his hope was no whit augmented, that séeing such a vertuous resolution, or in maner absolute deniall to his sute, he was perswaded, <hi>Parismus</hi> was the onely man that hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his loue, which the rather vexed him, because hée sawe his vertues of euery man commended, and himselfe by the beauty of his excelent gifts disgraced, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer after he sought all meanes he could to worke his harme. And fearing that he should be frustrated of his expectation, began very narrowly to prie into the behauiour of <hi>Laurana</hi> towards <hi>Parismus,</hi> that they coulde at no time talke, if hée were in companie, but would still bée attentiue to their spéeches, nor seldome were they at any time togither, but hée would be in their companie, dissembling a countenance of great frindship to <hi>Parismus,</hi> hauing tha grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occasion to crosse their loues, because of the motion hée had made to <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and of the kings spéech to <hi>Laurana.</hi> In this sort he continued his iealous behauiour, yet farre from the least hope of procuring <hi>Lauranas</hi> fauour.

for him, which she thought to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fittest place for their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conference, for that she was now fully assured of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable meaning, so directing him the way, he quickely found <hi>Laurana,</hi> who was come to the staites head to meete him, whom he kindly saluted, and she as louingly welcomed him, spending their time in sweet gréetings, but farre from any thought of vnchastenesse, their imbracings beeing grounded vpon the most vertuous conditions that might be: and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together vpon the beddes side, <hi>Laurana</hi> taking <hi>Parismus</hi> by the hand, the teares standing in her eies, told him all the speeches her father had vsed vnto her, and of <hi>Sicanus</hi> loue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating to him all that had passed betwixt them, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely gréeued <hi>Parismus</hi> to heare, not that hee doubted her change, but for that hee was thereby disappointed of the first grant from <hi>Dionisius,</hi> whom he was fully perswaded would haue giuen his consent. Deare Lady (said <hi>Parismus)</hi> since these mischances are vnfortunately happened, I know not how to remedy them: but it resteth only in your power, either by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him loue, and so to destroy me, or still continue your sauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kindnesse towards me, and thereby purchase displeasure of your parents, which would be more greeuous vnto me then death. My Lord, replied <hi>Laurana,</hi> you néede not vse these spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or any way trouble your mind, for I promise and protest, that the losse or displeasure of my friends, nor any other misery or torment whatsoeuer, shall make me any way infringe that promise I haue made to you: for your loue is more dearer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me then my life: but I desire you to tell me how I may any way worke your content, and I will doe it? More shee would haue spoken, but the Christall teares that fell from her eies, and extreame hearts sorrow, to sée <hi>Parismus</hi> so sad, stopt her speech, who likewise was drawn into such admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to think of her kindnesse, that he could vse no words to comfort her, but with his chéeke wiped away the wet teares that bedeawed her face, and bestowed swéet kisses on her corall couloured lips. At last he said, Deare <hi>Laurana,</hi> deare <hi>Laurana,</hi> I would desire you
<pb facs="tcp:16915:19"/>
not to thinke, that I any way cal your loyalty in question, but vsed those spéeches only to assure you, that whatsoeuer pleaseth you, I count my greatest blisse: but since you vouchsafe to grant me that fauour, to be content to endure your Parents displeasure for my sake, that am vnworthy of that kindnesse, I will heereafter so fully rest at your command to doe whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer lieth in my small power, that you shall say <hi>Parismus</hi> is not vnwilling, though vnable to be sufficiently tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kful. Thus thinking too much of their stole time, spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about those vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant newes, they began to vse words of more comfort, which were such as porceeded from the kindest friendship that might be. For so pleasantly swéet were their louely ioies, and true hearted meanings, that it far surpassed the admirable kindnes of Louers, but might be tearmed the true substance of perfect pleasure: wherein these two harmelesse soules continued the greatest part of the night with such ioy, that had <hi>Sicanus,</hi> who most enuied <hi>Parismus,</hi> séene and beheld them, he would neuer haue attempted to part such knide friendship. Now the dismall houre of their parting being approached, by reason of the light that the Sunne began to giue vnto the Chamber, <hi>Parismus</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Laurana</hi> in his armes, drawing sweete breath from her lippes, told her that now (to his griefe) he most leaue her to be courted by his enemy <hi>Sicanus,</hi> relating vnto her the long wars that had passed betwixt their fathers, and the late peace that was conciuded, and how that he knew <hi>Sicanus</hi> at his first comming into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> desiring her to let him vnderstand such newes from her as did concerne their loue, which she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him she would, and withall, that she would neuer yéeld to loue him that was an enemy to <hi>Parismus,</hi> but would hate her owne heart, if it should but thinke a thought to wrong him.

might some way come to her knowledge, so galled him to the heart, that his inward passions would not suffer his outward physicke to doe him any good, and the continual care he was in did much hinder his health: being likewise as much tormented with remembrance of the grant that <hi>Dionisius</hi> had made to <hi>Sicanus,</hi> concerning the marriage twixt him and <hi>Laurana,</hi> who he thought might now be inforced to yeelde her consent, when she was out of hope of recouering him: this griefe farre exceeded all the rest, that all the whole company began to note his sorrow, for he was scarce able to containe himselfe within the bounds of reason. In these perplerities he continued by the space of three months, in all which time, he could not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his health.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and therefore it stood not with her vertue to séeme strange or shew her selfe vndutifull. <hi>Laurana</hi> hearing her fathers spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, being much amazed, stood still and gaue no answer a good space; at last kneeling downe, shee began in this sort: I most humbly intreat your Maiesty, to vouchsafe to heare my words with patience, and not to impute any thing I shall desire at your highnesse hands, to vndutifulnesse: I cannot as yet fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Prince, though I confesse my selfe farre vnworthy the honour you proffer me, but haue presumed (vpon your fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable promise, not to marry me to any without my liking,) to

fuse the offer <hi>Sicanus</hi> maketh, for that my fancy perswaded me, he shall bring some sorrow to your highnesse, and al the rest of this Court and Countrey: as also for that I am vnwilling to this with my better, but would intreate your maiesty (if your highnesse will needs haue me marry) rather to bestow mee on some honourable Gentleman of my degree, but most of all my desire is to continue this my happy life, wherein I entend (with your gracious liking) to spend the length of my daies.</p>

                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> wondring to heare her answer, began to waxe somewhat angry with her, and told her, that it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shee should marry with him, and he would haue it so.

                     <p>The King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and Prine of <hi>Sparta,</hi> beeing much ashamed of <hi>Sicanus</hi> behauiour, in whose company they came, desired <hi>Dionisius</hi> not to impute his impiety any way to their dishonour, for that they would foreuer abhorre him for that monstrous act, and rest ready to defend him, if euer he should stand in need of their aide, to reuenge this iniury: who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to stay still with <hi>Dionisius,</hi> if they could, to driue out of his minde the remembrance of this mischance. <hi>Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> being most extreamely ouercome with rage, and griefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to take the murther of <hi>Parismus</hi> with such sorrow, that he determined to spend the rest of his daies out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of all men, and the next morning (giuing delay no scope to hinder his purpose) hauing disguised himselfe that he could not bee knowne, in Palmers weedes, hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted secretly from the Court: and first tooke his course to trauell into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to heare whether <hi>Parismus</hi> Father had knowledge of the death of his sonne, or no. Dinner time being come, <hi>Dionisius</hi> was wanting, which made the Queene maruell, for that he was not wont to bee absent, but thinking hee was gone alone by himselfe to meditate, made no great enquiry: but after Dinner, going her selfe to seeke him, could by no meanes finde him, which made her make open enquiry, yet none could heare of him, that vpon the sudden there beganne such an vproare (when they had searched all the Place, Gardens, Orchardes, walkes, and

                     <p>These newes of <hi>Sicanus</hi> departure, and of <hi>Dionisius</hi> want happened in two daies, yet neither of them was come to the knowledge of <hi>Laurana,</hi> who absented her selfe from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by reason of the extreame care shee endured for <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus: Sicanus</hi> treason, and <hi>Parismus</hi> murther was concealed from her by <hi>Leda,</hi> who loued her dearely, and therefore would not suffer it to come to her hearing: but contrary to <hi>Lauranaes</hi> thought, and <hi>Ledaes</hi> expectation, <hi>Oliuia</hi> the Quéene came to her lodging, wringing her hands, and making a great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and espying her, said: O daughter, what shall betide vs? that villaine <hi>Sicanus</hi> hauing murthered <hi>Parismus,</hi> hath likewise destroyed thy Father. <hi>Laurana</hi> hearing her mothers speeches, stood as one amazed, not once sitting, speaking, or mouing hereie: at last thinking it was strange newes to bee true, said; déere mother, I trust these vnwelcome newes cannot be true, nor that your grace speaketh of proofe: whereupon the Quéene told her all that had happened to <hi>Parismus,</hi> by <hi>Sicanus</hi> procurement, wherewith <hi>Laurana</hi> (not beeing able to heare the rest that her Mother would haue vttered) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fel downe amongst the Ladies dead, who indeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to recouer her, but were not able to bring her to life againe,

Lord <hi>Remus</hi> beeing a man of great wisdome and gouernment, began to weigh the fickle estate of the people and Countrey, who hauing beene a long time subiect vnto peace, therefore were not able to endure the brunt of warre, and that it was likely <hi>Sicanus</hi> would seeke to reuenge himselfe against them, and take, if he could, out of their hands the Princesse <hi>Laurana,</hi> heire apparant to the Crowne, and thereby get the kingdome into his possession, which the Thessalians could not endure: reuoluing these thoughts in his mind, he came to the Quéen, and the rest of the Nobles, and requested her and them together, to haue some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their Countrey, and not to shew themselues vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to defend themselues from further mischiefe: whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell all liked well, especially <hi>Oliuia,</hi> who with the consent of the rest of the Péeres, made him Lord Regent of the Country: vpon which charge committed to him, hee presently gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for mustring of men, and fortifying of Castles, and places of defence, appointing Captaines and Gouernours, vnder whose charge hee committed those places of defence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a short space brought all things to such perfection, that the Countrey was well fortifyed, and able to resist a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>

While they were in this meditation, <hi>Laurana</hi> hauing wel markt the black knight, began to suppose that it might be <hi>Parismus,</hi> but againe, she thought that was impossible, at last shee saw a great troupe of Knights assaile him all at once, which made her call and cry, helpe, helpe, her sences being so farre drawne with feare and remembrance of <hi>Parismus,</hi> that shee neither thought of the place where shee was, nor in whose company. Lord <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Oristus,</hi> seeing this braue and worthy knight in such distresse, issued forth of the City with twenty thousand horsemen, and commanded forty thousand of the best Souldiers to come out an other way on the backe of the Persians, vnder the conduct of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther braue Noble man: all this while the blacke Knight
<pb facs="tcp:16915:35"/>
so brauely and couragiously defended himselfe, that before the <hi>Thessalians</hi> were come to his rescue, hee had slaine aboue forty Persians: but being vnable to striue with so many, hee was constrained to lose his weapon. Contrarily, Lord <hi>Remus</hi> sudden issuing out, so amazed the Persians, and made such slaughter amongst them, that they quickly set the black knight at libertie: who hauing recouered his horse, being cheared with the comfortable sight of Lord <hi>Remus,</hi> and his trusty knight <hi>Oristus,</hi> with his sword made such hauocke amongst the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, that none durst abide his comming, but wheresoeuer hee went, hee made a large lane for the rest to follow him.</p>
                     <p>The Persians by this time hauing ioined all their forces together, thronged by such multitudes vpon the Thessalians, that they were constrained somewhat to retire, but in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treit, the blacke knight sent the Ghosts of many Persians to hel, and behaued himselfe with such magnanimity that all the whole army were amazed at his valour. By this time the Thessalian footmen assailed the Persians on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side, which draue them into such a feare, that thousands of them were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to flie: but seeing no hope of safety by flight, were so amazed, that their force was quite turned into cowardise: which the Thessalians perceiuing, assailed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with such fury, that they had destroied in a short space, a great number of them that al the earth was stained with the blood. The black knight still followed his enemies with such furie, that (by the death of many Persians) he was gotten into the middest of the whole army, where he found <hi>Sicanus</hi> incouraging his Souldiers, and knowing him by the richnesse of his armour, ran at him with such force, that with a mighty blow hee beate him quite from his horse, and had it not bin for the two brethren of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> who attended on him, he had beene troden to death. The blacke knight stil rushing amongst the thickest of the Persians came where <hi>Oristus</hi> was vnhorsed, &amp; assailed grieuously, who seeing him in that distresse, laid on his blowes with such swift
<pb facs="tcp:16915:36"/>
furie, that happy was he that could get him farthest from him: by which meanes <hi>Oristus</hi> recouered his horse. Thus all the day the battell continued, to the terrour of the Persians, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Thessalians, and honour of the blacke knight: who behaued himselfe with such magnanimity, that both the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, and Thessalians admired his valor. Like wise the quéene and <hi>Laurana,</hi> (who all this while beheld the battell) could not otherwise iudge, but the blacke Knight to be the most valiant Knight of the world.</p>
                     <p>Thus the day being spent, the Thessalians sounded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treit, which the Persians were glad of, onely the black knight went away discontent, for that he thought he had not yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently recompenced his kind loues fauours: but secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed himselfe vnseene of any) vnto the wood wherein was his Caue. Where we leaue him to be entertained of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes, and to be cured of his woundes, by the virgin I spake of before.</p>
                     <p>Lord <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Oristus</hi> (hauing retired their men into the City) sought for the blacke Knight, but could not finde him, which made them maruell what should become of him, whose behauiour had beene such, as it made him knowne to all the whole Army: but seeing themselues frustrated of seeing him, they gaue order for such as were maimed, and hauing viewed their whole troupes, found but a thousand Thessalians mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and with great ioy went to the Pallace: where they were ioyfully receiued by the Quéene and <hi>Laurana,</hi> and relating the whole circumstance of their exploit, their chiefest talke was of the worthy fortitude of the blacke knight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sicanus</hi> on the other side, seeing himselfe so brused with the fall he receiued, and also his Persians so weakned, and such a multitude of them slaine, departed towards the Campe, on the plaines of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> beeing not able to lodge before the City walles, by reason the ground was so wet with the blood of the Persians: who lay vpon such heapes, that had not the Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salians the next day conueied their bodies into a deepe pitte,

                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> had so secretly lodged his Troups in the woods, that the Persians had no knowledge of his beeing there, but would oftentimes disguise himselfe into the Palmers weedes, and so behold the Cittie, how it was incompassed with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which strooke such sorrowe to his heart, to see his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ready to be wasted, his Subiectes in distresse, his Queene and his faire Daughter, ready to be surprised and taken by the Enemies, and such a multitude of bloodie minded Persians, vnto whome he neuer had done wrong, readie to destroy all things, that he could not refraine from exclaming against For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and his owne destines that had allotted him such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce: and hauing diligently viewed the Campe, he espied the Tents of the Hungaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> King, and of the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who had giuen him their faithfull promise to ayde him against the Persians: and therefore he was some what comforted with their presence.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:38"/>
at last he espied <hi>Osiris</hi> comming towards the Cittie, who had prepared in a readinesse twelue thousand Thessalian horsemen, and had lodged them some twelue miles from the Cittie, and knowing him to be a man of most rare curtesie, he saide vnto him: Worthy Knight, might I be so bold as aske this one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, wherefore such a multitude of souldiers haue begirt this cittie?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Osiris</hi> most curteously answered, Father those with the blewe Tents are the Persians, who without any iust quarrell are come to destroy this Countrey. Those with the red Tents are vnder the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> come in reuenge of his sonnes death against the Persians. The gréene and white Tents are the King of <hi>Hungaria</hi> and Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who are come to aide the Thessalians. Indéed we are but a handfull in respect of the Persians, but the greatest hope we haue is in God, and we are also much comforted by the aide of a black knight (for so we call him, for that hée is vnknowne) whose valour is able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort a multitude of Persians, who haue already tasted of his inuincible force: for first he slewe thrée of the stoutest Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in thrée single combattes, and at last, he defended himselfe against a multitude of them, that like cowardes came running vppon him, but at last hée was ayded by Lord <hi>Remus</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi> who seeing his person indaungered by so vnequall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, issued out of the Cittie with their power (but before they could come to him, he had slaine fortie Persians) at which time by the asistance of that worthy Knight, there died of Persians almost fiftie thousand: amongst the rest, this blacke knight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered <hi>Sicanus</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and at one blowe, ouerthrew both horse and man, that had he not bene taken vp, he had then bene troden to death: but this is our care, that we knowe not what is become of him, for hée priuily got himselfe from forth of the field. Whilest <hi>Osiris</hi> was telling this newes vnto the Palmer, diuers were gathered about him to heare his talke, by which meanes the report of the blacke knight came to the knowledge of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the Prince

The Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger returned answere, that they were determined to giue the onset the next morning. <hi>Parismus</hi> by this time had fully recouered his health: therefore béeing still desirous to reuenge himselfe on <hi>Sicanus,</hi> as also to be assured in what estate his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued <hi>Laurana</hi> was, thinking himselfe too slacke in performing his promised vowe, armed himselfe in the blacke Armour, and hasted towardes the Cittie: where he was no sooner come, but séeing such an alteration, he was so perplexed to see such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of enemies, in compassing the person of his beloued, that without any further aduise, hée determined to assault the whole multitude, and so die amongst his enemies.

but might be of better parentage then, he tooke her to be, which somewhat inticed his minde to a wandring delight in her kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that he determined with her to taste what loue was.

Shée was no sooner gone, but <hi>Parismus</hi> secretly stepped to the doore, with purpuse to behold if her beautie and person were agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her other conditions, and sawe her to be a most gallant and beautifull Damosell, which sight so inticed his mind, that assoone as shée was comming to him with the candle, hée blewe the same out, and tolde her that a light fitted not at that time, for it might be a meanes to bewray their secret méeting, which shee allowed for a sufficient excuse: wherewith <hi>Parismus</hi> bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to entertaine her, with such kinde dalliance as earst hée neuer tasted, she kindly reprouing his behauiour, yet had no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to resist: at which time (to both their delights) he depriued her of the Iewell she was vnwilling to losse, but with his pithy perswasions yeelded vnto: he vsing such a sweete attractiue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as was able to conquere the chastest. <hi>Parismus</hi> reaped such sweete content from this Uirgins pure delightfull bodie, that he was altogether vnwilling to leaue her pleasant imbracings, but at last remembring his estate, told her that he would work such meanes for sauegard of her honour, as she should wel like of: she poore soule with weeping eyes and heartie sighes, badde him adiue. Kindly kissing at the parting, he gaue her a rich Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, which he desired her to were for his sake, and tooke from her finger a King, which he promised he would euerlastingly weare as her fauour.

Deare Loue (quoth he,) account you it so lately, when (I protest) I thought these thrée dayes sithence I saw you, to be longer then thrée yeares: by which spéeches she perceiued that another had ouerheard their appointment, and by that meanes deceiued her, which made her growe so much in loathing of her present suter, that euer after shee shunned his companie, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Many daies continued the Persians before the walles of <hi>Thebes,</hi> neuer giuing any assault, nor once comming foorth of their Trenches, which caused the Thessalians to count them halfe vanquished. During which time, <hi>Parismus</hi> (knowne by the name of the blacke knight) did fight many braue combats with the Persians, by which meanes the Court of <hi>Dionisius</hi> was filled with the resounding ecchoes of excéeding praises made in commendation of his prowes and vnconquered chiualry, but most of all they wondred at his strangenesse to bee knowne, and the rather, for that none could learne where hee made his abode, knowing that it could not bee farre from the Citie.

Whose message, the Persian King kindely accepted, and vpon his Kingly promise protested to continue a truce for that day, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potniting the place of meeting, to be on the Greene before the west gate of the City: whither he came with the Kings that were with him, and <hi>Sicanus</hi> his Sonne: whither also <hi>Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> and the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with all the rest of the Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates on the Thessalian party likewise came.

                        <hi>Parismus</hi> still hauing his eyes seated on the Uertuous Lady <hi>Laurana,</hi> at last <hi>Dionisius</hi> came downe from the seate of State, and most kindely saluted him, telling them, since it was their pleasure so much to doe him honour, as to become his Combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, hée would (if it pleased God to graunt them the Uicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,) not be vnmindefull of their Courtisie, nor vngratefull for their paines.</p>
                     <p>No sooner was <hi>Dionisius</hi> Seated againe, but the Trumpet (according to the woonted manner,) beganne to summon these Champions to the battell. <hi>Parismus</hi> looking backe vppon <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana,</hi> (as if from thence hée had fetcht his being,) waued his Launce about his heade, and the Champions mette with such fury, that shiuering their Launces into a thousand péeces, they passed by without any harme at all, then drawing their swords <hi>Parismus</hi> encountred <hi>Zoylus, Pollipus Brandor,</hi> and the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law <hi>Ramon,</hi> betweene whom began a most firce, terrible, and cruell battell, that in short space the Armours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

whose constancie and resolution they maruailed at, and the whole assembly were so desirous of his conquest, that with applaudes and commendations, they extolled his honourable resolution. <hi>Laurana</hi> seeing her Champion readie to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a fresh battell, came to him, and with hartie thankes for his honourable paines taking in her behalfe, desired him to desist from the combat, for that it might much endaunger his person, <hi>Parismus</hi> lighting from his horse, reuerently kissed her hans, the very touch whereof, reuiued his spirits with ioye, and tolde her, that if it were her pleasure <hi>Parismus</hi> wrongs should go vnreuenged, he would soone desist: otherwise being vowed her poore Knight, he would either at that instant make <hi>Sicanus</hi> confesse his treason, or spend his latest breath in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite of that quarrell: and therefore hee most humbly craued her pardon.</p>

so daunted the hearts of the Persians, that they alotted him the conquest, before euer that he beganne the Combat.</p>

and by the Persian kings, who so well liked the blacke knights behauiour, that they resolued to stay some dayes there, as well to be acquainted with this valiant knight, as also to do him al the honour they could, thought by his valour they had lost the victorie. The stréetes where they passed, whereby the Citizens strowed with flowers, the windowes &amp; doores, and house tops, were filled with abundance of people, (that they séemed like stages) they came to behold these conquerours.

whatsoeuer can procure your disquiet, shall likewise purchase my discontent. <hi>Parismus</hi> most reuerently taking her by the hand, said: Most vertuous Lady, I acknowledge my selfe so farre bound vnto you for many worthy fauoures vndeserued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestowed vpon mee, that I know not which way to yeelde you sufficient thankes for the least of them, much lesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them: and if I should deny to fulfill your request heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, vnto whom I am perpetually bound, I should shew my selfe altogether void of manners: Therefore know (most vertuous Lady) that my supposed discontentment, was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and delightfull meditation.

                     <p>In these and such like kind conferences they continued talking in the Garden, to both their vnspeakable ioies, being so vnited in the bondes of perfect amitie, that it was impossible to remoue their setled friendship. But Dinner time beeing come, they departed to their seuerall waies, being both high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contentented with the others faithfull promise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> no sooner found opportunity, but hee made his loue to <hi>Laurana</hi> knowne to his Father, who was glad of his sonnes vertuous choise, and promised him to motion the same to <hi>Dionisius,</hi> which he presently did by this occasion. As hee was walking alone, hee was encountred by <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and <hi>Oliuia</hi> the Queene, not accompanied by any: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindely saluted each other, <hi>Dionisius</hi> beganne to talke of the worthinesse of <hi>Parismus,</hi> and telling him
<pb facs="tcp:16915:60"/>
that he estéemed him the most fortunate man liuing, to be the father of so vertuous a child, enting so farre into commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, that the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> thought he could haue no fitter time to motion the marriage then that, and therefore answered; My Lord, I thanke you for entring into such good liking of my Sonne, whom I cannot discommend, for that he hath well deserued honor, but I haue an humble sute vnto you and the Queene heere present, in his behalfe, which if you will vouchsafe to grant, both he and I shall be bound vnto you for the same. <hi>Dionisius</hi> and <hi>Oliuia</hi> earnestly requested him to manifest the same. My Sonne (saith hee) intreated me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest your honourable fauour, to contract a marriage betwixt him and your most vertuous Daughter, vnto whom hee hath wholly dedicated his affections, that I am now become an humble sutorin his behalfe. <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and the Quéene hearing his request, were so exceeding glad thereof (beeing the onely thing they desired) that taking the King of <hi>Bohomia</hi> by the hand, they told him, they were highly contentedit should be so. Thus al things falling out to their contentments, they parted for that time: <hi>Dionisius</hi> the next day assembled al his counsell and noble men together, and there me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned the contract vnto them, who most willingly consented therto, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the newes of this marriage was soone published, that it came to the hearing of <hi>Sicanus,</hi> who being inraged with griefe and shame, abandoned the company of all Knights, and in short time grew to such a desperate conceit of his impaired honour, that with griefe thereof hee died, which brought some heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the rest: but his death was soone forgotten, for that his Father estéemed him not worthy the name and estimation of a King, and had lately growne into great dislike of him, and altogether fauoured the next Sonne <hi>Lennilus,</hi> who farre excelled his brother <hi>Sicanus</hi> in vertuous qualitie. The solemnization of <hi>Parismus</hi> marriage was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to beginne within forty daies, to the vnspeakeable ioy of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> but especally, of the two yong Princes, in

which time <hi>Dionisius</hi> sent messengers to inuite thither many Kinges and Potentates, by meanes wherof, the Fame of these nuptialls was spred in most places of the world, and many hundreth Knights determined to méete there to doe honour to <hi>Dionisius,</hi> whose vertues by report, had bene made knowne vnto them. To this marriage came the famous Emperour of <hi>Constantinoble,</hi> with many other worthy knights.

                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> for the more royall entertainment of the States there assembled, caused a most stately Tilt to be erected on a goodly gréene before the Pallace gate, the stages being most

cunningly made, by expert workemen, and proclaimed a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe to be made there for seuen dayes, against all commers. The first dayes tryumph, the Prince of <hi>Sparta</hi> and his knights helde, as chiefe Challengers, who appeared before the whole assembly of States, who were seated vpon the Scaffoldes, in such royall manner, that the glorie of them séemed to excell the stately pompe of the mightie Monarch <hi>Alexander.</hi> Amongst the rest, <hi>Laurana</hi> was seated in a Chaire of state, Crowned with an Emperiall Diademe, as Ladie of the Reuels: who had prepared seuerall giftes for the Conquerours, shining like golden <hi>Phoebus,</hi> and her eyes twinkeling like two bright shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning starres, that her beautie made the whole assembly of straunge Knights admire her excellencie. The Prince of <hi>Sparta</hi> had his Tent pitcht at the first entring into the Listes, being as white as milke, shewing his single estate, on the toppe whereof, was artificially framed a Golden Sunne, which with his splendor beautified the Listes. This dayes tryumphe was performed by the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and his Knightes, with excéeding valour, himselfe hauing vnhorsed aboue fortie Knights, of straunge Countries, and had giuen to him by the Bride a payre of siluer Gloues, made by the cunningest work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world.</p>
                     <p>Thus in great royaltie, to the excéeding pleasure of the beholders, was the first day spent, till the darke euening caused the knights to giue ouer, and betake themselus to their nights repose.</p>
                     <p>Early the next morning the knights were summoned to the Listes, by the sounde of Trumpets, the chiefe Champion for that daye, was Lord <hi>Remus</hi> of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> richly mounted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a Thessalian stéede of Iron graye, his Tente pitcht néere vnto the other, being of the colour of the Raine-bowe: on the top whereof, was artificially tramed a swift running Hart, whereby the countrey of <hi>Thessaly</hi> was famous: before him, went foure Pages richly attired, carrying some seuerall scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions: on the first, was portraited his Mistresse picture: on
<pb facs="tcp:16915:61"/>
the second, thrée siluer Doues, signifing his innocencie, farre from vaine ostentation: on the third, a bleeding hart: and on the last, a man séeming desperate: who behaued himselfe with no lesse valour, then the Prince of <hi>Sparta,</hi> to the great ioy of his Lady <hi>Isabella.</hi> The third day the worthy knight <hi>Pollipus</hi> was chiefe challenger, who had his tent richly picht ouer against the Stage, being of the colour of blood, on the top whereof stoode a Lion Rampant, his stéede furnished with costly abilaments of beaten Gold, his armour after the Phrigian maner, whose matchlesse chiualry vnhorsed that day an hundred knights, and woon the prize from all the knights that encountred him. The fourth day Lord <hi>Osirus</hi> of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> was chief challenger, whose tent was pitcht in maner of a hollow trée, from whence hee is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, so artificially ouerspred with mosse, that hee seemed to be nothing but a lumpe thereof, running vp and downe the fielde, but so honourably hee behaued himselfe, that hee was allotted that dayes conquest.</p>
                     <p>The fift day Prince <hi>Lemulus,</hi> sonne to the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> was chiefe challenger, whose tent was of the colour of the skie, his abilaments was of the colour of Azure, beset with starres of Gold, who behaued himselfe with great honour most part of that day: but at last he was encountred by the valiant King of <hi>Frize,</hi> by whome he was vnhorsed, by reason that his stéede stumbled, &amp; so the conquest returned to the aduerse partie. The King of <hi>Frize,</hi> vnhorsed afterwardes many worthy knightes, to his excéeding commendation,</p>
                     <p>The sixt day the King of <hi>Frize</hi> was challenged ouer the aduerse partie, who had not continued long, but hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horsed by the King of <hi>Libia,</hi> who most part of that day bare away the Prize, vntil he was encountred by <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and by him vnhorsed: <hi>Guido</hi> for that day bare away the Prize, hauing vnhorsed many hundred Knights, and was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to atchiue the chiefest honour of the Turnament. The seuenth day <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> came with great triumph into the Listes, hauing his Tent pitcht in full view of the whole
<pb facs="tcp:16915:62"/>
assembly, being of the colour of the bright gold, supported by foure Elephants, himselfe mounted vpon a coloured steede, most richly behung with abiliments of beaten gold, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himselfe most part of that day, to the shame of the Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salian and Persian Knights, that the whole assembly admired his valiantnesse.

Many other spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches bee vsed to comfort her in her sadnesse, who was the more comfortable, for that she was in his company: they had not long continued in this good hope of recouering land, but they espied a ship making towards them with all speed, who being come neere to him, they knew him to be a Pirat, who presently began to board the ship wherein <hi>Parismus</hi> was, but the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners resisted them, wherewith began a fearefull battell. <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> being vnder ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Afterward they boorded the Pirates (who were belonging to <hi>Andramart</hi> of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> the Scythian Pirate, that had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the whole world with the report of his tyranny) &amp; beléeuing them vpon such protestations &amp; oathes, as the villaines made, they conueied such riches, Iewels, and prouisions as they had, aboord the Pirats ship, for that their owne was shrewdly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beatten. And likewise hauing shifted <hi>Laurana, Leda,</hi> and <hi>Adonius,</hi> into the same, sunke their owne, and placed such few Marriners as they had left aliue, for gouernours ouer the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, they made towards the Iland which they saw before them, and soone landed, determining there to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, where they found the Country waste and desolate, without any inhabitant, yet well replenished with wild Déere and Foule, of which they got good store.

                        <hi>Parismus</hi> demanded of the Pyrates if they knew that Iland, who told him, that they gaue it the name of the Desolate I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, for that they neuer saw any liuing creature there: but they told him that there was a beautifull Castle, that stood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of a mightie Rocke, in the middest of the Iland, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited as they thought by some Diuels, for that many of their fellowes had oftentimes gone thither, but none of them euer returned, nor they neuer saw any creature in any place of the Iland besides: though there were many goodly Townes not inhabited.

                     <p>But séeing <hi>Parismus</hi> come to himselfe, looking like one ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maistred with care, and staring vpon him like a madde man, fearing that this sodaine griefe had altered his wittes, vttered these spéeches; Most noble Prince, since it is allotted vnto you to bée thus crossed in your happinesse, I bée séech you beare the same patiently, and remit this extreame care, which so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maistreth your vertues, that their splendor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not shine in such perfect sort, as wontedly they haue done: what can helples grief auaile you? what can care herein pleasure you? or what can this distemperature sorrowe helpe you in the recouery of your lost friend? then doe not shewe your selfe so inconsiderate, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy your sences in this sort, but let vs consult which way to recouer them for these sorrowes, &amp; ten thousand times as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, cannot any way pleasure you.

How can I containe my selfe within the compasse of reason, when my losse excéedeth the bounds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? how can I with patience beare this affliction, when my losse is such as all the worldes wealth cannot counteruaile? How should wisedome beare sway in me, when she was my onely wisedome, and with her precious selfe, all that was mine is departed from me? Why should I not torment my self, when through my selfe she is perished? Why should I not rage, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,

How then can I asswage my griefe, but rather increase the same? what sufficient torment can I inflict vpon my cankred carelesse heart, that left her in their custodie, and by that meanes haue lost the fruition of her Diuine presence, whereby my life was maintained?</p>
                     <p>No, no, <hi>Pollipus,</hi> my sorrowes are such as can no way bee salued, therefore it were but in vaine to perswade my selfe that there is any hope left to redeeme this my vncomparable losse, and lost Friend: Heere you see we are left in an vnfrequented place, inuironed round with the Sea, and no meanes to escape a miserable death by famishment, vppon this accursed Land, that was ordained to be my graue: then <hi>Pollipus,</hi> what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile haue you left to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort vs withall?

<pb facs="tcp:16915:71"/>
and weigh the estate that we are in, and then I doe not doubt, but your wisedome will consider, that it is better for you to preserue your selfe for his sake, then by destroying your selfe, be guiltie both of your owne death and his too.

refreshed with wine &amp; venison, which this old man had alwaies ready. After that they had well satisfied their hunger with this good cheere, the olde man requested to know of whence they were, and by what disastred mischance they were arriued on that vnhappy Iland. <hi>Parismus</hi> told him how he was sonne to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and that his Companion was a Knight of <hi>Phrigia,</hi> rehearsing vnto him all their whole misaduenture, and the losse of <hi>Laurana,</hi> vttering the same in such doleful wise, that the old Hermit could not refraine from grief. By that time <hi>Parismus</hi> had ended his Tragical discourse, it waxed dark, and therefore the old Hermit had brought them vnto their lodging which was the same bed whereon he layed himselfe (there bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other) on which <hi>Parismus</hi> was very vnwilling to lie, thereby to displace this good old man: but by the manifolde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the Hermit, he yéelded, and soone addressed himselfe therunto, desiring <hi>Pollipus</hi> to be his bedfellow, and for that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> was somwhat sickly, they laide him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midst betwixt them, for that he had done them many pleasures in their trauel, <hi>Parismus</hi> being so far in loue with him, as he would haue ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured his own life to do him good.

When hauing gotten my Crown, they imprisoned my Quéen and two sonnes, and a daughter, which I had liuing, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they could neuer quietly enioy the gouernment, but were oftentimes disturbed by my subiects, who vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to liue vnder his tyranny, for that hee daily grew more odious amongst them, that by continuall warre his Countrey was almost wasted, and by the counsell of that wicked Hagge <hi>Bellona,</hi> he with his consederates betooke themselues vnto a Mountaine heere hard by, and there Fortified themselues, and by witchcraft framed an inuincible Castle, from whence they continually issued forth, and vanquished and slew most of my noble men, the rest remaining now in their custody, in most miserable seruitude.

they came vnto the maine castle (wherin the seruants of <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball</hi> told them, they neuer saw any to enter) which they found fast shut, &amp; assayed by all meanes they could to open the same, but their labour was in vaine, which caused them to maruell what might be the cause therof. But they were no sooner depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (determining to go sée where <hi>Bellona</hi> lay dead) but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the windes began to blow with such veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, that with much adoo they could stand vpright: wherewith such thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drings &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pests began to arise, that all the whole Rock shooke wheron the castle stood, &amp; the buildings quaked, in such maner, that such as were within the compasse of the roofes, ran forth into the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> court, &amp; the lower wherinto <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Pollipus</hi> would haue entred, seemed to turne into a mighty flame, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence came such a smoke, as darkned the whole place where they stood that they could not sée one another.

The riuer, ouer which they had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, was not to be séene, nor any other goodly thing, that before séemed most admirable for beauty. Wherefore <hi>Parismus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Tent to be picht for their habitation, being no other there to be had. <hi>Druball</hi> being (as before I said) in prison, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this noise, and séeing the darkenesse that ouerspred the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, soone knew, for <hi>Bellona</hi> had reported the secret thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him before, that <hi>Bellona</hi> was dead: he by that meanes des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately without any hope of aide, beate out his owne braines against the stone walles, and his body being found in that sort murdered, <hi>Parismus</hi> commanded to bee cast as a pray to the beasts of the field, for that he was not worthy of buriall. After which, the two Knightes came to the Queene, who was in the Tent, accompanied by her two sonnes and daughter, who by <hi>Adonius</hi> good tendance were wel strengthened, &amp; they no sooner

Uertuous Lady (quoth she) I haue long diligently marked the doleful plaints you secretly vtter, which maketh me muse, that you hauing no cause at al, shuld spend your daies in such heauie sort, wheras you might (if you plesed) inioy such happy delights as many thousand ladies wold wish for. You are here in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie place in my opinion, where nothing is wanting that might procure your content, where no iniurie is offered you, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you indure some secret griefe, I know not what to coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of your discontent: and the loue of <hi>Andramart</hi> in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment faire Lady, should bring you that happie consent, that yet you neuer enioyed the like, who in all respects beareth such an intire affection to your selfe, that whatsoeuer he hath or can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This hag was so inragde with the sharpe answere of <hi>Laurana,</hi> that presently she came to <hi>Andramart,</hi> and told him that there was no dealing with hir in gentle sort, rehearsing how disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully she refused all the proffers and sutes she could make; vsing such perswasions, that <hi>Andramart</hi> consented to be wholly orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by her, nothing regarding what she intended, so hée might haue his desire. <hi>Adamasia</hi> therfore purposing to bring her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse to effect, first caused <hi>Leda</hi> to be prisoned and restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from her mistresses presence, which was an insupportable gréefe to her.

The Nurse hauing receiued the young <hi>Parismenos,</hi> with great ioy departed to the place of her aboad, where she was no sooner come, but she then began presently to deuise how to saue the swéete Babe from death: for although she was a stranger to <hi>Laurana,</hi> a woman of a rude and barbarous Nation, and altogether voide of Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, yet by the Diuine operation, she was so farre in loue with that most sweet countenance of the yong Infant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, she tooke such delight to educate so gallant a Childe, that she determined either to saue him from <hi>Adamasias</hi> cruelty, or thereby worke her owne destruction: therefore in the middest of the darke night, when all things were at silence, she stole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Castle with <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and by that time it was day, she was trauelled some twenty miles from the same, wher she gate into a woode, and there made such prouision, that she carefully brought vp <hi>Parismenos,</hi> as conueniently as was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for her to doe, in that vnfrequented place, of whom wee will speake more heereafter.</p>

                        <hi>Andrmart</hi> into such an amazement, that with many thousand oathes vowes and protestations, he requested <hi>Laurana</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest vnto him the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of these her spéeches, which she was vrged to doe, wondring at the many intreaties he made, for she thought assuredly it had béen by his procurement, but at last by his protestations, she suspected the contrary, &amp; began to declare to him the manner of her vsage: How she was daily whipt and beaten by two olde mercilesse women, and how <hi>Adamasia</hi> had murdered her sonne <hi>Parismenos,</hi> with remembrance of whose death she vttered such aboundance of teares, that <hi>Andramart</hi> was likewise ready to weepe, to see the sorrow shee endured.

her steps, she fell downe a high paire of staires, and dasht out her hatefull braines, and in that maner according to her owne wicked life, she desperately ended her daies. <hi>Andramart</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her death not sufficient to make amends for the cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Laurana</hi> had indured, in furious sort, ranged vp &amp; down the castle, vntil he had found the old hags that had bin <hi>Adama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> instruments of furie, one of them he immediatly slew, and the other fled into the court, whom he pursused, and in the sight of his mistresse, (who was beholding the dead body of <hi>Adama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia)</hi> at one blow he parted her cursed head from her filthy body. Which in some sort, reioyced <hi>Laurana</hi> to sée, but he still ran vp and downe, raging in such cruel sort, that his seruant fled from his presence, and hid themselues for feare of his furie.

These discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, draue them to the trial of their vttermost wits, for by the perswasion they had to finde <hi>Laurana</hi> there, they determined (though the attempt were neuer so dangerous) to make tryall thereof, or <hi>Parismus</hi> rather determined to be detained there as a prisoner, then to leaue any thing vnperformed, whereby he was put in any comfort of his long &amp; wished expectation. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such as were the seruants of <hi>Oswald,</hi> they told them that the conquest of that place wholly rested in their powers: therfore <hi>Parismus</hi> saide, if you will condiscend to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my direction herein, I do not doubt but easily to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish the same, and for your truth reward you so kindly, as you shall

no way néede to feare the furie of <hi>Andramart,</hi> who maketh no other account of you, but to keepe you as his vassalls &amp; slaues, in bondage and cruell seruitude, whereas if you will be faithful and true vnto me, I will set you at libertie, and rewarde you, to your hearts content. For I my selfe am Gouernor of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey farre excéeding this place, whither I will conduct you with mée, if I happily atchieue my desire herein, or if my determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation faileth herein, you shall safely retire into our ships, and be acquitted from all feare of his reuenge.</p>
                     <p>The Pirates hearing the curteous spéeches of <hi>Parismus,</hi> hauing also in the time they had been in his company noted his Princely behauiour, and on the other side weighing the estate they remained in, being his prisoners, on whom hée might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a cruell punishment, if they should refuse to ayde him in the request he made, and also considering the little account <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart</hi> had alwaies made of them, and the crueltie hée vsed to them: All these considerations wrought such a change in the hearts of these poore slaues, that they fréely condisended to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his directions in any thing hée should demaund.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> was gladde of their consent, but fearing to trust them, hée vttered these spéeches. Syrs, I thanke you for your willingnesse to pleasure mée, but pardon mée, though I make some question of your loyaltie, for that I haue been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by men of your profession: and as I suppose, of <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marts</hi> seruants, by whose vnfaithfulnesse, these miseries that wée are fallen into haue happened. Whereuppon hée tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to report vnto them the treachery of the Pyrates in the desolate Iland, thereby to make vnfaithfulnesse séeme odious in their sights.</p>
                     <p>The Pyrates vowed with such confidence to bée true vnto them, that they were fully assured of their faith, and being now neare the place of their landing, admiring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wonderful strength of the same, thus they continued their stratageme. <hi>Parismus, Pollipus,</hi> and <hi>Barzillus</hi> (who would néedes accompanie them
<pb facs="tcp:16915:96"/>
armed themselues with the best armour they had, and putting on sea gownes (whereunder they had conueyed their swords so secretly, that none could discerne the same) were conducted as conquered by the Pyrats, vnto the passage into the Iland, and <hi>Adonius</hi> in their company (who by no means would leaue them.)

This exploit was so suddenly performed, that those within the Castle had no knowledge thereof, which fell out well for the two knights, who quietly rested in that place,
<pb facs="tcp:16915:97"/>
being no way moiested that night, but were excéedingly gréeued to heare the groues, cries, and gréeuous complaints, of such as remained in prison, which continued in such misery, as it were too heauy to report. Early the next morning, these Noble min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Knights, hauing with wise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration, weighed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test perill of this their attempt, attended their fittest opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which thus fell out. Sitting in their secret shrowd, they espyed some of the seruants passe in and out at the Castle gate, whither they presently went, and came to the porter with these spéeches.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by reason of their number, shut too the same againe, and run vnto <hi>Andramart,</hi> who hearing their report, presently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded 20. of his best knights to arme themselues, himself likewise ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himself, and went down to the gate, which he commanded to be opened, &amp; séeing no more but only two knights, (himselfe not vouchsafing to speake to them) commanded his seruants to carry them to prison, by which meanes they had occasion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within the gates, when drawing their swords they stood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their defence, which <hi>Andramarts</hi> men began to laugh at, thinking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> foolish to resist them: but it fel out to their sorrow.

easily withstood their force, and by exquisit skil, furthered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that still the assailants perished, and in short space they had slaine the one halfe of them, and the rest seeing their party still decrease began to draw back, which turned to their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for these Knights perceiuing them to quaile, so furiously assaulted them, that they all there ended their liues: which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that stood by perceiuing, fled into another Court, and shut a strong gate against the knights that pursued them, and in the meane time, by the commandement of <hi>Andramart,</hi> they were inclosed within that Court, by such, as while they were in this fight, went out at a postern gate, &amp; fastned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate at which they entred, so suresy that it was impossible for them to get out by which means they were inclosed in that court.

This draue these Knights into such veration, that they could not tel what to do, nor how to behaue themselus. <hi>Andramart</hi> séeing his men thus flaughtered only by two knights, greatly admired their valor, and also maruelling what the occasion of their quarrel might be, which he desired to know, fearing the treachery of his seruants that kept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> passage by meanes wherof, before that time, he euer thought himself in security: he spake vnto them (looking from ouer the wal) in this sort. Knights (quoth he) what séeke you in this place, that hath moued you to offer such outrage against my seruants? If any that belongeth vnto me hath offered you discourtesse, Iam rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to sée him make you sufficient satisfaction: if none hath done you offence, I would wish you depart without bringing your selues in further danger: for so much I regard your good (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding your valour) that I would be loth to seeke reuenge of these my seruants death, but set you at liberty, so you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to depart, with offering me no further iniurie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> thus replied, If thou art the owner, and ruler of

this Castle (as I suppose) then know that we are such as goe in search of a lost friend, whom we assuredly thinke thou vniustly detainest, for none but thy selfe wouldst do such a discourteous déed: as also hearing of the trechery thou vsest to trauellers, and the continuall outrages thou attemptest by Sea, whereof wee haue had sufficient triall, we determinately came, aswel to find our lost frind, as also to requite the discourtesie we haue found by thy seruants, since which our comming thou knowest what we haue begunne, and our determination is to goe forwards, vnlesse thou wilt vouchsafe of curtesie to let vs see the prisoners thou detainest, which if thou deniest assure thy self we are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bent to purchase the thing we came for, or in pursute therof, hazard our dearest bloud: therefore resolue vs what thou wilt do, for we challenge thee, if thou hast any spake of honourable Knighthood, to shew the same, in honourable, and not in treacherous sort, which will make our reuenge more sharpe. <hi>Andramart</hi> hearing the speeches of the valiant <hi>Parismus,</hi> could not well tell in what sort to answer him, one while purposing to detaine them in that place: but not confidently trusting the strength thereof, that thought was soone vanished, Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to coniecture that <hi>Laurana</hi> was the Lady, in whose search they came: with all remembring that she should be taken from him, which was more grieuous then a thousand deathes, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to offer them the sight of the prisoners, fearing that they would otherwise doe him some mischiefe. At last, a multitude of sundry cogitations so oppressed his minde, that he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to try the vttermost of their power, and to put them in the most extremity that might be: and therefore returneth them this answer. Proud Knight (quoth hee) whose malice I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing feare, know that I will not in any respect yeeld your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and therefore content your selues with this answer, that I am determined (since you refuse my gentle offer) to detaine your heere, vntill your pride be somewhat abated, and by that time, I hope you will wish you had accepted my offer: and with those words departed, which vexed the two Knights,
<pb facs="tcp:16915:98"/>
the rather for that they were voyd of meanes to séeke reuenge: being inclosed in such sorte, that there was no way for them to escape Famishment: Where they continued all that night in most heauie case, not beeing able to take one minutes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Parismus</hi> on the other side, had his minde troubled with a thousand cogitations, of his beloued <hi>Laurana,</hi> whome hée thought assuredly to be there imprisoned, which draue him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such good hope, that notwithstanding the extremity of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dramart,</hi> hée shewed a countenance of greater ioy then before he had vsed, which reioyced <hi>Pollipus</hi> and poore <hi>Adonius,</hi> whose heart was much greeued to see the perill his deere freends were like to endure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andramart</hi> began to coniecture, that if <hi>Laurana</hi> were the Lady of whom they sought, then it was his best course to keepe them as prisoners still in that place, and not to destroy them by famishment, as before hée had determined: but to rid himselfe of that doubt. he priuily called <hi>Leda</hi> vnto him, &amp; brought her vnto a secret place, where shée might behold the two Knights with these speeches, Damsell quoth hee (there are newly arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at my Castle, two Knights, whome I suppose are come in search of thy missresse <hi>Laurana:</hi> therfore I desire you to resolue me.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> presently sent a messenger to <hi>Barzillus,</hi> to certifie him of theyr happy successe, who leauing the custodie of the Passage to his trustiest Souldiours, came to be partaker with them in theyr reioycings.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:16915:105"/>
to conceale the same from <hi>Parismus,</hi> which made them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maruell. And vppon a day when <hi>Pollipus</hi> by the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Parismus</hi> hadde rehearsed the whole discourse of all theyr Aduentures in the Desolate Iland, and the occasion of theyr arriuall in that place, <hi>Laurana</hi> with these sad remembrances, was put in minde, déepely to compare her owne miseries with theirs, and found them to be greater, for that they were all in safety, but shee missed her young Sonne, who was vntimely lost, which strooke such a sadnesse into all her Sences, that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely shee burst into aboundance of teares. Which draue them all into an admiration, that <hi>Adonius</hi> and <hi>Leda</hi> seeing her teares, could not refraine from partaking with her in that sadnesse, but (as the custome of Women is) wept for company. <hi>Parismus</hi> maruelling what was the cause of her sorrowe, and desirous to knowe the same, for that his heart therewith was excéedingly tormented, most earnestly intreated her to vnfolde the cause of her griefe, that he might (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Laurana</hi> beeing vnwilling in the least degrée to shewe her selfe vndutifull to his will, began to declare the manner of her bringing to that place by the Pyrates, after they had betrayed him on the coast of the Desolate Iland, as also the kindnesse she had found at <hi>Andramarts</hi> handes, and how that from time to time, he had vsed her in most honourable sort.</p>
                     <p>But my Lorde (quoth shee) <hi>Andramart</hi> had a Sister na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Adamasia,</hi> who many times vrged mée to yeelde to Loue her Brother: Which when shee could effect by no perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: First shee imprisoned my Seruant <hi>Leda,</hi> next shee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde from mee (the cause of this my sadnesse,) my young Sonne, that was borne in this vnluckie place, whome I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be named <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and with cruell torment afflicted my bodie, and daylie caused two Olde-Women to whippe me in most cruell sort, which I was contented to endure. But when shee sawe that all this would not preuaile, she caused the Nurse that kept <hi>Parismenos,</hi> to come vnto mee with a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,

                     <p>And being about that cruell déede, I intreated her to referre his punishment and vnnaturall Doome, vntill the nexte day, since which time I neuer saw my tender Babe; nor is hée, or his Nurse any where to be founde: and afterwardes againe, shee centinued her former manner of crueltie.</p>
                     <p>Nowe <hi>Andramart</hi> all this while by perswasions of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, absented himselfe from mée (for that shée had promised him to obtaine my consent to his request) nothing misdoubting the crueltie shée daylie vsed to mee. But at length séeing his sute still frustrated, and finding (as well by mine owne report, as by other manifest prooses) her treacherie, and my miserie, hee would with his Sworde haue slaine her: but shée running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to auoyde his rigour, burst her necke downe a payre of stayres.</p>
                     <p>The two Olde-Women hée likewise slue with his owne hands: my Seruants he sent vnto mee, and euer after againe, vsed me in most kinde and good sorte. And the very day when you entered in fight in this Court, he caused mee to be lodged in the place where you found mée. The greatest cause of this my sadnesse is, the losse of my young Sonne, whose death was vntimely, and whose presence would haue expelled such sadde thoughts as haue possessed my minde: and disquieted the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie content I should receiue by your honourable presence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> hauing heard the summe of her Tragicall report, could not chuse but grieue, especially to think of the miserie she had indured, and the death of his young Sonne, whom he had neuer seene, that what with his, and <hi>Lauranaes</hi> sadnes, all the whole company were growne into heauinesse. But with the comfortable perswasions of <hi>pollipus,</hi> the remembrance of these griefs were somwhat mittigated. Many dayes after they stayd in this Castle, in good and quiet estate, vntill the longing desire <hi>Parismus</hi> had to returne into <hi>Thessalie,</hi> caused him to make

                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Laurana,</hi> remaining in happie and peaceable contentednesse, by meanes of theyr good successe, hauing respite to viewe others griefes, began to note the sadde countenance of <hi>Pollipus,</hi> which before they did not marke: which caused <hi>Parismus</hi> suspect that his olde Sore was not cured, which was, his Loue to <hi>Violetta,</hi> wherein hee aymed aright: for <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> seeing his trauells for <hi>Laurana,</hi> were at an ende, beganne to desire to heare some newes of <hi>Violetta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though there was no likelyhood fore him to attaine her Loue, yet the extreamitie of his affections were such, that hee thought he could no way content himselfe better, then to spend the rest of his life in her seruice, still purposing (according to a most noble and constant Resolution,) neuer to desist from
<pb facs="tcp:16915:106"/>
shewing the true zeale he bare to purchase her fauour. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hee could spend many houres in secrete complaintes and Protestations of his true and loyall Loue: wherin (according to the humours of Loue-sicke people) hée thought hee did in some measure ease his heart. Which behauiour of his, <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> well noting, (as beeing infected with the selfe-same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease) would oftentimes interrept him in his sadde Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with such conceytes, that <hi>Pollipus</hi> woondered to sée such wisdome in a Boy: but by reason that shee was taken to be no other then a Boy, he entred into no déeper consideration of her actions. In the silent Night time <hi>Violetta</hi> did with such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse affect his complaintes, that when hée sighed, shée likewise sighed: and if hée chanced at any time to complaine of his hard Fortune, <hi>Violetta</hi> would as often blesse the happie time, and houre when shee first saw him, and that shee was so happie to be beloued of so honourable a Knight. The variable difference of whose Ioyes were contrarie: For <hi>Pollipus</hi> (little thinking his <hi>Violetta</hi> had bene so néere him) continually spent his time in heauinesse, not being any way able to comfort himselfe with any hope of attayning his wished desire, being eftsoones terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the remembrance of her last doome, and deniall to his sute, as also the manifolde mischaunces that might befall her, or that shee hadde so wilfully thrust herselfe into, with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other displeasant thoughtes, sufficient enough to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage anie from presuming vpon any good successe. By meanes whereof, hee continually remained in most heauie and sadde Estate, still deuising how to ease his heart of that care it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, wherein hee greatly excelled in constancie, the fickle and wandring thoughtes of diuerse, which are discouraged from persisting in theyr first Resolutions, for euery small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which might well please a curious Ladyes eye, his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered Ualour and prowesse, whereby hee atchieued incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible victories with great Fame: the friendship and courteous behauiour that abundantly flowed from his gentle hart, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was apparant, that hee did not disdaine the meanest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Besides, hearing the continuall complaints hée made of her hard sentence, and the constancie of his Resolution, for that he determined to spend his life in her seruice: and all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shée tooke in his company, being neuer from him in the day time, and his Bedfellow in the night, that she was priuy to all his actions, vsing many kindnesses, which he full little thought procéeded from such affection.</p>
                     <p>And nothing déeming <hi>Violetta</hi> had bene so priuie to all his Cogitations, though shée poore soule, neuer touched his bodie, but with a trembling feare, remembring her owne Nakednes, still vsing such a Modest kinde of bashfulnesse in her actions, as if many Eyes had beene priuie to her Disguise, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully noted her behauiour, wherewith her ioyes continued in such a secrete content, as is not to be expressed. And one night when she hadde shrowded her selfe within the Bed, as <hi>Pollipus</hi> lay tossing and tumbling, by reason of the restlesse thoughtes hee endured: In the midst of his heauinesse, <hi>Violetta</hi> pittying his sorrowes, and to drawe him from remembring them, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these spéeches.</p>

Yea (quoth <hi>Pollipus)</hi> for Loue is a diuine and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly gift, and Loue it is, that so tormenteth mee: Not that I Loue, but that I am not beloued againe. For in <hi>Thessalie</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:16915:107"/>
loued a Damsell named <hi>Violetta,</hi> whose excellent Beautie, and vertuous gifts, haue so inthralled my Senses, that I feare me Boy, it will be to mée a cause of perpetuall heauinesse. Whose absence is cause of my griefe: and not onely that she is absent, but that I knowe not where to beholde her Attractiue beautie, for euen at my comming from <hi>Thessalie,</hi> she was (I know not by what misaduenture) missing to my great sorrowe, in whose continuall search I am determined to spende the rest of these my wearysome dayes.</p>
                     <p>It is very much, mee thinkes (quoth shée) that you will so much regarde her good, that hath showne her selfe so discourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards you, and surely you are not of my minde, in that you will take such paines to finde her out, and in the ende per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture reape nothing but disdaine for your good will: For it is likely shee hath made choyce of some other Knight, not so worthy to be beloued as your selfe, with whom shee is departed: Then why will you hazarde your person in the daungers inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to trauell, and spend your time, in purchasing nothing but your owne discontent?</p>
                     <p>Well (replyed <hi>Pollipus)</hi> howsoeuer I am rewarded, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand more perills then I can imagine shall not discourage me. For were I but so happie as once to finde her, then would I commit the rest to my good Fortune, which shalbe sufficient, if I can but once againe make my Loue knowne to her, that shée may haue some further triall of my seruice. If shée should not regard you (qd. she) according to your hearts content, I should account her the most discourteous Lady liuing: and were I in her case, I would indure a thousand deaths, rather then shewe my selfe ingratefull to so honourable and kind a friend: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would see the issue of your loue, I desire you that I may be partaker with you in your Trauells: For though I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnworthie to be estéemed of you, yet if you would vouchsafe mee that kindenesse, I would both shewe my selfe dutifull and diligent, and also rest continually bound vnto you for the same. And thus farre I presume (though my wordes

may séeme ridiculous) that if euer you méeto <hi>Violetta,</hi> she will yeelde vnto your iust sute, for I know <hi>Violetta</hi> well, and haue bene better acquainted with her thoughts, then I was worthy of, though shee now hath forsaken her Fathers house, and hath absented her selfe I know not for what occasion.</p>

                        <hi>Pollipus</hi> hearing the Pages wordes, smiled to thinke how farre it was from his power, and yet how kinde he was to put him in such comfort.

Then (qd. she) set your hart at rest and trouble not your selfe with those cares, but liue in hope of some better successe: for my minde perswadeth mee, that you shall find <hi>Violetta</hi> safely returned at your arriuall in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> and if you find it not so, then neuer hereafter credit my words, for I haue already hadde triall of the euent of my presaging thoughts, that I haue oftentimes found things fall out euen according as I haue before déemed. <hi>Pollipus</hi> hearing the boyes speeches, at the first tooke them as spoken of course, but being drawne into a déeper consideration of all his former qualities, beganne to make a doubt whether he should repose any credite in them or no, that his heart euen with those speeches (yet in his fancie, bearing no shewe of likelyhood) was somewhat reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and therefore determined to make tryall of the boyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: such vertue had <hi>Violettas</hi> speeches, that they wrought an expected euent of perswasion, in the heart of the Loue-sicke <hi>Pollipus,</hi> who was easily drawne to yeelde conceit of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, because hee thought <hi>Violetta</hi> might be still in <hi>Thessalie,</hi> and so the Pages wordes prooued true. The rest of that night they past in slumbring Sleepe. The next morning <hi>Pollipus</hi> came to <hi>Parismus</hi> Chamber with a far more cheerefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance then hee was woont, which caused them maruell at his sudden alteration: and afterwards they spent some few dayes in great pleasure, and in the meane time made prouision for theyr departure towardes <hi>Thessalie,</hi> committing the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Castle vnto two of <hi>Andramarts</hi> Seruants, taking

their oath to yéelde the same to <hi>Parismus</hi> againe vpon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds, leauing all the rest likewise so highly contented, as that they account his arriuall the best good fortune that euer befell them.

                     <p>Sir (replied she) my businesse is not ouer great, therefore I am the willingler to stay, especially to beare you companie, vnto whom I am much bound, and a greater fauour then my companie would I graunt, so that it stood with my honour to fulfill: therefore this liberall proffer I make vnto you (whome I knowe will request nothing but that which is vertuous) that if in any conuenient sort, I may doe the thing which may pleasure you, it shall bee your fault if you haue not the same. I thanke you hartily (quoth <hi>Pollipus)</hi> and if I should be vngratefull vnto you for this your kindenesse, I should doo much amisse. And for such desert in me as you speake of, I knowe none at all, but it is your aboundant Courtesie, that vouchsafeth me such fauour, which I knowe not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite, neither can I be so bolde, as to bring my selfe further into your debt, vntill I haue by my indeuours laboured to shew my selfe thankefull for that which you haue alreadie graunted. Manie other spéeches past betwixt them, which if <hi>Pollipus</hi> had diligently marked, he might easile haue séene the loue <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netta</hi> bare him, but he hauing his deuotions vowed to another

Which stil increased her burning affection, that at last, fearing to misse the fit meanes was offered by so sweete oportunitie, taking him by the hand, &amp; withdrawing to a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that lookt into a pleasant garden, with a blushing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance she vttered these spéeches, Sir knight, contrarie to the maner of modest maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I am compelled to hazard the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which may turn to my disshonor vnles it please your vertuous wisdom, to giue a fauorable censure of my good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which I am constrained to do, as procured thereto, by the short abode you determine to make in my fathers Court, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for that I sée your mind ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not conceiue thereof, without I my selfe make demonstration of the same. Wherefore most noble knight, relying vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that loue hath seized my heart with a desire to be loued of you againe, which maketh me manifest the thing that modestie wils me to conceale. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I desire you to vse that charitable opinion of me, as that my honor may no way be misconceited, and my gréefe relieued, which I would neuer haue vttered, but that I shall for euer heareafter be banisht your heauenly company, the affection I beare you being such, that vnlesse you pittie my estate, your depar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At which instant <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana</hi> by occasion entred the gallerie, by means whereof they left off their speeches to salute her, of whose comming <hi>Pollipus</hi> was glad, and a while companied them, in such communication as occasion offered. <hi>Violetta</hi> all this while, had well noted <hi>Frene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> behauior towards <hi>Pollipus,</hi> and listned to their talke which strooke a sodaine feare into her minde, least her spéeches might mooue <hi>Pollipus</hi> to yéelde to her desire, for that shée was very beautifull, besides that the daughter of a king, that euer after she grewe into an extreame ielousie of her, that <hi>Pollipus</hi> could neuer in all the time of his abode there, be in any place, but shée would still attend him, that he wondred at the pages diligent attendance, which procéeded not from the lawfull dutie of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant (as he supposed) but from the faithful loue of a friend. <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus</hi> hauing left <hi>Freneta</hi> with <hi>Laurana</hi> in the gallerie, got to his lodging, to meditate of <hi>Frenetas</hi> rash motions, and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate loue, and the manifolde inconueniences that might arise thereby, as well to call his honour in questions, for that it would bée thought it was procured by his perswasions, as also for that it seemed shée was growne to that desperatenes in loue, that vnlesse shée might inioy the thing shée desired, it would much indanger her selfe, and rather then hée would thinke a thought to violate his vowed loyaltie to <hi>Violet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> himselfe would indure death. For <hi>Violetta,</hi> (though she were no Kings daughter) yet by reason of her excéeding beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie she was much spoken of in <hi>Thebes,</hi> and nothing inferiour to <hi>Freneta</hi> in gifts of minde, the remembrance of whose perfections, together with his loue, hadde so much bounde him in the inuiolable bonds of true friendship to his first belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that for euer after hée eschued all occasions to come in <hi>Frenetaes</hi> sight, but still kept company with <hi>Parismus,</hi> vnto whom hée vnfolded the whole circumstance of that which had passed betwéene him and <hi>Freneta,</hi> which when <hi>Parismus</hi> vnderstood, he told him that she was an honourable Lady, and
<pb facs="tcp:16915:110"/>
that in his opinion, he should do her wrong to reiect her loue, which should proceede from a vertuous inclination, vsing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie perswasions to that effect. Which when <hi>Pollipus</hi> heard, hee saide. My Lord, I cannot so much wrong my deere <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi> as so soone to yeelde ouer my fancy to loue another, and forget her perfections: in whose seruice I haue vowed to spend the rest of my life. Then good my Lord do not so much iniurie that vertuous maiden, who in <hi>Thessalie</hi> hath so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored you, for I will neuer yeeld to loue any but her most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie selfe, so long as my life both last. <hi>Parismus</hi> then answered frend <hi>Pollipus,</hi> I would not any way wrong <hi>Violetta,</hi> nor your selfe, if I saw any likelihood that you should euer see her againe: and yet so much I commende your resolution, as that I shall euer extoll those honourable parts that rule your heart, where by I my selfe haue beene preserued, and obtaine the height of all felicitie, neither do I vtter any worde to alter your affection from <hi>Violetta,</hi> but to make triall of your vertues, which still continue perfect. And since our abode in this place, may againe turne to our disparagement and hinderance, I will by all meanes possible, hasten our departure towardes <hi>Thessalie,</hi> whereby, by good happe, you may finde the partie that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth your happie ioyes, vnto whom I will vse all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions I can to purchase your content.

cause of her sadnesse, though her parents earnestly laboured to know the same, which turned their ioy into care, and their former pleasure into he aninesse. <hi>Pollipus</hi> hauing knowledge thereof, would neuer come at her, vntill the verie day of their departure, and choosing a conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time when she was alone, onely attended by a damosell, hee entred her Chamber: she no sooner espied him but her poore heart began to leape for ioy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting some kindnesse, but <hi>Pollipus</hi> taking her by the hands, saide; Courteous Lady, I am at length come to your presence, to satisfie your mind for that which I would haue you to know. Your loue to me (that am vnworthy thereof) and the little account I seeme to make of the same, hath brought you to that weakenesse you remaine in, which if so it be, I am most heartily sorrie: but for that I am now departing this countrey, I would now satifie you in any thing I could: therefore I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to mitigate the extremity of your passions, which I cannot salue, for that long since, I vowed my seruice vnto a Lady in <hi>Thessalie,</hi> vnto whom I am bound by many inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable bonds of passed promises: neither can I be disloyal to her without impeachment of mine honour, which is the only Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell I most estéeme: then let me perswade you to abstaine from louing him, that cannot shew himselfe so kind as he would, and you deserue, but banish from your minde, all good conceit or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of me, that must against my will be ingrateful: and if in any other sort, I may do the thing with hazard of my life that may content you, I am héere readie to accomplishe your wil. And in my absence do not accuse me of inhumanity, for I may not nor will not, do any Lady wrong: vpon whose fauour, my life, if it were ten thousand times dearer, dependeth. <hi>Freneta</hi> hearing his resolute and vncomfortable words, fell in a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swound, which her maide perceiuing, laboured to reuiue her againe: in the meane time, he departed to <hi>Parismus,</hi> and hauing solemnly taken their leaue of the King and Quéene, who endured their departure with great heauinesse, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to their ships, and soone launced into the maine, and with

Then I beseech your Highnes to shew me that fauour, as I may obtaine your frée consent to depart at this instant, for my heart hath vowed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to rest in any place, vntill I be fully assured of my friends prosperity. <hi>Dionisius</hi> hearing his request, was sorie so soone to leaue him, and therefore taking him vp most kindly by the hand, he said.</p>
                     <p>Most worthy Knight, to whom both my selfe and all mine are much bound, it were a hard matter I would deny you: but in this let me intreat you to stay some few daies with vs, that we may make you some small recompence for your paines, and
<pb facs="tcp:16915:114"/>
not so soone leaue vs, who are much delighted with your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: and rather let me perswad you to leaue off this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the dangers incident to trauell are many, and your selfe haue lately sufficiently tried, and if that in short space you doe not heare tydings, according to your content, you shall haue all the furtherance I can giue you, to doe what seemeth best to your selfe.</p>
                     <p>My Lord (replyed <hi>Pollipus)</hi> my staying in this place can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleasure you, but rather be offensiue, for that my sorrowes without some good hope of comfort, will exceed the limits of reason: neither will it (I hope) delight your Maiestie to see my griefe, which I can by no meanes auoide. Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your Highnesse, not to intend me any further honour, but let me haue your licence to depart that haue already sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tasted of your bounty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> séeing his intention, vsed all manner of frindly and kinde perswasions to dissawde him from his purpose, but he as earnestly intreated his consent, for his heart was oppre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with that care, that no other thought could take place in his Fancies, but very shortly hee determined to beginne his trauels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Violetta</hi> séeing that nowe or neuer was the time to worke his and her owne content, resolued to manifest her selfe, and with her best diligence attended him all that day, fearing least he should depart secretly, and at night when he went to his bed, (not with intent to sleepe, but to poure forth his vsuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations) <hi>Violetta</hi> likewise was with him, shewing a sad countenance to see his sorrow.</p>
                     <p>But when she had tenderly coucht her selfe by his manly side, shee could not deuise how to growe into conference with him, being strooken with such a delightfull feare, to discouer her self, as she had neuer felt the like. At last she said, most miserable knight, I am sure now you giue no credit to my words, because you find not <hi>Violetta</hi> here, according as I promised you shold: neither haue I any comfort to attain the fauor at your hands I
<pb facs="tcp:16915:115"/>
expected, because your pensiunesse will not permit me. But might I bee so bold as to craue one request at your hands, which if you please to vouchsafe me, I promise you, that you shall find my words before spoken true (for that I know where <hi>Violetta</hi> is) and promise you againe to doe more for you with her, then any liuing, but her selfe. Tush boy (quoth <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus)</hi> doe not goe about to delude me with fond spéeches, for thou canst not performe any thing that can further mee heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. My Lord said shee, doe but trie me once more, and if I faile, then let mee endure the most heauy doome of your euerlasting displeasure. <hi>Adonius</hi> (quoth hee) if it bee to pleasure thée any way, I will galdly do it, for the friendship I haue found in thée: then I pray thee as thou louest me, and tendrest the sorrowes I indure, do not delay me with thy spéeches, for I know they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from kindnesse, to make me forget my sadnes, and not to do me any benefit in the thing thou speakest of, for I shall neuer be so happie as to be beloued of her, who I feare me left her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house to shun my company. But notwithstanding the little hope of comfort I conceiue by thy meanes to pleasure thée before I depart, tell me what it is thou demandest, and if it bee in my power thou shalt obtaine it. <hi>Violetta</hi> was ashamed to vtter her minde in that place, but being sure he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her blushing Chéekes, said: the request that I make is this, that you will giue mee your faithfull promise, that at such time as it is you hap to meete <hi>Violetta,</hi> and obtaine her good will, that the first night you will not offer to doe any thing that may tend to her dishonour. Upon mine houour said <hi>Pollipus,</hi> I will not doe any thing whatsoeuer disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her will, for so deare doe I esteeme her, that I would rather destroy my selfe then shee should be any way displeased with me. Then know, worthy knight (quoth she) I am that <hi>Violetta</hi> you so earnestly enquire after, I am the party that haue so long time procured your discontent, and I am shee whose absence you haue so oft bewailed, and now I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to manifest my selfe vnto you desiring you to pardon
<pb facs="tcp:16915:115"/>
my hard hartednesse, that haue so long concealed my selfe, and thereby procured your disquiet. <hi>Pollipus</hi> hearing her speeches, could not tell what to say, being halfe perswaded it was she, by remembring her countenance, and the behauior she had vsed in al, their trauels: as also calling to minde her kindnes, &amp; now at length her owne speeches, could not resolue what to do, for that his fancy still perswaded him it was not <hi>Violetta.</hi> And on the other side, he had a mighty perswasion it might be she: at last he said. I know not what to coniecture, nor how to behaue my selfe, nor whether I should call you <hi>Adonius,</hi> or <hi>Violetta,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how vnlikely it is she should be so kind to me, and how certaine I am that <hi>Adonius</hi> hath done me manifold pleasures. Then sweet <hi>Violetta</hi> (if you are she) resolue mee of this my doubt, being thereby driuen to that hopefull despaire, that I know not whether my fortune be better or worse then it was. <hi>Violetta</hi> shrinking a little back, said. Pardon me déere <hi>Polipus,</hi> for I am your vnworthy friend <hi>Violetta,</hi> that haue in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise, made triall of my fortune, and your friendship. <hi>Pollipus</hi> then tooke her most louingly in his armes, not offering other then his former promise did permit. Yet he was in a doubt still, and could not be quiet, vntill he had vsed such kind meanes (yet farre from dishonour) as thereby he found shee was a virgin, and no Page and therefore assured himselfe it was <hi>Violetta:</hi> and folding her delicate and tender body in his manlike armes which he had oftentimes before imbraced, but not with such kindnesse, banishing all sadnesse from his sorrowfull heart) with sweet and delightfull tontent, he embraced her with that kindnesse that long parted Louers enioy, when they so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly meete, spending the rest of the night in pleasing and delightfull communication, and remembrances of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kindnesses, which augmented their ioyes to an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding height. Oftentimes <hi>Pollipus</hi> would haue exceeded the limits of his former promise: but shee reserued that fauour, for the more honourable delight of their Nuptiall Bedde, but with many pleasures, such as true and loyall kindnes yeeldes.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:116"/>
Thus these two kind friends spent the time, <hi>Violetta</hi> accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her selfe most happy so enioy so constaut a friende, as shee had found him by certaineties in their trauell, and hee esteemed himselfe as happie, that hee was beloued of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi> that had not refused to hazarde her selfe in many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for his sake. At last, their minds being both at quiet, and satified with blisfull content, these two faithfull louers fell fast a sleepe, <hi>Parismus</hi> enduring much heauinesse for his friends departure, could scarcely entertaine a minutes rest to his troubled head, therefore he was earely vp, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to perswade <hi>Pollipus</hi> (if he could) from vndertaking that iourney: and presently after these louers were a sleepe, hee entred his Chamber, where contrarie to his premeditated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he found him fast a sleepe: and <hi>Adonius</hi> in most louing sort, laying one hand vnder <hi>Pollipus</hi> head, and the other embracing his manly breast: séeming in his conceit, the delightfullest sight that euer he beheld: the supposed page being so beautifull, that had hee not knowne him, hee would haue iudged <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe had been there, to comfort <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> with her sweet embracings. But seeing his deare friend in such quiet and sweet rest, he withdrew himselfe, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate how to worke his friends comfort, and stay his iourney. By which time, the Sun had lightned all the Chamber with his golden brightnesse, the clearenes of whose splendor, shining full vpon these louers, awaked <hi>Pollipus,</hi> but <hi>Violetta</hi> still lay sweetly slumbring, and <hi>Pollipus</hi> shadowing her with the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, arose, and soone found <hi>Parismus</hi> walking at his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doore, who seeing him, said. My deare friend <hi>Pollipus,</hi> I had thought to haue found you ready armed to depart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your resolution yesterday, but I hope you are rather determined to alter that purpose, and stay with vs, who desire nothing more then your companie: and were not <hi>Adonius</hi> well known to me I should thinke you had embraced some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Goddesse in that kinde sort: but notwithstanding, let me intreate you stay some longer time with vs, which was the
<pb facs="tcp:16915:116"/>
onely cause of my comming vnto you at this instant. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you for all the friendship that hath passed betwixt vs, bring mee so much more in your debt, by obtaining this fauour at your handes. My Lord (quoth, <hi>Pollipus)</hi> I must confesse I am too sluggish to bee found sléeping at this instant, while my minde should bée busied with more weightie matters. Indéede, according to your saying (my Lord) I thinke I haue either imbraced some goodnesse, or a more diuine creature: for my former resolution to trauell is quite dissolued, and my heart at more quiet then it hath bin: for my deare <hi>Violetta</hi> hath bene so kind as to visite me this night, shewing my heart that cause of ioy, as for euer while I liue, I shall account my selfe bound to her: and because your honor hath both bin acquaintd with my loue, and al my intents, &amp; haue vouchsafed me that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour that I shall neuer requite, I wel shew yon the cause of my gladnesse. <hi>Violetta</hi> hath disguised her selfe, and bin with vs in all the time of our trauels, and <hi>Adonius</hi> is now cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta,</hi> and hath discouered her selfe vnto me, which was more strange to me then it may séeme to you. <hi>Parismus</hi> hearing his spéeches, called her fauor to remembrance, &amp; perfectly knew that it was <hi>Violetta,</hi> wondering that in so long time as shée was in the disguise of <hi>Adonius,</hi> hée could neuer perceiue the same, nor once suspect it, which affected his heart with excéeding ioy: and taking <hi>Pollipus</hi> by the hand, they walked together to <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who greatly reioyced at his happy newes, &amp; presently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Leda</hi> to carrie apparell vnto her, and all things that were necessarie, which shée presently executed, and at her comming founde <hi>Violetta</hi> newly awaked, and tolde her that <hi>Laurana</hi> had sent her that apparell, which <hi>Violetta</hi> was well contented with. <hi>Parismus, Pollipus,</hi> and <hi>Laurana,</hi> by this time were come where she was, who stood with a bulshing cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance like <hi>Venus</hi> intrapt in <hi>Vnlcans</hi> net, but <hi>Parismus</hi> tooke her by the hand, &amp; said: Blush not vertuous damosel, for it reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth my hart to sée you here, could you be so vnkind as in all the time of your trauell, neuer to make your selfe knowne till
<pb facs="tcp:16915:117"/>
now? Well, I sée you haue wisdome in making your choice, and well haue you deserued to be beloued of <hi>Pollipus,</hi> who I am sure will performe no lesse, neither néede you any more trial of his loue, for that you haue béene priuie to many infallible proofes thereof. <hi>Violetta</hi> knéeling vttered these spéeches, I thanke your honour, that vouchsafe mee this extraordinarie fauour, as to visite mee, that haue shewed my selfe vnworthie thereof: but I trust I néed not now stand vpon nice tearmes to this worthie knight, for that I may bee fully assured of his fidelitie: neither can I séeme straunge, hauing béene so long time acquainted with his loue. But if my boldnes hath not c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Then I desire you let your heart repose that good trust in me, that no miserie, calmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, death, nor affliction, shall cause me once, in wdrd or deede, to be disloyal to your selfe, that vouchsafe me the heauenly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse I desire.</p>

Most vertuous damosel, be not discomforted nor abashed at your disguise, for it cannot

And as for my selfe, I am so fully assured of your Uertues, that I shall for euer hate them, that shal once thinke otherwise then honourablie of you, and hereafter make account to finde me as your most faithfull Friende, for at all times I will esteeme you as my Sister, and whatsoeuer lyeth in my power to doe you good, shall be readie at your commaunde. <hi>Violetta</hi> kneeling downe, most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie thanked her, for her Honourable kindnesse. <hi>Laurana</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her by the hand, led her downe into the great Hall, where she was entirely welcommed by the King and Queene, and by all the rest of the States, with maruailous louing kindenesse: who hauing knowledge of her, exceedingly commended her Uertues, and beeing informed of the truth of all that had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed betweene her and <hi>Pollipus,</hi> (by his owne reporte) grew into such a good liking of her, and so much esteemed her wifedome, that they accounte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If you finde any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, passe them ouer with a carelesse res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and if ought please your Fancie, let it ceunteruaile that which is amisse. If neyth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

My intent was to please, but if not, my labours are ill bestowed, and my happe the harder: If I may breede any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to the well-minded, or purchase any good opinion of the Well-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to Learning, then I haue the reward I expect.</p>
                  <p>One peraduenture will say, the inuention is barren; another, the English is harsh; a third, all is naught. Yet let me answere in mine owne behalfe, that which is lightly disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, is not easily amended; and the worke well done, that pleaseth all: and that very harsh, that none liketh. But I submit my selfe to the wise, courteous, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: whome I trust will vouchsafe to esteeme fauourably of my good intent: that though I am not able to compare with any: yet I am willing to prooue worthie: and haue taken some paines to procure their good opinion, vnto which I submit my selfe. As for <hi>Momus</hi> mates, that are contented with nothing, yet desire most; I let them passe as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardles, whom. I neyther care to please or displease: but if my fortune be so aduerse, that I cannot procure their delight I would, then I plead penitencie: protesting I was in good hope of their fauor. Knowing this, that which disagrees with ones fancie, may delight anothers.</p>
                  <p>So that I am in hope this poore Treatise may passe, with the fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

                     <p>Presently two Gentlewomen welcommed her with great courtesie, comforting, perswading, and intising her to remit all care, vntill <hi>Archas</hi> returne, whom they assured was so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and vertuous a knight, as shee needed not any way doubt of his diligence.

After supper, they brought her to a most pleasant chamber, where all things were most neatly prouided, comforting her with many perswasions, that <hi>Archas</hi> was at the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Court to expect her comming, and by reason of the nights approach, could not come back that night, but should early in the morning bring her newes, intreating her to betake her selfe to her rest: which she did, the rather to be rid from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that being alone, she might enter into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of her estate: and being by her selfe, she began to reuolue in her minde her miserable condition, <hi>Pollipus</hi> perill, and <hi>Archas</hi> intent: for her selfe shee cared not, if <hi>Pollipus</hi> were in safetie: neither feared she what <hi>Archas</hi> enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if her Knight were in health, that so many cares concurring togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so many doubts clogged her mind, and such feare possest her hart, that her words, burst into a flood of teares, and the warme blood see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to issue from euery vaine of her body, that with theyr abundance she bedeawed the Bed where she lay.</p>
                     <p>When she had wept her fountaines drie, shee then began to accuse her selfe of Follie, that would not stay in the place where hee left her: then a certaine perswasion entred her heart, that he was dead, which tooke such déepe roote, that of a long time no other thought would take place, which made her think the Tapers which gaue her Light burnt blue: which likewise added a further setled resolue in her Fancie, that it was so indéede. In this carefull estate, shee lay tumbling and tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing her selfe, giuing no quiet to her minde: no rest to her Cares: no ease to her pensiue heart: no respit to her sences, nor sléepe to her head: but being ouercome with sorrow, shee continually rather augmented then diminished the same.</p>
                     <p>In this sadde and heauy estate she spent the Night, not suffring her eyes once to slumber. In the morning the 2.

                     <p>Which dismall words strooke such a sudden griefe vnto her heart, that there she fell downe at his feete in a Traunce: but when by theyr industrie she came to her selfe againe, her amazed countenance, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable grones made the teares trickle downe her chéekes, and sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in that dangerous estate, conueyed her to her bedde, whose vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sences were so abated and extinguished, that for a long time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding theyr vttermost endeuours, shee seemed no otherwise, then as one bereft of sense: and in that lamentable estate shee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued many dayes.</p>

In this vnquiet sort he spent the most part of the Night, vntill towardes Morning, what with wearynesse and care that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest his heart, he laide him downe, leaning vpon his elbowe, neither vttering word nor teare, but inwardly stufft with extreame vexation, seeming no other then the forme and picture of discontent.

                     <p>Why (quoth <hi>Parismus)</hi> How can you thinke she is dead? When there is no likelyhood, signe, nor mention to be séene thereof? neither her Apparell, nor any part of her Bodie torne: or any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to perswade vs to any such conceyt? Then why will you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any such perswasions to possesse your Fancie? (Quoth <hi>pollipus)</hi> How then came the Scarffe so torne? It may bee the Wilde beastes haue secret Dennes, whereinto they haue drawne her Body, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other mischaunces may be befallen her, that she was subiect vnto, and yet still be hidden from our knowledge: Neyther let that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you (quoth <hi>Parismus,)</hi> but rest contented, and your care that way shall soone be eased; but depart with mée to the Court, to comfort your selfe with some Sustenance, and I will presently giue order to haue this Woodde so throughly searcht, that you shall plainely finde shee hath not miscarryed.

                     <p>Sometimes accusing himselfe of negligence, to leaue her, to pursue the Beare, blaming her that would not stay his return: and then again fretting his heart for accusing her.

At last he determined to search throughout all <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> but he would finde her: For hee assuredly thought shee was not deade, being thereto induced, for that he could not finde any likelyhood thereof, being perswaded by <hi>Parismus,</hi> that some discourteous Knight had met with her, and so witheld her returne: that within fewe dayes (Arming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in a greene armour, which he made of purpose, bearing this deuice; <hi>A Knight pursuing a wilde Beare)</hi> hee left the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Court, making none priuy to his departure but <hi>Parismus,</hi> who determined not to stay long behinde him:) Whom we will leaue onwards of his iourney, and speake of <hi>Violetta,</hi> whom we left weake in <hi>Archas</hi> Castle.</p>

that shee was hindred by the 2. Gentlewomen: especially one of them named <hi>Sorana,</hi> was so carefull ouer her, that shee left not so much as a Pinne about her, where with she might doe her selfe harme: but when some three dayes were past, and the extremitie of her desperate Passion somewhat calmed, she began to desire that <hi>Archas</hi> would conuey her to the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Court; if not to finde <hi>Pollipus,</hi> yet to enioy the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table presence of <hi>parismuss</hi> and <hi>Laurana;</hi> but notwithstanding her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold intreaties, they vsed some excuse or other, to frustrate her expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, telling her that it was dangerous for her to Trauell yet, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her late sicknesse, and that since it was certaine <hi>Pollipus</hi> was no more to be enioyed, she might stay with them some few dayes, vntill she were better able to endure so long a Iourney: For that the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Court was not so neare as she thought.

and you shall finde I will be inferiour to none in good will, nor violate my Protested-loyaltie in any vndutifull respect.</p>
                     <p>I haue the boldlyer presumed to detaine you here, because with your absence my life would depart: Then construe not amisse that true loue and sincere Affection, which hath caused me to offend in, but no offence at all, if you vouchfafe not to take it so: Here shall you enioy your fill of content, in as ample sort, as any other place can yéelde: Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeche you graunt some ease to my troubled heart, and by your clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie release me of those cares that possesse my Breast, onely procured by the piercing dart of your sacred Beautie.

                        <hi>Archas</hi> hearing himselfe thus reuiled, abandoned shame and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, violently pulling her to him: told her, that she shuld submit her selfe to his will, offering by force to attaine the fruition of her spotlesse body. When <hi>Violetta</hi> felt her selfe so handled, shee laboured by all meanes to disappoint him of his will: but in the ende, séeling her selfe too weake, long to withhold his force, she yéelded foorth such shrikes, as all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle roong with the noyse of her outerye: that <hi>Sorana</hi> hearing the same, knowing the place where she vsed, came thitherwards. <hi>Archas</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her, withdrue himself, and <hi>Violetta</hi> rose from the place, tyred with resistance, and swolne with inward veration, and disdain to be so vsed, casting her countenance downe to the earth: To whome <hi>Sorana</hi> said, How now Lady, What causeth your sorrow? Hath <hi>Archas</hi> offered you
<pb facs="tcp:16915:137"/>
violence? <hi>Violetta</hi> with teares trickling downe her crimzen chéekes, answered: yea, that villaine. <hi>Archas</hi> would haue done me violence, had not you so Fortunately come to my rescue: But I thinke the Diuine prouidence, hath sent you hither so happily to preserue me from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring lust, whose dishonorable minde is fraught with all villanies: accursed be the day that first brought mee to this hatefull place, to fall into his loathsome power, that contrary to Nature, hath done mee this outrage. Swéete <hi>Sorana</hi> (quoth she) conuey mee secretly into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that there I may in sorrow end my accursed life, rather then again abide his loathsome sight, which will be as pestilent as deadly Poyson to my heart. <hi>Sorana</hi> taking her by the arme to support her weake bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, led her to her Chamber. <hi>Archas</hi> likewise seeing himselfe so frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his desire, with an impudent and vnshamefaste Countenance, went into the Castle, vowing in his heart neuer to desist vntill he had accomplished his desire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Violetta,</hi> being come to her Chamber, related to <hi>Sorana</hi> the whole manner of <hi>Archas</hi> vsage, intreating her counsell, which way to auoyde his sutes, which shee knew hee would still prosecute: who vttered her minde in this sort. Lady I pitty your estate, but I am so farre from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding release thereto, as I know no meanes at all how to comfort you: For <hi>Archas</hi> disposition I too well know, is farre from any spark of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, who hath in iike sort behaued himself to me at my first comming hither, which was in the Prime of my youth: neither giue any credite to his reports: for he hath told me that <hi>Pollipus</hi> is yet liuing, and long since I suspected hee would vse you in this sorte, and escape from hence you cannot: For this Castle is continually guarded, hauing but one entrance therto, whereby none can escape vndescried; therefore I think it best for you to yeeld to his loue, and then you may liue in quiet: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I know your life will be miserable enough.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Violetta</hi> was striken into a sudden amazement to heare her detested counsell, thinking to haue found some comfort in her spéeches: In so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that with extremitie of Passions, shee was readie to giue vp the ghost. Which <hi>Sorana</hi> beholding, reuiuing her with rubbing her pale chéekes, she said as followeth.</p>
                     <p>If you will followe my aduise and counsell, I may peraduenture ease you in some respect; Which is this, That the next time when <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> coms againe to sollicite his sute, condiscend to his request, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, that hee will come to you in the silent of the Night, so secretly

hat none may knowe thereof, and that onely hee satisfie himselfe with your Loue without asking questions, or entring into any talke, which may renue the remembrance of your former griefe: and when w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these conditions you haue agreed, my self will supplie your roome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by safegard your Honour, and satisfie him: which may well be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, considering that his desire being nothing but Lust, he easily will be drawn to condescend to your conditions: which once done, let me alone to execute the rest: for I am so well acqnainted with his fashions, that it shalbe long before he descrie our deceit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Violetta</hi> hearing the circumstance of her Talke, promised to doe all things according to her counsell, if shee herselfe meant faithfullie. Which <hi>Sorana</hi> assured her of, by many Protestations, and so left her in some comfort, hoping by this meanes to bee ridde from her Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Louer.</p>
                     <p>Assoone as <hi>Sorana</hi> was departed, she presently goeth to <hi>Archas,</hi> (pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forward with as great a sting of foule Lust, as raigned in him) and told him, that shée had talked with <hi>Violetta</hi> about his sute, which shee was perswaded she would yeeld vnto, but that shee was bashfull: and by his speeches, rather hardned, then any way mollified: but (qd. shee) Trie her euen now, and whatsoeuer shee bindeth you vnto by conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that promise you to performe: and when you know her minde, tell mee what shee sayes, and I may peraduenture counsell you what to do for your furtherance: for she is worthy to be beloued, and kindely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and in my Iudgement, you did amisse, to vse her so rudely as you did in the Orchard; For forced kindenesse is not worth estimation, but consent in Loue breedes the sweetest delight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Archas</hi> presently put her counsell in practise, and came to <hi>Violettaes</hi> chamber (who was then studying how to rid her selfe from his custody) and very kindly saluted her, crauing pardon for his last offence, excusing himself by many reasons, and alledging as many perswasions, that she could not in reason denie his request: his Loue being grounded vppon the truest foundation of perfect constancie, of Uowes, Oaths, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations, to dedicate himselfe, his life, and all that hee had to be at her command. <hi>Violetta</hi> (casting down her eyes to the earth, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing countenance, to think how much it went against her heart, to vse him kindly: asking pardon of <hi>Pollipus,</hi> in her secret thoughts, for dooing him that vnwilling wrong) at last made answer, that she could in some sort be contented to grant his request, if he would promise to performe

what she should inioine him too, which he vowed and protested to fulfil in euery respect. Then she concluded with him as <hi>Sorana</hi> had counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to do, which liked him excéedingly well, &amp; quoth she, for a pledge hereof, giue me that ring which you so much estéem, which he gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ber, and at his departure receiusd from her a gentle kisse, which she wisht might proue as deadly poyson to his heart, being greatly discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with her selfe for shewing him that fauour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Archas</hi> presently with a ioyfull heart went to <hi>Sorana:</hi> and tolde her all that had passed betwixt him and <hi>Violetta:</hi> which she willed him in any wise to performe: and séeing shée hath bound you from talke, what néede you care for speaking, sith you may enioy what otherwise you desire: and she finding you so willing to condiscend to her requests, will bée the easiler drawne to yéelde you any courtesie. <hi>Sorana</hi> being parted from him, imediately came to <hi>Violetta,</hi> and tolde her all that he had made her priuie vnto, and withall saide, that for her sake onely she vndertook that taske, (which was nothing so, but of a most inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate desire to beastly lust, which <hi>Violetta</hi> well noted:) and thus they spent the day in much idle talke, vntill euening drawing nigh, shée left <hi>Violetta</hi> in her chamber, and went vnto that swéete bedde, which she had neately drest for <hi>Archas,</hi> perfuming her selfe with many odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous waters, deuising all meanes she could to kéep her selfe vnknown from him, being affected with great desire for his approach.

Which words being ended, hee mounted himselfe on his steede, and rode the way his fancie first chose, trauelling towards the mountaines that incompasse <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but not finding her, being vnacquainted in those countries, wandred towards <hi>Grecia,</hi> and trauailed without any more hope to find her, then at the beginning, continuing his trauels without intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, passing many places without any misaduenture. At last he came to the great Forrest of <hi>Ardea,</hi> wherein stoode the Castle of the mighty Gyant <hi>Brandamor,</hi> the place being inuincible, by reason of the scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and strength, whose cruelties committed by him and his brother <hi>Argaletus,</hi> made him much feared, and his walkes eschued of all men.</p>
                     <p>Which Forrest <hi>Pollipus</hi> was no sooner enterd, but hée espied the bodie of a goodly Knight, that had lately giuen vp his ghost, lye weltred in his blood, which when he had wel viewed, and perceiued to be quite past recouerie, hee maruailed what sad aduenture had bene cause of his death, perswading himselfe, that those that had done the same were not farre off, that he withdrew himselfe into a thicket of bushes, where he could not be discerned, to stay vntill hee might descrie those that had done that déed.</p>
                     <p>Hée had not bene long shrowded there, but hée sawe a damzell and a squire comming to the dead knight, with great lamentations, bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his vntimely death, seeming by their behauiour to be quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with extreame miserie.</p>
                     <p>After their lamentations ended, they hasted to take vp the dead Knight, to whome <hi>Pollipus</hi> came and demaunded what Knight that was, and what misaduenture had brought him to that vntimely death. The damzel casting her eyes vp to him, which before were sadly fixed, on the earth, said, Sir Knight, to discduer the whole circumstance of our mishap, would aske more respit then the time will now permit: because if we be surprised by our tariance, wée are like to be partners with him in death. This Knight was named <hi>Tyrides,</hi> sonne to the noble Duke <hi>Amasenus</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> being brought vp in the Court of the renowned King of <hi>Libia:</hi> who being with the Princesse <hi>Venola,</hi>

by <hi>Amasenus</hi> to his castle, sore wounded in the battel he had with <hi>Argalus</hi> and <hi>Thenudes,</hi> was so carefully tended by the Dukes Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, that in a few daies they had brought him to his perfect remem brances: and within short time after that, to his perfect health, which greatly reioyced the good old Duke, who tooke great felicitie in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, for the many honourable parts he saw to abound in him. And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time, in the presence of all his Court, demaunded the cause of the combate betwéen him &amp; <hi>Argalus,</hi> which he requested as well to knowe the truth thereof himselfe, as to satisfie the suspitious mindes of many that inwardly maligned the discontented Knight, vnto whom he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the truth in manner as is before set downe, saying: This my lord is the truth of his misaduenture, whom I neuer iniured, but alwaies estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as my friends. <hi>Amasenus</hi> was glad that no cause of discontent could be conceiued against him, by any other of his Knights, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied him, because his noble gifts darkned their glories: but yet his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and kind behauiour in short time expelled that roncor, and they that before were his enemies, began to make good estimation of him, &amp; his fame began to spread it selfe in most parts of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer behelde him, grew into admiration of his strength, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with such bewtie, as his youth yéelded: that had they not knowne the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by his prowesse, they would haue taken him for some disguised La-Ly. Whilest the knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> remained in <hi>Amasenus</hi> court, the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> appointed a generall triumph, to be heldfor certaine daies, the occasion whereof is this.</p>
                     <p>He had one onely daughter, named <hi>Phylena,</hi> whose beautie was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to none: and her gifts of nature were such, as made her much spoken of in many countries: insomuch that many knightes came as sutors to obtaine her loue, but she had secretly betrothed her selfe to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus,</hi> one of the knights of her fathers court, without her parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: by meanes of whose beautie, the Court of <hi>Thrace</hi> was full of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant knights that sought her lone, that the King was much troubled in minde how to bestow her: and séeing that she did not fancie one more than another, he appointed a general triumph to be held for seuen daies, and whosoeuer bare away the prize the last day, shuld marry his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Intending thereby to ende his doubt and care that way: thinking, that though his daughter had not a rich and Princely husband, yet shee should haue a valiant Champion to defend the price of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:144"/>
Amongst the rest of the Knights, there was <hi>Guido,</hi> who had long time sued to obtayne her Loue, who now reioyced at this Decrée, hoping by his valor to beare away the Bride. There was <hi>Trudamor</hi> of <hi>Candie,</hi> who thought none equall to him in strength: and therefore none more forward against the time of the appointed triumph. There was <hi>Drio</hi> of <hi>Scicil,</hi> who had sayled from his owne Countrey thither: who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by his strength at seuerall times slue thrée Lyons, who came with resolution to winne <hi>Phylena</hi> for his Wife. And many other Knightes of high account.</p>
                     <p>The report of this great Triumph came to to the knowledge of the Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> whose minde was kindled with an earnest desire to goe thither, that he requested <hi>Amasenus</hi> consent, who being desirous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way to pleasure him, gaue him sufficient Coyne to furnish him of all things, fit for such an attempt. Who caused a most rich Armour of gréene to be made, shadowed with Trées of golde, presenting a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. In his shielde he bare this deuise; A naked man leading a Lyon, with this <hi>Motto</hi> vnderneath, <hi>Ouergone with Discontent:</hi> Wherein the expert Artsman had so cunningly imitated his Fancie, that a man by his Armour and shielde, might easily vnderstand his meaning. The appointed time of Triumphe drawing nigh, <hi>Amasenus</hi> with a gallant troupe of Knightes, amongst whome the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> was chiefe, came to the <hi>Thracian</hi> Court, whome the King honourably receiued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amasenus</hi> hauing don homage to che King, pitched his Tent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Court-Gates, vpon a little hill, hard by the appointed place for Triumph: where likewise hard by him were the Tents of <hi>Guido, Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor, Drio,</hi> and the three valiant knightes of <hi>Candie: Tristramus, Tennulus,</hi> and <hi>Babulus,</hi> in whose companie were a number of valiant knights, that came thither: Some to make tryall of theyr valour, and some of purpose to winne the faire <hi>Phylena.</hi> Likewise there were the Tents of the young King of <hi>Arragon:</hi> who came accompanied with a number of valiant knights hoping to beare away the Prize, that all the Plains were filled with Tents. There might you see knights breaking staues, practising themselues against the day of Triumph. Here might you see others recreating themselues in <hi>Martiall</hi> exercises: there might you heare the Neighing of Horses, clattering of Armour, cracking of staues, and such companies of Knights assembled, as if the richest prize had bene appointed for reward.</p>
                     <p>Whilest these things were acting, <hi>Phylena</hi> was in great care for
<pb facs="tcp:16915:144"/>
                        <hi>Remulus,</hi> whome she loued so dearely, that rather then shee would part with him, she would endure any misery whatsoeuer: who likewise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed himself to trie his Fortune amongst the test. And the day before the Triumphe, <hi>Phylena</hi> secretly getting opportunitie to speake with him, gaue him this assurance of her constancie.</p>
                     <p>My deare Loue (qd. shee) since my Father hath decréed this publicke Triumph, for the bestowing of mee in Marriage, because amongst so many Knightes as haue sought my Loue, I haue Affianced my selfe to none of them, but haue chosen you as the chiefest Load-starre of my life and Loue: be you yet assured, that though Fortune may allot me to be anothers by Conquest, yet none but your selfe shall enioy my Loue: and though another may challenge mee by right of my Fathers decree, yet none but your selfe shall haue true interest in mee. And rather then I will yeelde to like of any Knights loue but yours, I will endure either death, or any other torment shall be inflicted vpon mee: for you are the Knight that shall conquer my Loue; you haue by courtesie woonne my Loue, and you shall weare it. Nor King nor Knight shall robbe me of that which I haue giuen to you: Then be not you discomforted, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way disquieted, but trye your Fortune amongst the rest, and Fate may happily allot you the Conquest as well as any other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Remulus</hi> hearing his Ladyes constant Resolution, was ouercome with exceeding ioy, resoluing to aduenture as much as any to attayne the desired Conquest: and Solacing himselfe so long as theyr stolne time would permitte, in her companie, beeing by necessitie compelled, they parted.</p>
                     <p>The next Morning, the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> accompanyed by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Personages of Estate, brought foorth the beautifull and faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Phylena,</hi> most richly adorned with costly Ornamentes, wearing vpon her head a Crowne of golde, attended by an hundreth Damzells clad in white, and seated her on a Scaffolde, in the open view of all the Knights there assembled, whose harts were enamoured with the sweet attainte of her shining Beautie, and theyr courages reuiued with the hope of so rich and precious a Prize. Amongst the rest, there was the Lorde <hi>Remulus,</hi> whose heart was opprest with distrustfull care, to see the Ladie hee most estemed, and his secret protested loue, set as a Prize, to wring him from his possession: yet comforted by her faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, he tooke great felicitie to see that Beautie made famous, which he made account to enioy.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:145"/>
The Knight of <hi>Thrace</hi> beganne the Triumph, and the first that entred the Listes was <hi>Andreas,</hi> who was at two Courses vnhorsed by <hi>Cleanthea,</hi> who continued Conquerour by the ouerthrowe of manie Knightes, vntill <hi>Bubulus,</hi> one of the thrée Brethren of <hi>Candie,</hi> with violence draue him from his horse, and burst one of his ribbes. <hi>Bubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> vnhorsed many Knightes afterwardes, both of <hi>Thrace</hi> and other straunge Countreys, and in the ende, was vnhorsed himselfe by <hi>Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who behaued himselfe so valiantly in the sight of the Princes, that by the foyle of many knights, he ended that dayes Triumph, to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding honour, resting Conquerour vntill the next Morning. When the Night was ouerpast, the King conducting <hi>Phylena</hi> in the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he had done the day before, and seated her againe vpon the scaffold. When <hi>Remulus</hi> came into the Lists, brauely managing his prauncing stéed, whom <hi>Phylena</hi> beheld with a crefull eye, breathing foorth many a deuouted prayer for his good successe, who hauing conquerd some twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Knightes, in the ende was foyled by <hi>Temulus,</hi> and so with a heauie heart left the Fielde. <hi>Temulus</hi> continued Conquerour by the disgrace of many Knights almost all that day, but in the end, was vnhorsed by the King of <hi>Arragon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Arragon</hi> ended that dayes Tryumph, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefe Conquerour the next day, and on the fourth day hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horsed by <hi>Tristramus,</hi> and so hee lost the Conquest which he so much destred.</p>
                     <p>Afterwardes, <hi>Tristramus</hi> continued that dayes Triumphe with great brauerie, and the fiste day was vnhorsed by <hi>Annulus,</hi> a knight of <hi>Lybia,</hi> who vnhorsed that day fourtie knightes, to his exceeding honour.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> all this while, kept himselfe out of sight, and was Lodged at a Uillage, some two miles distant from the <hi>Thracian</hi> Court, and according to <hi>Amasenus</hi> appointment, came toward the lists gallantly mounted all alone, and by the vnexpected manner of his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, approach, and by the straunge fashion of his Armour, as Fortune would, was not generally noted: and in that sort hee entred the Lists reuerencing himselfe towardes the Scaffolde whereon the King was seated, and setting spurres to his Horse, incountred <hi>Annulus,</hi> (and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune intending at the first to doe him some disgrace) mist his course, and <hi>Annulus</hi> brake his Staffe most brauely, wherewith the whole as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie

Which the discontented knight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed so gallantly, that hee vnhorsed another knight of <hi>Lybia,</hi> that thought to reuenge <hi>Annulus</hi> ouerthrowe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Guido</hi> disdaining thereat, and séeing how the beholders were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, noted him more specially: thinking by his spoyle to winne some speciall honour, and with the more brauerie to continue the rest of the Triumph, and attaine the Prize, taking a strong Staffe, prepared to méete the knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> who by that time had dismounted thrée or foure other knightes.</p>
                     <p>The people séeing the valiant <hi>Guido</hi> come to the Listes, who was well knowne to all, thought then surely to see the discontented knights Honour at an ende, for on him and <hi>Drio,</hi> the chiefest suppose of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest depended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Guido</hi> encountred the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> the first time, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering or sustaining disaduantage, which inwardly vexed him to the heart, that charging him againe the seconde time, notwithstanding all his force, hee could not once moue him in his saddle. The discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended knight, likewise féeling the puissance of his Enemie, was excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly inraged, that taking another course, they met with such furie, that the Earth shooke with the force of their encounter, and their Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces shiuered into a thousand pieces, passing by, without any shewe or signe of oddes.</p>
                     <p>The king of <hi>Thrace</hi> seeing the day so farre spent, sent a messenger to intreat them to leaue the further triall of their doubtfull Conquest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the next day, which they both consented vnto.</p>
                     <p>The next Morning these two Champions came againe, with desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mindes to be reuenged eache of other, and met two courses with such brauerie, that the people with great shoutes applauded theyr Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalrie, the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> chusing the strongest Staffe that hee could finde, meant now or neuer to giue or take the foyle, and rushing forcibly to encounter <hi>Guido,</hi> he met him so violently, that <hi>Guidos</hi> Horse yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the force of theyr Encounter, and falling downe, burst his legge,

                     <p>The King of <hi>Thrace</hi> beholding the Noble valour of the Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> was exceedingly well affected towards him: insomuch, that hee desired none might enioy his Daughter but hee; betwéene whome and <hi>Trudamor</hi> continued a most braue Combat: till in the end, the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> had so grieuously Wounded him, and in so many places, that all the beholdets accounted <hi>Trudamor</hi> as halfe vanquished: and what with effusion of blood, and ouermaistered by the Knight of <hi>Fames</hi> strength, his Armour giuing way to euery blowe, was readie to fall from his Horse: Which the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> perceiuing, stayed: vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering these words.

of Rocks, but chiefly such a secret impression of the Ladies beautie was fixed in his remembrance, that hee quite forsooke and forgot the least thought of <hi>Phylena,</hi> whose beautie in his fancie, was nothing comparable to her diuine perfections, that calling to minde euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular note hée had seene, the perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of the Ladies countenance, fauour and beautie, was so deeply imprinted in his heart, that no other thought could sinke in his braine, but that she was the Lady he should honour, that he vowed to search the world throughout to finde her, and come to the knowledge of his parents. In these cogitations hée spent the rest of that night.</p>
                     <p>Earely in the morning, hée was honoured with all diuersities of curiefies, and most royally feasted of the the King, and by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should be affianced to <hi>Phylena,</hi> within sixe dayes. The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> remembring the Uision, being most commonly in company of <hi>Phylena,</hi> diligently noted, which might be the knight <hi>Phylena</hi> loued, and soone perceiued that it was <hi>Re mulus,</hi> who amongst the knights of <hi>Thrace,</hi> had sought most meanes to honour him. Who little thought the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> hadde noted the kindnesse betwixt him and <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena:</hi> but he noting all circumstances, perceiued that <hi>Phylena</hi> was déeply inthralled in the bands of constant love: for though thée were in talke with him, yet her eye was continually on <hi>Remulus,</hi> glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing so many swéete lookes (intermingled with sighes) towards him, that hée thought it a most discourtesie and inhumaine déede to part them.

                     <p>Déere Lady (quoth he) knowe this, that I account my selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that honour, and am vnwilling any way to contradict your will or disturbe you quiet: but knowing that which you vnuertuously conceale, will surrender my estate to the knight you most sancie: for the honour I haue wonne, shall be my suficient reward: therefore I beséech you, conceale no part of your minde from me, for I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to performe any thing you shall command, but will hazaed both life and honour to satisfie your fancie, and any way procure your content.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Phylena</hi> with a blushing countenance, made this short replie: Most noble knight, <hi>Remulus</hi> is the knight I haue long esteemed: but must now forsake him, or purchase my parents discontent, and denie you the right of your conquest. The knight of <hi>Fame</hi> smiling at the inward conceit of his Uision, made this answere.

The seruants séeing this, couered her body, and afterwardes buryed it. <hi>Archas</hi> presently Arming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, giuing speciall charge to the Gardiants, to kéepe diligent Watch, posted that way he thought best in her search.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Violetta</hi> by this time was wandred a great way, care hastning her stoppes, and feare to be again by him surprized, tooke away the tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Trauell. At last forsaking the beaten way, she wandrd aside into a most Desart and vnfrequent place, being so full fraught with Trées and little springs, that there she thought was the safest harbour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to remaine vndescryed: Being tyred with Trauell, and possest with care, she sate downe vpon a banke side to refresh her selfe. Shée had not long stayed in that place, but thee behelde an Aged man, whose yeares made him stoupe to the Earthwards, carrying a few drye sticks vnder his arme. <hi>Violetta</hi> thinking, she might repose some confidence in his vertues, because of his years, drew towards him: Who séeing so beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull a Lady, in that vnfrequented place vnattended, excéedingly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled, to whom she saide. Ah good Father, whose yeares beares Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, will you vouchsafe a distressed Ladie succour, who by extreame miseries compulsion, am wandred to this vnknowne place, sore wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with Trauell, and in requitall of your kindnesse, my prayers shall
<pb facs="tcp:16915:151"/>
inuocate the Heauens to graunt you Felicitie, and my Reward suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to content you for your paines. The old-man hearing her spéeches, made this answere: Faire Lady, my homely Cell is not worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue your person, but such as it is, you shall be hartily welcome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: For I desire to liue no longer, then to extend my small assistance to such as are in distresse, but especially to such harmles creatures as your selfe: Therefore pleaseth you with kindenesse to accept what succour my abilitie will affoord; What counsell my Experience can giue you, you shall receiue both with a willing heart. And for that I sée your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell (vpon what occasion to mée as yet vnknowne,) hath both wearyed you, and this colde Earth whereon you sat, may endanger your health, giue me your hand, &amp; I will yéeld you what aid my weake strength wil permit, to guide you to my Cell, which is hard by. Doo so good Father (quoth she) and I thanke you most heartily: Where I will disclose to you my vnfortunate mishap; That saide, shae leand her selfe vpon his aged arme, so weary with Trauell, that she scarce could set her féete vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grassie earth, for hurting them. His Cell, it was no other but a hollow Caue, which the poore Did-man by his owne industrie, had cut and vndermined vnder the side of a Rocky-hill. Which was well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued, hauing his lodging seuerall from the rest. And so artificially had he framed his Chimney, that through a hollow Uawt, he conueyed the smooke, at the foote whereof, ran a most pleasant spring, where the cleare Water striuing with the smooth pibbles, made a burbling noise, where the comfortable beams of golden <hi>Phoebus</hi> had full force. On the other side was a swéet spring, where the birds kept continuall pleasant recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Harmonie. Assoone as <hi>Violetta,</hi> was entered this olde mans Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, he seated her soft vpon a chayre, giuing her all the courteous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment he could, and presently brought foorth such cates as he was prouided of: Which was, White bread, chéese and apples: Her drinke being the cleare brooke Water that ran by his Cell doore; Whereto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would amend the taste to her liking, he mingled <hi>Aquauitie. Violetta</hi> being hungrie, thought his poore prouision in that quiet place, dainty fare, wherewith she stenched her hunger, and in the mean time, the old-man had heat Water and hearbs for to bathe her ouertrauelled féete in, which the kindly accepted, perceiuing that it came as willingly from the old-mans hart, as euer good déed came from any, and therwith bathed her féete. This done, <hi>Violetta</hi> desired the olde man to seat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe down by her, (who taking a stoole, sat downe right against her, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes, vpon her Face) whilst she began to speake as followeth.</p>

Good Father (qd. she) the kindenesse I finde in your entertainment, sheweth the Uertues that rule your heart, which maketh mee no whit doubt to commit the dangerous report of my Tragicall misfortune to your secrecie, neyther neede I require any stricter assurance, then your promise alreadie past, to extende your ayde to my distresse.

Whome I made priuie to all my secretes, by whose meanes, late yester night I stole from the Castle: Nowe good Father (qd. she) counsell me how to escape his hands, who I know ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all diligent search for mée; and vnlesse you helpe mée.

                     <p>There remaineth a Gyant, not farre from this place, called <hi>Branda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> in a castle of such inuincible strength, as it is impossible to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by legions of souldiers, who takeeh delight in nothing but cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie and vnlawfull attempts.

                        <hi>Panuamus</hi> continued Fight against him a good space, but being vnable to cope with so mighty an Enemy, was by reason of so many grieuous Wounds, in the ende left by him for dead: Which done, <hi>Brandamor</hi> séeing our flight, hasted after vs: But before hee could come at vs, we attained the Castle, and rescued our selues from his possession. But when he saw himselfe disappointed, he made as though he had departed from hence, and contrary to our thoughts, hee hidde himselfe secretly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Bushes.</p>
                     <p>My Mother being ouercome with extreame sorrow for my Fathers death, neither regarding doubt nor daunger, went backe, with hope to recouer him, whom <hi>Brandamor</hi> surprized, and carried away with him, hoping by her Imprisonment, to winne her consent to yéelde mee into his hands. My brother <hi>Panuamus,</hi> within a while, recouered his féese, not knowing of my Mothers misfortune, with great danger of his life, crawled home: whom I had much adoo to preserue from death, and now hee is departed towards the Forrest of <hi>Arde,</hi> where the Giants Castle standeth, to inuent means to set my Mother at libertie, and this night is the premised time of his return.

                        <hi>Barzillus</hi> hauing foyled the Knight, for that the night drew nigh, withdrew himself from the Golden Tower into a pleasant valley, and there stayed that night.

You shall haue occasion enough to exercise your Armes, against such as would steale your Lady, which this Knight intendeth not; therefore returne to your Tent, &amp; defend her beautie there, which none here gainsaieth. <hi>Tellamor</hi> hauing ended his spéech, intreated <hi>Barzillus</hi> to depart with him, which the Knight of <hi>Candie</hi> séeing, he returned towards the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Tower.</p>

                        <hi>Barzillus</hi> being mooued with her teares, was ready to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate her griefe in the manner she did; but at last he sayd.

we haue all the reward we expect for our trauels, now we haue found you, for so much are wee bound to that worthy Knight <hi>Pollipus,</hi> and the most noble and gracious Prince <hi>Parismus,</hi> (who is likewise tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled in your search) that we account our liues well imployed to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them and you.</p>

By this time <hi>Panuamus</hi> had prepared their dinner, which was serued in after the best sort: to which, hee and <hi>Clarina</hi> welcomed them with great kindnesse. <hi>Clarinas</hi> heart being somewhat comforted by their company, hoping by their meanes to sée the downefall of <hi>Brandamor,</hi> and her Mothers release.</p>
                     <p>When they had well refresht themselues, and heard <hi>Violletta</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the whole circumstance of her misfortunes, they beganne to deuise what course to take to set <hi>Pollipus</hi> at libertie, which they found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to doe by force, because the strength of the place was inuincible: at last, they determined the next morning to trauell, to try if Fortune would any way fauour their attempts. After they had spent some time in these spéeches, and euery one fully resolued what to doe, <hi>Bazillus</hi> saw a payre of Chesse standing on a side Table, which hee went vnto, and began to place the men in order, which <hi>Panuamus</hi> espying, came to him, and saide; That if hee pleased, he would play a game with him, wherewith <hi>Barzillus</hi> was contented.</p>

with all his force, and adding courage to his strength, ranne with such violence at <hi>Brandamor</hi> with the poynt of his kéene sword, that ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a broken place in his Armour, it pierced him into the shoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, where it stucke so hard, that he was compelled with a snatch to draw out the same, wherewith <hi>Brandamor</hi> let fall his mace, and this valiant Knight, with a carefull eye looking backe on <hi>Parismus,</hi> saw him fallen downe in a traunce, procured by the exceeding abundance of blood that issued from his wounds, and <hi>Brandamors</hi> seruants ready to make a finall end of his precious life: amongst whom hee rushed with such violence, that hee soone made them flye from their intent to saue themselues, insomuch that none of them durst come within compasse of his sword, but betooke themselues to flight, some one way, some an other: in which time <hi>Brandamor</hi> was gotten vnto the bridge, thinking to haue attained the Castle, which this Knight perceiuing, hasted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and ouertooke him on the middest thereof, and with his sword gaue him foure or fiue mortall wounds.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hen <hi>Brandamors</hi> seruants conducted them to the Chamber doore, which was fastned with so many barres, that it was long before they could vndoo the same. <hi>Pollipus</hi> (as aforesaid) hauing slaine <hi>Veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> Gardiants, &amp; seeing that he could by no meanes get out, came to <hi>Venola,</hi> desiring her not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed to see his rudenesse: for (quoth he) there are diuers Knights in fight with the Gyant, amongst whom is the most valiant Prince of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> vnto whom I would willingly haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe; for I greatly feare his death, being beset with the Gyant and a number of his seruants. Sir (quoth <hi>Venola)</hi> doe not thinke me one whit dismayed with your presence, but wish you all happy successe, and the ouerthrow of your enemies: and fortunate had that worthy Prince béene if hee had not arriued here, for <hi>Brandamor</hi> by his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery no doubt will betray his life and libertie.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:165"/>
Then both together stepping to the window, saw the combattants, and beheld the danger <hi>Parismus</hi> was in, and the comming of the strange Knight to his rescue, and withall, how valiantly hee ouerthrew the Gyant, which when he had seene, he thought in his fancy that hee had neuer before beheld so valiant and comely a Knight. And also noting the carefull regard he had of <hi>Parismus,</hi> hee exceedingly wondred what he might be, that his heart was drawne to so great affection towards him, entring into these spéeches:</p>
                     <p>Most fayre Princes, did you euer behold a goodlyer, or more valian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Knight then yonder is, who by his onely prowesse hath ouercome such enemies? doe you not behold how carefully and valiantly he hath rescued the Prince? which maketh me so much the more maruell what he should be; for neuer in my life did I before this see him: such valor, such courtesie and comelinesse, did I neuer behold in any; with the one, hee hath left his foes slaughtered; with the other, preserued the Prince.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pollipus</hi> had no sooner ended his words, and <hi>Venola</hi> readie to make answere, but they heard some vnboulting the doore, which made him againe betake himselfe to his barre; but when he beheld <hi>Parismus</hi> and the rest entring, he ranne to him, embracing him with such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as true and loyall friends might proffer: hee did the like to the strange Knight and the rest. <hi>Parismus</hi> séeing so beautifull a Lady in his company, so gorgeously attired, and attended by so many Damzels, thought that was the Princesse <hi>Venola,</hi> whom he most kindly saluted, whose heart melted into teares of ioy for her deliuery and their victory: after that, such courteous gréetings past on euery side, as would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to describe, but suppose them to bee such as proceeded from the depth of ioy. Presently <hi>Parismus, Tellamor,</hi> and <hi>Panuamus,</hi> were vnarmed to haue their wounds dreft, which taske the Lady <hi>Madera</hi> vndertooke, which when shee had performed, dinner was brought vp by <hi>Brandamors</hi> seruants, who had all submitted themselues to the Conquerours.</p>
                     <p>The strange Knight all this while was prouiding things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, with as much diligence as might be, that allin generall wondred at his courtesie, who would not vnarme himselfe vntill hee had well ordered matters for their securitie, not trusting to the truth of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damors</hi> seruants. And when they were ready to take their repast, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus</hi> desired him to vnarme himselfe, and not longer to conceale
<pb facs="tcp:16915:165"/>
what he was from their knowledge. (For <hi>Parismus</hi> thought him to be some Knight that knew him. <hi>Venola</hi> likewise thought him to be some Knight that sought her loue, but both were deceiued.) Now this Knight was the Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> the occasion of whose comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, shall be declared in the next Chapter, who beeing drawne by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall instinct, so much reuerenced <hi>Parismus,</hi> that he thought hee could not sufficiently expresse his loue towards him, and though hee neuer saw him before, yet such a secret impression of reuerence towards him, was stirred in his heart, that he desired nothing more, then to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his sight: and although he had not the least thought that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus</hi> was his father, nor he one perswasion that the other might be his sonne, yet both of their hearts were stirred with an earnest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted expectation of friendship and neerenesse of acquaintance. And the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> noting the others behauiour that <hi>Parismus</hi> was some great personage, hearing him to desire him to discouer himselfe, made this answere.</p>
                     <p>Right noble Knight, at your command I will vnarme my selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a farre borne stranger to this countrey, neither haue I any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this place, but by misaduentures forced to wander through the world, to seeke that which I haue not yet found, nor scarce know if I meet withall, being onely fortunate to arriue in this place, to make some, triall of my strength in your defence: which said, he presently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed himselfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> beholding his youth, beganne (withall the rest) to admire his valour, accompanied with such young yeeres, that embraced him in his armes, he could not by that courtesie expresse his good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> likewise reuerently kissing <hi>Venolas</hi> hand, said. Most noble Lady, my comming to this place, was to set you at liberty, and also to reuenge the death of the courteous Knight <hi>Tyrides,</hi> sonne to the good Duke <hi>Amasenus</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> vnto whom I am infinitly bound: that had I thousand liues. I would venture them all in his behalfe that now is dead. And seeing by the danger and valour of these Knights, you are set at liberty, and released from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, be of good comfort, for the King your Father will soone be heere, with thousands of knights to conduct you safely into <hi>Lybia,</hi> who at my last being in this Court, was made great preparation for this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Venola</hi> made this reply: Courteous knight, I yeeld to you and this
<pb facs="tcp:16915:166"/>
Noble Prince, all humble thankes for your kindenesse, beeing all the reward my Mayden estate can affoord: and for the newes you bring of my Fathers approache, that can yéelde no such quiet to my heart, as your happy victorie hath done: Which hath expeld those infinite trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, wherewith I was on euery side compassed: and in stead of care, replenisht my heart with comfort. When these cerimonious saluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were past, they went to Dinner. <hi>Pollipus</hi> diligently noted the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> his countenance, proportion, and gesture, thinking it his Fancie, he neuer saw a Knight more like <hi>Parismus:</hi> that his minde was inwardly styried with a great destre to knowe his Name and his byrth. After Dinner was ended, <hi>Parismus</hi> with <hi>Pollipus</hi> and <hi>Tella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> grewe into conference about <hi>Violetta:</hi> Determining the next Morning eyther to goe to the place where shee was, or else to fetch her thither, <hi>Venola</hi> shee continued in conference with the Lady <hi>Madera,</hi> entering into manie extéeding commendations of the valour of these thrée Knights, <hi>Parismus Pollipus,</hi> and <hi>the Knight of Fame:</hi> but the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> withdrawing himselfe into a priuate place, reuolued his cares in these cogitations.</p>

                        <hi>Venola,</hi> but contrary to my expectation, I am still allotted to endure more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series in her search.</p>
                     <p>Tush (qd. he) may not <hi>Venola</hi> be the Lady she meant, is she not faire Noble, &amp; vertuous? May not I be deceiued by that vision, and so driuen to consume my time in purchasing my owne torment? Do not dreams often fall out false and vaine? Tut, Why doo I make these doubts? <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> is faire, yet nothing comparable to the same I serue: Whose swéet <hi>Idea</hi> perfectly fixt in my remembrance. <hi>Venola</hi> is both noble and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, yet the countenance of my beloued countermaundeth that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: And that vision ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not prooue fallible, neither can I account it my labour, if I endure a thousand miseries in her search, so that in the end I may obtain her heauenly sight. How shuld I come to any knowledge of her abode? Which way should I dyrect my steppes in her Search? Shall I first seeke my Parents, or shall I giue ouer my care for them, and imploy all my endeuours to finde her? Such a <hi>chaos</hi> of confused

carres doe oppresse my senses, that I knowe not what to determine, whose counsell to follow, or what aide to implore. If I knew in what continent of the world she were harboured, then would I with some comfort direct my steps thitherwards: and shunne no danger though neuer so doubtfull, to purchase her good liking. Well, I will pacifie my selfe with constrained countenance, and patiently endure the hardest extremity. In these and such like complaints he spent some time, and afterwards came and accompanied <hi>Parismus</hi> and the rest, who spent that night in quiet, resoluing vpon other matters the next morning.</p>

                     <p>AFter that the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> had wonne the chiefe honour of the triumph, in the Court of the king of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and had giuen away the Kings daughter to <hi>Remulus,</hi> with her Fathers consent therto, and the solemnization of the wedding past and performed with great royalty, the king calling to minde the valour of the knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> and how prodigally he gaue <hi>Phylena</hi> to another, whose beauty might haue satisfied a mighty Potentates liking: and withall, how little he regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his heire, by which meanes afterwards, hee might haue come to the highest type of dignity, and to the high honour to bee King and Quéen of so mighty a nation: wondred what might moue him to refuse those offers: sometimes thinking it proceeded from want of wisdome: then againe he supposed, a Knight endued with such bountiful and rare gifts of prowesse, could not chuse but likewise enioy sufficient wisdome to consider the valew of such gifts. And entring into a further conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof, he began to coniecture that he was sprung of some great personage which might be the cause thereof, and for that hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, he thought that to be the very truth. Then againe he called to remembrance what <hi>Amasenus</hi> had told him, about his comming into that country, that he was by these thoughts grown into such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be satisfied therin, that he sent for the Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> and in the presence of the Queen, <hi>Amasenus, Remulus, Phylena,</hi> and al the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, of gallant knights that came to the triumph, he said as followeth. Worthy knight, whom I so much affect, that if it in my power lye, to doe you any more honour then I haue heretofore proffered, I would willingly do it, for you valour deserueth euerlasting commendations.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:167"/>
I haue offered you my Daughter in marriage, and withall intended to haue adopted you my Sonne and heire, both which you haue refused, yeelding your interest in my daughter to <hi>Remulus,</hi> and therewith left the inheritage I adioyned to her marriage, which were both worthy of regard, for that such gifts are seldome giuen: which maketh me send for you, desiring to be satisfied for your comming in the one, and also to knowe of whence, and what you are, if I can without offence to you, obtaine the same.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> made this reply. Most high and mighty King, I will vnfold the truth of all to satisfie your demand: I confesse your Maiestie did so much honour me, as my life shall bee alwaies ready at your command in quitall of the same: and your Princely gifts are of such estimation, as I confesse my selfe farre vnworthy to possesse them: but that they might haue beene bestowed of the greatest Potentate in the world, which I neither refused, nor lightly esteemed, but alwaies regarded, as of precious and inestimable valew: not drawne thereto by any want of consideration of their worthinesse, but for the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble respect I beare to loyalty. For should I haue presumed to haue wed your Princely daughter, I should haue done her great iniurie, and thereby parted the vnited hearts of true and loial friends. For pleaseth your Maiesty, at the first I intended with a ioyfull heart to haue clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my interest in that sweet Princesse loue: but I was commanded the contrary by an vndoubted meane, (which if it so please you, I will in priuate vnfold) as also perceiuing the true friendship betwixt her and that noble knight <hi>Remulus,</hi> past with consent of both their harts: I should haue esteemed it either in my selfe or in any other, an acte of great dishonour and impietie, to part those firmed bands of friendship, which if I had dissolued might haue turned their sweet intent into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented miserie, neither could I so rudelie presume to challenge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in so sweet a Ladies loue without desert, which is not attained by armes, but by loyaltie: which was the cause that I yeelded my interest vnto him, that had taken possession in her gentle heart, before my comming: and for my birth, I know not my Parents, but the truth of all that is manifest to me, the noble Duke <hi>Amasenus</hi> hath made you priuie vnto.</p>
                     <p>The King hearing his answer, greatlie commended his honourable minde, saying: Thou worthy knight, if there bee any meanes left wherein I may pleasure you, doe but aske, and you shall assuredly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

It is not vnknowne, that the King our Lorde hath but one onely Daughter, named <hi>Venola:</hi> Who on a day riding foorth on Hunting, being by a Tempest seuered from her Traine, (bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied by many Knights, amongst whome was <hi>Tyrides,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Thrace,</hi> vnto whose custodie the King committed her,) and was vnawares surprized by the Gyant <hi>Brandamor,</hi> (that dwelleth in a Castle in the Forrest of <hi>Arde,)</hi> and by him by violence carryed away: Whome the Noble knight <hi>Tyrides</hi> pursued, but the Gyant (too migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a Foe for him to cope withall) slue him, and so conueyed the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse into his Castle: Whose corps wee haue (according to our Kings commaund) brought hether.</p>

                        <hi>Amasenus</hi> hearing this sadde report, ranne vnto the dead bodie of his Sonne, breathing foorth such Lamentations, that it would haue made the very Rockes to haue rent at his sorrowes: Whom the king comforted by all possible meanes hee could, but griefe for his Sonnes vntimely death, ouer-whelmed and opprest his heart with such Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of desperate care, that hee fell into an extreame Sicknesse, which his olde-Age not being able to out-weare) within fewe dayes after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amasenus</hi> death (who was generally beloued) turned their myrth into sorrowe, and theyr Ioy into sadde preparation for mournfull Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, for the two dead Knightes: Which was afterwardes perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in most stately manner.

                        <hi>Tyrides</hi> death on the Gyant: besides his minde was affected with such a desire to sée the Ladie <hi>Venola,</hi> that giuing no respite to delay, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the right of <hi>Amasenus</hi> Funeralls was performed, made his intent knowne to the King, and with all Reuerence tooke his leaue of him. Likewise, diuers that came to the triumph, and still remained in the kings Court, being growne into great familiarity with the <hi>Knight of Fame:</hi> and desirous to make tryall of their valour against the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, departed likewise toward <hi>Lybia,</hi> With the Knights that brought the dead bodie of <hi>Tyrides,</hi> amongst whome was the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> named <hi>Archilacus, Guydo</hi> of <hi>Thrace, Trudamor</hi> of <hi>Candie, Drio</hi> of <hi>Scicile,</hi> and <hi>Tristamus,</hi> one of the thrée brethren, and within thrée dayes arriued in <hi>Lybia;</hi> Where the King hearing of their intent, and cause of comming, entertained them most Roially.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> remained in the Court of the King of <hi>Lybia,</hi> some two dayes: Where his entertainment was most courteous and honourable; Which might haue drawne a resolute determination to haue taken delight therein: But hée thought all time, though entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all varieties of pleasure, tedious: All delicate fare and costly banquetting, superfluons: and all company wearisom: hauing his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations opprest with care, his minde filled, meditating on his Ladies swéete Beautie: and his heart thyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I presume thus boldly to commit my passions to your remembrance, procured by my restlesse desire, to be acceptable in your sight. I cannot beast of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, because hitherto you haue had no triall of my truth, nor any cause to commend my desert, because the want of meanes to be imploied hath kept me from performing any such duties: but I protest and promise as much as any true heart dare affirme, or the constantest friend may performe: therefore I beseech you sweet Mistresse, grant your seruant some fauour, wherewith to comfort his poore heart, which hath deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it selfe euerlastingly to your obedience.</p>

                     <p>By this time they were commen to the Golden Tower, where was exceeding preparation made for the King, who speaking to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus</hi> and the Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> tolde they were most heartily welcome thither: likewise the Queene welcommed them with great kindenesse, especially <hi>Marcellus</hi> care for the Knight of <hi>Fames</hi> entertainement was very great, who caused him to bee lodged in a most stately lodging, where euery thing was readily prepared for him in the best manner. Euery one being departed to their seuerall lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> meditating on his good fortune, and the kinde entertainement he found in that strange place, waying on the one side, how late he was pluuged in care, and how suddenly he was possest with pleasure, how from miserie, hee was aduanced to the highest degree of his felicity: how hee was lately in dispaire of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his deuoted, and how prosperously he had now mette with her, and had in some part manifested his affection: how the occasion of his quarell for his Ladies Gloue, was the cause of his kinde entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: how fortunately in that strange plate his deedes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde:
<pb facs="tcp:16915:181"/>
and how kindly <hi>Marcellus</hi> vsed him, whose acquaintance and friendship might be a meanes, both of his stay in that place, and also of obtaining <hi>Angelicaes</hi> loue. Then againe considering how strange it was that hee would stay in the very place where his Lady should see him: and how luckily he had left the Court of the king of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and thereby he was ridde from <hi>Venolas</hi> rash loue, which might haue both endangered his honour and person: that with the remembrance of all these happy concurrences, his minde was exceedingly contented, and he seemed to haue attained more happy successe then hee would haue wisht: that in that Sunne-path of sweete delight, accompanied with quiet sleepe, he spent that night. <hi>Angelica</hi> was likewise no whitte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to him in contrariety of passions, but hauing likewise spent the day in company of her mother, when the time of rest drew nigh, shee soone gat from out of all company which she thought troublesome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much disquieted in her thoughts, feeling a kinde alteration to her former liberty of of minde, being desirous to be alone, shee gatte to her Chamber, where was none but her Damzell <hi>Anna,</hi> that was her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, to whom she said: I pray thee good <hi>Anna</hi> leaue me alone for a while, for my thoughts are possest with such disquiet, that I desire by solitarinesse to ease my passonate heart.</p>

Why (quoth <hi>Angelica)</hi> doest thou thinke their approach should disquiet me?

Will you pardon me (said <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na)</hi> if I giue my opinion? I will (said shee) I thinke (quoth <hi>Anna)</hi> it is the braue Prince <hi>Camillus Camillus</hi> (quoth she) it is rather the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Indeed (quoth <hi>Anna)</hi> that strange Knight farre surmounteth all the knights that euer I beheld, for comlinesse, courtesie and prowesse.

                     <p>Diddest thou not heare my brother <hi>Marcellus</hi> report, how prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally hee gaue away the Kings daughter of <hi>Thrace?</hi> and what paines he tooke to redeeme <hi>Venola,</hi> that beautifull Lany, from <hi>Andramarts</hi> Castle.</p>
                     <p>I know thou didst: but likewise I know thou didst not heare what he said to me to refell these doubts, that he was long since enioyned to my seruice, and was the thing hee had long time sought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
                     <p>Didst thou not sée how I found him a sleepe, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the Knights that guarded me, how resolutely (yet with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie) he approched my presence? where he told me, that no want of regard had bredde that rudenesse, but feare of missing that fit occasion, considering how straightly I am kept and pried into by my Fathers decree?</p>
                     <p>Didst thou not see how brauely and valiantly he ouerthrewe three stout Knights together, that would haue taken my gloue from him?

time, therfore I pray let vs deferre any further commendation of him, vntill we haue made better proofe of his worthinesse: which saide, they betooke themselues to their rest.</p>
                     <p>Earely the next morning the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> was vp, to whom <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> was soone gotten, who tooke no other delight but onely in his company, vsing him so kindely, and so honourably, that the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> maruelled thereat, wondring whence such kindenesse should grow: that he likwise beganne greatly to affect his company, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both come into the kings presence, who was accompanied by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus,</hi> they spent the forenoone in seuerall discourses: likewise <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi> spent her time against the Ladies of great account, in such sort as agreed in their fancy.</p>
                     <p>Dinner time beeing come, a most costly and sumptuous feast was prepared: whereunto <hi>Maximus</hi> inuited all his Nobles, and <hi>Camillus</hi> and the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> amongst the rest as his chiefest, where they were most honourably entertained, sumptuously feasted, and kindely welcommed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Camillus</hi> seeing that the Quéene and <hi>Angelica</hi> were wanting, was suddenly fallen into a sadde dumpe, because the Lady of his delight was absent: which the King noted more specially then all the rest, who supposing that <hi>Camillus</hi> came as a Suter to his daughter, had of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose giuen order to the Quéene, that shee should banquet the Ladies by themselues: which was so done, that neither <hi>Camillus</hi> nor any else perceiued his drift therein, which made <hi>Camillus</hi> extreame angry with himselfe, that he had not the day before (when he enioyed both her sight and full liberty of speech) in some measure giuen her knowledge of his loue.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> on the contrary side, gouerned himselfe with more moderation, for he hauing attained such good successe as his heart did wish, was therewith for the present contented: hoping that fortune that had beene so fauourable to him, would not suddenly alter her countenance, but still continue her aide to his furtherance: whome <hi>Maximus</hi> likewise diligently noted, hauing suspition that hee likewise came for <hi>Angelicas</hi> loue, though he dissembled the contrary, of which he could perceiue no likelihood by his merry countenance, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him onely to suspect <hi>Camillus</hi> and not him.</p>
                     <p>The Feast beeing ended with great Royaltie, euery one after some Courtly pastime past, betooke themselues to what exercise liked them

best <hi>Camillus</hi> still accompanyed the King, shewing (for griefe of <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaes</hi> absence, such a kinde of behauiour, as though his sences were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched with carelesse passions) which he noted diligently, thereby brée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his minde, an assurance of his suspition. The <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> hadde withdrawne himselfe into a Garden, and seeking the solitaryest place hee could finde, beganne to recall the sweete remembrance of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicaes</hi> Beautie into his minde, whereunto he was more firmely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled then he was before he had seene her, though euen then his Loue was firme, hauing but seene her in a Uision: That hee was now not onely contented with that fauour shee had already shewen him, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so deuised and studyed how to become more gratious in her sight, and attaine some better hope of her Loue: Which as yet hee had no likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to attayne. Whilest hee was in the depth of these cogitations, <hi>Marcellus</hi> missing him, and séeing him before enter into the Garden, neuer left vntill he had found him out, to whom he said; Syr Knight, I am somewhat bold to interrupt your quiet Meditations by my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, being desirous of your companie: Therefore if I may without intrusion accompany you, I will stay, Otherwise, I would be loath to bréede your disquiet.</p>

                     <p>I could wish it were in my power (quoth <hi>Marcellus,)</hi> to deserue so well of you: Being more willinger then able to pleasure you, for the report of your honourable guifts, hath made mee long since desirous of your Acquaintance, that if you please to stay with me in my Fathers Court, I will endeuour to shew my good. Will towardes you: And if you will accept of my plaine meaning, without further tryall, I will hereafter prooue your faithfull Friend. Most courteous Knight (quoth hée) I can yéelde no other recompence but most hearty thankes for your great kindnesse, which hath extended it selfe farre beyond my desert, with so willing a heart accepting your kinde proffers, that before I prooue disloyall, I will teare my heart from out my brest.

Hauing written this letter, and sealed it with his signet, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sent the same by certaine of knights to the Golden Tower, who as effectually dispatched their iourney, as he had giuen them straight charge, and arriuing at the Golden Tower, deliuered the Letter to <hi>Maximus,</hi> who hauing read the same, and well considered the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which augmented his hatred and suspition already begunne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> presently comming to the place where hee was in talke with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> he caused him to bee apprehended, and without any other iudgement, caused him presentely to be cast into a denne of Lions, to be deuoured.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> was no sooner put into the denne, but the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made an exceeding roaring, that those without assuredly iudged him deuoured, and himselfe expected nothing but that terrible and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death: but the Lyons, who by nature will not harme those of Roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bloud, spared his life, and not so much as offered to touch him, but were rather terrified with his presence. He being glad of this happy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, began to assure himselfe that he was sprung of kingly race, which greatly comforted his heart, and added a perswasiue hope to comfort himselfe withall, that by that occasion hee should attaine to <hi>Anglicaes</hi> loue, if he could worke meanes for his releasement out of that place: most of all he wondred why <hi>Maximus</hi> had offered him that outrage. In these and such like cogitations he spent the rest of the day.</p>

                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> séeing the knight whom he most dearely loued destroied, without iudgement, equity, or cause, was so inwardly inraged, that he was in minde oftentimes to work himselfe iniurie, and seek meanes of reuenge, if he knew who had been the causer therof: and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to doe, nor in whose company to spend his time, he presently thought to goe to <hi>Angelica,</hi> whom he thought bare some good will to the knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> with her to bemoane his vntimely death: but comming to the place where she was, he would haue entred therin, but <hi>Collimus</hi> according to <hi>Maximus</hi> command, den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:16915:189"/>
in that rage, which shee soone perceiued by his behauiour, she came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, (hauing seated himselfe downe in a chaire) and desired to know the cause of his wrath.</p>
                     <p>O Sister (quoth he) this place is the harbour of cruelty, tyrannie, and dishonour, which in times past hath beene famous, and a receipt of honour, but shortly will be hated and shunned, as odious and ominous, and all procured by the foolish Diuining of a wicked Harlot, that hath filled my Fathers head with such fancies, that hee forgetteth himselfe, his Honour, and Kingly behauiour, and giueth credit to none but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and parasites, imprisoning his children, murthering his friends and séeking the subuersion of honour, and honourable knights. Oh <hi>Angelica,</hi> what should I say, or to whom should I complaine? he hath slaine Uertue, he hath destroied Honour, he hath murthered my deere Friend, that kinde and courteous knight: he hath cast the vnknowne (most honourable though vnknowne) Knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> into the Lions denne: without iudgement, iustice, right, or triall. <hi>Angelica</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his words, was readie to swound with griefe, but that feare to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer her loue, withheld her: but beeing not able to refraine from teares, shee withdrew her selfe aside to conceale the same, which <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> espying caught her in his armes, and said. Nay deare Sister, doe not conceale your griefe for his death from me, that loue you so much the better: and if you euer conceiued any good liking of him, I shall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you for the same: for he was worthy to be beloued of the best La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the world: for in him shined all points and parts of true knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and honour.

                     <p>Oh <hi>Angelica?</hi> (quoth <hi>Marcellus)</hi> had I knowne you had loued him so well, I would haue died with him, but I would haue saued his life, which was so suddenly acted and so vnexpected, that before I could recouer my sences from amazement, hee was past my reache. What cause had my Father thinke you, to seeke his destruction, but because he saw him in speech with you? Aye me (quoth <hi>Angelica)</hi> was I the cause of his death? I will then goe to him: with that such griefe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest her heart, that she fell downe in his armes.</p>

                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> called to her Maides, who presently came thronging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, maruelling at her suddaine sickenesse: and especially <hi>Anna,</hi> who was priuy to her thoughts, and hearing <hi>Marcellus</hi> spéeches, made great lamentation. This newes was soone come to the Queenes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, who presently came running vnto the place, and hauing by her labour recouered her, entred into these speeches: Why how now <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> what meanest thou to doe thy selfe this wrong? What mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance or sudden passion hath caused this disquiet? Then turning to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> Or can you tell <hi>Marcellus,</hi> (quoth shee) for you were by? I know not (quoth he) but I am sure wee haue all cause of little ioye, when we that are the Kings children, shall be imprisoned vpon the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering report of euery dissembling Sycophant. Why (quoth shee) who hath abused you? That did <hi>Colimus</hi> (quoth hee) and him haue I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. Besides, my Lord and Father hath destroied that honourable strange knight, because I loued him, who neuer deserued the least cause of such cruelty, but was alwaies honourablie esteemed in euery Kings Court, vntill it was his ill happe to arriue in this vnfortunate place, to end his life by Tyranny not by Iustice. Take heede <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> Scandalize not your Fathers honour, which may bring you in danger: for that he hath done nothing but right, and with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, for behold that Letter, and thou shalt soone see what a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet that Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> hauing read this Letter, was at the first suddenly amazed thereat, but yet notwithstanding, he said: vpon my life this accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation is most false and vntrue. <hi>Angelica</hi> taking the letter and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> ding the same, was exceedingly astonisht thereat, to whom <hi>Marcellus</hi> said. <hi>Angelica</hi> beleeue it not, for if you doe, you shall too much wrong that honourable Knight, that is too much abused already, who if hee were liuing, would soone reprooue these accusations: but hee good Knight is now dead, and past recalling, whose death will bring more dishonour to the <hi>Natolians,</hi> then euer will be recouered. Why (quoth the Quéen) what maketh thée <hi>Marcellus</hi> thus inconsiderate, by taking a strangers part, to indanger thy owne life, which knowest the Kings humor? Loue (quoth he) to that stranger, maketh mee bewaile his vntimely death, whom I would that I had excused.</p>
                     <p>The Queene seeing <hi>Angelica</hi> somewhat well recouered, departed vnto <hi>Maximus,</hi> who by that time had knowledge of <hi>Collimus</hi> death, and was meditating how to chastise <hi>Marcellus</hi> for that presumption:
<pb facs="tcp:16915:190"/>
But the Queene vpon her knees intreated him to pardon him, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that <hi>Collimus</hi> had greatly abused him, that with much adoe the King was pacified.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> hauing somewhat comforted <hi>Angelica,</hi> in a heauie and sadde estate, departed to his chamber, and left her with her Damzell <hi>Anna,</hi> rather ready to yeelde vp the Ghoast, then otherwise likely to suruiue: and night being come, the refusing meat, went to her bed, not to sleepe, but to bewaile the Knight of <hi>Fames</hi> vntimely death.</p>
                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fame</hi> all this time remained in the Lions denne, carefully deuising which way to get out of that place tyring his senses, but finding no meanes of release. One while accusing his hard fortune, and then <hi>Maximus</hi> for his cruelty. Sometimes fearing to be famished in that place: and then comforting himselfe with perswasions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible deliueries. Now dispairing to be vtterly exempt from the swéet sight of <hi>Angelica,</hi> whose absense and restraint of liberty (procured as he thought by his boldnesse) pinched his heart with extreame feare.</p>
                     <p>In this sort he continued so long, vntill he was ready to be starued, and constrained to eate such vnsauory foode as was daily cast to the Lions. <hi>Angelica</hi> likwise no whit mittigated her griefe, but rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the same: being much comforted by <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whose minde was not yet satisfied with sufficient consideration of these mischances, both hee and <hi>Angelica</hi> continued as it were in a further hope in their fancies of the <hi>Knight of Fames</hi> safty: though when they beganne to comfort themselues with any perswasions, they were quite past hope. <hi>Maximus</hi> likewise hauing considered with what seueritie hee had vsed the Knight, and that he had condemned him without any triall of the accusation that had been vsed by his Knights, euer since his death, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to tell a remorse in his conscience of vniustice) but by the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led opinion that was stirred in his heart by those false Prophesies, hee soone shooke the same off.</p>

My freinde, I séeke not thy life, but mine owne safety, beeing as thou seest, preserued by Diuine prouidence by the Kings cruelty, by him vniustly cast into this place, without any cause of offence: but wrongfully, as thou maiest perceiue by my preseruation: for if my facte had deserued punishment, no doubt I could not haue escaped the crueltie of these executioners, hauing endured great danger of famish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Most honourable Knight (quoth he) I know my selfe so cleare from all such villany, as that I sweare and protest by my life, by Heauen, and by all the good that euer I expect, which I desire to turne to my destruction, it I tell you not the very truth.</p>
                     <p>Then (quoth <hi>Marcellus)</hi> the same day that the King my Father caused you to be throwne into the Lyons den, the king of <hi>Lybia</hi> sent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certaine of his Knights, with a Letter, wherein he accused you to haue most shamefully dishonoured his Daughter <hi>Venola,</hi> desiring my Father to dispatch you out of the way: for your life and nothing else might appease his ire: which was the cause of his cruelty.</p>
                     <p>My Lord (quoth the knight of <hi>Fame)</hi> vpon mine honour, my former oath, and by all other truth and fidelity, this accusation is most vniust, false, and vntrue: which if I may by your fauour in whose hands my life now resteth) haue liberty to approue, I will maintaine the contrary, euen in the gates of the king of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and cause my accusers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the contrary: neither did I euer seeke loue at that Ladies hands, by whose dishonourable meanes this false accusation is raised against mee.</p>
                     <p>Deare friend (qd. <hi>Marcellus)</hi> you haue said inough, and I rest assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied of your loialty. The knight of <hi>Fame</hi> was so inwardly vexed with this accusation that he was halfe mad with griefe, but chiefly, for that hee thought it was come to <hi>Angelicas</hi> hearing, and might bee a meanes to cause her vtterly to forsake him: which appalled his sences, with extreame vexation, that he stood like one transformed.</p>

This (quoth he) is the true discourse of my forepassed life, which I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet manifested to any but your selfe, whose fauour hath farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted my desert, into whose hands I commit my selfe to bee dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of: desiring you not to conceiue amisse of mee, for that false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation being most vntrue.</p>

                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> againe embracing him in his armes, desired him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, not to thinke that hee did any way conceiue the least euill opinion of him, but that he did esteeme of him, as the dearest friend he had in
<pb facs="tcp:16915:193"/>
the World, and that he did both loue and honour him as himselfe, and would neuer forsake him whilest hee liued, but continue his faithfull friend for euer. Hauing in this sort made a new league of amitie, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> left the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> to his priuate meditations, promising to returne to him very shortly, going directly to <hi>Angelica,</hi> whome hee found continuing her woonted sadnes: For shee could by no meanes be comforted, but still augmented her Loue, by remembring the <hi>Knight of Fames</hi> person, to whom she bare such intire affections, that she resolued neuer to Loue any other Knight, but determined to spende the whole date of her life in single estate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> sudden Approach brake off her silent pensiuenesse, by his countenance shewing a heart replenisht with ioy, which hee vttered in this sort. <hi>Angelica</hi> (qd. hee) cast off this sadde countenance, for I bring you newes of more comfort: for the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> is liuing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by admirable meanes. Oh Brother (quoth she) this newes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, which will nip my heart with griefe to heare of, and be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed therein. Sister (qd. he) it is so, neither maruell thereat, for his innocencie in the fact laide to his charge, hath I thinke caused the Gods to pitty him: besides, thereby you may be assured, hee is borne of royall blood, who is now in the Kéepers house in safety, with whome I haue bene these two hours: Now cast off these discontents and clowds of care, for there is no further cause of disquiet for his supposed death.</p>

                        <hi>Angelica</hi> then verily belieuing his wordes, saide: Good brother tell me how he doeth, for whose safetie I reioyce? For of all the Knights that euer I behelde, I neuer liked nor loued any so well: desiring you withall, to kéep my counsell, (hauing bewrayed my secrets to none else) and not let him know so much as I haue tolde you. Then should both you and I doo him wrong (qd. he) for he hath well deserued loue, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at your hands: to whom by his owne report, he hath long ago dedicated himselfe, and not onely of his owne inclination, but of a high command: for the truth of which, he hath vpon trust of my secrecie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto me, which you shall likewise heare: then he discoursed the whole truth, euen as the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> had before done: which when she heard, she said: What a discourteous Lady is that <hi>Venola,</hi> to séeke the ouerthrow of so Woorthy a Knight? and how may I estéeme him, that before he knew mee, was so constant in his Loue, without hope of my fauour, and refused the proffred loue of two such Ladies for my sake; besides the perill he hath endured in my search: and peraduenture is

                     <p>Well (quoth <hi>Marcellus)</hi> rest you contented, and still continue your louetowards him, to increase and not diminish the same, who is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny alloted to be your husband: the care of whose welfare let be my charge: for I so much loue and esteeme him, both for his own and your sake, that I will leaue no meanes vnassayed, whereby to do you good: which said, hee againe departed to the Knight of <hi>Fame.</hi> By this time the darke night approached, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> and the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> were deuising what meanes to vse for his safetie, and to procure the desired content <hi>Angelica</hi> expected, who before had giuen herconsent to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Therefore this is my censure, that you shall this night (as I will direct you) depart from hence, and go to Saint <hi>Austins</hi> Chappell, not farre hence, and there stay for mee, vntill to morrow morning, where remaineth an olde religious Priest, named <hi>Iabine,</hi> who if you say you come from mee, wil assuredly giue you entertainement: which when you haue done, I will so worke with my Sister <hi>Angelica,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:194"/>
that hee shall condescend by such meanes as I will worke for her secret escape, to come to you: by which I hope I shall end the doubts that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse my Fathers minde, ridde their Countrey of the scandall it is likely to runne into: and worke both mine owne, yours, and <hi>Angelicaes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: for so dearely doo I loue her, that had I many liues to loose, I would hazard them all to worke her releasement: For were she once marryed, then should the date of the foolish Prophecie haue an ende. The <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> hearing his spéeches, which only tended to worke the content, hée aboue all things in the World sought, could not well containe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from expressing immeasurable ioy, but yéelding many humble and harty thanks to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> both commended his deuise, and also intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to goe forward with the same.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Marcellus</hi> called the Kéeper, asking his counsell, if he knew any way whereby the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> might getont of the Castle promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him a good reward: and withall, pulling from his necke a Chaine of gold, gaue him the same. The Kéeper being inticed with this reward, (Gold hauing that force, to make thimgs impossible come to effect) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently tolde them he hadde a Deuise that might goe for Currant, if the Knight would vndertake the same. I haue my Lord (quoth he) a Ues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of great largenesse, which sometimes sorted for other vses, which if wée could deuise to let downe into the Lake, he might easily in that get ouer vnto the other side: Which deuise <hi>Marcellus</hi> and the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> both liked. And about Midnight, when all things were at rest, they put the same in practise, and by a Rope lette the Uessell downe: Which swamme most currantly.</p>
                     <p>Then fastening a Rope about the <hi>Knight of Fames</hi> middle, and after that (With many fayre promises and protestations of perpetuall Friendship) they had taken theyr leaues, the Kéeper and <hi>Marcellus</hi> lette him downe: Who was so heauie, by reason of the waight of his owne bodie, and his Armour, that they had much adoo from letting him fall, and being in the Uessell, was like to sinke in the same. But with much adoo (and great daunger of Drowning) by reason of the tottering and vnsted fastnes of the Uessell, which with euery little Weyght more on one side then on the other, was ready to ouerturne, hee got on to the Bancke, which was so stéepe vpwards, that hée had much adoo to clime vp the saine, but was oftentimes readie to fall downe backwardes into the Lake vnder him, which was of an excéeding great and huge depth:
<pb facs="tcp:16915:194"/>
but hauing happily escaped both those daungers, hée departed towards Saint <hi>Augustins</hi> chappell, according to such dyrections <hi>Marcellus</hi> had giuen him to finde the same. <hi>Marcellus</hi> and the Kéeper drewe vp the Uessell, and betooke themselues to theyr rest.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> had not well remembred <hi>Marcellus</hi> spéeches, and therfore hauing gone some halfe mile from the Golden Tower, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to wander out of the way, he tooke vp his lodging vnder a Cipresse Trée, spending the whole Night in manifolde meditations, of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his businesse: Being oftentimes in great doubt, and dispairing of neuer séeing <hi>Angelica</hi> again, drawne to that feare by reason of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Iealousie, and the diligent Watche hee had set in euery corner of the said Tower, but especially at the entrance: Where none went out and in, but the Gardiants searched them, that his minde was sometimes wrackt with dispaire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sometimes animated to comfort by the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red trust he had in <hi>Marcellus.</hi> The Night béeing by him in this sort spent, in the Morning hee betooke himselfe againe to his Iourney, and with ease found out Saint <hi>Austins</hi> chappell: and knocking at the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell doore, it was iong before any came, but at last he beheld olde <hi>Iabin</hi> standing behinde him; Who had bene abroade very early, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, whome the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> most kindely saluted. <hi>Iabin</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling to sée one in Armour, demanded what he would haue?</p>

hearing, she said: Brother, How can this be effected, when you sée so many impossibilities to hinder our intent, that we shall but spend much labour to little effect, and also rather bring my Fathers heauy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against vs, then reape any comfort? Whose crueltie you sée is such, that hee will, if hée should finde out our drifte, punish vs with seueritie: Besides, if it should come to that passe: What excuse could you finde to pacifie his ire? Therefore I thinke it best, that wee neuer hazard our selues, but rather be contented with our quiet estate, least a worse mischaunce light vpon vs thereby.</p>
                     <p>Syster (quoth <hi>Marcellus)</hi> your counsell is good, but yet heare what I shall say: The life you leade is but miserable, being kept like a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner; Whereas, if you could but winne this liberty, you should enioy your fill of hearts content, and be a meanes to rid my Father and vs all from the doubts we may now endure. Besides, if you loued that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knight; Whose constancie to you-wards is without compare, you would for his fake refuse no perill. Why brother (qd. she) what néede you make any such doubt when I haue said sufficient alreadie, vnlesse you thinke me to dissemble? For such is my loue and good Will, that I will more willingly vndertake any means to attaine his company, then he can desire: not drawne by your perswasion, but of my own voluntary will: which haue made some doubt of this attempt, because I am feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of your ill, and carefull of your good: but whatsoeuer you shal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile me vnto, I will execute. Which said, they began to studie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult how to bring their businesse about: but were so confounded in their thoughts, that they thought it altogether impossible.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Maximus</hi> being ridde of <hi>Camillus</hi> company, and assured of the Knight of <hi>Fames</hi> death, gaue his minde to more quiet, then during the time of their being there hée had done: and being wearie with care, thought to recreate himselfe by some exercise: therefore hée appointed the very same day to ride on hunting: and to that intent hée was early vp, sending for <hi>Angelica</hi> to goe with the Quéene, euen at that instant when shée was deuising with <hi>Marcellus:</hi> which opportunitie fell out most conueniently to further their intent, which <hi>Marcellus</hi> told her he would determine of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> immediately went downe with the messenger: and with the King and Quéene, <hi>Marcellus</hi> and diuers others departed out of the tower. <hi>Marcellus</hi> all that day kept diligent company with <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> vntill the king being earnest in pursuite of the game strayed from
<pb facs="tcp:16915:195"/>
them: the Quéene likewise was absent, and most of <hi>Angelicas</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diants, sauing some sixe, béeing indeede such as <hi>Marcellus</hi> had before made priuie to his intent, who had firmely protested to kéepe his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile: which opportunitie <hi>Marcellus</hi> tooke, and presently conueyed <hi>Angelica</hi> towards Saint <hi>Austins</hi> Chappell: being without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Parke, when they thought themselues farre inough from the King, they were vnawares set vpon by a company of strange knights, who offered by force to carrie away <hi>Angelica.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> being somewhat astonisht thereat, drew his sword, and being before well prouided, withstood them. <hi>Angelicas</hi> gardyants did the like: that on a suddaine there began a cruell combat betwixt them, vntill <hi>Marcellus</hi> was gréeuously wounded, one of his company slain, and the rest in as great danger as might be: but being a knight of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding courage, he defended himselfe most valiantly. So long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the fight, that in the meane time, some of the kings company, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the charge of <hi>Angelica,</hi> mist her, which hée soone declared to the king, who commaunded his knights to poste euery way by seuerall troupes: himselfe and the Quéene well guarded, tooke the readiest way out of the Parke: which was the same way <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> had taken, and hasting, came to the place where they were, in the hottest of their skyrmish.</p>
                     <p>The straunge knights espying the King, presently fledde away, with all possible spéede, whom many of the <hi>Natolians</hi> pursued so farre, vntill they might descrie a band of Souldiers: wherewith they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all expedition possible, and certified the King thereof, who presently hasted to the Golden Tower, with the Quéene, <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> in his companie: and by reason of the straungers hée saw in fight with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> hée hadde not the least suspition of <hi>Angelicaes</hi> entended flight: and maruailing what that Armie should meane, hée sent out spyes to viewe of what force they were, who hauing done in all poynts accordingly, they went and certified him that they were tenne thousand Souldiers, but they could not discerne vnder whose conduct.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maximus</hi> fearing the worst, presently sent letters to the Nobles of his Land, with all expedition to muster vp theyr forces, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey them to the Golden Tower: and also caused most diligent watch and warde to be kept.</p>

                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> being most grieuously Wounded, was like wise with all cure tended by the Kings Physitions, to whom <hi>Angelica</hi> repaired: and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him alone, she said as followeth.</p>
                     <p>What misery awayteth my hard Desteny, that am thus disastredly deteyned from my wished content? My euill presaging minde, did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell this misfortune, which hath thus frustrated our desire, and which is more miserable, brought you to this dangerous estate: but most of all withhold me from the fight of my beloued, and causeth him both to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his cares, and suspect our loyaltie. What will he thinke when he seeth no performance of that which was promised, but still stayeth for our comming, and yet be frustrated? For the knowledge of our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, can by no meanes come to his hearing. Would to God that I had ended my accursed life, by the hands of those enemyes, rather then to haue suruiued to endure this extreame care. No hard fortune can be compared to that I endure, no care comparable to my griefe.</p>
                     <p>First, to sée you thus grieuously Wounded: Next to be disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of our desire: and lastly, to frustrate the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. What shall wée now doe? How shall wee recure this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap? Or what meanes is there left, that may adde the least comfort to our hearts in this extremitie? In stéed of the content I expected by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying his presence, I am returned to my woonted bondage: and sée my Friends almost murdred and enuironed with foes. Peace, peace, (qd. <hi>Marcellus)</hi> good <hi>Angelica,</hi> ceasse these complaints, and in this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, imitate the olde Phrase: Make a vertue of necessity, and with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience giue attendance for better successe: For now in these perplexities, there is small hope of present amendment: For that Worthy knight no doubt is of such Wisedome and prudent gouernment, that hee will iudge the best of our estate, and carefully prouide for his owne safetie. With that <hi>Angelica</hi> burst foorth into abundante of teares, saying. Aye mée poore Wretch, I shall neuer then sée him againe. With that shee departed, wringing her handes, and making great lamentation, so that <hi>Marcellus</hi> séeing her sorrowe, was ready to worke his owne decay by his vexation.</p>
                     <p>Nowe those Bandes of Souldiers belonging to <hi>Camillus,</hi> who presently after his departure from the Castle of the Golden Tower, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during manie restlesse Passions, for the want of <hi>Angelicaes</hi> presence, with whome hee was full greatly in Loue: with all spéed mustered vp
<pb facs="tcp:16915:196"/>

                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fame</hi> being with olde <hi>Iabine,</hi> spent much part of the day in conference with him, maruelling that hee heard not from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus:</hi> but when it was darke night, his minde was rackt with excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding care and vexation, and being without any hope of his comming, hee was as much grieued how to satisfie <hi>Iabine,</hi> whom hee thought would now suspect him of falsehood: and might suppose hee came not from <hi>Marcellus.</hi> Therefore he said as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Father, I maruell that I haue not heard from <hi>Marcellus,</hi> according to his promise, which maketh mee thinke that some crosse mischance hath hindred him, that may breed in you some misconceit of mee, that haue in his name come vnto you, which if you doe, you shall much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie me: for it was he that sent me hither, as I could assure you by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers probable reasons.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight (quoth he) I pray bee not troubled with any thought, for you are welcome to me, though <hi>Marcellus</hi> had not sent you, which I make no doubt of, but so well doe I loue him, as that whatsoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in his name, shall by the strickt obseruance I beare to that name, command me any seruice.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards they went to their repast, with such sparing diet as the Priest vsed, and after Supper to bedde: where the Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> could take no rest at all, but yet lay very quietly, because he was loath to trouble his Host: with which restraint of liberty of speech, and other passions that opprest his sences, he endured that tedious night in great torment, which seemed longer then many nights would haue done, if he might haue had liberty to vtter his lamentations, which boiled in his breast like the violence of a mighty flame pend within a small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.</p>
                     <p>Early the next morning, <hi>Iabine</hi> went foorth for to prouide food, and left the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> alone, who then vttered many complaints, but at last finding fault with himselfe for vrging that effeminate kind of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, he striuing to ouermaster his passions, which the more hee

                     <p>Knight, thou néedest not to haue fledde from me, for I intended thee no harme, but was desirous to knowe some newes of thée, which if thou wilt tell me, I will let thee depart: otherwise thou shalt neuer es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape my hands.

Father (quoth he) your counsell is good, which I will put in practise, not voluntarily, but forced thereto in regard of mine owne preseruation: requesting this one fauour at your handes, that you would by some meanes remember my humble dutie to that honourable knight <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus:</hi> and tell him that it shall not be long ere I returne: desiring him in the meane time (according to his former curtesie, which hath bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended farrebeyond my desert) to remaine my friend, and remember mée to <hi>Angelica.</hi> I will (quoth <hi>Iabine)</hi> fulfil your request in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.

                        <hi>Laurana</hi> beholding his countenance, felt an exceeding throbbing suddainly possesse her heart: withall, such a violent blushing <unclear>flasht</unclear> in

her face, that she wondred whence such sudden motions should proceed, and was constrained to turne aside, least any should perceiue her chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging countenance, and withdraue himselfe to a Window.

                     <p>The <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> not vnmindfull to satisfie <hi>Violettaes</hi> wrong, by some reuenge against <hi>Archas,</hi> most humbly thankt the King for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him so much, by giuing him authority to giue his Doome: but (qd. he) I most humbly intreat your Highnes to pardon mee, and desire your Wisedome, to whome hee hath bene offensiue, to vse him as you please: For it were great presumption for mee in this straunge place to censure of him in your Maiesties presence.</p>
                     <p>Then the King called <hi>Archas,</hi> commaunding him to declare what mooued him to commit that outrage to <hi>Violetta?</hi> but hée assuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of no lesse then death, would make no answere: Wherevpon the King commanding him to bee had to Prison, appoynted that the next day he should loose his head: Which was accordingly performed: Who might peraduenture haue bene pardoned, but that his owne conscience accused him more then those whome hee had offended, and so according to his owne follie which had brought him to commit all those Wicked acts, euen so hee was his owne Iudge: For that his guiltie conscience would not suffer him to aske pardon. After this iudgement giuen, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans minde was in quiet, hauing sufficiently scanned the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Violettaes</hi> misfortune.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> was Royallie entertained, and honourablie feasted by the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but especially <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Laurana,</hi> vsed him with excéeding kindenesse, being for that night driuen to part from him without any conference.

trauell in search of my Parents. Which the Uision tolde mée were of Kingly race: And withall, gaue me another commaund, that I should loue no Lady, vntill I had found out that Lady that was showne mee in the Uision: this did greatly trouble me, when presently came newes of <hi>Tyrides</hi> death, sonne to Duke <hi>Amasenus,</hi> who was slaine by <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> in rescue of <hi>Venola,</hi> whom he had the custodie of: Upon which occasion I trauelled first to <hi>Lybia,</hi> and from thence to the Forrest of <hi>Arde,</hi> thinking <hi>Venola</hi> had bene the same Lady appeared to mee in the Uision. Where I met with your Highnesse, and with you departed to the Court of the King of <hi>Lybia,</hi> after <hi>Venola</hi> was redéemed, as your selfe rmember, who was not the Lady I went in searche of. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when I had thought to haue departed with you towardes this Countrey, <hi>Venola</hi> by subtiltie, causing mée to take a séepie Potion, frustrated my desire, which she did to stay me with her, vpon a pretence of great Loue as she bare me, which one afterwards made me acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted withall: Which when I heard, being enioyned to place my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on another, fearing some mischaunce might arise by her Loue, and finding with out what deuice they had frustrated me of your company, I departed without knowledge of any from thence. And at last after long Trauell, arriued in <hi>Natolia;</hi> Where lying downe to rest my selfe being wearie, it happened the Lady <hi>Angelica</hi> (the most fairest Lady li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, to passe by:) Whom after I had séene, I perfectly knewe to be the Ladie that appeared to me in the Uision, hauing after such good successe, that I was entertained by <hi>Maximus</hi> the King, at the Golden Tower, and there grewe into great acquaintance with <hi>Marcellus.</hi> I had not long remained there, but the King of <hi>Lybia</hi> (as I suppose, perswaded thereto by <hi>Venolaes</hi> meanes) Wrote a Letter vnto <hi>Maximus,</hi> that hee would for his sake either send mée to him, or else be reuenged on mée by my death: alleadging that I had dishonoured his Daughter: Which accusation was most false and vntrue. Heereupon the King without hearing what I could say in mine owne defence, immediately cast mee into a denne of fierce Lyons, who refused to hurt mée: Where I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many dayes, hauing no other Foode but such as was cast to them: from whence afterwards I escaped by the Kéepers meanes; Whom I compelled to send for <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who ridde me out of the Tower, and sent me to an Ancient friende of his named <hi>Iabine,</hi> Priest of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> Chappell, promising to come to mée the next day, but was disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted thereof by such meanes as is not yet come to my knowledge.
<pb facs="tcp:16915:202"/>
Upon a day I went abroad from the Chappell, and by misfortune was espyed by some of the Kings Knights; Who certified him, (as I think) that I was aliue; Wher vpon he againe most vniustly sought my life, and sent out thousands in my search: from whose handes I escaped, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to finde out my Parents, and so trauelled hitherwards. This (quoth he) is the briefe and true rehearsall of my trauells and bringing vppe, so farre as I knowe: hauing nothing whereby to bee otherwise knowne, but a Iewell which my Nurse gaue me great charge to kéepe; Whose minde I haue fulfilled. With that, he pulld out of his bosome the Iewell, which he continually wore about his neck: Which <hi>Laura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> hauing diligently viewed, perfectly knew to be the same she had lefte with <hi>Parismenos,</hi> in the <hi>Iland of Rocks:</hi> Whom she assuredly (both by that and many other probabilities) knew to be her sonne, that suddenly before them all, she caught him in her armes, and cryed; Oh my sonne <hi>Parismenos,</hi> thou art my Sonne: many times kissing and embracing him. Her strange behauiour draue them all into admiration. When suddenly the place where they were, beganne to waxe darke, that they could scarce sée one another, and they heard a voyce, which they knewe not from whence; Which said, <hi>Parismus</hi> welcome thy sonne <hi>Parisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi> long time absent from thée: thou néedest not doubt of it, for none is so like thée in Heroicall qualities; Which saide, the darknesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vanished.</p>
                     <p>By this they all assuredly knew that the <hi>Knight of Fame</hi> was sonne to <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Laurana;</hi> Who likewise assured himselfe that hee had found his Parents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that presently he knéeled downe: Whom <hi>Parismus,</hi> the King, the Quéene, and <hi>Laurana,</hi> most louingly all at once incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with theyr kinde embracings, reioycing most exceedingly for ioy that he was found, being vnable by Words, Welcoms, Embracings, or otherwise, to expresse their gladnesse. <hi>Parismus</hi> reioycing that hee had so valiant and vertuous a Sonne, the King and Quéene glad that in theyr olde Age they sawe so vertuous an imposprung foorth of theyr issue to succéede in the Kingdome. And <hi>Laurana</hi> with teares of ioy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing her content, in that she had found her sonne whom she thought had bin destroyed long ago: that no hart is able to expresse the ioy that possest their harts. <hi>Pollipus</hi> and <hi>Violetta,</hi> they likewise embraced him, being as glad as any of the rest, of his safetie. This newes was soone spred throgh the whole Court, &amp; from thence, flying fame soone brought the knowledge thereof to the Citizens, who of their owne accord, rung

theyr Bells, made bon-fires, and Triumphs, through the whole Citie: Where on all sides, was such excéeding reioycings, as is impossible to be exprest.</p>
                     <p>Many dayes afterwards the <hi>Knight of Fame,</hi> who now shall assume his right and proper Name <hi>Parismenos,</hi> continued in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Court, honourablie entertayned, and highly estéemed of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> States: Who grue into an excéeding loue towards him, and was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued of the King and Quéene, but especially of his Parents, who thought themselues moste happie and blessed, to haue such a Sonne: Whose fame was spredde through most places of all the Worlde, and that euery mans eares were filled with the report of his most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable déedes.</p>
                     <p>Now that <hi>Parismenos</hi> had thus happily attained the knowledge of his Parents, the want whereof had long time filled his minde w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> care, no other thought but of <hi>Angelicas</hi> Loue could take place in his heart, which (though his cause of ioy otherwise was sufficient) filled his sences with sadnesse, and quite extinguisht those delights, that they séemed to trouble his minde, rather tedious then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable: adding no ease to his cares, which were augmented to an excéeding height, by reason of <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus</hi> cruelty, which he saw was so much aggrauated against him, that he knew it a thing impossible for him to attaine the least fauour at his hand: Who likewise kept <hi>Angelica</hi> Guarded so strongly, and so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly pryed into all her actions, that it was impossible any way, eyther to come to her spéech, or send to her: that with diuersitie of the cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his hart was tormented, his countenance darkned, and hée spent his time most commonly in sadnesse: beeing séeldome drawne to any myrth: Which was generally noted of all men, but especiallie of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana,</hi> who could neuer be quiet but onely in his company.</p>
                     <p>And one a day missing him, shée rested not vntill she had found him out, being gotten into the most solitariest place in the Garden, leaning himselfe vpon his Elbow: Who espying her, raised himselfe from the ground, blushing at her presence; to whome she said.</p>

myselfe would both willingly doo my best to comfort you, and knowe the cause if it be not too secret.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> with humble reuerence made her this answer: I beséeth you doo not thinke me so vndutifull, nor my cause of care so secret, that I would conceale the same from you: but were it of much more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I would willingly reueale it to satisfie your minde: which I haue omitted, as vnwilling to trouble you therwith, and for no other respect.</p>
                     <p>Then I pray (qd. she) let me know, is it not Loue? Yes most déere Mother (qd. he) it is Loue, and to that beautifull Ladie <hi>Angelica,</hi> who beareth me the like affection: but so farre am I from enioying her loue, as that it attainteth my heart with care to thinke thereof, which is the cause of my sadnes: which will increase, rather then diminish, if I doe not shortly trauell thither, being now assured of all other doubtes, and hauing finished my trauell in search to finde you out. Therfore I most humbly beseech you to procure my Lord and Fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent to my spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy departure: For without the fruition of her heauenly sight, my life wilbe but wearisome. <hi>Laurana</hi> hearing his spéeches, perceiued indéede, that his affection was great, and therefore not to be remooued, and well knowing by her owne former experience, that Loue was incurable, thee was the more ready to pitie his passions, that shee promised to further him in what the could, being now assured of the cause of his sadnesse.</p>

With that he embraced her in his arms, who gaue a silent consent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with teares, procéeding from her tender heart: With whom <hi>Marcellus</hi> stayed some time, spending the time in many friendly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, so that <hi>Dulcia</hi> was constrained by his intreaties, and her owne yéelding heart, to giue her consent: both their intents being grounded vpon no other purpose, but that which is vertuous and chaste.</p>

                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> being departed from <hi>Marcellus,</hi> soone arriued at the Maiden Tower, where hee alighted: and comming to the Gardiants that kept the Gate, hee saluted them with a courteous behauiour, and tolde them, that hee was sent by <hi>Maximus</hi> theyr King, to be one of the Gardiants: Whome at the first they denied him, then he deliuered his Letter, which they hauing read, accepted him for one of theyr fellowes, without any doubt or mistrust.</p>
                     <p>When hee had obtained his desire in this, with such a prosperous beginning, hee began to comfort himselfe with hope of further good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, continuing all that Night amongst the rest of the Gardiants, and not once offering any behauiour which might bréed suspition: but beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himselfe most carefully, both in all his words and déedes, as he had good reason: For that they were very circumspect, and almost by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the strict charge the King had giuen them, ready to suspect each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All the next day continued hée in that sort, without any méeting of the Eunuches: But on the third day he met two of them together in a place most conuenient, and faluted them most kindely: Who maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling what he should be, for that he was a stranger, began presently to be iealous of him: but he perceiuing the same, told them, that he had a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret message vnto them from the King: and withall, a letter vnder his hand and signet to the Gardiants, which he shewed them. But to you (qd. h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Eunuches hauing heard his message, and with all, the Kings priuy seale to the Letter, written in his behalfe, could not chuse but giue credence to the same, supposing that none was priuie to <hi>Angelicaes</hi> being there but the King, that they made no doubt but that he was sent by him: but would not trust him, vntill they had

consulted with the rest of their fellowes, vnto whome they declared the truth of all hee had tolde them, who in generall they admitted him to their societie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> thought himselfe most happie to haue attayned this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie: Where likewise hee behaued himselfe most carefully, selling them that hee had a message of secrecie to declare to her from the King, which they made no doubt of, nor neuer denyed. When he spied his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test opportunitie, which was, when <hi>Angelica</hi> was walking alone in a priuate Garden, being all the libertie she hadde, and the Eunuches were gone to disporte themselues, and had put him alone in trust with the Key that conducted to her Chamber, he vnlocked the doore, and shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same againe, he came to her Chamber; Where hee durst not be so bolde as enter before he had knockt. <hi>Anna</hi> being alone in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hearing one knocke, came to the doore: and espying <hi>Parismenos</hi> in Armor with his sword gyrt to his side (which he neuer left off, being in euery point armed but his head) maruelled what he shuld be: to whom he saide. Faire Damzell, maruell not to sée mee in Armor, which shall neuer offend you, but still be imployed in your defence. I haue knockt, presuming no further without licence: the cause of my comming is, to deliuer a message vnto the Ladie <hi>Angelica</hi> from <hi>Marcellus.</hi> All this time <hi>Anna</hi> had diligently behelde him; perswading her selfe, shee had séene him before, that she made him this answere.

                     <p>Then she brought him downe a paire of staires, into a Garden where <hi>Angelica</hi> was: Who sate at the further ende thereof, in a most heauie and discomfortabie sort, séeming to be quite giuen ouer to sorrowe, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning herelbowe vpon her Kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Assoone as hee had ended those fewe Words, she saide: Are not you the <hi>Knight of Fame?</hi> I am the same most deere Ladie (quoth he:) With that her hart leapt for ioy, and she tooke him most louingly by the hand, desiring him to arise, saying: I am glad to see you againe; Which I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red I should neuer haue done. Then presently procured by ioy for his sight, and griefe to thinke of her owne bondage, a flood of Cristall teares issued from her eyes: Which attainted her heart with extreame griefe, that he stood like a man sencelesse, and confounded in his thoughts: and such Passions opprest his heart, that she was scarce able to vpholde her selfe from falling, which caused the Water with violence drawne from his manly heart, stand in his eyes: Which neuer before by any accident were absent: and seeing her in that wofull estate, could not chuse but folde his arme with a fearfull touch about her slender-Waste, to vphold her, whilest <hi>Anna</hi> ran for some comfortable-Water to reuiue her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: but comming to her selfe againe, shee leant her head in his bosome: Who put his hand betwixt her precious Temples, to keepe it from tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his colde and hard Armour, vttering these speeches.</p>
                     <p>Oh how vnfortunate am I, that by my disquiet haue procured you this disquiet; but before he could say more, she answered: But were you hence, my griefe would be far greater. It is not your presence hath done this, but my owne hearts cares, that are still allotted to be my greatest comfort: but thinke your selfe most Welcome to me, and your presence more delightfull then any others whatsoeuer. Most vertuous Ladie (qd. hee) your kindnesse is so farre beyond my desert, that I knowe my selfe altogether vnable to render sufficient thankes, for which I haue beene often made acquainted withall, by the Worthie <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and now finde kindely ratified by your owne heauenly voyce: Which yeeld me that vndeserued fauour as shall binde me in all dutifull bonds of seruice to command.

Most swéete Ladie (qd. he) if I prooue not thankfull, Heauens graunt my good déeds may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with ill: If I remaine not euerlastingly true, let comfort hate my soule, the earth denounce my body, &amp; terror afflict my conscience: if

Gentle Knight (quoth she) your words I do constantly beleeue: therefore be you assured likewise: of my resolution, which is to rest my selfe wholely vpon your vertues, with that they parted so pure a maiden kisse betwixt them, being the first that euer she had giuen or receiued, that both their heartes sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to tenterchange the others place, and to part from their louing brest with a soft breathing sigh, more swéete then if all the vnited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes in the world had bene met betwixt their rostate lips. By this time <hi>Anna</hi> was returned, hauing spent her labour in vaine, for that <hi>Angelica</hi> was safe. Then <hi>Parismenos</hi> taking her by the arme, led her vp into her lodging, which when he had done, <hi>Angelica</hi> desired him to declare by what meanes he had attained that liberty to come to her. And he said, I am amongst the rest, one of your kéepers: for behold I haue the key that alone co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducteth to your lodging: the Eunuches haue put me in trust withall, who are now gone about some recreation they haue in hand: then he declared vnto her the truth of all, and of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> policie, and how he had caused <hi>Dulcia</hi> to supply her roome at the Court, who was of euery degree taken for her selfe. <hi>Angelica</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his report, forced a smile from her cheareful hart, which she had not done many a day before.

My deare knight (quoth she) I reioice to heare that you haue found your princely parents. But yet I would you had kept the same from my knowledge as yet, because that you might haue had tryall of my good will in your vnknowne estate, in which you were as deare to me, as you shall be if you were the highest Monarch in the world. But how happie should I be, if I might in quiet enioy your presence, which I know not how you will effect.

                     <p>Thus continued he amongst them some three daies, in which time be came often to <hi>Angelica,</hi> and had conference with her: at last his turne came, that he must both watch with one of the Eunuches, and also at the Castle entrance, where likewise, neuer but two kept the watch, which fell out according to <hi>Parismenos</hi> desire: whose hart was much troubled to effect this businesse, deuising how he should bee rid
<pb facs="tcp:16915:211"/>
of his two fellowes, the Eunuch, and the other, that kept the entrance, being vnwilling to be estéemed a murderer, his handes being yet neuer guiltie of bloud: At last his desire to get <hi>Angelica</hi> from thence ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came that care, and hee resolued rather to be their Exectuioner, then be disappointed of his intent: When the time that hée should take his place to Watch was come, and hée and the Eunuch alone, the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone to theyr Lodging. <hi>Parismenos</hi> being in talke with the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, suddenly mufflled him in his Gowne, so close, that none could heare him crie, and thrust his Sword quite through him, which he did with such expedition, that his fellowes neuer heard theyr noyse: And taking the Key from him, tooke him vnder his arme, and floong him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a darke corner of the Tower. When hée had done this, he hasted to his other place of charge: Where when he came, he found his fellow Watchman staying for him, but fast asléepe, with the Keyes of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle gate lying by him: Whom <hi>Parismenos</hi> caught in his armes, and before he could recouer his sences, threw him from the Battlements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lake, where he was drowned: Which done, hee went backe to <hi>Angelicaes</hi> Chamber, and opening the doore, entred in, and found <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> in her bad fast a sléepe; Whom was in minde at the first to haue awaked her, but beholding her in so swéete a slumber, the awfull regard he bare to her would not suffer him to be so bolde, but still hee stoode by her a good space, being desirous to awake her, yet fearfull to disturbe her quiet rest: at last <hi>Anna</hi> awaked, who continually was her Bedfellow. Who séeing <hi>Parismenos</hi> in the Chamber, at that vnseasonable houre, styrring her selfe to speake to him, awaked <hi>Angelica,</hi> who likewise ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting her eye suddenly on him, was somewhat agast at his being there, but he kneeling downe at her Beds-side, saide: Pardon me I beséeche you this boldnesse: now is the time that you may depart, and without any let or molestation, For that my selfe haue alone the keeping of the entrance into this Tower.</p>

After they were out of the thamber he lockt the doore againe, and tooke the key with him: and from thence, let her downe to the Tower gate: and being without, fast lockt the same againe after them. And being quite without the compasse of the Tower, <hi>Angelicaes</hi> heart séemed to leape within her for ioy, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in most kinde sort, whither hée would conuey her, for (quoth she) if I should be taken againe, and come to <hi>Maximus</hi> presence, my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and griefe would be more then I am able to expresse.

they hadde it not, then beganne a corontuersie amongst them, enquiring who it was that came out last, but the truth thereof they could not learne, that they began to suspect each other, and that she that had the key had lost the same, and would not be knowne thereof: that at last they began to knocke first softly, and then hard, but none made answere, which draue them all into an extreame perplexitie, and with much ado, to rid themselues of that fear, they got vpon the doore, where at there comming they could not finde <hi>Angelica,</hi> but found some of her ornaments cast in the middest of the floore: that then with wringing their hands, tearing their haire, and renting their ornaments, they made such an outcrie and exclamation, that all the court rung thereof: which caused the Queene, the Nobles and almost all the whole court gather to that place, where the Queene being come, and knowing the cause of their sorrow sat down amongst them, opprest with care, and vttered these speeches: Peace, peace, giue ouer this vaine lamentation, for you know not for whom you mourne, it was not <hi>Angelica</hi> you had the custodie of, therefore cease your laments, and giue me leaue to mourne, that haue iust cause: who am a partie of all these woes, that at once haue lost the company of both my deare children, and all procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Maximus</hi> misdoubt, who left <hi>Angelica</hi> in the maiden Tower, who is stolen from thence, and now my sonne <hi>Marcellus</hi> with <hi>Dulcia</hi> is likewise fled.

                        <hi>Maximus</hi> was so enraged with his spéeches, that hee aunswered: What madnes doth possesse thy minde, that standest vpon such termes of resistance, when thou seest thousands of Armed Souldiers to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe thy life? thinkest thou with boasting spéeches to auoid my displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and disappoint my reuenge? no, wert thou the greatest Potentate in the World, thou couldest not escape my hands: With that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Knights to apprehend him by force; Who presently began to enter vpon him, but hee (by reason of the narrownesse of the Way) stoode in his owne Defence, and flewe the first that came; and after him another, and behaued himselfe so couragiously, that which of them first entred, first dyed: and had they all assayed to enter that way, he would haue slaine them all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcellus</hi> séeing what a mischiefe this slaughter might bréede, and withall, knowing that it was impossible for them any way to escape, but rather to increase <hi>Maximus</hi> to more desire of reuenge, stept betwéen <hi>Parismenos</hi> and the <hi>Getulians:</hi> Who knowing him, would not offer a blow at him, whilest hee spake to <hi>Parismenos,</hi> desiring him to be ruled by him: Who likewise considered that in this extremitie it was best to yéelde, for there was no hope of escape, therfore he agréed to doo according to his direction. <hi>Marcellus</hi> then vpon his knée, submitted himself to his Father. By this time the <hi>Getulians</hi> had beaten downe a great part of the Chappell, and rushed violently vpon <hi>Parismenos:</hi> Who disdained to be forced to yéeld, before they could ouercome him, sent many of their ghosts to hell, but in the ende by their multitude, hee was so thronged,
<pb facs="tcp:16915:219"/>
that he could not lift his armes to strike another blow, and so was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to yéelde, whome <hi>Maximus</hi> commaunded to be first bound.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> seeing this, with wéeping eyes humbled her selfe vpon her knee to her Father, and saide; I beseech your Maiestie vse that Knight honourablie, on whose safetie my life dependeth: More she would haue said, but <hi>Maximus</hi> cut her off with these spéeches; Poore, shamelesse, and disobedient creature, Pleadest thou for him, and not rather for pardon for thy owne shamelesse déedes? Holde thy tongue: for I will not heare thée speake a Word more. With that hee commaunded them all to be apprehended, and so he departed with them to the Court: first impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and Gyuing him withboltes and fetters of Iron, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting him into a most leathsome, stinking, and darke Dungeon. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> he caused likewise to be discrobed of her Ornaments, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Prison, with <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Dulcia,</hi> vntill they had more leysure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermine of them. <hi>Marcellus</hi> at the instant intreaties of the Quéene and Nobles, he did not Imprison, but with many rebukes and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches banisht him his presence: vowing if that euer he came in his sight, he should loose his head.</p>
                     <p>To rehearse the seuerall complaintes <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Dulcia</hi> made, would bee tedious to reccount, and too grieuous to recite, for they were such as would force salte teares from Tyrants eyes, pierce the stonie Rockes, and mollifie the hardened-Hearts of the most rude, cruell, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and inhumane monsters in the whole Worlde, being hardly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, scantly Dieted, and badly Lodged: That <hi>Maximus</hi> often hearing theyr plaints, pittied their Laments, yet therewith was rather drawne to more seueritie, then any way mollified.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> misery likewise, was nothing inferiour to theyrs, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ten times worse, being alone (they hauing the benefit of each others company: which is a great comfort in miserie) without light, for the Uault or Dungion whereinto he was thrust, had not so much as a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, where through any light appeared, being large and wide, far from any company, that he could not heare any creatures voyce, hauing but once a day food, which was Bread and Water, and of that so little, that it would scarce preserue life: Clagd and ouerloden with the burdenous weight of Chaines and bolts: in which sort he continued many dayes, without hope euer to escape from that place: Where you may suppose, his cares were great, and his comforts small.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:219"/>
Many dayes being past, <hi>Maximus</hi> assembled all his Noble Péeres, and Estates of the Countrey togither, to determine what to doo with <hi>Parismenos,</hi> against whome many Accusations were layde, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the breache of their Lawes, especially that of <hi>Angelicaes</hi> Rape: Which was amongst them punished with death, and that so seuerely, as that none escaped; whom the King in open Audience condemned to dye the same death that theyr Lawes yeelded, which was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dulcia</hi> likewise they condemned to perpetuall imprisonment: but for the Kings children, by the Lawes, they were to stand at their Parents disposition.</p>
                     <p>This Newes was soone conueyed to <hi>Marcellus</hi> knowledge, which strooke an exceeding torment to his heart: Which rather then he would endure to sée, hée would execute his owne death desperately, to saue his Friend, that hee fared like a Madde-man, and wheresoeuer he became, hee made those that beheld him wonder, to sée him so altered in gesture, and so suddenly that hee quite forsooke the Court, and continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Lady <hi>Panoraes</hi> house, so secretly, that none knew what was become of him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hauing continued many daies in the loathsome dungeon, maruelling that he could heare no newes from <hi>Angelica,</hi> and also that <hi>Marcellus</hi> had forgotten to yéeld him comfort in his greatest extremity, thought that eyther they were imprisoned, or else that the King in his Furie, had executed some cruell reuenge vpon them. These cares on the one side were sufficient torments, and his harde imprisonment and cruell vsage on the other side, enough to kill the stoutest heart, that had he not bene preserued by admyrable and strange operation, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue endured those calamities. At last hee beganne to dispaire of all hopes, and suddenly to recall his Sences, and with more comfort to studie howe to release himselfe: And amongst many thousands of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises which came into his Fancie, he deuised how to entice the Keeper to come into the Dungeon, which hee thus contriued. The next time the Iaylor came to bring him his vsuall Dyet, he fained himselfe to bee excéedingly sicke, and groaned as though hee had gasped for his latest breath. The Iaylor hearing him make such moane, asked him what hee ayled. To whome <hi>Parismenos</hi> saide: Good Iaylor, the date of my life is now at an ende, so that I neuer looke to sée the day light againe, béeing of all men most vnfortunate, to ende my wretched life in this place, that might haue liued in great dignitie in mine own Countrey:
<pb facs="tcp:16915:220"/>
but now past hope of all comfort: onely to thée am I able to doo good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I die, I haue good store of Golde and Iewells about mée, which I will giue vnto thee, if thou wilt but doo thy endeuour to saue my life, for that I am yet in hope of his mercie: and withall, I will declare vnto thée, where thou shalt haue more Riches then thou wilt euer be able to spend. All this will I doo for thée, if thou wilt helpe me out of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable life, to yéelde me same of thy helpe, for that I am fallen, and am not able to rise. Manie other perswasions <hi>Parismenos</hi> vsed, which wrought so effectually with the Iaylor, that inticed with hope of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Wealth, and past feare of him that was so weake, hee opened the Dungion without any feare or doubt, (being thereto guided by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niue prouidence) and came to <hi>Parismenos;</hi> Who no sooner sawe him within reach of his armes, (retaining a most manly courage notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Weakenesse) gathering all his strength together, caught holde on him and ouerthrewe him, and getting vppon him with swifte crawling, for that he was not able to stand by reason of his Boltes, and hauing him vnder him, neuer left strugling and striuing with him, vntill he had strangled him. Then taking the Bunch of Keyes vp, hee loosened and vnlockt all the Bolts that were fastened to his legs, necke, and other parts of his bodie: Which when hee had done, prostrating himselfe vpon his Knées, he praised God for that happie successe: Then presently without delay, hee stript off all the Iaylors Apparell, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled himselfe therwith, casting his body into the further ende of the Dungion, and so went out, and locked the Dungion doore after him.</p>
                     <p>By this time it began to be darke: Which was a meanes to further him in his escape, that in the Iaylors apparell he went into the Court, with the keyes at his gyrdle, and the Iaylors Fanchion, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ware about him, and met with diuers, passing by them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspition, and from thence hee got out at the Court-gates, beeing of euery one taken for the Iaylor.</p>

The Iaylors wife standing by, and seeing the two young Princes readie to sacrifice themselues, béeing assured that none but her selfe knewe the trueth, and that it rested onely in her to saue their liues, especially being touched with remorse, shee suddenly stept to the two young Princes, and said. Stay, stay, gentle young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and heare the truth of all. This dead bodie whom you suppose to be <hi>Parismenos,</hi> is the Iaylor, though cladde in his apparell, for that woorthie knight escaped out of the dungeon: if you beholde the corpes, you shall perceiue it to be the body of my husband. With that <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> started to the hearse, and casting off the cloath that couered the same, knew that it was not <hi>Parismenos,</hi> then casting away his sword, hée embraced <hi>Angelicas</hi> in his armes: who seeing the truth of all, and that <hi>Parismenos</hi> was escaped, (with whome shee came of purpose to haue dyed) let fall the knife from foorth her hand, and casting downe her eyes to the earth, was cloathed by the Ladies that attended her. The king was so amazed with this newes, that hee stood like one sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: the King of <hi>Lybia,</hi> for shame of <hi>Angelicaes</hi> speeches, but his eyes vpon the earth with sadde countenance, and all the whole assembly of the beholders were confounded in their sences, and stood as men transformed into admyration.</p>
                     <p>Presently in the middest of this amazement, came a knight po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting with spéede, his countenance bewraying some tragicall report, who vttered these speeches. Most noble King, whilest you stand here, debating matters of small importance, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> haue destroyed thousands of your souldiers, who now runne vp and downe like men agast, for want of their Captaines, that all the fields are strewed with their dead bodies, the valleys staind with blood, and the drie ground is drunke therewith, our enemies armes are tired with slaughter, and wee compelled to flie for feare, with speed receiue this euill, or else the pryde of <hi>Natolia</hi> is lost.</p>

Then began a newe terror, <hi>Maximus,</hi> the King of <hi>Lybia, Santodelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doro, Pridamor,</hi> and all the Nobles of <hi>Natolia,</hi> hasted to the Campe, <hi>Marcellus</hi> ranne to get him Armour: the Queene, <hi>Angelica,</hi> and all the Ladies, went to a Tower to behold this Battell, most to sée the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians</hi> death, but <hi>Angelica</hi> to behold the valour of <hi>Parismus,</hi> who she heard was come to redeeme his Sonne <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and in some hope to sée him amongst them, her heart inwardly vttering many deuoted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations for the <hi>Bohemians</hi> Uictorie. <hi>Maximus</hi> and the rest, by this time were come to the Gates, where they met with thousands of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, flying to saue theyr liues, whome they caused to turne backe, and beeing without the Gates, they could hardly passe, for the slaughtered carkasses of <hi>Moores, Natolians,</hi> and <hi>Lybians,</hi> that lay dead, and in the Campe they sawe such confused slaughters, and heard such grieuous cries, that it amazed theyr sences to sée the same; Here lay thousands flaine, there lay multitudes gasping for life, and bathing in their Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme blood: heere others lay mangled, with wide gaping-Woundes, there Horse and Men lay both dead togither: the <hi>Natolians</hi> flying, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> pursuing, and glutting their swords in blood.

And such slaughters were performed by <hi>Parismenos,</hi> beeing the first Battell that euer hee Fought, that both <hi>Parismus,</hi> and all that sawe him, admired to sée the same, who had taken <hi>Pridamor</hi> Prisoner, and sent him to his Tent.</p>
                     <p>The Quéene and <hi>Angelica</hi> all this while behelde the Battell, the one

By this time the night beganne to approach, that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> wearie of sheadding their enemies blood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew them to their Tents, appoynting most diligent watch to be kept throughout the whole Campe.

The king of <hi>Lybia</hi> and <hi>Santodelodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> stayed in theyr Tents in the Field. <hi>Angelica</hi> was returned to her chamber very sickly, by reason of the ouermuch desperature, vexation and griefe she had endured that day, being yet more comforted in her heart with hope of <hi>Parismenos</hi> safetie, then she had bene many dayes before. <hi>Marcellus</hi> was returned to <hi>Panoraes</hi> house, tormenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with excéeding griefe for <hi>Dulcias</hi> absence, fearing that she was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, that hée entred into that kinde of lamentation, that <hi>Panora</hi> was oftentimes in feare he would destroy himselfe. <hi>Dulcia</hi> was likewise all this while in the Campe with <hi>Parismenos,</hi> in very sorrowful estate, for <hi>Marcellus</hi> want.

and his posteritie, that it is not valor, but wilfulnesse, that maketh him resolute: theyr foes likewise, are so much weakened by the last slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we made amongst them, that if wee can giue them another sudden Onset, they will be vtterly dismayed: Besides, the Kings eldest sonne <hi>Marc,</hi> is my deare Friend, on whose faith and fidelitie, I durst repose my life: Who if he could attaine the Cittie, would be ready to aide vs; Therefore so pleasath you, let vs giue the Onset, when they are in their dead sléepe, which will bring such terror and amazement to their harts, that they will be like men amazed. <hi>Parismus</hi> hearing his Words, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked his counsell very well: And thus hee contriued this businesse, the Band should be diuided into thrée parts: the one to be vnder the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of himselfe, the other vnder <hi>Parismenos,</hi> and the third vnder <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus:</hi> Which was so secretly done, that the <hi>Getulians</hi> had not the least knowledge thereof.</p>
                     <p>About midnight, when all things were at silence, and the <hi>Getulians</hi> voyde of suspition, the <hi>Bohemians</hi> left theyr Tants, and <hi>Pollipus</hi> with his forces gaue the Onset, violently rushing into the <hi>Getulians</hi> Camp, on that side was next them. <hi>Parismenos</hi> went betwixt them and the Citie. And the Prince of <hi>Bohemia</hi> marched about with his forces and inuaded them on the backe side. The Getulians being then in their déepe sléepe, and without the least thought of any such inuasion, were so amazed with this assault, that they ranne vp and downe, some wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponlesse, and some halfe armed, and some with their swordes onely: and the Bohemians in the midst of them, making an excéeding slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

And being armed, they began to courage their amazed souldiers, with many comfortable spéeches, but the Bohemians were so thicke amongst them, and had so much disordered them, that some of them lost their liues as they were putting on their armour: others were slaughtered, euen whilest the sléepe were in their eyes: others strooken dead, as they were lifting their armes to strike the first blowe: and some slaine before they could recall their sences from amazement: there might one heare the dismall grones of murdred soules: there might one perceiue slaughter in her royaltie, and reuenge filleth his thirstie heart with blood: feare stood trembling in his right hew, terror appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Moores gastly lookes, and victory on the Bohemians swords.

The Prince behinde them, slaughtering some before they could looke backe. <hi>Pollipus</hi> before them with his furie, parting the soules from the bodies.

Then began the Cittizens to crie out, and ran with amazed terror: the Beacons were set on fire, the bels rung out with a confused noise, &amp; euery signe of amazement was made.

By this time <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> was come to the Court, fearing least the Souldiers should enter, and affreight the Quéene and <hi>Angelica,</hi> Where hee found <hi>Parismenos,</hi> though vnknowne, kéeping the Entrance, running at him most furis ously; To whom <hi>Parismenos</hi> saide: <hi>Marcellus</hi> holde thy hands, here is none but Friends.

And since your noble Sonne <hi>Parismenos</hi> for my sake, and my Fathers crueltie, hath endured manie miseries, and death too by all likelyhoods, I humbly desire you both, to remit all cause of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent conceiued against vs: and also to vouchsafe me that fauour, as if you knowe of his abode or safetie, you would comforte my heart with

With that an exceeding ouer-flowing of teares stopt the passage of her speeche, that for inward hearts sorrowe, she could not vtter a word more.</p>

When her eyes were full of teares, her heart of griefe, and all sadde to sée her sorrow, hée imbraced her in his armes. With that <hi>Marcellus</hi> ran vnto him for ioy, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were gladde, and the Nobles were contented with that pleasiing sight: and within fewe dayes cast aside all sorrow for <hi>Maximus</hi> death, because they had liued in disquiet during the time of his raigne: onely the Quéene rested still in heauinesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> hauing found her deare Knight, thought to staye no longer in that publicke assembly, but departed with <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismenos</hi> vnto her chamber. <hi>Parismenos</hi> and <hi>Pollipus</hi> accompained the Quéene, vsing many perswasions to comfort her. <hi>Marcellus</hi> then being with <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Parismenos,</hi> amongst many other spéeches, could not forgette <hi>Dulcia,</hi> on whom his thoughtes were continuallie bent, enduring great care for her: for that hée could by no meanes tell what was become of her, but feared that <hi>Maximus</hi> crueltie hadde sought her vntimely death, to whom <hi>Parismenos</hi> declared both where shee was, and how shee came thither. Then <hi>Marcellus</hi> heart was reuiued with ioye, and both hée and <hi>Angelica</hi> rested in exceding great content.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Sycheus, Camillus,</hi> and <hi>Remulus,</hi> were come to the Court, and <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Parismenos</hi> hearing thereof, went downe to welcome them.

The time for the Solemnization of the wedding bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appoyinted, and much sumptuous preparation made against the day: the Knights making ready their costly Armours and rich furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the triumph: the Ladies electing choyce of riche attires, and Ornaments to adore their beauties: Skaffolds making to behold the Tylt: and euery ones minde repleat with ioy. And in this sort was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one busie to honor these Nuptialls.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Getulians</hi> haue a custome, which is generally obserued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst them, that the Brides the day before their marriage, offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in <hi>Hymens</hi> Temple, whom the married folkes adore as a God.

The manner whereof is this: the Brides are adorned with rich Ornaments, and Crowned with Garlands of Flowers, and in that sort they go to the Temple, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by one Damozel, which carrieth their incense, which is balles of Frankensence, and Rosewater which themselues cast into the fire, that burneth vpon the Alter: Which done, <hi>Hymens</hi> Priest sayeth certaine prayers, and vseth to blesse them with many inuocations, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise done, the Bride continueth after that saying many praiers to <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> such as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Uotaries haue framed.

The doore being fastned by the Priest, the knights returned backe to the Court, and the Ladies departed vntill the time of her returne, which would be within thrée houres. The Priest wanting something that belonged to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, went into the house to fetch the same, where hée was no sooner entred, but he saw certaine knights, who suddainly laid hands on him. The Priest maruelling at this outrage, demaunded what they were, and therefore they came, to whom one of them said: We come for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> and her we will haue: and therefore speake but a word more and thou diest. With that one of the chiefest of them, demmaunded 2. of his seruants to kéepe him fast. Which done, he alone with one more, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Temple, where he found her staying for the Priest, <hi>Angelica</hi> séeing two Knights in Armour enter the Temple, was with that sight suddenly agast, fearing some trecherie, as indéed it fell out. For one of those knights came to <hi>Angelica,</hi> and told her, that she must goe with him. Which said: he tooke her by the hand to lead her out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: with that <hi>Anna</hi> began to shrike and cry out, but the other knights drawing foorth a dagger, swore that if she did offer to cry he would split his heart. <hi>Ang.</hi> well vnderstanding, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this vilanous act was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plotted by treacherie, thus said. Uillain, what outrage is this thou offerest, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will thou conuey me, what treason dost thou intend? Peace Lady (quoth he) for I must and will carrie you with me: neither make any resistance, for that which I came for, I will perform. Then he tooke her by the arme, and led her with force out of the Temple, into the Priests house, where she saw the Priest bound. And from out of his house they conueyed her into a Litter, which was close, that though shée made great lamentation, yet she could not be heard, and causing <hi>Anna</hi> to mount vp behinde a knight, they carried them away with the Priest: which they did so closely and with such expedition, that they escaped away vndsecried, by reason the Temple stood on the outside of the Citie.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:230"/>
Now this Knight that carried away <hi>Angelica,</hi> was the barbarous King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> named <hi>Irus,</hi> who long time before <hi>Parismenos</hi> arriuall in <hi>Getulia,</hi> had bin a sutor to <hi>Angelica,</hi> but was denied her by <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and departed from thence in a discontented vaine, who hauing soiourned many daies in <hi>Getulia,</hi> was well aquainted with their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, and hearing all that befallen in the Court, and of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> death, had manie daies awaited this opportunitie, well knowing before that she would come to <hi>Hymens</hi> Temple, to offer the acusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med sacrifice: came at the very instant and surprized them, and hauing past without suspition out of the suburbs of the Citie, hasted with all spéede hée could towards his countrie. And by the way as hée went, they entered at thicke wood, where <hi>Irus</hi> purposed to rest himselfe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which way to take, fearing to be surprised, for that he knew she should be soone mist: he had not stayed there long, but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried by certaine Knights that ltued in those woods: the cause of whose abode in that place shall be declared in the next Chapter: who hearing many lamentatons that <hi>Anna</hi> made, set vpon <hi>Irus</hi> whome they thought to be a personage of great estate, and by the richnesse of his Armour, which was on the skirts and sides enamelled and besette with rich stones, all ouer besette with bléeding hearts of Azure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Irus</hi> séeing himselfe thus beset, drew his sword in his defence, with that one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> companie blew a horne, wherewith there suddenly came out tenne in Armour, with the rest of their fellowes, equalling the number that was with <hi>Irus,</hi> betwéene whom began a most sincere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which continued so long, that there were some flaine of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Hymens</hi> Priest, in this time secretly stole away. And <hi>Angelica</hi> being in the Litter, looked out thereat, beholding that cruell fight, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling what those should be, that had stolen her from the Temple, and what those should be that sought to rescue her from them, but shée was so excéedingly opprest with terror, that her vitall sences were readie to yéeld vp her latest breath.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Irus</hi> Knights were most of them, slaine, and some gréeuously wounded, sauing <hi>Irus,</hi> who being a Knight of resolued cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, continued the combat with great valour against his assailliant, who seemed to be a Knight of exceeding courage, as he was indeed, and by his strength soone brought <hi>Irus</hi> within his mercie: who fearing his death, desired the Knight to holde his hand. Tell me then what thou

art (quoth he?) I will not (quoth he) tell thée my name, but I am of <hi>Tunis, Angelica</hi> hearing that word, gaue a sudden shrike, wherewith the Knight looking backe, beheld her most excéeding beautie, which was beautified with her Garland of flowers, that hée stoode as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed thereat, taking her rather to be a diuine, then a mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: that he said. What Lady is this, that is fearefull to heare thy name? It is (quoth he) <hi>Angelica:</hi> with that he fell downe for faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by effusion of blood. The Knight then stepping to <hi>Angelica,</hi> said: Lady, you now are mine by conquest: therrfore feare not his name, and goe with me, where you shall not want any thing that you will desire: with that he tooke her out of the Litter, and carried her and <hi>Anna</hi> away with him, and left <hi>Irus</hi> amongst his Knights almost wounded to death, but thrée of them hauing escaped that cruell massacre.</p>

In which place in times past, the Giant <hi>Malachus</hi> kept his secret abode. Into this place they brought <hi>Angelica,</hi> and comforting her with many faire spéeches, which were most sharpe to her hearing, refusing all comfort, denying to taste any foode which they offered her, and shunning their company, till at last, the chiefest of them saide.

                     <p>The great Preparation stood at a carelesse staye: neither going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards nor backwards, and all things in such a confused alteration; as though all things had bene quite giuen ouer to alteration: that euen the vainer sorte of people that had delight to sée shewes, were grieued to be frustrated of theyr desire.</p>

Many dayes after, continued <hi>Angelica</hi> in that Desart place, very daungerously sicke, so that <hi>Anna</hi> thought she could not by any meanes escape.</p>

                     <p>Hée was no sooner gone, but he was as soone mist at the Court, for whose absence great sorrow was made. And the next day many of his Knights went in search of him: From whome hee secretly shrowded himselfe, and sawe some of them: Whome had they séene him, they could not haue knowne him in that disguised Armour.</p>
                     <p>Thus manie dayes past in his search, but being still frustrated, they were all out of comfort, especially <hi>Parismus, Pollipus,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> were very sadde: but yet in hope of his safetie, although they knewe not where he were, for they were assured hee absented himselfe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

                     <p>Knight (quoth hee,) What art thou that offerest me this outrage? I knowe thée not, neyther haue I offended thée.

<pb facs="tcp:16915:234"/>
to this estate, espied another Knight comming out of the wood, which made him leaue <hi>Irus,</hi> and follow him, and ouertooke him at the woods side, to whome he saide: Knight, Who art thou? The Knight looking backe, seeing his swoord bloodie, and his Armour battered, seeming to haue come from some cruell skirmish, and disdaining at him to be so peremptorily examined, answered. What art thou that examinest me in this place?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> being exceedingly enraged before by the smart of some Wound he had before receiued, saide. I am one that will knowe what thou art before I leaue thée: and with that word, strooke at him.

Which done, <hi>Parismenos</hi> pulled off his Helmet, to see if he knewe him, but he knew him not.</p>

                     <p>Good Ladie cast aside all such feare, for <hi>Irus</hi> shall not so much ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule mee, as once to make me falsifie my Word: Neyther doo I thinke hee is of any such disposition; but if hee bée I care not: For what I haue promised I will vndoubtedly performe: and would haue done it before this time, but that your health would not permit the same.</p>
                     <p>Many other spéeches past betwéene them, till at last <hi>Iconius</hi> left her, and going to <hi>Irus,</hi> tolde him all the spéeches that had passed betwéene him and <hi>Angelica:</hi> Who by <hi>Iconins</hi> counsell dissembled his affection: and though he were often in <hi>Angelicaes</hi> company, he made no shew of such earnest Loue, yet carelesly made recitall of his former deuotions: Which he so cunningly dissembled, that <hi>Angelica</hi> began to rest in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Iconius</hi> fidelitie: and in a perswasion that <hi>Irus</hi> had also giuen ouer his hote Loue, and by that meanes she began to gather more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to her abated spirits; Which by reason of those great troubles she had past, and her late Sicknesse, were brought into a weake operation. And manie dayes after it was, before shee hadde recouered her health,

which <hi>Iconius</hi> still made his excuse, to the frustrating of her desired departure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> likewise all this time, wandred vp and downe the Desart, liuing poorely vpon hard and wilde fruite, and lying vpon the earth in his armor, that the haire which then begun to bud, had with a carelesse groweth shadowed some parte of his face, which was growne to a great length, and his complexion so much altered by care, that hée could hardly be knowne of those that were familiarlie acquainted with him before. In which time of his continuance in that place, hee had at seuerall times met with <hi>Iconius</hi> consorts, and slaine them because they refused to yéelde to him, and denied to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what they were, hauing taken an oath, and made a firme vow with <hi>Iconius</hi> before, not to reueale, which they Religiouslie kept, though in other matters they obserued no ciuilitie.

That can I not doo (quoth he) for the same is so ouerworne, olde, and battered, that neyther the colour nor other deuice therein can be discerned. Assuredly (quoth <hi>Iconius)</hi> it is this knight that hath slaine so many of our companie as wee haue found dead, which maketh mee thinke, that hee is some distressed knight, or banished as my selfe is, which maketh mee pittie his case, and could wish hee were with vs: which paraduenture might giue him some comfort.</p>
                     <p>Many other spéeches they had of him: beeing yet of no minde to séeke him out, which <hi>Iconius</hi> determined to doo afterwards.

                     <p>This behauiour hée vsed so long, that <hi>Angelica</hi> beganne to conceyue well of him, and to remitte some parte of her conceiued displeasure, and also her feare of his further crueltie: And many times <hi>Iconius</hi> and all the rest of their company, béeing out of the Caue, left <hi>Irus</hi> alone with <hi>Angelica,</hi> who behaued himselfe in such decent sort, and with such kinde behauiour towards her, that <hi>Angelica</hi> thought hée had vtterly abandoned his former rude and vnciuill behauiour.</p>

foolish, to liue so long in the sight of his beloued <hi>Angelica,</hi> without any hope of her sauour, and also began to perswade himselfe, that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius</hi> had some other intent then he made shewe of, which might disappoint him of obtaining her custodie, and then beganne to recall to his secret viewe her diuine perfections, which thought infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his heart with such desire, that the loue and earnest affection which hée had by <hi>Iconius</hi> good counsell restrained, burst out into an excéeding inflamed lust: that hée presently went into the place where <hi>Angelica</hi> was, who expected no other preffer of behauiour, but that which he had before vsed, suffered him to sit downe by her, and entered into communication with him as formerly she had done, but he hauing his minde meditating how to satifie his desart, behold her excéeding beautie, with a greedie eye, and deuoured the piercing power of her conquering beautie, with such desire, that it augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his affections, and set one fire his newe intended purpose, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the conquest of her loue, and the possession of her person, that bée seized his hand vpon hers, grasping the same sometimes strictly, and then againe playing with her dainty fingers, selling his eyes vpon hers, making a sad sigh a Prologue to his spéech, he said.</p>
                     <p>Most diuine Ladie, pardon me if I presume beyond the bounds of your fauourable license, to touch your precious hand: or if I enter into spéeches that may disagrée with your fancie, or shewe the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of my deuotion: but for that I relye vppon your benignitie, and haue long time by feare to be offensiue, rather indured inward and secret torment, then vpon presumption to procure you any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, haue concealed my loue, duty, and affection, to your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

                        <hi>Angelica</hi> hearing his speeches, would haue taken her hand from him, but he still held the same, whilest she answered: I had thought you had forgotten your former desire, &amp; would not haue troubled mee with the same: but especially now when you see I am not to make any change of the choise I haue already made. Therefore I should account it great wisedome in you, to abstaine from desiring that which you haue bene so often denied, and see so much vnlikelihood to obtaine: for would I now yeelde my selfe to please your fancie, I should dishononr my name, my stocke, and reape perpetuall ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and scandale to my selfe and you: and besides by my disloyaltie, breed euerlasting discord and war betwixt you and the noble Prince of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who is of such force and inuincible strength, that hee would wast your countrey, and neuer giue ouer vntill hee had wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted me out of your possession: therefore I pray you giue ouer your sute, which may (it obteined) bring so many adherent miseries and inconueniences, as you will soone repent you.

Which said, hauing her hand still in his, he pulled her to him suddenly, &amp; clasping her in his armes, he by his strength, tooke from her a swéete kisse: with which she was so much vexed, that with a suddaine start, she sproong from forth his armes, and fearing to be againe so surprised, would haue departed out of the roome, which he perceiuing, hauing armed himselfe with impudencie, ran after and caught her in his armes, &amp; by force brought her backe, whilest she strugled to get from him, but he being too strong for her, held her so fast y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she could not stir, but with chéekes as red as scarlet, said.

Euen so <hi>Irus</hi> stood readie to seize vpon her againe, his heart painting with striuing, and his vaines swolne with desire, no more mollified with her lamentations, then the hardest Adamant with the fall of soft snowe. And casting a most bitter countenance on <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who stood not far off, and only hindred his lust, he sudenly caught his dagger in his hand, and ranne after her to haue stabd her, which caused her with an excéeding outcrie to runne out of the roome, and he after her. And <hi>Angelica</hi> calling after him, stay good <hi>Irus,</hi> stay: and when he was returned, she as fast flying from him: And séeing <hi>Anna</hi> out of the roome, he caught holde of her, and pulled her to him, holding his dagger in his hand whilest shee lay trembling at his féete said; <hi>Angelica,</hi> my resolution is to obtaine thy loue, either by force or faire meanes: therefore giue consent, or I vowe I will neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist though it cost thy life. <hi>Angelica</hi> hearing his spéeches, said. <hi>Irus,</hi>

With that he turned himselfe from her, whilest she rose from the ground, she was no sooner vpon her féete but her sences failed her, and the liuely redde, faded out of her crimson chéekes: euen whilest <hi>Anna</hi> cried, helpe, helpe, shee sell downe in her armes dead: then <hi>Irus</hi> with <hi>Anna,</hi> did the best he could to recouer her, beginning to waxe madde with griefe, for within short space she began to drawe in her swéete breath againe, and lifting vp her eyes, with a gréeuous sigh, she said.

                     <p>I am (quoth he) a man as miserable as your selfe, subiect to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie misfortunes as your selfe, and euery way filled with discontent: if I should Name my selfe, you knowe mee not; hauing liued many

                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hauing well noted his spéeches, beganne to maruell what hee should bee, hearing him say, hee had liued manie yeares in that Desart, thought it good to sée his habitation, and therefore saide: Syr Knight, although I know not whether I may with security giue credite to your spéeches or no, yet if you will vouchsafe me such kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I will accept thereof, and for a time, contrarie to my purpose, take some ease.</p>
                     <p>Syr (quoth <hi>Iconius)</hi> you shall vppon my faithfull promise, rest voyde of treacherie, and be as secure as my selfe: These spéeches past, they departed towardes the Caue, continuing as they went in some conference; Where they arriued euen at such time as <hi>Angelica</hi> had ended her spéeches: And being entred, <hi>Iconius</hi> told <hi>Parismenos</hi> that was his habitation, whether he was Welcome: Then stepping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Angelicaes</hi> roome, he thought to haue found <hi>Irus</hi> there: but séeing her heauinesse, and in what sort both shee and <hi>Anna</hi> by her sate Wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, he came vnto her with kinde behauiour, demaunding her cause of sorrowe?

And looking with a fearfull countenance, hee asked what blood that was? With that <hi>Angelica</hi> cast downe her eyes, and <hi>Anna</hi> blusht, but hee being earnest to know, demanded againe, What blood it was? <hi>Anna</hi> then answered, It is some of <hi>Irus</hi> blood spilt by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Why (quoth he) did hee that déede? Because (quoth she) <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> would not giue consent to his wicked Lust. Where is he now (saide hee?)</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anna</hi> then, knowing her selfe guiltie, stoode as one confounded with feare: but at last reuiuing her selfe from her dumps, shee said: If I did murther him, I did it but to saue my owne life, and <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaes</hi> honour. With that hee was so enraged, that hee drue his Sword, and in a furie would haue slaine her, but that she with spéede ranne out of the roome, and hee after her, ready to strike her dead. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismenos</hi> hearing that noyse, and séeing <hi>Iconius</hi> pursuing the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell, being of a quicke conceit, euen as the blow was descending, stept vnder the Sword, and caught the blow: Which otherwise had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iconius</hi> being inraged, strooke another at him, vntill <hi>Parismenos</hi> drawing his Sworde, saide: Holde your hands, and knowe whome thou strikest, or I will gore my Sworde in thy heart blood. Pardon me good Knight (quoth hee) Rage made me forget my selfe. What Damozell is that (quoth <hi>Parismenos)</hi> you would haue slaine? It is (quoth hee) one that hath murthered my deare friend. By this time some of them had caught <hi>Anna,</hi> and brought her backe; Whom <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> offered againe to haue slaine, but that <hi>Parismenos</hi> hauing séene her countenance, knewe her: and staying <hi>Iconius</hi> againe, saide. Be not so rash without aduisement, to lay such violent handes on a sillie Damozell, and before you execute reuenge, be better aduised, and first knowe the truth of the fact she hath committed, and vpon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shée was vrged thereto.</p>
                     <p>I will not (quoth <hi>Iconius)</hi> followe your counsell, but now shee hauing confest the déede, I will be seuerely reuenged by her life, and nothing else shall make me satisfaction for his blood, which shee hath shead.</p>
                     <p>Discourteous Knight (qd. he) art thou voyde of humanitie, or doo I wish thée to doo any thing that disagreeth to reason? I sweare by Heauen, let but a haire of her head perish by thy accursed hand, and
<pb facs="tcp:16915:242"/>
thy death shall be the ransome: Here doe I stand in her defence, and therefore the prowdest of you all touch her, and if you dare. With that <hi>Iconius</hi> said: Doest thou requite my friendship in this sorte, to take part with my enimies? or tell me, Doost thou know that Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell, that thou standest so peremytorily in her defence? I doo nothing but that which euery Knight is bound vnto: Which is, to defend La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wrong: Neither doo I know this Damozell, but will defend her, for that shee is a Lady: vntill I may know, Whether you offer this outrage against her wrongfully, or by iust desert: Which once tryed, doo then what thou wilt with her. Then <hi>Iconius</hi> said. Damozel, tell me why thou sluest him? <hi>Anna</hi> made this answere: Hee offered vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to <hi>Angelica,</hi> and with his ponyard attempted to slay her: Who will tell you the truth of all. With that, they altogether went into the roome where <hi>Angelica</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> beholding her, hadde much a doo to withholde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from bewraying what hee was: but yet with constrained for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, be stood still, and heard her declare <hi>Irus</hi> Wicked behauiour, and in what manner she hadde wrought reuenge against him.</p>
                     <p>With that <hi>Iconius</hi> saide: Wicked Woman, couldest thou not haue wrought some other meanes to disappoint his intent, which I can hardly belieue, but that thou must murther him? Heauen nor Earth shall not throwde thée from my furie: For being the vntimely death of that louing, kinde, and couragious King, neither shall any thing but thy destruction appease my wrath, for the losse of my deare friende <hi>Irus.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hearing him name <hi>Irus,</hi> saide: Was it that treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and disloyall villaine, <hi>Irus,</hi> that slaue? Damozell thou hast well reuenged the wrongs he hath done me, vpon his own accursed head; and therefore will I be thy defence, and shielde thée from harme. For had I met him my selfe, I would haue done no lesse then thou haste: for he was the most dishonourable Knight that euer drewe breath.</p>
                     <p>But tell mee (quoth hee) to <hi>Iconius,</hi> What art thou that offerest such cowardly violence to resistlesse Ladies, and imprisonest them in such sort, and also bearest so disloyall a minde, as to vpholde him in his villanie?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iconius</hi> was so enraged with his Words, that hee saide: Base

Uillaine: Did I but lately take thée vp as a Runaway, and brought thée to my Cell, of pitty to succour thy distressed estate, and doest thou thus requite my kindenesse, to become my examiner?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hearing his spéeches, so much disdained them, that he let driue at him with irefull violent blowes, and with such furie, that he draue <hi>Iconius</hi> backwards out of the roome: and withall, gaue him so many Woundes, that had not some of his Associates stept to him, he had bene slaine: When thrée of them at once assailed <hi>Parismenos,</hi> but by his inuincible valour, first one of them, and then another lost their liues: Which <hi>Iconius</hi> séeing, he would very faine haue stayed to haue spoken to him, but his hart being set on reuenge, and desirous to haue the Possession of <hi>Angelica</hi> againe, followed his fight with such rigour, that he had well neere slaine <hi>Iconius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this time some of the other came in; Who séeing <hi>Iconius</hi> in such danger, by the valour of that one Knight, admired his Chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and stept to rescue him from his violence: Which when they had done, <hi>Iconius</hi> saide, Knight, tell mee what thou art, that knowing thy Name, I may know whome it is I resist? My name (quoth he) is <hi>Parismenos.</hi> With that <hi>Iconius</hi> floong away his sword, and said; Most honourable Knight, I yeeld my selfe to your mercie, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Name doo I honour, vowing that it is against my Will, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I offended you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> hearing his words, saide. And if thou béest my friente (quoth he) I am sorie, not that I met thée, but that I haue hurt thée: Which saide, hee entred into the Roome where <hi>Angelica</hi> was, and comming to her, not being able to vse any delay, but forced by desire to comfort her heart, by giuing her knowledge of his safetie, pulling off his Helmet, that she might behold his face, he saide. My deare La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <hi>Angelica,</hi> behold your poore Friende <hi>Parismenos. Angelica</hi> then knowing him with a modest behauiour, clasping, her Arms about his necke, and sealed a number of swéete kisses vpon his Lippes: Whth done, and withdrawing her armes againe, her Eyes melted into a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of teares, and afterwards saide; Welcome my deare Lorde <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismenos,</hi> ordeyned yet to be my blisse. Well haue I now preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against calamitie, for your sight hath banisht him my brest: how miserable and daungerous was my Estate once this day: and how

happie, and tenne thousand times blest am I by your presence? If you doo account your selfe happie by my presence (quoth hee) for euer shall you be happie, for neuer will I depart from your sight. But ten thousand times more then happie doe I account my selfe to bee so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of you, that haue neuer deserued such fauour, but by my euill Fortunes haue brought you into these calamities. Nay, good <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos</hi> say not so: for not you, but my vnluckie Destinies haue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained me to some forrow, but in the ende haue repaide mee double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde with swéete content.</p>
                     <p>In these and such like spéeches, did they expresse their ioyes, for eache others presence and preseruation, till <hi>Parismenos</hi> buckling on his Helmet againe, went out to sée whether <hi>Iconius</hi> did pretend any treacherie against him, but him he found vnarmed, and his knightes dressing his Wounds: and séeing <hi>Parismenos</hi> still armed (as fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to disarme himselfe) he gaue him such assurance of quiet, both by his owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Most diuine Ladie, I beséeche you pardon my offence, I confesse I loued <hi>Irus</hi> well, because hee was my deare friende, and finding no such misbehauiour in him, since I first knew him, I could not belieue her report, vntill I saw you iustifie the same, and for amends, I offer my selfe to be at your disposition: desiring you to remitte my proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red offence for <hi>Irus</hi> death: And withall, I beséech you make no doubt of my good meaning; For that I haue bent my whole indeuors, with truth to be at your commaund: Neyther harbour any further conceit of violence to be offered you in this place.</p>

                     <p>My Lord (said hée) let that be my charge, and so please you, I will depart to put the same in execution presently, and you in the meane time may remaine with the Princesse, and be assured of my fidelitie, for heauens graunt my ouerthrow, if I deale not faithfullie: with that he departed, and <hi>Parismenos</hi> returned to <hi>Angelica,</hi> spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the time with her in great content, vntill <hi>Iconius</hi> returne.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:16915:245"/>
Earely the next morning, <hi>Iconius</hi> returned to the Desart, and certified <hi>Parismenos</hi> of that which hée had done, which was this: There was then in the harbor, a ship of <hi>Italie,</hi> that was readie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part towards that Countrey, vnder the gouernment of <hi>Theoretus,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Marchant, with whom <hi>Iconius</hi> had agéed for their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, not telling him what they were that should goe with him, and withall, promised him to returne that forenoone, or not at all. <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos</hi> hearing his spéeches, was excéedingly glad thereof, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made <hi>Angelica</hi> acquainted therewith, who most willingly gaue her consent: and presently they departed towards the Hauen, being in all but eight persons. And comming to the ship, they were kindly receiued of <hi>Theoretus</hi> the Maister. Who hauing sped his voiage, and hauing no other thing to stay for, the winde seruing, hoysed sayle, and with a merry gale, they launched into the déepe. <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos</hi> comming to <hi>Theoretus,</hi> demaunded which was the nearest course for <hi>Germanie,</hi> for that he was bound thither? Sir (quoth he) if it so please you, after I haue landed in <hi>Italie,</hi> and dispatched some businesse I haue there importance, I will be then ready to conuey you to the nearest Hauen that lieth towards these parts, so that you will content me for my voiage,</p>
                     <p>My friend (quoth <hi>Parismenos)</hi> if thou wilt do me this friendship, I will content thée to the vttermost of thy demaund. Then hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the place where <hi>Angelica</hi> was, comforting her with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red trust of a happie and spéedie voiage.</p>
                     <p>Many daies they continued on their course with prosperous successe, till <hi>Teoretus</hi> assured them hée was within two daies Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Italie,</hi> where accordingly he arriued, where <hi>Parismenos</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> refreshed themselues, vntill <hi>Theoretus</hi> had ended all his businesse, and was growing to a composition with <hi>Parismenos.</hi> It fortuned that there was then in the place where they arriued, a Knight of <hi>Slauonia,</hi> named <hi>Arenus,</hi> who had secretly beheld <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicas</hi> beawtie, and was so surprised therewith, that he beganne to deuise what meanes to vse to possesse her, and hearing that they were bound for <hi>Germanie,</hi> and supposing <hi>Parismenos</hi> had béene her husband, hée vsed the more expedition, his dsire béeing growne to that extremitie, in the small time of their abode, that he thought it
<pb facs="tcp:16915:245"/>
impossible for him to liue without the fruition thereof. And often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times growing into conference with <hi>Theoretus,</hi> hée vnderstood the trueth of all by his report. And <hi>Arenus</hi> finding some hope to bring him to condiscend to his practise, vpon a time hée begaune to commune with him, and in the end concluded with him for a summe of money, to conuey them for him into what place hée would. With whom <hi>Arenus</hi> dealt so couningly and so strictly, that he bound him by many oathes to performe the same: which hée for greedinesse of the summe of money, was most resolutely determined to doo.</p>
                     <p>Now the time of departure being come, <hi>Theoretus</hi> (with a dissembling countenance colouring his intended villanie) came to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismenos,</hi> and tolde him that his businesse was now ended, and the winde fitly serued for their departure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> béeing glad thereof, and hauing before agréed with him for the price of his passage, brought the Princesse a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Parismenos</hi> little suspecting their drift, accepted of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and vsed him kindly. <hi>Arenus</hi> put on such an outward shew of vertue, and framed himselfe to such a kinde of behauiour, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismenos</hi> grew into great good liking of him, and into such familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that he tolde him what he was.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arenus</hi> hearing that he was sonne to <hi>Parismus,</hi> then grewe into protestations of reuerence and duty that hée bare to him, and into many such other like vowes of dutifull regard, that <hi>Parisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> related to him the whole summe of his estato, and what the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Angelica</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>And some two daies they past in this sort: <hi>Parismenos</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> with a ioyfull heart going towards their miserie, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing misdoubting <hi>Theoretus</hi> treacherie, thought themselues say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling toward <hi>Germany,</hi> when indeede they were a quite contrary way. When suddenly an excéeding tempest arose, and the windes began to blow and rage exceeedingly, the raine began to fall in such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that the shippe was readie to be drenched with the same. Which cruell Tempest continued for the space of two dayes and two nights, in that most raging and extreame sort, that there wax none

but expected present destruction: then began <hi>Parismenos</hi> to curse himselfe, for leauing the country of <hi>Natolia:</hi> and committing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the mercy of the seas, of whose fury he had before tasted. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> was in great feare of her life: <hi>Theoretus</hi> conscience began to accuse him of villanie: and <hi>Arenus</hi> to repent his treacherie: &amp; whilest they were in this extremitie of feare, the ship where in they were, was by violence driuen vpon a Rock, and there split in sunder, that they were all driuen to shift for their liues. <hi>Parismenos</hi> being amazed with this misfortune, yet had an especiall regard to the Princesse, whom he caught in his armes, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

And the rest, some drowned, and some by other admirable meanes preserued. When presently the storme began to cease, and the sea suddenly grew calme, It chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that a Fisherman was not farre off in harbor, who beheld this shipwracke: and with all spéed, séeing the storme ceased, hasted with his boat thitherwards: and first came to <hi>Parismenos</hi> and <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi> who euen then were readie to perish: for <hi>Angelica</hi> affrighted with the terror of death, being with feare and weakenesse not able to support her selfe on the péece of the broken shippe, was fallen off, whom <hi>Parismenos</hi> had held vp by her garments, being with euery little motion himselfe readie to ouerturne, and so to perish togither: to whom the Fisherman approached, and by the diuine prouidence came at that instant to preserue their harmelesse liues, and tooke them both into his Boate, and at <hi>Parismenos</hi> request, hasted to saue as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as he could possible of the rest. When presently <hi>Parismenos</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spied <hi>Anna</hi> tumbling vp from vnder the water, whom by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hée caught hold of, and drew vp to him: who by that shée had auoided abundance of water out of her mouth, beganne to reuiue: by this time, the Fisherman had gotten in <hi>Iconius</hi> and <hi>Theore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> both of them being in great daunger of death, or in a manner dead, but all the rest were quite drenched, and neither they nor any part of the shippe, to be séene: presently the Fisherman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed them to the shore, not farre from which place, was his house, whither likewise, after they had all recouered their sences, he brought them.

                        <hi>Parismenos</hi> glad of the fortunate escape, and séeing in what weake estate the Princesse was, desired the olde Fisherman and his wise, to do their vttermost to succour them in that distresse: and hauing a speciall regard of <hi>Angelica,</hi> hee with the olde woman named <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella,</hi> disrobed her of her wet ornaments, and the olde woman put her on drie Linuen, the best she had, and got her into a warme bed, which greatlie reuiued her abated sences. <hi>Dorella</hi> likewise had the like care of <hi>Anna,</hi> being of such a good and vertuous disposition, that of her owne pittifull inclination, shee would haue hazarded her life to succor them. <hi>Iconius</hi> by this time was perfectly come to his sences, but <hi>Theoretus</hi> still remained in great hazard of death.</p>

                     <p>And in this sorte they spent the Day, and at Night were conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to seuerall lodgings, <hi>Parismenos</hi> by <hi>Osirus,</hi> and diuers Knights, that soiourned in his Castle, and some that attended him. <hi>Angelica</hi> by <hi>Vdalla,</hi> and many other gallant Ladies and beautifull Damozels, with excéeding statelinesse, and courtesie.</p>
                     <p>And being alone by themselues, sauing that <hi>Anna</hi> was <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes</hi> bedfellow, which roome shee was not to resigne, till <hi>Parismenos</hi> should take possession of the same: Hee on the one side meditated on his happy Fortune to arriue in that place, and admired <hi>Osirus</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and was most of all affected with ioye, that <hi>Angelica</hi> was so kindly Welcommed to that strange place, being farre from her owne Friends and Countrey, that he did not onely reioyce at their kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for his owne parte, but especially for hers: Whose content hee wisht, and desired more then his owne; And withall, being now in <hi>Thessalie,</hi> his heart was so fully possest with desired content, that hee séemed not to lacke any thing hee desired, but onely to enioy <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes</hi> swéete, diuine, and pure Loues possession: Whith he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in assurance to enioy within short space.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> on the other side, spent some parte of the Night in communication with <hi>Anna:</hi> Which added a delight to her Sences, relating her misfortunas past, her happie preseruation, the Courtesie and gentle good nature shee founde in the Fisherman ane his Wife:
<pb facs="tcp:16915:249"/>
Which caused her to conceyue a perswasion by the kinde and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full entertainment shée hadde found in <hi>Osirus,</hi> that the <hi>Thessalians</hi> were people of an excéeding courteous disposition; Whereas many other People, both poore and Noble, were rude and barbarous, that she might thinke her selfe a thousand times blest, that shee had made choyse of so Honourable a Knight as <hi>Parismenos</hi> was, and one that was sprung from the Race of such noble Parents, and such naturall, kinde, and louing subiects, that her heart with these cogitations, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be absolutely happie, and her Sences were filled with such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull content, that in these heauenly Meditations, shee fell into a quiet and easefull rest.</p>
                     <p>The next norning <hi>Osirus</hi> and <hi>Vdalla</hi> were vp, readie to vse theyr best and vttermost indeuours, to expresse theyr liberall good Will? but the Princes kept theyr Beddes longer then vsuall: For that on the one side, they had spent much of the Night in the Meditations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaide: and on the other side, hauing bene so long time opprest with carefull cogitations, theyr Sences being now at rest, they slept with great quiet. And at such time as they were awaked, had all things in such Cerimonious kinde, and stately manner ministred vnto them, that they could not choose but admyre the same, being loath to motion theyr departure to the Court, least <hi>Osirus</hi> should thinke they did not accept of his kinde entertainment.</p>
                     <p>Whilest all remained in this great delight in <hi>Osirus</hi> Castle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port had blazed into the hearing of diuers of the Nobles and knights of the Kings Court, the Ioy and great Feasting was kept by <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> Which was made knowne in such sort, that they were assured some great Personages were arriued there, but none knewe who they were, that this newes was so open in the Court, that it came to <hi>Dyonisius</hi> hearing: Who most of all maruelling thereat, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now fully recouered his health, determined for his Recreation after his long Sicknesse, onely with <hi>Parismus,</hi> and some fewe of his Knights, to progresse secretly to <hi>Osirus</hi> Castle, both to recreate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, to know what those should be he entertained, and especially, for that hee loued <hi>Osirus</hi> excéedingly well: Which determination hee made <hi>Parismus</hi> acquainted with, and the next day accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the same. (Which was the thirde day that <hi>Parismenos</hi> had
<pb facs="tcp:16915:250"/>
bine with <hi>Osirus.)</hi> And being arriued at the castle euen about noone, hee and <hi>Parismus</hi> entered, whom the Porter well knewe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <hi>Donisius</hi> (not suffering any of his seruants hee met, to giue <hi>Osirus</hi> knowledge of his approach) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Parismus</hi> still stayed with the rest of the knights without the doore, <hi>Osirus</hi> soone espyed <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and suddainelie starting from his seate, vppon his knee did his reuerence: <hi>Vdalla</hi> and the rest that knewe him did the like. Whilest <hi>Dionisius</hi> said: <hi>Osirus,</hi> you see a bolde guest comes without bidding, but it you had beene kinde, you would haue made mee pertaker of your mirth. <hi>Parismenos</hi> was so amazed, that a good while he could not tell how to behaue himselfe, but perceiuing that it was the King, hée with <hi>Angelica</hi> drewe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and humblie prostrated themselues before him vppon their knées, béeing vnable by the suddainnesse of their ioye to speake. <hi>Dionisius</hi> not knowing them, and maruelling to sée them knéele, was halfe astonisht, vntill <hi>Osirus</hi> to ridde him from that doubt, saide. My Lord this Knight is sonne to the Noble Prince <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismus.</hi> Before hée could say any more, or <hi>Dionisius</hi> once salute them, <hi>Parismus</hi> was entered, who at the first knewe <hi>Angelica,</hi> and by her his sonne, whom otherwise hée should not haue knowne, hée was so much altered, whose suddaine sight, so vnexpected, and so farre from his thought, and so contrarie to his expectation, and so impossible to his perswasion, made him tansformed into a kinde of admiration, whether it might be possible that it was they, or that it was some elusion: but <hi>Parismenos</hi> likewise espying him in such a studie, immediately rose from the ground, and vpon his knée did him reuerence, and <hi>Parismus</hi> embraced him with a most kinde, louing and ioyfull behauiour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Angelica</hi> likewise knowing him, bent her deuotions with all humble reuerence to shewe her loue and dutie, whilest hee raised her from the ground, and embraced her in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber armes, beeing vnable to expresse his ioye to see them there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> likewise embraced them with great kindenesse, and
<pb facs="tcp:16915:250"/>
Welcommed them with teares of ioy. Oftentimes folding <hi>Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menos</hi> in his armes with a louing behauiour, and holding <hi>Angelica</hi> by the hand, beeing loath to let the same goe, and vnable to expresse his inward ioy, that he, <hi>Parismus</hi> and all the rest, were possest with such content, as would aske a skillfull penne to describe.</p>
                     <p>Their welcomes, kinde embracings, gentle speeches, and other signes of contented ioy, were such as passeth my vttermost skill to relate, or decipher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dionisius</hi> then desired them to seate themselues againe at their banquet, and hee and <hi>Parismus</hi> would beare them companie: then they againe seated themselues and himselfe by <hi>Angelicas</hi> side, vsing her so kindly, so louingly, and so familiarly, and with such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding mirth, pleasantnesse, and merry countenance, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicas</hi> heart was possest with ioy thereat: <hi>Parismus</hi> admired the same, <hi>Parismenos</hi> reioyced thereat: And <hi>Osirus</hi> and <hi>Vdalla</hi> tooke exceeding ioy thereat, hauing not a long time seene him so pleasant.</p>
                     <p>They would haue wayted, but he commaunded them to sit downe and be merie. The Noble men that came with him, which was Lord <hi>Remus,</hi> and diuers others, hee commaunded to sit downe, vttering these speeches. My Noble Children, the great ioy I conceyue for your presence is such, that it filles my sences with exceeding content. and were <hi>Oliuia</hi> and <hi>Laurana</hi> here, I would make account this were the best, most pleasing, most contented, most royall, and delightfull day that euer befell: but since they are absent, let vs be merrie: <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> bidde vs Welcome, for we are all your Guests. <hi>Parismenos</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> Welcome into <hi>Thessalie:</hi> Welcome to your Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so exceedingly Welcom, as your hearts can wish. <hi>Parismus</hi> who would haue thought that these had bene with <hi>Osirus,</hi> what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Destinie hath brought them hither? Or how are they so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily met, to méete vs here?</p>
                     <p>Well, did but <hi>Oliuia</hi> and <hi>Laurana</hi> knowe of theyr being heere, they would not be absent. He had no sooner ended that word, but <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuia</hi> the Queene, and <hi>Laurana</hi> entred the Chamber (the news of his secret departure from the Court, and his intent being tolde to them, they followed him to <hi>Osirus</hi> Castle.) To whom <hi>Osirus</hi> saide.</p>

                     <p>I knowe that all here present are excéedingly glad for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of these two young Princes, then laying apart all salutations, which cannot suddenly be exprest, let vs once againe and this third time, seate our selues to this banquet, and leaue all other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies while afterwards, for w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But first let vs refresh our stomackes with <hi>Osirus</hi> costly cheare, and afterwards we will desire to know the occasion and manner of their arriuall into the Country, which was neuer absolutely happy before this time. Then they all seated themselues againe in great content. <hi>Dionisius</hi> not suffering <hi>Angelica</hi> to sit from him, but close by his side, betwixt them and the Queene, euery one expressing exceeding ioy for their vnexpected safetie and arriuall in the Country. After dinner was welnie ended, which was ouerpast with pleasurable content on all sides, and was performed by <hi>Osirus</hi> in great pompe, <hi>Parismus</hi> desired <hi>Parisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> to declare what misaduenture had befallen him, since his priuate departure from the Court at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> and by what occasion they arriued in the atplace.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Parismenos</hi> declared the truth of all, how he met with <hi>Angelica,</hi> of <hi>Irus</hi> death, <hi>Arenus</hi> and <hi>Theoretus</hi> treason, and of their preseruation by the Fisherman, which greatly delighted them all to heare. <hi>Dionisius</hi> then said, which is <hi>Iconius?</hi> Then <hi>Parismus</hi> called for <hi>Iconius,</hi> and he presently came: whom <hi>Dionisius, Paris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

and the rest, vsed most kindly. And the Fisherman and his wife, were by <hi>Dionisius</hi> highly rewarded, and afterwards promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to great dignitie.</p>
                     <p>Some two dayes they altogether stayed in <hi>Osirus</hi> Castle, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the time in exceeding mirth. And at last, with great Royaliie departed towards the Court at the Citie of <hi>Thoebes.</hi> Where there were infinite numbers of people with ioyfull hearts gathered togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to welcome them: expressing such ioy as is not to be described.

And after <hi>Dionisius</hi> was dead, <hi>Pairsmenos</hi> was Crowned King of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> and liued all his life time in great quiet and blisful content, with the faire <hi>Angelica:</hi> Increasing the honourable fame and dignite of the Kings of <hi>Thessalie:</hi> hauing one onely Sonne and a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
