         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT had been a matter of no great
difficulty to have preſented
you, inſtead of this ſhort Eſſay,
with a large Volume, if I had
either affected or deſigned, when I
firſt took my pen in hand, to have
written a full history of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Manners and Government of
the <hi>Turks,</hi> or had tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>moires with
accompts of things trivial and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
which have been ſaid too often
already and which are to be met
with in every little Relation. But
I was not in the leaſt tempted to
ſuch a piece of vanity and oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb facs="tcp:53701:4"/>
and indeed I thought it very
much beneath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne to do this; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when I reflected I was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Letters to an <hi>Excellent Perſon,</hi>
who by his ſtudies and travels, and
many honourable employments both
at home and in forrain parts had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a perfect knowledge of the
state of affairs, not only of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
but alſo of all other remoter
Countries; and who deſerved to be
treated with greater reſpect and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
by me eſpecially, that owe
the opportunity I gained of travelling
into the <hi>Levant</hi> to his moſt obliging
and effectual recommendation. So that
brevity was my choice, and I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
more ſollicitous and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to conſider what not then what
to write. That I have done what
I propoſed to my ſelf, and have made
good my pretenſions, neither my fears
nor my modeſty will permit me to
be over-confident: But I have this,
I will not ſay to juſtifie, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
at leaſt my preſumption and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs,
that if I had known theſe
things to have been ſatisfactorily
<pb facs="tcp:53701:4"/>
accompted for by others, I ſhould
not have troubled either my ſelf or
you. Theſe accompts, which upon
my return home to <hi>Oxon</hi> I publiſhed
there in <hi>Latine,</hi> I am in a manner
neceſſitated to tranſlate into <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
tho with ſome few enlargements, to
prevent the doing of it by another,
which I had juſt reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
For a worthy perſon, who has
often condeſcended to this kind of
drudgery for the publick benefit,
was ſo juſt and civil, as to ask my
leave to do it; which I did not
think fit to grant: but whether for
the better or the worſe I must not
ſay.</p>
            <p>If the thread of a <hi>Church-man</hi>
be perceived to run through the
whole Relation, I hope this will be
ſo far from being a juſt exception or
prejudice to it, that it may gain
ſome little credit and reputation
with you upon that accompt; if
not the performance, the deſign at
leaſt, I eaſily perſwade my ſelf will
not be diſallowed. It is not only to
gratifie your curioſity, but to ſerve
<pb facs="tcp:53701:5"/>
you in better and nobler ends;
whereof this is the chiefest, that
being more and more convinced by
ſuch kind of relations, of the brutiſh
ignorance and horrid barbarouſneſs
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and of the dotages
and follies of their worſhip, you may
the more thankfully and ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon that most bleſſed and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
providence, which has caſt
your lot in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and in a
Countrey eſpecially, where the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Doctrine</hi> is profest in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
purity and integrity, and
where civility and learning, and all
ingenuous Arts flouriſh, and are in
their heigth and perfection.</p>
            <p>The accompt of my voyage to the
<hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> all but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and end, I wrote in <hi>Smyrna</hi> out
of my Diary, for the ſatisfaction of
my fellow-travellers, who were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to demand Copies of me. And I
hope what I have done in this kind
will not in the leaſt hinder any of
thoſe worthy and ingenious perſons,
who have made the ſame <hi>tour</hi> before
or ſince, from publiſhing their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals:
<pb facs="tcp:53701:5"/>
this argument being capable
of continual enlargements, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the matter of <hi>Inſcriptions.</hi>
This would be of very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to learning, of which there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
poſſibly be a greater proof than
in thoſe marbles which were
brought out of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the <hi>leſſer
Asia</hi> at the expence of that great
man, <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> and
which by the moſt generous favour
of the illuſtrious, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of
<hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Earl Marſhal,</hi> now
ſerve to adorn the <hi>area</hi> about the
<hi>Theater</hi> at <hi>Oxon:</hi> and eſpecially the
<hi>Parian</hi> marble, which contains the
moſt famous Epochas of the ancient
<hi>Greeks,</hi> by the help of which many
difficulties in <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
have been cleared; as Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Lydiat,</hi> the right Reverend and
moſt profoundly learned, the preſent
<hi>Lord Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht
<hi>Sir John Marſham,</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> the learned Publiſher
of the <hi>Marmora Oxonienſia</hi> have
ſhewn in ſeveral instances. And of
what great uſe ſeveral other inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:53701:6"/>
are, for the adjuſting and
ſettling the accompts of time, and
rectifying the <hi>Faſti Conſulares,</hi> will
better appear, when the Reverend
and moſt judiciouſly learned Doctor
<hi>William Lloyd</hi> Dean of <hi>Bangor</hi> ſhall
think fit to publiſh thoſe things of
this kind, which he has been pleaſed to
ſhew me in his Collections. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
number of marbles ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
behind in thoſe parts, and
others are continually dug up, (the
erecting of theſe having been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the pride and gallantry of the
<hi>Greeks</hi>) and what might be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
upon no very hard terms, if
ſome excellent perſons would be at
the expence of enriching their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
with the ſpoils of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> I
have often lamented the miſfortune,
which drove me from <hi>Hierapolis</hi>
after the ſhort ſtay of two or three
hours, where I believe I could have
employed my ſelf for a week or fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
to very good purpoſe: and that
neither my neceſſary attendance npon
the Ambaſſador and the Nation, nor
my ſmall ſtock of money afterward,
<pb facs="tcp:53701:6"/>
when I was at liberty, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to travel to <hi>Nice, Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,
Ancyra, Iconium,</hi> and ſeveral
other places, where I heard were
numerous and famous ruines;
but eſpecially to <hi>Monte Santo,</hi> as
they call <hi>Mount Athos,</hi> to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Greek Manuſcripts.</hi> But I hope
other Travellers will be more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and better encouraged than I
have been, and will one day make
the world happy with their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
and receive the reward of
their generous adventures and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
when <hi>God</hi> ſhall reſtore
them to their native Countrey.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I have added a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which
I readily acknowledge to be far
from accurate and perfect, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
in the leaſt, when I was
upon the place, to have done any
ſuch thing; and therefore I content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my ſelf only to put down ſome
ſhort notices to relieve my memory.
I ſoon was made ſenſible, by paſſing
up and down the ſtreets of that great
City, that the ſcite and ſceleton, if I
<pb facs="tcp:53701:7"/>
may uſe the word, of the ancient
buildings only remains, the beauty
and glory of them being loſt, ſince
the <hi>Turks</hi> became Masters of it:
And as when I was at the <hi>Churches</hi>
(an idea of which they may eaſily
have, who have ſeen the Abbey of
<hi>Glaſtenbury</hi> or <hi>Thetford,</hi> or will
but call to mind the deplorable ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
of <hi>London</hi> after the diſmal fire)
ſo when I conſidered the preſent ſtate
and condition of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I
was oftentimes perplext and in
doubt, whether I was more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the piety and munificence of
thoſe, who raiſed ſuch ſtately and
glorious ſtructures, or the brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and barbarouſneſs of thoſe, who
pulled them down. But I ſoon laid
my hand upon my mouth, when I
further conſidered, that ſacriledge
had done the like to ſeveral goodly
houſes of Religion and Learning in
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and that it was wholly
owing to the miraculous providence
of <hi>God,</hi> who laid a reſtraint upon
the mad and impious zeal of ſome
of the prevailing faction in the late
<pb facs="tcp:53701:7"/>
times of uſurpation, (when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of the Church became a prey
to their covetouſneſſ) that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals,</hi>
which are the wonder of
all ingenious forrainers, and one of
the ſtanding glorys of <hi>England,</hi> had
not been laid waſt and levelled
with the ground, and turned into

renders neceſſary and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to their Government; or to
want of Diſcipline, for that in moſt
things is very exact, and agreeable
to the Laws and Rules of Polity,
which Cuſtom and Experience hath
eſtabliſhed as the grand ſupport
of their Empire; or to want of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Behaviour among themſelves,
for none can outwardly be more
reſpectful and ſubmiſſive, eſpecially
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53701:9"/>
to their Superiors, in whoſe power
it is to do them a miſchief, the fear
of which makes them guilty of moſt
baſe compliances: But to the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Pride and Scorn wherewith
they treat all the World beſides.</p>
            <p>Their Temper and Genius,<note place="margin">Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Learning.</note> the
Conſtitution of their Government,

enclining them to War, where
Valour and Merit are ſure to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
and have their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
They have neither leiſure
nor inclination to entertain the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Learning or the Civil Arts,
which take off the roughneſs and
wildneſs of nature, and render men
more agreeable in their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And though they are forced to
commend and admire the ingenuity
of the <hi>Western Chriſtians,</hi> when they
ſee any Mathematical Inſtrument,
curious Pictures, Map, or Sea-Charts,
or open the Leaves of any Printed
Book, or the like; yet they look upon
all this as a curioſity, that not only
may be ſpared, but what ought to be
carefully avoided, and kept out of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53701:9"/>
their Empire, as tending to ſoften
mens minds, and render them leſs
fit for Arms, which they look upon
as the beſt and trueſt end of life, to
enlarge their Greatneſs and their
Conqueſts.</p>
            <p>But it is not ſo much their want
of true and ingenuous Learning,
which makes them thus intractable
and rude to Strangers,<note place="margin">Hatred of all other Religions, which is</note> as a rooted
and inveterate prejudice againſt, and
hatred of all others who are of a
different Religion. It is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that where this principle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
and is look'd upon as a piece
of Religion and Duty, they who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it ſhould be guilty of any act
of kindneſs and humanity; except
when they are bribed to it with hope
of reward and gain, or forced to it

obligeth us to reſtrain and keep

and reproachful language, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when there is no provocation;
but the rude malice of the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſcorns to ſubmit to theſe general
rules of civility, who are ſo far from
being ſenſible of the indecency of it,
that they triumph and glory in it,
as if it were not only an act of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and gallantry, but a juſt proof
of their zeal, and moſt becoming
and worthy a <hi>Muſulman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hatred they are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to inſtil into their Children from
their very infancy,<note place="margin">of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</note> as a moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

I muſt profeſſ, it raiſed my

and with a fury above that of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
exclaim upon them, and not
satisfied with this, throw ſtones at
them, with a moſt ſtrange and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
concern, upbraiding them with
their infidelity, as if they had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nothing elſe from their Parents.</p>
            <p>This is the general civility of the

               <note place="margin">Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> who vouchſafe us no other

in their way does offend them, if

them to ſhew a higher degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

Domuz, you Hog,</hi> is the word; (the

diſorder, and gives their blood a new

abſtain. We are not yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at the height of their rudeneſs
and barbarity; this is not the worſt
reproach and abuſe they put upon
us; it is not enough they think to

In Cities, and places of Trade,<note place="margin">Chriſtians only ſecure in places of Trade;</note>
where Merchants reſide, there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
made by capitulations and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
accorded by the <hi>Grand Signor</hi>

the ſecurity of their perſons and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
which intereſt alone makes
them ſubmit to. For as dull and as
heavy as they are, they are mighty
ſenſible of the benefit and advantage
they receive by foreign Trade. They
themſelves not caring to traffick out
of their own Empire, either out of
a principle of pride, as if there were
more of ſtate in it, that all ſorts of
Merchandiſes are brought to their
doors, without their ſeeking or fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
or of lazineſs and fear, not
willing nor daring to undergo the
hazards and fatigues of Sea-voyages;
or for want of ſkill in the art of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
in which they are very
blockheads and bunglers, confeſſing,
that <hi>God</hi> has given both the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
and command of the waters to
the Chriſtians; all which added to
the natural dread and averſion they
have of the Sea, make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53701:12"/>

with the Trade of the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi>
ſailing for the moſt part <hi>terra terra,</hi>
or of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the great Scale

parts of <hi>Egypt</hi> which lye toward

moleſted in the one by the

down the <hi>Boryſthenes</hi> with their
Fleet of Boats, and thence coaſt all
along to the very mouth of the <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi>
as by the <hi>Malteſes</hi> in the
other. And I am induced to believe,
by arguments of very great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
that if the Trade of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
were wholly interrupted by
wars, and the Silk-trade particularly
diverted and turned out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
of the <hi>Turk,</hi> either by the
way of the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, or which
would be more feiſible, by lading
it at <hi>Gombroon,</hi> and ſo joined to the
<hi>Indian</hi> Trade, (both which projects
were mightily approved of by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
that victorious King of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
and great enemy of the <hi>Turks</hi>), to
avert ſo great a miſchief, they would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53701:12"/>
quickly vail their <hi>Turbants,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
from their high terms, and
quit their diſdainful and proud
thoughts, as if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> could
not live without their friendſhip,
and ſubmit to more advantageous
conditions of peace and commerce.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,<note place="margin">yet obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and abuſes,</note>
and the ſuperaddition of the
Law of Nations to that of common
nature and humanity, as if their
tongues lay not under the reſtraint
of an Edict, and Religion gave them
a licence to be rude, they do not
abſtain oftentimes from reviling <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi>

            <p>Here is not indulged the liberty

or ſhip'd for <hi>Tartary;</hi> and though
examples of ſuch violent ſeizures are

ſuch like fears, makes it neceſſary
to have the company and attendance
of a Souldier, which is neceſſary to
deſend one from the open aſſaults of
<hi>Turks,</hi> either ſpirited with Wine and
Rackee, or with the zeal they have
brought with them from <hi>Mecca,</hi>
(for theſe religious Pilgrims, who

whatever the deſign be, whether
only to affright, and to ſhew what
they would do, if their Emperor had
not forbid it; yet in ſuch a ſcuffle
the accident may prove very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and fatal too, and only this way
is to be provided againſt.</p>
            <p>Their prejudices lying ſo deep as

            <p>However,<note place="margin">as alſo the Habit of the Country, when they travel.</note> if curioſity carries one
twenty or thirty miles into the

and certain, (for it is uſual to ſeize

from their company, where there is
ſuch great probability of ſecuring
their prey, and of their being undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered),
unleſs he throws off his
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Habit, and puts himſelf
into that of the Country, and goes
armed and well attended. In places
where <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſeldom appear, they
are had in greater horror and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration;
and if they meet with any
civility, it is for the ſake of the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi>

whom they are afraid to diſplease;
though ſometimes the ill humour
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53701:14"/>

and peeviſhneſs, that the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
themſelves ſhall ſare the worſe
for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whom they wait
upon. I remember, when I was at
<hi>Sardes,</hi> not caring to lodg in the
<hi>Caravanſerai</hi> with our Horſes, we
employed our <hi>Janizaries</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
us a Lodging for a night or two
in any <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cottage, which the
barbarous people would not give
way to, (though they had the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a gratification above what
ſo ſlight a courteſie could poſſibly
merit) as ſoon as they underſtood
we were <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but rejected the
overture with a great deal of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and ſcorn, ſaying, <hi>that they
would upon no condition or reward
ſuffer their Houſes to be defiled by
Infidels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This opinion they generally bear
of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of, and behaviour toward the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </note> but they entertain a
far worſe of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and herein
they think they mightily oblige us,
and would have it taken not only
as an argument of their juſtice, but
of their good will, that they prefer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53701:14"/>
the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whoſe valor they have
ſo often experimented to their great
coſt, before them whom I found by
juſt and frequent obſervation they
eſteem as the baſest and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
people upon the face of
the Earth, and as a company of
pitiful and low-spirited wretches,
who dare do nothing that is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and brave, and worthy of men.
It is uſual with them to ſay, 'tis mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of great wonder to them, that
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who pretend to ſo
much wit and underſtanding, ſhould
believe the juſt and great <hi>God</hi> ſhould
give up a <hi>Prophet</hi> ſo famous for
the holineſs of life and miracles
as was their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> (for this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
they acknowledg as moſt due
to our <hi>B. Saviour</hi>) into the hands
of ſo vile a Nation as the <hi>Jews,</hi> to
be crucified; and therefore in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with their groſs conceptions,
which are no way capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, they
imagine, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> eſcaped out of
their hands, and was aſſumed private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into Heaven, and another very like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53701:15"/>
him in ſtature and ſhape, and the
other ſignatures of his body, ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
in his room, upon whom they
executed their utmoſt malice and
fury in putting him to ſo ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a death. They call them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
by the name <hi>Gephut;</hi> which
word is corrupted from the <hi>Arabick,</hi>
and though originally it might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
nothing but the name of that
people, yet now they uſe it in a
moſt diſgraceful and ignominious
ſenſe, as if there could not possibly
be a greater diſgrace or reproach
than the bare title of a <hi>Jew;</hi> tho
ſometimes for merriment ſake, and
to ſhew their ſcorn, they uſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix
ſome opprobrious term or other,
to make them more contemptible
and ridiculous. But when they grow
a little more ſerious, and recollect
themſelves ſomewhat, and change
their ſcorn into anger, they will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
them with their obſtinacy and
inſidelity in rejecting and disbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the holy <hi>Prophets</hi> ſent by <hi>God,</hi>
and particularly our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi>
whom they place next their falſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53701:15"/>
Prophet <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> are
very obnoxious to the inſolencies of
the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who oftentimes to
make themſelves merry, throw and
kick them to the ground, and pull
them by the Noſes and by the Ears.
Againſt which they dare not ſo much
as open their lips, for fear the ſport
ſhould by the leaſt ill word be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into fury and madneſs. And very
often, to do them the more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
when any Criminal has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the ſentence of death, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
hurry him away, and make
the firſt <hi>Jew,</hi> rich or poor, they can
light upon, walk with the Rope in
his hand, tyed about the neck of the
other, till they come to the next
Tree out of Town, and then hang
him. It is a great miſtake to think,
that the <hi>Turks</hi> admit them into their
<hi>Divans,</hi> or publick Councils, as if
they were privy to any of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns

but retains a <hi>Jew</hi> with him or
about him, whoſe only buſineſs is
to look to the expences of the Houſe,
and buy all things neceſſary, as
Cloaths, Proviſions, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Above all they retain an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
hatred of the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the <hi>Perſian</hi> greateſt.</note> though
they are their Brother <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
and pay a like reſpect and reverence
to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and embrace the
dotages, and follies, and impoſtures
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53701:16"/>
of it, with the ſame concern of zeal.
The original and fundamental diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is about the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> which
the <hi>Perſians</hi> contend to belong to
<hi>Ali,</hi> not only in right of his Wife
<hi>Phatima,</hi> who was Daughter of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet;</hi>
and by the laſt Will of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
himſelf, whoſe Favourite he
was; but alſo upon the account of
his Valour, and other perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies.
Agreeable to this opinion
they have of Him and his Title,
they exclaim upon <hi>Abu Beker, Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and <hi>Omer,</hi> who were ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Chiefs of the new <hi>Religion,</hi> as
meer Usurpers, and as Corrupters of
the holy Text; they are one great
argument and ſubject of the raillery
of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Poets, who make odd
and ridiculous repreſentations of
them; whereas the <hi>Turks</hi> look upon
them with all poſſible veneration,
eſteem them not only as the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but as the props and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of the <hi>Muſulman</hi> faith, and
their memories are ſo ſacred among
them, that their names are uſually
inſcribed upon the inſide of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53701:17"/>
greater <hi>Moſchs,</hi> as I have often took
notice of. This difference is height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by different interpretations of
ſome ambiguous Texts in their Law,
and by the introduction of different
Rites and Ceremonies in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worſhip, each fiercely accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the other of perverting the mind
of their <hi>Prophet,</hi> and of innovation.
Their diſputes and grudges, and
mutual cenſures and recriminations
have ſome ages ſince broke out into
ſuch quarrels and feuds, that ſeem
no way likely ever to be peiced up
and reconciled. If any diſcourse hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
concerning the Religion of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
the zeal wherewith the <hi>Turks</hi>
are preſently ſet on fire, does furniſh
them with ſufficient arguments of
reproach. A <hi>Perſian,</hi> they will tell
you, is a deſertor of the true faith,
and an Apoſtate; an Heretick, who
follows his own fancy, and rejects
the eſtablisht and ancient Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Religion; is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
as neglectful of thoſe waſhings,
which their Prophet requires as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
preparations to prayer; one
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53701:17"/>
who does not know how to ſay his
prayers as he ought, void of all ſenſe
of the true Religion; laſtly, a very
<hi>Infidel, kizel baſh Gaour, the Infidel
with the red head,</hi> alluding to the
<hi>Turbants</hi> or <hi>Shaſhes</hi> they wind about
their heads, which are uſually of
that colour; whereas the colour the
<hi>Turks</hi> moſt affect is white, except the
kinred and poſterity of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
whoſe ſpecial priviledge alone it is
to wear green, a colour they pretend
he moſt delighted in, and uſed to go
in when he was old; his name is
writ with that colour in the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However this animoſity might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
upon a Religious account, yet it
is mightily ſupported by intereſt,
and managed with a great deal of
dexterity and cunning by the <hi>Turks,</hi>
who cheriſh theſe evil opinions and
prejudices in the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Souldiers, eſpecially againſt
both <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Perſian,</hi> the two
extremes of their Empire confining
upon their Territories, and ſo eaſily
either find or take frequent occaſion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53701:18"/>
to quarrel and war with both. By
theſe arts they work upon the minds
of the Souldiers to a greater willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of undergoing the hardſhips of
war. With this politick Engine they
thruſt them upon any deſign, though
never ſo unlikely or deſperate. For
who is ſo cowardly and faint-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or ſo much in love with life, as
not to venture the loſs of it in the
cauſe of Religion, when the true
Faith either is in danger, or is to be
propagated; when they take up
Arms to chaſtize and puniſh Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Apoſtates; when they fight
for <hi>God,</hi> and the advancement of his
cauſe againſt the profeſt Enemies of
it? This perſwasion inſpires them with
deſperate and brutiſh valour, when
they turn their faces upon <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew
hereafter. And the ſame argument
they uſe as ſucceſſfully, when reaſon of
State or ambition oblige them to
make a War in <hi>Asia;</hi> a famous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of which we have in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> in the year of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
1638, by that warlike Emperor <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:53701:18"/>
who was preſent there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and not long after died of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
drinking of Wine, to the great
joy of <hi>Poland,</hi> which he threatned
to invade with his well-diſciplin'd
Troops, full fleſh'd with blood, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
to revenge the affront and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of his Brother <hi>Osman.</hi> For as
ſoon as an expedition into <hi>Perſia</hi>
was reſolv'd upon, and determin'd
in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the <hi>Church-men</hi> had
orders to ſound the alarum in their
Pulpits, for the better animating and
encouraging the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who
otherwiſe would have had no very
great mind to it. And they perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their part mighty well by their
popular and furious preachments,
telling them over and over, that the
<hi>Perſians</hi> had made a defection from
the true Faith; that they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the ſenſe of the Divine Law,
by their wicked and falſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and gloſſes; and how highly
they would deſerve of the great <hi>God</hi>
of Heaven and Earth, of <hi>Mahomet</hi>
his Prophet and Apoſtle, and of the
whole <hi>Muſulman</hi> Religion, if they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53701:19"/>
would fight ſtoutly. Every <hi>Moſch</hi>
rung with zealous exhortations to
fight for the cauſe of <hi>God,</hi> and the
Souldiers longed to be at it before
the time. And to keep firm their
good reſolutions, the <hi>Mufti,</hi> whoſe
ſentence and determination they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
as moſt ſacred and binding, and
little leſs than infallible, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from Court ſo to do, ſends forth
his <hi>Brief</hi> all the Empire over, (a
Copy of which in the original lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
I have laid up in that great
Repoſitory of all curious as well as
uſeful and neceſſary Learning, the
moſt famous <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library at
<hi>Oxon</hi>) wherein he thunders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the heads of the poor <hi>Perſians,</hi>
charging them with Apoſtacy. He
makes them guilty of damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
and Errors, which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to ſhew in ſeveral branches
and particularities; he ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
them accurſed of <hi>God,</hi> and
not worthy to live upon Earth, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
them that it is a meritorious
work, and what will be rewarded in
Paradiſe, to root them out, and more
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53701:19"/>
meritorious than if they deſtroyed
the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and not contented
with this peremptory ſentence, as
bloody and cruel as it is, but as if
it were too mild, he condemns them
to the pit of Hell, and very devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prays <hi>God,</hi> that there they may
ſerve for Aſſes, and be condemned
to the drudgery of carrying the
<hi>Jews</hi> upon their backs, not being
able to wiſh them a more vile or
more diſgraceful employment. Thus
extreme violent and deadly is their
hatred of Sects; and I would to <hi>God</hi>
the falſe Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> only
afforded inſtances of it.</p>
            <p>This contempt and diſesteem of
all others is the natural reſult of
the over-weening conceit and falſe
valuation they have of themſelves;<note place="margin">The proud behaviour of the <hi>Turks</hi> ariſing from a falſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their being Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</note>
they proudly ſtile their Port the
Refuge of the World; and fancy the
glory and majeſty of the <hi>Roman</hi> and
<hi>Greek</hi> Empire to be devolved upon
them by a moſt juſt right; and that
other Princes ſtand in awe of them,
and are no better than Tributaries,
and do them homage, becauſe they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53701:20"/>
judg it their intereſt to ſend their
Ambaſſadors and Miniſters to reſide
among them; cuſtom that had its
beginning from the too forward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
and condeſcension of thoſe
who courted the favour of the <hi>Grand
Signor,</hi> this way paſſing into right,
that no Ambaſſador can in the leaſt
aſſure himſelf of a civil reception,
except he bring his preſents along
with him, upon his arrival at the
Imperial City.</p>
            <p>The chief ground of this their
arrogance is a mighty confidence
and perſuasion,<note place="margin">and only in the right way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Salvation.</note> that they are the
choſen of <hi>God,</hi> to whom he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
his Will and his Law by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
the <hi>Seal of the Prophets,</hi> as
they ſtile him; that they are in the
right way which leads to Paradiſe,
while others wander in by-paths of
error, and conſequently are the only
true Believers (for ſo <hi>Muſulman</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies)
which is become the general
name,<note place="margin">Muſulman.</note> by which they diſtinguish
themſelves as <hi>Mahometans,</hi> of ſuch
a particular denomination from all
other Religions in the world. They
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53701:20"/>
are aſhamed of their <hi>Scythian</hi> origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
it does not comport with their
preſent grandeur, to look back and
remember what poor vagabond lives
their Anceſtors lead upon Mount
<hi>Imaus,</hi> how they wander'd to and
fro with their Goats and Kids, and
how not being able or willing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their poverty by their labour
and induſtry, they betook themſelves
to the more gainful trade of ſpoil and
robbery. For the old name of <hi>Turk</hi>
is altogether laid aſide and deſpised
by them, as ominous and of an evil
ſound, as if an alteration of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had made them quite another
Nation, and they ſeem deſirous to
forget it, and therefore never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it themſelves, and take it amiſs
and are very angry and look upon it
as an affront, if any <hi>Chriſtian</hi> call
them by it. Such as depend imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
on the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
in his ſervice, and receive his
pay, for diſtinction and for honour
aſſume to themſelves the title of <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manli,</hi>
out of reſpect to the name
and memory of <hi>Osman,</hi> to whoſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53701:21"/>
valour and prudence they owe the
firſt beginning of their Empire; and
to ſhew their duty to the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Family, whoſe Slaves they glory
themſelves to be; but the name of
<hi>Muſulman,</hi> which Religion beſtows
on them, and equally reſpects all, is
that they are moſt pleaſed with, and
deſire chiefly to be known by.</p>
            <p>They ſay,<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laid claim to by them.</note> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi>
we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father;
all the Prophets are theirs, <hi>Moſes,
Samuel, David,</hi> and the reſt. A <hi>Jew</hi>
thinking to put a trick upon a very
zealous but ignorant <hi>Turk,</hi> who was
diſcoursing upon this argument, told
him, that they had one <hi>Prophet</hi>
however peculiar to them, which
they could not pretend to or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
in the leaſt, naming the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Habakkuk;</hi> to which the other
could not tell what to reply, having
never heard of him, till having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to his <hi>Imaum,</hi> or Pariſh-Prieſt,
and underſtanding from him, that
<hi>Habakkuk</hi> was a good <hi>Muſulman,</hi>
he finds him out, and beats him
ſoundly for daring to go about to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53701:21"/>
rob them of one of their greateſt
Prophets. In this they triumph and
applaud themſelves; this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
ſubject of their moſt ſolemn
thankſgivings to <hi>God,</hi> that he has
made them <hi>Muſulmans,</hi> in ſuch like
form as this, which I have met with,
<hi>Praiſed be God who has made us to

to us an holy Religion, and a Houſe
to which all Strangers reſort, and
has appointed us to be Judges over

            </p>
            <p>In a Religion,<note place="margin">The <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion groſs,</note> which is made up of
folly and impoſture and groſs abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
which abſtracting from the
common and fundamental principles
and notices of Natural Religion, has
nothing in it to recommend it ſelf to
the choice and acceptance of any
ſober and wiſe man, no ſubtil, no
grave diſcourses of learning or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
not ſo much as an argument,
that looks like probable, is to be
expected for the defence of it. Their
ſtrength lies more in attacking other
Religions, than eſtablishing their own.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53701:22"/>
What they commonly object againſt
the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> argues a ſtupidity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
befitting <hi>Turks,</hi> as being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of a groſs fancy, that entertains
no other idea's of things than what
are derived from material and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

idle imaginations the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of our Religion can no way
ſuit; concerning which they aſk
blaſphemous and moſt ſhameful
queſtions, and they think this a
ſufficient confutation; though it
muſt be ſadly confeſſed, that for the
ſake of ſome novel Doctrines, and
eſpecially that of <hi>Tranſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which intereſt and a miſappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
zeal and a ſuperſtitious fancy
have brought into the <hi>Church,</hi> they
loath and abhor the very name of

            <p>The liberty their Religion allows

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53701:22"/>
a bar and a prejudice to it, that it
ſets it the more cloſely upon their
minds; the doctrine of it being ſo
agreeable to the example of their
Prophet, who was of a hot luſtful
temper, and pleaſed himſelf with
variety of women. By this with an
equal cunning he both juſtified his
own practice and drew in ſuch great
numbers of men, of as bad a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and complexion as himſelf, to
embrace a Religion ſo charming and
ſo pleaſing to fleſh and blood, which
propoſed the groſſeſt ſatisfactions of

               <hi>God</hi> having tried ſeveral ways, which

at laſt upon this, and bring men
over to the true Faith by violence
and force of Arms, whom tenderneſs

work upon. This was his chief war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
(for he pretended but little to
Miracles, and thoſe few he is ſaid to
do are very idle and frivolous) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
advantage of the diſtractions
of the time he lived in, and of the
horrid ignorance of his Countrymen

that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was ſent
by <hi>God,</hi> and that particularly they
(<hi>Turks</hi>) are his true followers, who
have ſo great a ſhare and part of the
world; as if the <hi>Sophi</hi> and <hi>Mogul</hi>
had little or nothing, and that there
was no ſuch Empire as that of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and <hi>America</hi> they hear the
<hi>Franks</hi> talk of lay out of this world;
and as if all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> though
brancht into ſo many diſtinct Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
and Governments, was but
a little ſcantling in compariſon of
their Empire, which by degrees has
encreaſed to that vaſt bulk, next to
the juſt judgment of <hi>Almighty God,</hi>
by the follies and diviſions of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53701:24"/>
Sometime out of an exceſs of zeal,
they will ask a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> civilly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
as I have been aſkt my ſelf
in the Portico of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> why
will you not turn <hi>Muſulman,</hi> and
be as one of us? The uſual anſwer
is, that my Father before me, and
my Grandfather before him were
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that I think it beſt
for me to continue in the Religion
of my Country, in which I was born
and bred.<note place="margin">No diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them.</note> And indeed as they are
ſcarce capable of any other anſwer,
ſo neither is it ſafe or prudential to
give it. It would be a piece of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
zeal and indiſcretion
(not to call it by a worſe name) to
upbraid them of their follies to their
faces, without the leaſt hope of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and diſpute with them in the
Streets, and in their <hi>Moſchs,</hi> when
ſuch like queſtions are propoſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the purity and truth of the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; and ſuppoſing
that zeal ſhould tranſport any one
ſo far, that he were knockt in the
head in the purſuit of his argument,
he would deſerve pity, and his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53701:24"/>
that the fear of death could
no way mate, were to be admired;
but I queſtion whether he could
challenge the glorious title of a
<hi>Martyr,</hi> who without any juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
much leſs neceſſity, has brought
his death upon himſelf. The caſe of
that poor <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
who having renounced his Faith
and his <hi>Saviour,</hi> being perplexed in
conſcience for the great ſin he had
been guilty of, and informed by his
Confeſſor, to whom he had disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
his grief which lay ſo heavy
on him, that he could no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
it, but by publickly profeſſing
himſelf a <hi>Christian</hi> again, went bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the <hi>Cadi,</hi> and perſiſting in his
new reſolution, received the ſentence
of death with great comfort and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
            <p>This ſhadow of an argument,<note place="margin">Moſt ſecure in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and belief.</note> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the force of education, has
ſuch a mighty influence upon their
minds, that it ſtifles all the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of reaſon and natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and makes them perverſe and
obſtinate, and ſo ſecure withall, that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53701:25"/>
'tis a ſin to doubt of the happineſs
of their condition, as to the other
world as well as to this; in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of which confidence it is
moſt ſeverely forbid by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to go about to convert a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman,</hi>
and the doing of it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
a capital crime, without the

            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> indeed knowing how
generous the <hi>Franks</hi> are in order to
the sfying of their curioſity, as
if Money ſprang up in their poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
ready coined, make their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
and their hatred vail to their
covetouſneſs, and will admit them
into their very Churches; though
ſometimes I have met with a repulſe
at <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> where I uſed to
go often to pleaſe my ſelf with the
ſight of that glorious Structure;
they telling us, the <hi>Caymacam,</hi> who

<hi>Helleſpont</hi> and took <hi>Adrianople,</hi> we
procured a Prieſt to let us into a
<hi>Moſch,</hi> which had been formerly a
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, hard by which
is the Tomb of the Emperor <hi>Vrcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
who took the City. After we
had viewed it, we preſented the old
man, who was waiting at the door,
with about half a Dollar, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
exſpecting but a few Aspers,
was ſo ſurprized with it, that to ſhew
his ſenſe of the unexſpected civility,
with great earneſtneſs and devotion,
lifting up his eyes to Heaven, he
prayed <hi>God</hi> in his good time to
make us <hi>Muſulmans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the only way of taming
their fierceneſs,<note place="margin">Only to be pleaſed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and preſents.</note> by preſenting them
money, and bribing them with gifts
to be civil; and ſo long as this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

pretend great kindneſs; but if they
do not depend upon you, or if you
withdraw your hand, they return
to their natural rudeneſs and hatred
with greater violence, which hope
of gain and ſome preſent advantage
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53701:26"/>
had reſtrained; for to be kind to
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> is againſt the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of their Religion. Here and
there may be a few, whom a ſenſe
of gratitude for received kindneſſes,
and a freer converſation with <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
by reaſon of commerce, have
ſoft'ned out into better manners.</p>
            <p>As I and my Companion were walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

now call it, to ſee what remains of

<hi>Gentleman-Turk</hi> (for ſo he ſhewed

that there was ſomething of
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> under our <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Clothes,
aſked our <hi>Janizaries,</hi> if we were

it, and upon further demand of
what Country of <hi>Phrenkistan</hi> or
<hi>Christendom,</hi> knowing that we were
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> he invites us to his Houſe;
which civility as we were unwilling
to accept, ſo did we not know how
to refuſe; but after a little conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with our two <hi>Janizaries,</hi>
who were very forward for it, we
went with him. Upon our firſt coming
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53701:26"/>
in, he bids us heartily welcome, and
expreſt ſuch reſpect and kindneſs,
as fear of being taken notice of
did not permit him to ſhew in the
publick Streets. He entertained us
with Coffee and Sherbet and Sweet-meats,
according to the cuſtom of
the Country; our wonder at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
and extraordinary treatment
was the more heightned, when we
underſtood that he had been a <hi>Haggi,</hi>
or <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> and had viſited <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi>
Birth-place at <hi>Medinat Alnabi,</hi>
the <hi>City of the Prophet,</hi> and Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
at <hi>Mecca</hi> (from which places
they uſe to bring back greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of zeal and fury againſt the
<hi>Christians</hi>). But to ſatisfie us, he
told us, that he had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
very great kindneſſes from
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and
that he was reſohttp://www.thecatseyes.com / show.asp?show<seg rend="decorInit">i</seg>d=2460ved for his ſake to
be civil to his Countrymen where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he met them. Not content with
this, he would ſcarce give us leave
to depart, proffered us the uſe of his
Houſe, while we ſtayed in <hi>

and upon our refuſal, took a ſolemn

farewell of us, and ſent one of his
Slaves to attend upon us to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
which we had a great mind
to look into. One may travel from
the <hi>Danube</hi> to <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
not meet with the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of generous civility.</p>
            <p>They obſerve moſt ſtrictly the
Rite of Circumciſion,<note place="margin">Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> as the Seal of
the Covenant, which <hi>God</hi> made with
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ismael,</hi> which gives
them a right and title to all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the <hi>Muſulman</hi> Faith. This
Sacrament the Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet</hi>
thought fit to receive, as well in
compliance with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as with
the cuſtom of his Country and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Nations in the <hi>East,</hi> who
were punctual in the obſervation of
it, out of a ſtrict adherence to the
traditions of their Fathers, and the
uſage of ancient times, without any
remembrance of the true ground of
its orignal inſtitution. They do not
circumciſe Children in their infancy,
much leſs think themſelves obliged
to the eighth day; no Canon tyes
them to a ſet time, but they are left
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53701:27"/>
wholly to their liberty, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
their convenience, ſo it be not
defer'd beyond the thirteenth year,
which is the utmoſt limit, (that is,
if they be not deprived of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of doing it for want of a
ſkilful hand) in memory of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
of <hi>Ismael,</hi> which as they
alledg agreeably to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
was done when he was at that
age. Till which time the Boys wear
their Hair long, but made up into
curled knots hanging over their
Shoulders. The Ceremony is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
with great noiſe and tumult,
which with them are the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of their feſtival joy and
mirth; all their ſolemnities being
diſorderly and rude, and without
any decorum or diſcretion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
them. The whole day is ſpent
in entertaining their Relations and
Neighbours, who are to be witneſſes
of the operation; for at this time
they think they may fairly and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
lay aſide their gravity, and
wholly give themſelves up to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.
But as ſoon as Evening-prayers
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53701:28"/>
are over, they prepare ſor
the buſineſs, which is committed to
the care of a Chirurgeon, or Barber,
or any other who has an eaſie and
dextrous hand. In the mean while
the Boy is brought in by his Father
and Kinred, in his new Veſt and
Turbant, whom they flatter and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs
to divert him from melancholy
and fear, and to prevent him from
fainting before he feels the ſharpneſs
of the Raſor; telling him, that in
a few minutes he will be enrolled
among the followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and be made capable of the favour
of <hi>God</hi> and the joys of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
Sometimes they caſt the Boy into
a ſleep with an <hi>Opiat</hi> potion, when
they think he has not courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to endure it; or do it by a
ſurprize, before he is aware, having
firſt prepared all things in order to
it, and then making as if it were to
be deferred till the next day, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
return and finiſh the intended
work. Yet notwithſtanding the great
ſtir they have made in the day-time,
and that by this they are initiated
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53701:28"/>
into their Religion, they do not uſe
to have any ſolemn prayers at it;
only the Operator in the very act
cries out, <hi>Biſmillah, in the name of
God,</hi> three times, the Muſick play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to drown the noiſe and howling
of the young <hi>Turk,</hi> bleeding under
his wound. At the Circumciſion of
the Son of the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> or any
other conſiderable <hi>Baſſa</hi> or Officer,
for the greater pomp and ſolemnity,
and for example ſake to encourage
him to endure what they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
before him, ſeveral others
are circumciſed at the ſame time;
between whom upon the account of
this Religious ſolemnity, there is
contracted ſuch a dearneſs and
friendſhip, beyond all tyes of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
relation, that it is only diſſolved
by death, and ever after they call
themſelves by the title of <hi>Sunnet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſh,</hi>
or <hi>Aſſociate of Circumciſion,</hi>
which they value above that of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
In the night they repeat often
the ſame rude mirth, as they had
in the day. Thoſe Villains who out
of deſperation or a deſire of living
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53701:29"/>
in all beſtial ſenſuality, turn Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gados,
are compelled to be cut.
They firſt appear before the <hi>Cady</hi>
or Juſtice, and acquaint him with
the deſign of becoming a <hi>Muſulman,</hi>
and deſire to be admitted to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and priviledg. Immediately he
commands their heads to be ſhaven,
and the matter being uſually known
before, Clothes and Turbants are
provided and freely beſtowed upon
their Proſelytes; and ſometime upon
his firſt coming out in his <hi>Muſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
Habit, they ſet him upon a
Horſe, and carry him in triumph
through the Streets of the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
with a Lance or Dart in his
hand, to ſignifie they are ready to
fight for and defend the Religion
they have newly taken up, with the
utmoſt hazard of their lives. Some
few, perchance out of a natural hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of pain (I intend it only of the
Apoſtate <hi>Christians,</hi> for the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-born
<hi>Turks</hi> never omit it) have
by ſeveral artifices and wiles eluded
the ſentence of the Law, and remain
uncircumciſed, and abhor this invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53701:29"/>
ſign of a <hi>Mahometan;</hi> and old
men eſpecially, to whom this wound
might prove deadly and fatal; but
then they muſt keep it mighty pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and ſecret, leſt it come to the
<hi>Cady</hi>'s ear, whom they muſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
bribe, or elſe be forced to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to this piece of religious ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>It was one of the great policies
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at ſet times.</note> that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
eſtablish the fancies that were to
be the peculiar characters of his
Religion, to preſs upon his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
the frequent practice of thoſe
great duties of Nature, which refer
to the worſhip and ſervice of God,
as if in this they were to out-do both
<hi>Christians</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> For they are
obliged to make their ſolemn pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
five times a day, at ſet hours;
which vary according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſeaſons of the year. They do
not divide the natural day into ſo
many equal portions, as not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the uſe of Aequinoctial
hours, or the benefit of Sun Dials,
to meaſure and adjuſt their time;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53701:30"/>
but only have regard to the riſing
and ſetting of the Sun, and its lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or ſhorter ſtay above the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon;
though of later years they
are mightily taken with the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Watches, there being ſcarce
a <hi>Turk</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> of any faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but is maſter of one, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
has a ſtriking Clock in his
Houſe; a conſiderable number of
Artizans of the <hi>French</hi> Nation reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good advantage from this their
curioſity. The times are at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing,
Noon, the Middle-time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Noon and Sun ſet, Sun-set,
and an hour and half in the Night;
only upon <hi>Friday,</hi> which they call
<hi>Giumahgun,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Friday their day of Religious Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> or the day of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Convention, they add to their
devotion, and go to Church about
the middle of the Forenoon; at
which time the more devout ſhut
up their Shops, but afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their trade and buſineſs.
This being the only diſtinction and
ſolemnity of the day, and no other
reverence paid it. Otherwiſe there
is the ſame noiſe in the Streets and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53701:30"/>
Markets, the ſame chaffering of wares,
their Magazines as much frequented,
and no difference as to the neatneſs
and fineneſs of their Habit; they
thinking they have done enough,
if they ſtep to the <hi>Moſch</hi> at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
time for a quarter of an hour.
In the time of <hi>Ramazan,</hi> which is
the moſt ſolemn time of the whole
year, wherein they pretend to moſt
devotion, and wherein the moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
will endeavour to expiate the
miſcarriages of the year paſt, ſome
will riſe two hours before day to
praiſe the name of God in a ſet form,
this being a holy month, devoted to
faſting and the more ſtrict exerciſes
of Religion. In the greateſt <hi>Moſchs</hi>
on Friday in the Afternoon, ſuch of
the Prieſts as have acquired the fame
of Learning and Eloquence, enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon ſome words of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
entertain the people with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues
in their way, with a great
deal of noiſe and ſeeming zeal, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the advance of Piety, Juſtice,
Charity, and the other vertues of
converſation and ſociety. But this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53701:31"/>
is extraordinary, which they are not
bound to, their part being to read
ſeveral Surats or Chapters of the
<hi>Alcoran,</hi> and recite the preſcribed
office of Prayer: A little ſtock of
Learning ſerving to qualifie them
for this function.</p>
            <p>Before they make their prayers,<note place="margin">Their waſhings.</note>
whether publickly in their <hi>Moſchs,</hi>
or privately in their Houſes, they
are very ſolicitous to waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as thinking, that without this
previous luſtration <hi>God</hi> will be deaf
to their requeſts, and that all their
devotion will be ineffectual and to
no purpoſe. This being ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a qualification of prayer, that
they might not be deſtitute of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies,
and ſo be forced to omit
their devotion for want of due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
this way, beſides the vaſt
number of them every-where in their
Streets, there are Conduits and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
with great variety of Cocks
adjoining to the greater <hi>Moſchs</hi> for
this purpoſe. It is not enough to
waſh themſelves, except they do it
after a particular manner, which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53701:31"/>
though difficult in it ſelf, yet cuſtom
and uſe have rendred ſo eaſie and
familiar to them, that they do it
without delay and without error;
the manner is this, as I made a <hi>Turk,</hi>
whom I had oblig'd, ſhew me parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in my Chamber. Tucking
up their Veſts and ſhort Sleeves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
their Elbows, they take up as
much water as they can hold in the
hollow of their hands, which they
waſh thrice, and then putting their
forefinger inro the left ſide of their
mouth, and their Thumb into the
right, waſh that three times alſo.
Snuffling up water with their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils,
they gently ſtroke their Face
from the Forehead to the Chin, and
back again; next their Arms to the
bending; taking off their Turbant
they rub with the inſide of their
Hand the forepart of their Head,
from the Crown to the Forehead, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their fore and middle Finger into
the cavities of their Ears, and their
Thumbs behind, waſhing their Necks
with three Fingers of both Hands
reverſed. Their publick <hi>Bagnos</hi> or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53701:32"/>
Baths uſually are built very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
and ſtately; all great men have
them in their Houſes for their own
uſe, and the uſes of their Women,
being frequented not only for health
and cleanlineſs, but for Religion in
ſeveral particular caſes, in which
they are obliged to cleanſe other
parts of the Body, not to be named,
which yet I have ſeen them do at an
open Fountain in the Streets. This
ceremony, be their occaſions never
ſo great and urgent, they cannot
omit without great ſcandal and guilt.
Before which purgation they look
upon themſelves as unfit not only
to go to Church, but to converſe or
to be converſed with. But how ſhall
ſuch as travel in the Deſarts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi>
or <hi>Libya</hi> comply with this
fundamental Article of <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi>
where they cannot be profuſe with
the proviſions of water they carry
with them for the neceſſities of life,
where they meet with no Springs to
ſupply themſelves? Are they wholly
freed from the obligation of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
No. The ſubtle Impoſtor has
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53701:32"/>
herein provided a remedy againſt
this contingence; in caſe of the
faileur of water, Sand or Ashes or a
Morter-clod crumbled into duſt ſhall
do as well, and ſhall convey the
ſame cleanſing virtue, as much as
if they had made uſe of the cleareſt
Fountain-water. They uſe cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
except in caſe of ſickneſs and
weakneſs, when they are indulged
to warm it, for fear otherwiſe the
cold ſhould ſtrike into their bodies
and encreaſe their malady. But ſee
the madneſs and folly of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition!
by the ſprinkling of a few
drops of cold water, they think their
minds are as much purified as their
bodies, and that this is a ſufficient
purgation from the defilements of
ſin, and a moſt effectual remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
brutality, and the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
impieties they can poſſibly be
guilty of.</p>
            <p>To put them in mind the better
of theſe duties of Religion,<note place="margin">Called to Prayers by the Prieſts or their Servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

their thoughts, the Prieſts or
their Servants give notice to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53701:33"/>
people publickly of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
times of prayer. And for their
better accommodation, about the
<hi>Menar</hi> or Pyramid raiſed from the
ground adjoining to the <hi>Moſch,</hi> is
built a Gallery, to which there is an
aſcent by a winding pair of Stairs,
the door whereof always looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Mecca.</hi> Here walking round
and ſtraining their voices in a kind
of ſinging tone, which they lengthen
out, they invite them in a peculiar
form of words, which is common to
all, and from which they do not
depart a tittle, to come and make
their prayers; and by this way they
ſupply the want of Bells, which they
neither uſe themſelves, nor permit
the poor <hi>Greeks.</hi> It is ſcarce cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
how this noiſe, by reaſon of
this advantage of heigth, in a clear
evening may be diſtinctly heard. The
words are exactly theſe; <hi>God is
great, God is great; there is no
God but God, there is no God but
God; I confeſs that</hi> Mahomet <hi>is
the Meſſenger of God, I confeſs that</hi>
Mahomet <hi>is the Meſſenger of God;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53701:33"/>
come to prayers, come to prayers;
come to worſhip, come to worſhip;
God is great, God is great; there
is no God but God.</hi> In the morning
ſometimes they remind them, that
<hi>prayer is better than ſleep,</hi> and bid
them repeat the <hi>Phatiha</hi> or firſt
Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which they
uſe as frequently as we do the <hi>Lords
Prayer.</hi> In the <hi>Royal Moſchs,</hi> where
there are uſually four Pyramids,
(only that of <hi>Achmet,</hi> the Grand-Father
of the preſent Emperor, in
the <hi>Atmidan</hi> or <hi>Hippodrome</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>

is made with greater ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
by ſeveral Prieſts jointly at the

the ſame number of repetitions.</p>
            <p>Their prayers are in the <hi>Arabick</hi>
language,<note place="margin">Their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> and of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> the language of <hi>Mahomet</hi>

of their daily uſe are eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by the people; to which alſo
the frequent mixture of <hi>Arabick</hi>
words in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> does not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
conduce. The matter of them is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53701:34"/>
generally pious, and what might
not miſbecome thoſe who worſhip
the true <hi>God;</hi> but that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;
except where they reflect
moſt impiouſly upon the moſt ſacred
and venerable myſteries of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> by making a depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
appeal to <hi>God,</hi> with a <hi>far be
it from thee, O Lord, what the
Chriſtians impute to thee;</hi> meaning,
that <hi>thou haſt a Son.</hi> Theſe prayers,
as ſeveral other parts of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
have for their foundation not
only the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in which, as they
ſpeak, are contained the commands
of <hi>God,</hi> but the practice and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> derived down to
them by tradition, which they call
<hi>Sunna.</hi> By which pretence they have
introduced ſeveral cuſtoms, though
in matters of leſs moment, of which
there is not the leaſt intimation in
the Book of their Law; and the
people, out of a blind reverence and
ignorant zeal, eſteem them to have
the ſame authority and to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
binding. They direct their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
only to <hi>God</hi> Almighty, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53701:34"/>
his infinite power, ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and right over Angels and Men
and Devils, and the whole compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of all other Beings. They
put up no prayers to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> nor
do they bow their knees, as ever I
could obſerve, as ſome write, at the
mention of his name, it being one
of their principles, that <hi>God</hi> is only
to be adored and worſhipped, which
makes them ſo ſevere upon us, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning
us of Idolatry for worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

for ever; Arianiſm,</hi> which <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>

being one main ingredient of their
Religion. In what a fair way are a
great number of falſe <hi>Christians</hi>
(eſpecially inferior perſons, who are
taught to renounce the <hi>Lord God
their Saviour, who bought them</hi>)
in <hi>Poland</hi> and elſewhere, to become
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> if the <hi>Grand Signor</hi>

<hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf uſes in the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
toward the holy Patriarchs and
Prophets and our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of whom their writers take
up the ſame form, joining the name
of the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> to his, as <hi>Isa

honour in their offices of Prayer,
beſides frequent acknowledgments
of his miſſion from <hi>God</hi> as his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
and Meſſenger.</p>
            <p>There is a great ſemblance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
in their Churches.<note place="margin">Their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service in their <hi>Moſchs.</hi>
               </note> This is
the only repreſentation that can be
made of them to their advantage.
Take them in their Streets and
Houſes, they are rude and fierce and
ill-natur'd; but their modeſty here
triumphs over their fierceneſs of
temper, and a ſence of Religion influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
their behaviour, and makes it
extraordinary humble and reverent.
I happen'd to be preſent at Evening-prayer
in the time of <hi>Ramazan</hi> in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53701:35"/>
the new <hi>Moſch</hi> built by the Mother
of this Emperor, where might be an
Aſſembly of no leſs than two or three
thouſand. Lifting up the Antiport,
and advancing a little forward, I
could not perceive the leaſt noiſe;
no coughing or ſpitting, no diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
running up and down, no ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
one upon another, no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
of diſcourse, nothing of
irreverence or heedleſneſs, as if they
had forgot the buſineſs they came
about; but all were mighty intent
and ſerious, and liſtening with great
diligence to the Prieſt, or buſie at
their private prayers, with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
ſilence, as if it had been not
only a ſin, but a crime that drew
after it bodily puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
immediately, to miſbehave
themſelves whether in diſcourse or
geſture in that place.</p>
            <p>When they make their prayers,<note place="margin">And the manner of it.</note>
they turn their faces toward that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
point of the Heavens, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which <hi>Mecca</hi> is placed, as the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> do to the <hi>East,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Jews</hi>
to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in what Climate or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53701:36"/>
of Sphere ſoever they are;
ſtanding almoſt erect, only that
their heads do encline ſomewhat
forward; their eyes being fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ground, and their hands
cloſe to the breaſt, almoſt in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of a Croſs, without any the
leaſt motion, as if they were in an
extaſie. But ſoon after, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
of ſome words, they at ſet
intervals incline their heads, and
bend their bodies, and proſtrate
themſelves upon the pavement, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Carpets or Maps of
<hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> ſeveral times together;
then ſitting croſs-leg'd, their hands
placed upon their knees, but not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
in the ſame eaſie poſture as in
their houſes, but as it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
higher, and upon their right
heel. They often paſs from one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
to another, and make often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanges,
which tradition and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
have made neceſſary in order
to the right performance of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Beſides, they have a trick to
move their heads ſeveral times from
one ſhoulder to another, as if they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53701:36"/>
ſhewed the expectation they have of
the coming of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to appear at the laſt day at the
time of prayer; or elſe (which is the
reaſon <hi>Albert Bobowſki,</hi> a learned
<hi>Polonian,</hi> who had been kept in the
<hi>Seraglio</hi> full nineteen years, and a
perſon well-skill'd in all the Rites of
the <hi>Mahometan</hi> worſhip, gave me
upon enquiry) to ſhew reſpect to
their Angel-keepers, whom they
fooliſhly believe at that time to ſit
upon their ſhoulders. They make
uſe of Chaplets of Beads, upon
which they number their ſhort
prayers, ſuch as <hi>Sabhan Allah, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God; Allah Ekber, God is
great; Alhemdo lillah, praiſe be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to God; Biſmilla, in the name
of God;</hi> which they will repeat
ſometimes a hundred times, as they
will likewiſe the ſeveral names of
<hi>God,</hi> with great noiſe and fervency.
We heard in <hi>Sancta Sophia</hi> ſix or
ſeven Prieſts crying out ſeveral times
till they were even hoarſe again, <hi>We
believe, we believe;</hi> as if they
thought <hi>God Almighty</hi> had been to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53701:37"/>
be wrought upon by ſuch loud and
vain repetitions.</p>
            <p>In making bows and proſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</note>
which they look upon as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
appendages of prayer, their
devotion does chieſly conſist; to
omit them is very ſcandalous, there
being not a greater diſgrace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
among themſelves than to be
accounted <hi>Binamaz, one who does
not ſay his prayers.</hi> It is enough
however they do it in their Houſes,
ſo they do not neglect the <hi>Moſch</hi> too
much, and eſpecially in their Month
of Faſt; but the <hi>Janizaries</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
who by the obligation of
their Order fight for the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and advancement of the joint-intereſt
of Religion and the Empire,
think this their zeal and readineſs
enough to excuſe them from going
thither too often, and diſpense with
themſelves for not going above once
or twice in a year, except ſuch as
live in the two <hi>Oda's,</hi> or publick
Chambers in <hi>Constantinople</hi> deſign'd
for their Lodgings, adjoining to
which is a <hi>Moſch</hi> peculiar to them.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53701:37"/>
But ſome on the other ſide, who
would be taken for Saints, are as
extravagant in the exceſs, as the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi>
are uſually neglectful:
For at the times of Prayer they will
diſmount from their Horſes,<note place="margin">The exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive zeal of ſome <hi>Turks,</hi>
               </note> leave
their ſhooting and hunting, ſpread
their Handkerchiefs in the open
ſtreets, as well as in the Fields and
Woods or Sea-shore; as I have known
them do, when croſſing the <hi>Propon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
we were forced by violence of
weather, to make into a Cove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Rocks, where I found ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Boats of <hi>Turks</hi> got thither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, being the only <hi>Frank</hi> in the
company. After their prayers, they
fell to drinking of <hi>Coffee,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
that I was wet and cold and
indiſposed, by reaſon of the ill-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they bid one of their Slaves
give that <hi>Infidel</hi> who was in the Cleft
of the Rock, where I had ſhelter'd
my ſelf againſt the wind, a Diſh of
<hi>Coffee,</hi> which was very welcome,
not daring to offend them by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
uſe of the Wine I had laid
in the Boat to ſerve me during
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53701:38"/>
my Voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome this devotion certainly
flows from a principle of conſcience,<note place="margin">and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of others.</note>
and is very hearty and ſincere, as
both juſtice and charity oblige us
to believe; but it would be as great
folly and weakneſs not to cenſure
others of groſs and ridiculous folly
and diſſimulation, as this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſtance will fully demonſtrate:
My Lord Ambaſſador one day enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
at Dinner one <hi>Huſain Aga,</hi>
who had formerly been Cuſtomer
at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and at that time one of
the great men of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by
reaſon of the relation that his Father-in-Law
had to the <hi>Vizir</hi> then in
<hi>Candia,</hi> but as very a <hi>Turk</hi> as is in
the whole Empire, together with five
other Hogs fatning up for the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
They drank mighty freely of
Wine and Strong-water, which had
been diſtilled in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> for the
ſake of which they chiefly came;
though they would jeſtingly at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
check themſelves for daring to
tranſgreſs the Law of their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:</hi>
But being once in, they drank
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53701:38"/>
on, a drop of each defiling them as
much as the greateſt load they could
ſtand under. But however, to ſhew
that for all this extravagance they
were <hi>Muſulmans,</hi> as ſoon as they
heard the Prieſt from the Spire of
a neighbouring <hi>Moſch</hi> at <hi>Ikindi,</hi> that
is, the middle-time between mid-day
and Sun-set, call to prayers, they
deſired a Carpet might be ſpread in
the Court-yard upon the ground,
where they went very devoutly to
their prayers, and left us to wonder
at their ſtupid and irreligious hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.
This is no very rare or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
thing among them, it being
what I have ſeen alſo practiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a great number of <hi>Christians</hi>
in other places.</p>
            <p>The Faſt,<note place="margin">Their Faſt of <hi>Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan.</hi>
               </note> which every year is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the month of <hi>Ramazan,</hi> is
another great fundamental of the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion. Which though
it be fix'd as to the month, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the years they make uſe of in
their Religious and Civil accompts
are Lunary, without any intercala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to adjuſt the different periods of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53701:39"/>
the motions of the Sun and Moon,
there is an anticipation made every
year of eleven days, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
it does not return to the ſame
beginning, till after a Circle of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
three years has expired. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the beginnings of months,
not troubling themſelves with the
nice calculations of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> they
only reſpect the Phaſis of the Moon,
not in the leaſt its Conjunction;
and accordingly, as it muſt needs
often happen, they begin the month
one day ſooner or later, as the Moon
appears. Sometimes they have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their Lamps at their <hi>Moſchs</hi> in
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> which is the uſual
ſignal in this month, to be lighted
at midnight, as ſoon as it has been
atteſted by credible Witneſſes, who
either have had better eyes or a
clearer Horizon, that they have ſeen
the Moon that night. But however
to prevent confuſion, in rainy and
cloudy weather, after a days ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
and forbearance, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
it the next, when the thickneſs
and hazineſs of the Sky hinder it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53701:39"/>
from appearing. Generally upon
the ſight of the New-Moon they
bow their bodies, gently ſtroking
their faces and beards, and put up
prayers to <hi>God.</hi> During this month,
as long as the Sun continues above
the Horizon, a total abſtinence from
all manner of ſuſtenance is injoined;
in the very heat of Summer, when
the length of the days adds to the
trouble and irkſomeneſs of it, they
dare not ſo much as put one drop
of water into their mouths; and
indeed herein their ſtrength and
their patience are both equally to
be admired; ſuch reſtraints a fear
of violating this ſevere Law of their
<hi>Prophet</hi> lays upon their very natures,
that a natural <hi>Turk,</hi> though at other
times brutiſh enough, and apt to
indulge his appetite, will chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to periſh with thirſt, and faint
away by reaſon of an empty ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
than commit ſuch a great
ſin, though in private and out of
the ſight of the world. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
or rather obſtinacy have been
ſo great, that their Hiſtories relate,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53701:40"/>
that the <hi>Janizaries</hi> themſelves, who
in ſeveral other matters do not uſe
to be over ſcrupulous, when they
have been in the Field and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to engage their enemies, have
abhorred the very thought of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and drinking in <hi>Ramazan</hi> time,
till they have been diſpensed with by
the <hi>Mufti,</hi> aſſuring them by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
authority, that it is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to <hi>God,</hi> to defend his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
againſt the enemies of it,
than to obſerve its precepts to the
prejudice of it, in weakning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by ſuch exceſſive and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
faſting; and the Emperors
own example has prevailed with
them above the neceſſities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The <hi>Renegadoes</hi> perchance,
who have embraced <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi>
that they may wallow the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
in all manner of ſenſuality
and luſt (for no one can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſo ſottiſh, or void of reaſon and
common ſence, as to embrace it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conviction, as if he had found by
ſtrength of argument, that it was
true, and upon that account ought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53701:40"/>
to be embraced) do not uſe this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
upon themſelves; but then
their great care is, that they be not
diſcovered. For though it be not a
capital crime, yet the irreligious cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
if convicted before the <hi>Cady,</hi>
is oftentimes drub'd, and by way
of expiation and penance, is to faſt
a conſiderable number of days. To
prevent the ſcandal and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, they durſt not ſo much
as enter into a <hi>Cabaret</hi> (when the
<hi>Greeks</hi> were allowed to ſell Wine)
which would have been a double
crime, remembring the ſad fate of
him, who being got drunk in the
<hi>Ramazan</hi> time, had hot melted
Lead poured down his Throat and
into his Ears by <hi>Naſſuf,</hi> who was
chief <hi>Vizir</hi> under <hi>Achmet,</hi> who
judged his bad example merited
this ſeverity: though ſome, out of
their exceſſive love to it, will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to drink in <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Houſes,
where they may be free and can
have it. Their luxury, inſtead of
being repreſſed by this total abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
is the rather heightned and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53701:41"/>
inflamed; for as ſoon as the Sun is
ſet, and their Lamps flame round
about the Towers of their <hi>Moſchs,</hi>
which they place in ſeveral figures,
as of a Gally, and the like, which
make a very diverting ſhew; and
that prayers are ended, from which
none who are well are to be abſent,
who have any care of their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they play the gluttons more
ſolemnly, and ſpend the whole night
in entertainments and revellings.
They paſs over the day with a great
deal of wearineſs and drowſineſs,
wiſhing and yawning till the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Star
appears; but in the night
they enjoy themſelves doubly for
their forced abſtinence and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance;
which is therefore the
more ſhameful and ridiculous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is but an introduction to
riot.<note place="margin">The caſe of ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, and Children.</note> Sick perſons and Travellers are
diſpensed with, but upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that when they have regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their health, or have finiſhed
their voyages, they faſt ſo many
days in another month, till they
have filled up the number. Some
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53701:41"/>
out of a fooliſh opinion of merit,
begin their Faſt in the month prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but which is always to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with the laſt day of <hi>Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan,</hi>
and never to be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this limit. No Children are
tyed to this hard Law, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they make Boys of five or ſix
years of age, that they may learn
to accuſtom themſelves, faſt two or
three days together, after ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
intermiſſions. This month was
conſecrated by <hi>Mahomet</hi> to this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity,
becauſe in it he pretended
to receive the <hi>Alcoran</hi> from Heaven.
In this they all pretend to a greater
devotion than ordinary; and he
who at other times ſcarce cared to
go to Church, thinks now to redeem
his former neglects by his greater
diligence and frequency. The laſt
day of it is devoted to the memory
of their dead Friends and Relations,
whoſe Graves marked with red Oker
they uſually viſit, and put up their
prayers and ſuffrages for their Souls,
that it may be well with them;
with which ceremony they end the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53701:42"/>
day and the Faſt together.</p>
            <p>The following Moon begins the
Feaſt of the great <hi>Bairam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Feaſt of great <hi>Bairam.</hi>
               </note> which
is a time of great mirth and joy,
laſting only for three days. In the
morning of the firſt of which the
great Guns are diſcharged, and
Drums beat. There is nothing but
joy and triumph in the Streets.
They ſeem to be quite another ſort
of men than they are all the year
beſides, diverting themſelves in the
open Streets with Muſick and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
making invitations and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
at their Houſes, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſents to their Friends. A great
number of Sheep are killed too up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt day of this Feſtival;<note place="margin">Sacrifice Sheep.</note>
which they call <hi>Kurban,</hi> or <hi>the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi>
hereby thinking that <hi>God</hi>
will become propitious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to them, this being no obſcure
Relique of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Worſhip,
(<hi>Mahomet</hi> borrowing ſomething out
of the Religions then moſt in vogue,
when he firſt ſtarted up a <hi>Prophet</hi>)
and is queſtionleſs looked upon by
them in the nature of an expiatory
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53701:42"/>
Sacrifice, which they uſe at other
times upon ſolemn occaſions. As
<hi>Solyman,</hi> when he enter'd <hi>Buda</hi>
1541, ſacrificed in the great Church
dedicated to the <hi>V. Mary,</hi> turned
into a <hi>Moſch;</hi> and ſo at <hi>Strigoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
two years after, in 1543; As
<hi>Selim</hi> his Father did at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
for good ſucceſs in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Every man is
his own Prieſt, and may ſlay his
Sheep at his own Houſe. They
diſtribute the ſeveral parts of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the poor, reſerving nothing
in the leaſt to their own uſes, which
will take off from the merit of the
Sacrifice; which alſo ceaſes and is
rendred ineffectual, if theſe Victims
be purchaſed with money, got dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtly
either by fraud or violence.
I have been aſſured of a <hi>Turk,</hi> who
was ſo ſcrupulous this way, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of ſatiſfying for the injuſtice
he had been guilty of, and reſtoring
what he was wrongfully poſſeſſed
of, only deſired an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant
to change ſuch a number of Dollars
for others of the ſame ſpecies, fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53701:43"/>
thoſe that were got honeſtly
in the way of induſtry and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe
would thrive better with
him than thoſe he parted with, as if
the money only were in fault, and
drew a curſe after it, which he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
thus eaſily avoided by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.
The Sheep thus ſacrificed,
they fancy enter into Paradiſe,
and there graze all along the
flow'ry Meadows upon the Banks of
Rivers flowing with Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>Seventy days after is the Feaſt
of little <hi>Bairam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Feaſt of little <hi>Bairam.</hi>
               </note> which is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

prepare from the fartheſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Empire for their journey to
wards <hi>Mecca,</hi> that they may enter that
City in proceſſion the firſt day of this
Feaſt. In this pilgrimage all perſwasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns
of <hi>Mahometans</hi> agree, the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lying upon all indifferently to
perform it, once at leaſt in their lives.
The concourſe of Pilgrims is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
great; and for the greater
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53701:43"/>
pomp and ſhew, and for better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
and conveniency of travel,
there are places aſſigned confining
upon the reſpective Countries whence
they uſually come, where they meet
firſt either alone or in diſpersed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies;
ſuch is <hi>Damaſcus</hi> for thoſe
of <hi>Europe</hi> and the <hi>leſſer Asia; Cairo</hi>
for the Inhabitants of <hi>Africa; Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi>
a City in <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> for the

the <hi>Perſians, Vsbeck Tartars,</hi> and
the Subjects of the <hi>Mogul.</hi> But this
obligation and command is diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
in ſeveral caſes. If they are
employed in the neceſſary ſervice of
the Emperor, either about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or in the Wars, or in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of any Province. If they
be ſickly, and ſo their health like to
be endangered by long travel; if
they are poor, and have not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
to maintain their Families
in their abſence, or cannot furniſh
themſelves with neceſſaries for the
Voyage, and the like; ſo that it is
in a manner wholly left to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53701:44"/>
and choice, and is to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
and directed by their conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
and intereſt. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
there is ſo much of merit
in it, and ſuch reputation gained,
every one thinking himſelf, as the
more holy, ſo the more fortunate, as
if they had gone to take poſſeſſion

too many and too idle to be put
down here minutely and in detail;
the chiefeſt and moſt remarkable are
theſe which follow, as they were
communicated to me by a curious
and learned <hi>Renegado:</hi> They all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
meet on the Mountain <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi>
not far from <hi>Mecca,</hi> and are
there at the fartheſt by the ninth
day of the month <hi>Dulhaggi,</hi> where
they ſacrifice, and put on their holy
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53701:44"/>
Covering or Blanket, of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Haggiler</hi> or Pilgrims put on
a white woollen Coat, and hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their necks a white Stole, all
their other Clothes being caſt off,
pairing their Nails, cutting their
<hi>Muſtachios</hi> and Beards, and ſhaving
their Pubes, Head, and Body, or
waſhing their Body, at leaſt their
Head, Feet, and Hands, and after
perfume themſelves and ſay their
prayers. By this they become <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harrem</hi>
or <hi>devoted,</hi> and are obliged
to abſtain from all obſcenity of
language and ſtrife, even from hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and looking after game, &amp; do not
dare ſo much as to kill a Louſe, or
put on their other Clothes, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bants,
or Caps. Yet they may go
to a <hi>Bagno</hi> or Houſe for ſhade, or
into a Bed.</p>
            <p>Upon their entring <hi>Mecca,</hi> they
go ſtrait to the firſt <hi>Moſch,</hi> and then
to the Black Stone, which they
fooliſhly imagine the <hi>Patriarch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
uſed to ſtep upon to mount
his Camel, and ſay their prayers
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53701:45"/>
there, and kiſs it and rub their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
of Beades upon it. The whoſe

a great veneration; the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
name whereby it is known and
called in their diſcourse, being <hi>Kuds,</hi>
or the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> or the <hi>holy City;</hi>
to which they add the additional
titles of <hi>Sherif</hi> and <hi>Mubarek,</hi> or
the <hi>noble and bleſſed holy City.</hi>
Here they come to worſhip and ſay
their prayers in the <hi>Moſch,</hi> which
is built upon the top of Mount <hi>Zion,</hi>
in the very place where <hi>Solomons</hi>
Temple ſtood, once the <hi>Mountain of
Gods holineſs, and the joy of the
whole Earth, and ſtill beautiful for
its ſituation.</hi> This like the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53701:45"/>
at <hi>Mecca,</hi> they eſteem ſo holy,
that it is only lawful for a <hi>Muſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
to enter into it. If a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
or <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould but lift up the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and ſet one ſtep into it, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned
it, and indeed the penalty of
ſuch a curioſity would be, as they
give out, no leſs than death, or at leaſt
they would force them upon a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of redeeming their life with the
loſs and change of their Religion. Yet
ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> have been ſo curious,
who have ſpoke <hi>Turkiſh</hi> admirably
well, and known all the Rites and
Cuſtoms uſed in their Worſhip, as
to put on a Turbant and diſſemble
their Religion, and enter boldly
therein, who report upon the beſt
ſurvey and obſervation they could
make, they could ſee nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
or differing from what was
in their other Churches. So that it
ſeems nothing but the holineſs of
the ground in which it ſtands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
upon it this great luſtre and
veneration, and makes the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſo cautious and ſuperſtitious how
they admit ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:53701:46"/>

that nothing but abſolute ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs
can admit it as credible;

            <p>The fifteenth night of <hi>Shaaban</hi>

            <p>In the twenty-ſeventh night of

of the Alcoran;</hi> which is the cauſe
why the <hi>Impostor</hi> thought fit to
conſecrate the whole Month to more
than ordinary devotion, being the
holieſt time of the year. And to
encourage them to ſpend this Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
in the exerciſes of Religion, they
keep up and ſupport the credit and
reputation of it with a pretended
priviledge from <hi>God,</hi> that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
petitions they put up from
<hi>Jatzi,</hi> or an hour and half in the
night, until the Sky opens, (as they
ſpeak) and the day appears, ſhall
be infallibly granted, and that <hi>God</hi>
has decreed and determined this;
and therefore they call the prayer
at this time <hi>Kadar namaſi,</hi> or the
prayer of <hi>predestination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a fixt and eſtablished di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of order and degree among
the Miniſters of their Religion;<note place="margin">The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their Religion.</note> the

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:53701:48"/>
is often too conſulted in Civil affairs
and controverſies, which ſeem to
have little or no reſpect and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon Religion; and ſo may
be lookt upon under the notion of
a ſupreme Judge under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
as well as of a Chief Prieſt. He
is the great Doctor and Oracle of
their Law, and Heir (as they ſpeak)
of the Doctrine of the Prophets and
Apoſtles, the Fountain of vertue and
knowledge, one who can reſolve all
the difficulties of Religion, and who
has a Key to open all the treaſures
of truth; for by theſe and ſuch like
fooliſh characters do they repreſent
him. Let him be never ſo dull and
ſtupid otherwiſe, either through a
natural incapacity, or age, or any
other defect, if he be preferred to
the <hi>Muftiſhip,</hi> as ſome have been
out of a capriccio by ſome Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
preſently he becomes infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
his deciſions are ſacred and
authentick, and his authority is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
and received without
any diſpute or debate, and his dreams
are lookt upon as inſpiration, as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53701:48"/>
being <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s repreſentative.
Though he poor man, conſcious to
himſelf of the Cheat, uſes to be
over-modeſt, and is aſhamed to
aſſume this inerrable power, and
ſubſcribes his Sentence with this
uſual Expreſſion, <hi>God knows better;</hi>
which is yet no bar to the Peoples
opinion and eſteem of him; and no
one under the Emperour dares paſs
judgment contrary to his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
To keep up this veneration of
the <hi>Muſti</hi> in the People, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
deſcends from his State, and as
ſoon as he appears before him, riſes
up and advances leiſurely ſix or
ſeven ſteps towards him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
him to kiſs his left Shoulder;
whereas the chief <hi>Vizir</hi> is only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to kiſs and ſalute the hem of
his Veſt, though to do ſome little
honour to his firſt Miniſter he makes
a ſtep or two forward to meet him.
The Emperour makes great uſe of
him in his private Councils, and
ſcarce ſits upon a great deſign with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his advice, to make it take the
more among the Souldiers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53701:49"/>
who aſſure themſelves both
of the lawfulneſs, and convenience,
and neceſſity of an Expedition, and
flatter themſelves too with the good
ſucceſs of it, if it be ratifyed by his
conſent, and bleſt by his Prayers
and encouragement. If reaſon of
State judg it neceſſary to ſtrangle or
take off the head of a <hi>Vizir,</hi> any
other <hi>Baſſa</hi> or General of the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries;</hi>
the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s conſent will vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the execution, and ſtop the
clamours and diſcontents of the
Soldiers and People: who by this
are made to believe, that the perſon
cut off deſerved to die according to
the Law; and that it is a piece of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to ſubmit to the Emperours
Pleaſure, and the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
noleſs than to the Will of <hi>God.</hi>
The Authority of the <hi>Mufti</hi> being
ſo great, the Emperour will not truſt
a matter of that conſequence to an
election, knowing that the keeping up
his Prerogative in the diſposal of ſuch
an office to a fit perſon, who ſhall
comply with his humour and the
neceſſity of State, is a juſt piece of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53701:49"/>
Policy, on which may oftentimes
depend the ſafety and ſecurity of his
Perſon and Government. Although
uſually he prefers one of the <hi>Cadile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkires</hi>
into the place of the depoſed
or dead <hi>Mufti,</hi> if he be for his turn;
But in caſe the <hi>Mufti</hi> ſhould prove
reſractory and diſturb his Councels
by throwing in ſcruples of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and refuſe to obey and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his Orders, though they be
never ſo unjuſt and unreaſonable,
they are not long to ſeek for a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and as if the ſpirit of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
wherewith he was before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted,
immediately upon this fooliſh
act of diſobedience, left him to his
pure natural condition; then he is
ſaid to dote, and to be infatuated,
and to forfeit his diſcretion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and is hereby rendred
unworthy of ſo holy and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent
a dignity; and one preſently
is ſubſtituted into his place, who
underſtands better the Arts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
and Courtſhip, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
as an Oracle whatever comes
propoſed to him out of the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio.</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:53701:50"/>
The <hi>Mufti</hi> by his place always
moves with the Emperour; none of
his Retinue more conſtantly attends
him, that he may be ready to aſſiſt
with his Councel at all times in caſe
of doubt or difficulty. This high
place lies in common to any one,
whom the Emperour ſhall think fit
to dignifie and honour with it, and
is not confined to the Kindred and
Poſterity of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as ſome
through a miſtake have affirmed.</p>
            <p>I am fully aſſured the <hi>Mufti</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
acts as a meer Politician and
Counſellor of State, though the
advancement of Religion is always
the pretence, as it happened upon a
debate before the Emperour much
about the year 1669. when there
were diſpatched two Gentlemen out
of <hi>Croatia</hi> with full Commiſſion to
treat about their becoming tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi> from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Nobles of the <hi>Roman</hi>
communion, who afterwards had
their heads ſtruck off at <hi>Newſtadt,</hi>
upon the aſſurance of his aſſiſtance
and protection againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53701:50"/>
of <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they had ſhook off, and
thought to juſtifie and ſecure their
Rebellion this way. <hi>Muſtapha Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macam</hi>
of <hi>Adrianople</hi> was againſt
their being received, as being againſt
the Peace made ſo ſolemnly after the
battel of <hi>Rab;</hi> and beſides very
politickly remarqued, it was no fit
time while they were involved in ſo
troubleſom and expenſeful a War
with the <hi>Venetians</hi> in <hi>Candia,</hi> to
bring the <hi>Germans</hi> upon their backs,
which would inevitably follow; but
the <hi>Mufti</hi> was as zealous and fierce
for their being taken into protection,
alledging that the <hi>Port</hi> was the
refuge of the world, and that the
Intereſt of Religion as well as of
State would be advanced by ſuch an
acquiſt, which the Chriſtians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
would maintain and make
good to them, and that this was of
greater obligation, than the ſtrict
obſerving of a Treaty, that the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of the laſt <hi>Hungarian</hi> War
forced them to ſubmit to. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
diſtracted with ſuch different
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53701:51"/>
Counſels, would reſolve nothing till
he had received the opinion of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zir</hi>
then before <hi>Candia;</hi> but before
that could be brought back, they
had certain intelligence, that <hi>Croatia</hi>
was over run with an Army of Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thouſand, and the whole force of
the diſcontented and rebellious No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
defeated, and not an Acre of
Land left to plant a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
in.</p>
            <p>Next to the <hi>Mufti</hi> are the two
<hi>Cadileskires,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cadiles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kires.</note> the one of <hi>Anatolia,</hi>
who has the precedence, and the
other of <hi>Rumuli</hi> or <hi>Thrace;</hi> the
authority of which latter, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
the ſeeming reſtraint of
the name, is extended as far as the
<hi>Turk</hi> has any Dominions in <hi>Europe.</hi>
Theſe formerly were, as their titles
literally ſignify, <hi>Judges of the Army;</hi>
and perpetually attended the Camp
to adminiſter Juſtice among the
Souldiers, that ſo the Diſcipline of
War might receive ſupport, and be
maintained, and kept up better by
the aſſiſtance of the Law; and little
quarrels that might ariſe among
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53701:51"/>
them, might be the more fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
and capital puniſhments
inflicted according to the demerit
of the Criminals. This was the
deſign of their Original Inſtitution;
but at preſent they only aſſiſt the
<hi>Vizir</hi> or his Deputy, in deciding
civil Cauſes, and exerciſe no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and power over the Souldiers,
who have long ſince extorted this
Priviledge from the <hi>Grand Signor,</hi>
to be tryed only by their reſpective
Commanders and Officers, They
have carried before them a Pole or
Spear, on the top of which hangs
horſe-hair, as an Enſign of Honour;
to ſupport which, beſides what they
get by bribes and fees from the
parties contending, which are greater
or leſſer proportionally to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the Sum, about which the
Suit is commenced, They have a
daily allowance of Five hundred
Aſpers out of the Exchequer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Canon eſtablished by the
Emperour <hi>Suleiman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mollas</hi> challenge the third
place: who,<note place="margin">Mollas.</note> under the <hi>Baſſas,</hi> are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53701:52"/>
Judges and Preſidents of Provinces:
in the chief Cities of which they
reſide, and to whom the <hi>Cadies</hi> or
inferiour Judges are obliged to give
an accompt of their Judicature.
Their pay is out of the Publick
Treaſure, which is never leſs than
Three hundred Aspers a day, but
always under the allowance of the
<hi>Cadileskires.</hi> The firſt deſign and
intent of the allowance was agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Equity and Juſtice, that they
might live handſomly and well, and
never be forced to deſcend to baſe
Arts and ways of gain, unworthy
their places, or be under the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of perverting the Law for
reward and gain. But this does not
ſatiſfie and content their avarice,
who are not aſhamed to extort Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
and Preſents from the ſeveral
Parties, who muſt this way defend
their Cauſe, if they would not have
it miſcarry, be it never ſo juſt and
equitable in it ſelf. This is the beſt
and moſt effectual Plea they can
poſſibly make: for certainly if Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
be to be ſold in any part of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53701:52"/>
world, it is in <hi>Turkey.</hi> For though
they may pretend Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and may ſeem nice in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
ſome Suits; yet it is both
known and ſadly experienced, by
poor Chriſtians eſpecially, if they
implead any <hi>Turk,</hi> that they are
horribly corrupt, and men of no
faith or honeſty, and judg the cauſe
on his ſide, who has given the
greateſt bribe; though to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the infamy and guilt of
injuſtice, they alledge ſeveral trickiſh
ſubtilties out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and
from Tradition, and to ſtave off the
injured perſon from purſuing his
right, and proſecuting his complaint.
Theſe are reckoned among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Church-men, the Law by
which they judge and determine
Caſes, being as much a part of their
Religion, and founded in their <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi>
and <hi>Sunna</hi> or Tradition, as
the Rites of their Worſhip: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they have nothing to do in
the <hi>Moſchs,</hi> and ſuſtain only the
office of Civil Judges; they are
accordingly advanced to the higheſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53701:53"/>
dignity a Church-man is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>Moſch</hi> has a Prieſt pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
belonging to it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Imam,</hi> or Pariſh-Prieſt.</note> who is called
<hi>Imaum.</hi> In the royal <hi>Moſchs</hi> and
others that be endowed, ſeveral are
maintained, who take turns in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
their office, or elſe for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Decorum and State officiate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
A ſmall proportion and
meaſure of Learning is a ſufficient
qualification of a <hi>Turkiſh Prieſt;</hi>
there is no great need of any praevious
ſtudy, or a peculiar education and
deſignment to make any candidate
fit to take the care and Government
of a <hi>Moſch</hi> upon him. For the moſt
part if he can but read the Prayers,
and write and recite a few Verſicles
out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and be no way
ſcandalous in his life, though he has
been at a Trade all his life long, he
is very capable, if he can get to be
nominated to fill up any vacancy;
and in caſe of any miſcarriage or
unfitneſs degraded as it were from
his function, and he contentedly
returns to his Trade again, and one
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53701:53"/>
of his Neighbours is preferred into
his place. The great <hi>Vizir</hi> is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of moſt of the richeſt <hi>Moſchs;</hi>
the chief <hi>Mufti</hi> diſpoſes of others;
the <hi>Kizlir-aga</hi> or chief of the black
Eunuchs recommends perſons to
ſucceed in the vacant places of the
royal <hi>Moſchs;</hi> the <hi>Capi-aga</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
a right, where any of the Pages
of the <hi>Haz-oda</hi> or Chamber have
been founders, as having been bred
up under the care of his Predeceſſors.
To other places of leſſer value the
recommendation of the people is
ſufficient, who upon producing his

            <p>The vaſt number of Prieſts may be
collected from the great number of
Churches,<note place="margin">The great number of <hi>Moſchs.</hi>
               </note> which are every where to

in <hi>Conſtantinople, Pera</hi> and <hi>Galata,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53701:54"/>
and the Towns ſituated upon the

which I add, becauſe ſome Chriſtians
are permitted to live by themſelves,
without the mixture of any <hi>Turks;</hi>
which is particularly indulged to
thoſe, who live in Villages about
eight or ten Miles from <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53701:54"/>
the title that uſually is beſtowed
upon him.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Moſchs</hi> are endowed by
their reſpective Founders: for upon
no other condition are any allowed
to build. To preſerve order and
unity among ſo great a number of
Prieſts in every great City, as <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,

there is one who preſides and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes

            <p>Sometime in the greater Churches
Harangues and Diſcourſes are had

They are performed with a great

and devotion; their chief Argument
being a Religious or Moral duty, as
frequency of Prayer, Juſtice, Charity,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53701:55"/>
and the like. Theſe Preachers, whom
they call <hi>Scheicks,</hi> who have had
their Education in a Colledge or

in the ſtudy of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and
its ſeveral Commentaries, are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily

To which are joyned others, who

            <p>The <hi>Cadyes</hi> are the inferiour Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,<note place="margin">Cadyes.</note>
placed almoſt in every Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage
to ſee good order kept among
the people, to adminiſter Law and
Juſtice, to decide Differences, and
to puniſh Offenders, which they do
with ſeverity enough, unleſs they
buy off their puniſhment. This
power they uſually buy at a dear
rate; and that they may be no loſers
by the bargain, they ſell Juſtice as
dear, and upon every ſlight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
oppreſs the poor Chriſtians,
make <hi>Avanias,</hi> and demand Sums
of Money upon a pretended fault or
breach of the Law, and oftentimes
force Travellers to give them ſo
much Money in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> as they ſet
upon their heads. Such greedy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners
are they, as moſt <hi>Francs</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:53701:56"/>
know, who have travelled far into
the Countrey, by their ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
As for Preſents, they expect
them of courſe upon their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into their Towns; and as if they
were due and recoverable by Right
and Law, as well as by injuſtice and
violence, if we have been a little
ſlow in making them, they have
ſent an Officer to demand them.
For as ſoon as the News of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of any <hi>Weſtern Chriſtian</hi> is
brought to the <hi>Cady,</hi> he ſeems ſure
of a prey. Before we ſtirred out of
our <hi>Caravan-ſerai,</hi> which the piety
of the <hi>Turks</hi> hath built for the uſe
and accommodation of Travellers, to
view the Antiquities of any place,
we were firſt to obtain the leave of
the <hi>Cady</hi> by a Preſent of Coffee, or
Pepper, or Sugar, and ſometime of
all three; and unleſs we had done
ſo, we could have had no ſecurity,
(for by ſome deviliſh trick or other
he would have put us to a greater
trouble and expence) which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the neceſſary guard of
Souldiers to attend, makes travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53701:56"/>
ſo dear and chargeable in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key.</hi>
Coming to Anchor on the
North-ſide of the Caſtles at the
<hi>Dardanels,</hi> where is the narroweſt
ſtrait of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> as they
force all Ships to do that come from
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to lie there
three Suns to ſearch them, if they
have no Contraband Goods or
Slaves, which have made their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
from their Patrons; we went
aſhore, and had ſcarce paſt through
a Street or two in <hi>Seſtos,</hi> but we
were overtaken by an Officer ſent
from the Governour to bring us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: we underſtood the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, and therefore in our way
to the Caſtle bought ſome Coffee
Powder, for a Preſent, which we put
into his hands, who after ſome idle
queſtions diſmiſt us. But for the
moſt part in our Land-voyages, we
prevented the demands of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Cadyes,</hi> out of which number I
except the raſcally Cady of <hi>Sardes:</hi>
He hearing that there were ſeveral
Franks got into the publick Chane,
very imperiouſly ſent for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53701:57"/>
we replied, that we had the
Emperor's Paſs to exempt us from
all injury and exaction, and to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
unmoleſted; for ſuch a one two
Engliſh Gentlemen had procured at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> paſſing thence over
land to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which they gave us
to make the beſt uſe we could of it
in our Voyage to the <hi>Churches.</hi> But
the truth is, we did not rely ſo much
upon the Paſs, as our number and
the weakneſs of the Village: For
this once glorious City the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis
of <hi>Lydia,</hi> which has nothing
of its ancient glory and ſtate left,
unleſs that the great ruines ſhew
what it has been before Earthquakes
and War, and the barbarouſneſs of
the <hi>Turks</hi> had cauſed thoſe horrid
and frightful deſolations there, is
become a very pitiful and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
place, made up of a few Hutts
and Cottages. Pretending to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
with the ſight of our Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
he counterfeits reſpect and
civility, and deſires us to give him
but half a Dollar; but by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> we did not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53701:57"/>
think fit to give him, being ſuch a
low-ſpirited Fellow, not ſo much as
a ſingle Asper; upon which denial
he could not contain his weak paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and therefore ſeverely forbids
a poor Chriſtian, that we employed
in buying us ſome Proviſions, to be
any way aſſiſting to us. Afterward
when we were at leiſure to reflect
upon what we had done, we began
to condemn our ſelves or our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
that might have given us
ſo much trouble, which for ſo ſmall
a Sum as was demanded, might have
been better prevented, being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſenſible, that neither our
Swords nor Paſs might have been
of ſufficient proof againſt his rage
and madneſs.</p>
            <p>They look upon the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
as containing not onely the Word
and Will of <hi>God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alcoran.</note> dictated by the
Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Rites and manners of his
Worſhip, but the body of the Civil
Law referring to matters of Juſtice
and Government; and therefore, as
I ſaid before, uſe its authority in
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53701:58"/>
the deciſion of Caſes that happen
daily in converſation and commerce;
and where it is defective, as it muſt
needs be, they call in to their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
their <hi>Sunna,</hi> made up of the
Sayings and Acts of their <hi>Prophet,</hi>
derived down to them by Oral
tradition,<note place="margin">Sunna <hi>or</hi> Tradition.</note> from Father to Son, as
they pretend, and of equal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with the holy Book: and
becauſe innumerable caſes happen,
that are ſo perplext and confuſed,
that neither written nor traditional
Law have made any proviſion for
them, equity and right reaſon are to
interpoſe and determine, but no
where are leſs practiſed than in

to bend to their covetous humour;
and yet to keep the fraud from
being diſcovered, wreſt ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure

            <p>Some of theſe receive for their

twice a week, on Saturday and

examination they find the ſucceſs
anſwerable to their expectation;
after a ſet time they have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

has his Cell, over a ſet number of
which is placed a Superviſor to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

ſome of the Derviſes bred up in
their Convents, prove the great
Preachers, and have that mighty

            <p>Every <hi>Cady,</hi> beſides an Actuary

            <p>I found the <hi>Turks</hi> exceſſively
pitiful and good natured towards
dumb creatures,<note place="margin">Turks piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to dumb creatures.</note> ſoon putting them
out of their pain, if they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to kill them. Some buy
birds on purpoſe to let them fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and return to the liberty of the
Woods and open air. The Vultures
fly up and down the Courts of the
great houſes in the City, as if they
had perceived by natural inſtinct,
that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whoſe birds they are
fancied to be, had forbid under a
penalty any one to ſhoot at them.
The Storks, which in the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
return out of the Southern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
to the very ſame Neſts the
ſharpneſs of the Winter drove them
from, enjoy their natural liberty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53701:60"/>
without the leaſt moleſtation; and
if at any time in our travels we
ſhot at them, our <hi>Janizaries</hi> would
take it amiſſ, and look upon it as
ominous, as if ſome miſchief would
certainly befall us for our cruelty
to the poor innocent birds. For
though they uſe hawking, and take
them with Birdlime, and ſometime
uſe their Guns and eat their fleſh,
yet they are not very much accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
to ſuch dainties, and never
kill them for the ſport and pleaſure
of it, eſpecially if they are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and good for food; which is the
reaſon of the great number of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants

               <note place="margin">Their love of Dogs.</note> But above
all they ſeem to have a peculiar
love and kindneſs for Dogs, which
yet are the uglieſt and of the worſt
Race that ever I ſaw. They will not
indeed admit them into their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
becauſe they are unclean crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but however leſt the Winter-air
ſhould be too ſharp and piercing,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53701:60"/>
there are diſtinct Kennels in every
ſtreet, to which they peculiarly
belong, and a daily proviſion is
made of water put into hollow Pits.
I have obſerved ſome mighty ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted
<hi>Janizaries</hi> go to a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
ſhop and buy an Asper or two
of bread to beſtow by way of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
upon them: when at the ſame
time, if a poor Chriſtian had been
ready to periſh for want of a little
relief, the ſight of ſuch a miſerable
object would have no way moved
them to pity: and though they are
ſo troubleſom, in the night eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
no one dares either ſtab them
or poyſon them without danger of
being ſtabb'd himſelf if the fact
were diſcovered. How idly and
fondly ſuperſtitious they are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
will appear by the enſuing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
which though it hapned in
the time of <hi>Achmet,</hi> yet ſtill holds
true, and repreſents their preſent
temper. The Plague raging very
hot, the Emperour and the Baſſas
at laſt ſeemed to make a mighty
diſcovery, that it was neceſſary to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53701:61"/>
deſtroy the Dogs in and about <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
to prevent the further
ſpreading of the Infection: but the
<hi>Mufti,</hi> who was conſulted in this
weighty Affair, would by no means
give way to ſo bloody and cruel a
ſentence, maintaining it was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unlawful; and that he might
not ſeem to be peremptory without
cauſe, he added this momentous
reaſon, that <hi>Dogs had ſouls,</hi> and
therefore were to be exempt from
this univerſal and horrid carnage.
But it was a plain caſe, ſo great a
number of Dogs was a real miſchief:
what therefore was to be done in
this great ſtrait and perplexity of
mind? Upon the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s ſentence
they recalled the former order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their ſlaughter, and reſolved to
tranſport them over the Water to
<hi>Asia</hi>-ſide; above fifty thouſand were
found upon the Muſter, and carried
over to <hi>Scutary</hi> and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
places: but though they
were out of ſight, yet they were
not out of mind; and their care of
them ſeemed to be doubled, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53701:61"/>
Proviſions were ſent daily over to
keep life and ſoul together, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s learned and
philoſophical determination; till at
laſt growing weary of the expence
and trouble, and fearing they might
infect the places where they were,
with great trouble and reluctancy
of mind they conveyed them to ſome
of the uninhabited Iſlands that lie
in the <hi>Propontis</hi> toward the Bay of
<hi>Nicomedia,</hi> where they were famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But the City ſince is ſo peſter'd
with them, that I believe if a new
Muſter were now made, the number
would be found to be greater. No
one muſt offer to kick or touch any
of them; if a Chriſtian does this
by chance, they impute it to his
hatred and ill will, and will be ſure
to chide, if not beat him for it: as
one in a great fury askt a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
who through great haſte and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
trod upon a Mangey Curr,
that lay in the way, <hi>Thou Infidel,
how doſt thou know, but that thy
fathers ſoul is in that poor dog?</hi>
ſhewing by this his love to the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53701:62"/>
dog, and his zeal for his opinion:
for he was one of thoſe who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the idle Pythagorean dream
of a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or tranſmigration of

of fate,<note place="margin">The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fate.</note> which is the genuine
iſſue of their groſs ignorance and

encounter the greateſt dangers of
Death with ſuch deſperate boldneſs;
fearleſs and ſecure, as to their
thoughts, in the time of a raging
Plague. The contagion does not
hinder them from viſiting perſons
infected, with the ſame freedom, as
if they were only ſick of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Fever; they wipe their faces
with the Handkerchiefs of their
dead Friends, and put on the very
cloaths they but lately died in:
their confidence being grounded
upon this fooliſh belief, that every
man's deſtiny is written in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and not to be prevented or
kept off by care or Medicine, that
the term of life is fatal and perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory,
and that it is in vain to go
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53701:62"/>
about to extend it beyond the ſet
Period; and that Phyſick is to be
taken not to prolong life, but to
take off from the anguiſh and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of death, and to make the
pangs of it the more tolerable and
eaſie: and that it is a piece of folly
to think to eſcape. This error de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
thouſands of them yearly,
who haſten their own death by their
conceitedneſs and folly: which is
true of the common people eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
in whoſe minds this fancy
is ſo rooted, that they think it a
kind of Sin as well as weakneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
their houſes, and retire to
more wholſom air; what, ſay they,
is not the Plague the dart of the
<hi>Almighty God?</hi> and can we eſcape
the blow that he levels at us? is not
his hand ſteady to hit the perſons
he aims at? can we run out of his
ſight, and beyond his power? thus
calling in the belief of ſome of the
Divine Attributes to the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it. Indeed ſome of the
<hi>Cadyes,</hi> who ſeem to be the only
men of deep ſence and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53701:63"/>
among them, are aware of the
pernicious conſequences of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and when the Plague grows
hot and violent, provide for the
ſafety of their Families by a timely
flight into the neighbouring Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
where they keep them till the
fury of it is ſpent; while entire
Families (and one I heard of in
our time in <hi>Galata</hi> conſiſting of ſix
and thirty perſons) which have ſtay'd
behind, have been deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p>The Plague neceſſarily diffuſes its

till a thouſand bodies
are carried daily out at <hi>Adrianople</hi>
Gate to the publick places of Burial,
which lye in the plain without the
City, and are extended from the
<hi>Propontis</hi> to the Haven. For though
it be an arrow that cannot be put by,
yet they acknowledg it is in the
hand of God, and that he can ſtop
it if he pleaſes; and ſo are forced
at laſt to acknowledg the weakneſs
and falſity of their own Principle.
At ſuch times, as alſo when the
affairs of the Empire are in an ill
poſture by reaſon of War, the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> and <hi>Mufti</hi> attended by the
<hi>Baſſas,</hi> and a great number of Prieſts
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53701:64"/>
in ſolemn proceſſion, paſs over the
Water to <hi>Pera</hi>-ſide, where upon a
high hill a little above <hi>Kaſim Baſha</hi>
in that part of it they call <hi>Okmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
where at other times the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſort of <hi>Turks</hi> uſe to ſhoot (which
is one of their greateſt exerciſes) on
the edge of it toward the South-eaſt
is a little Square of about twenty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
long, andas many broad, hemm'd
in with Freeſtone about two foot
from the ground, where I found a
ſtony Pulpit aſcended to by ten
ſteps; on the top of which the
<hi>Mufti</hi> makes his prayers: after
which Ceremony is over, they think
they have done all they can do, and
leave off all further care. This is
their great argument of comfort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the death of their friends, that
it is the decree and pleaſure of <hi>God,</hi>
which they are to ſubmit to, and
that all humane counſels and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are ineffectual againſt his will,
(which is a great truth in it ſelf, but
very much miſapplied by them)
and that ſo long they are to live, and
not a minute longer: as I remember a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53701:64"/>
               <hi>Turk</hi> who eſcaped being buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ruines of a wall, that fell as
he paſt by, ſaid, when he was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
from his ſurprize, <hi>Egel ghel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medi,</hi>
that <hi>the hour of his death
was not yet come,</hi> without giving
God thanks for his great delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Some of them indeed ſeem to
have a great reverence and fear of
God,<note place="margin">Their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God.</note> which they ſhew both by their
geſtures and diſcourses, whenſoever
they have occaſion to mention his
name; referring all things, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the events of war, or any great
undertaking, but of a journey, and
the private concerns of their life, to
his will and diſposal, ratifying their
promiſe and purpoſe with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>In Shallah, if God will;</hi>
beginning nothing of any moment,
not ſtepping out of their door, nor
mounting a Horſe but in the name
of <hi>God.</hi> In any danger or diſtreſs
they quiet their fears, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
others not to deſpond, with
the remembrance of the mercy,
power, and goodneſs of God, often
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53701:65"/>
crying out, <hi>Allah karim, God is
gracious, Allah ekbir, God is great,</hi>
and the like; out of a ſenſe of their
own weakneſs, flying to God to
help and protect them; and when
the danger is over, the journey fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
or the deſign accompliſht to
their ſatiſfaction, they repeat often
theſe words, <hi>Alhemdo lillah, praiſe
to God,</hi> by way of gratitude and
acknowledgment. This is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of ſome of the more religious
among them.</p>
            <p>There are others who run into
the extreme of irreligion;<note place="margin">Atheiſts among them.</note> Atheiſts
in their hearts and in their lives;
among which I may reckon juſtly
enough the greateſt part of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,</hi>
and almoſt all the <hi>Apoſtate
Chriſtians.</hi> Theſe latter, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
to themſelves of horrid crimes,
which the Laws of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> have
made capital; or elſe of diſſolute
lives, and wallowing in brutality,
that they may enjoy their luſts more
freely, and without check and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe
of conſcience, embrace the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, look upon it
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53701:65"/>
and all other Religions as a meer
cheat, and by their lives ſhew the
diſeſteem of them. The other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men whoſe underſtandings are
ſomewhat refined by their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the ſtupidity and dulneſs
of the ordinary <hi>Turks,</hi> ſenſible of
the idle fopperies of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi>
and of the impoſture of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and of the abſurdities of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and the inconſiſtency of it
with the principles of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
raſhly conclude of Religion in
general, that it is a trick of State,
and an invention of Policy; and that
the belief of a <hi>God</hi> and of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is wholly owing to the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity
and ſuperſtition and unjuſt
fears of mankind. Only they are
ſo wiſe and cunning to conceal
their Atheiſm, which they are ſo
juſtly ſuſpected to be guilty of, for
fear of the great danger an open
profeſſion of it would involve them
in. For the <hi>Turks</hi> are mighty zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the exiſtence of a Deity
againſt the Atheiſt, and think ſuch
a perſon not worthy to breath in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53701:66"/>
the air, who dares deny this fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
principle of nature. And
the example of ſuch a juſt ſeverity
is very freſh in their memories,
as hapning in the year of Chriſt
M.DC.LXI, upon a certain <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan,</hi>
which I ſhall here put down
from the mouths of credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who knew the man very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly.
This <hi>Mahomet Ephendi</hi>
(which is a title of reſpect they
uſually beſtow upon men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and authority) was born
in <hi>Larr</hi> in <hi>Armeuia major,</hi> a man
of great eſteem in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
among all who knew him, for his
skill in the Law, and in the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
and <hi>Perſian</hi> languages, of a
temper mild and ſociable, which
made him covet the acquaintance
and friendſhip of ſeveral <hi>Weſtern
Chriſtians,</hi> from whom he could
learn ſomewhat, and whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to underſtand the laws
of diſcourse, and to reaſon much
better than his Brother <hi>Turks,</hi> whom
he lookt upon as very dull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
fellows. His inquiſitive genius
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53701:66"/>
put him upon the ſearch of ſeveral
things, and his pride and conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
were ſo great, that he thought
he had found the ſecret indeed,
which all the Atheiſts have been
ſeeking after to quiet and baniſh
thoſe fears which perpetually haunt
their guilty minds. Ambitious of
fame and applauſe, he ſets up for a
profeſt Atheiſt, being ſo far from
ſuppreſſing theſe extravagant fancies,
the effect of the greateſt madneſs
whatever, that he takes care to divulge
them in all companies where he
thought to meet with oppoſition,
and diſputes fiercely againſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a <hi>God.</hi> Whenever he went
to viſit <hi>Signor Warner,</hi> whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
learning and worth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
a great luſtre upon his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
character, the firſt ſalute upon
the very ſight of him was, <hi>there is
not,</hi> meaning a <hi>God;</hi> to which the
<hi>Reſident</hi> would immediately reply,
<hi>there is;</hi> after which they would
often deſcend to a cloſe diſpute
about that dictate of univerſal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and right reaſon; but he had
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53701:67"/>
ſo hardned his heart againſt all
conviction, and blinded his mind
and underſtanding with abſurd and
irrational prejudices, and fooliſh and
vain imaginations, that though he
could not well ſuſtain the mighty
ſhock of arguments which the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Reſident</hi> level'd at him, yet he
flatter'd himſelf he could fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
them all, and that he had the
better of him. But in the miſerable
end of this wretch the Divine juſtice
was as much ſeen as if he had been
conſum'd by Lightning from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
There hapning in the publick
<hi>Caravanſerai,</hi> where he lodged, a
quarrel between him and ſome <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian
Chriſtian</hi> Merchants, they
carried him before the <hi>Caimacam,</hi>
who is the Governour of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
who had for his Aſſiſtant
the chief Juſtice of the City, whom
they call <hi>Stambol Ephendi.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
he had done the <hi>Armenians</hi>
was proved by ſeveral Witneſſes;
and in the cloſe the <hi>Turks,</hi> who
were preſent, acquainted the Judges
of the temper of the man, and accuſed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53701:67"/>
him of ſeveral impieties he was
guilty of, as that he never came to
the prayers of the <hi>Moſch,</hi> neglected
the other rites inſtituted by their
<hi>Prophet,</hi> drank Wine freely, and
that in the time of <hi>Ramazan;</hi> and
beſides, that he openly maintained
that there was no <hi>God.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
through the zeal of the
<hi>Turks</hi> grew very hot, and matter
of fact ſeemed to be fully made
out by juſt proof. Whereupon the
Governour demanded of him, what
he could ſay for himſelf? whether
the evidence againſt him were true
or no? here ſeveral unanimouſly
agree, that you deny the being of
a <hi>God.</hi> He replied without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
or feat, you would be of the
ſame mind if you knew as much as
I know. They adviſe him, if he
valued his life, to retract his fooliſh
and impious opinion, otherwiſe they
would paſs the ſentence of death
upon him. They give him time to
conſider of it, and expect that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his private ſentiments were, fear
of death would make him confeſs
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53701:68"/>
his belief of a Deity. But it ſeems
he would be a Martyr for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,
and choſe rather to dye than
confeſs he was in an error, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
his inward thoughts; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he is ſentenced to dye; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
as perverſe and obſtinate as
ever, even in the laſt moments of
his life. For being ſet upon a Mule
with his face toward the tail, and
carried to the place of puniſhment,
and admoniſht by the <hi>Subaſhi</hi> or
Officer, who attended upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
to recant his error; his
only anſwer was, that the filth (for
ſo I chuſe modeſtly to expreſs it) he
was to eat he would eat preſently;
meaning by the rude Proverb, that
he was willing to dye as ſoon as
might be. Thus he periſht in his
folly, being between fifty and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years of age, and leaving a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
ſum of money behind him,
infatuated by the juſt judgment of
<hi>God,</hi> which became moſt viſible in
his deſerved ruine.</p>

and another at <hi>Pera,</hi> hard by the

which are the Seminaries of the
Youth of this Order, and where
they paſs their novitiate. Here they
are under the eye of moſt rigorous,
ſevere and cruel Maſters, and are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to the vileſt offices, to mortifie
them, and make them humble and
obedient; here they are taught to be
at the command of a beck or nod,
and if any way faulty, are ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a ſevere chaſtisement; here
they learn the firſt principles and
rudiments of War. This is according
to their original inſtitution by <hi>Morat,</hi>
the firſt who ſetled this <hi>new Militia</hi>
or Army, as the word <hi>Janizary</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies;
which out of reſpect to the
Founder and Order is ſtill retain'd.
But there diſcipline of late years
has not been kept up to this great
height of ſeverity, but is very much
relaxed and corrupted. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that according to the uſual
maxime of policy, which experience
hath ſo often confirmed and rendred
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53701:70"/>
little leſs than infallible, Empires are
kept and preſerved by the ſame arts
wherewith they were firſt eſtablisht,
which ceaſing, they begin to moulder
into pieces: We may look upon this
decay of diſcipline as a good omen,
that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, which has
been rais'd to that great pitch and
degree of glory, upon the ruin of
ſo many Kingdoms and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
grows towards an end; the
ſame fate uſually attending Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as ſingle perſons, that after
a ſet period of years, broken with
inteſtine factions and diviſions, or
weakned with idleneſs and the
charmes and delights of a long and
uninterrupted peace they periſh and
decay. They are not now ſo ſolicitous
to fill up thoſe ſeminaries with
<hi>Agiamoglans,</hi> which anciently were
accounted the hope and growing
ſtrength of the Empire; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of late years they have ſpent
ſuch a vaſt number of Soldiers in the
Wars, that they cannot get ſupplies
hence faſt enough to ſerve the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
of War. A very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53701:70"/>
part of the veterance Soldiers
was loſt in <hi>Candia,</hi> which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have called the burying place
of <hi>Muſulmans.</hi> For by a very juſt
calculation from their firſt landing in
the Island, and ſitting down before <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>
to the ſurrender of the chief City,
what by Plague and what by Sword
and Mine above four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
periſht there; the tediouſneſs
and diſadvantages of the War were
ſo grievous and irkſome to them, that
the <hi>Janizaries</hi> went thither very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
and without any heart to
fight, who dread all expeditions by
Sea, upbraiding the Emperor with the
miſfortunes and ill ſucceſs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
while their Country was impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh't
by the <hi>Temins,</hi> a falſe Coin of
mixt and baſe mettal, (which were
imported in vaſt quantities by the
<hi>French</hi> &amp; <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants) &amp; that
the Soldiers were thrown away in
<hi>Crete,</hi> &amp; yet for all this, that he went
a hunting. To ſupply the Siege, which
made ſuch continual waſtes of them,
I have known ſeveral country fellows
taken from the plough, and enrolled
<hi>Janizaries</hi> without any previous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53701:71"/>
of arms. Formerly all the
<hi>Conſtantinopolitan Janizaries</hi> were
quartered in two ſpacious hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
under the banners of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
officers, and kept guard
and watch; but now for a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
they are diſpenſt from this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance,
and are permitted to marry,
and accordingly ſeveral make uſe of
the indulgence; the cares of the
world put them upon arts of gain to
maintain themſelves and their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
and natural affection takes off
their minds from the purſuit and
love of armes, and makes them chuſe
rather to lye at home in their houſes
than go into the field. They are
buſied in the management of trade,
and turn ſhop-keepers, and by an idle
and ſedentary kind of life remit much
of their warlike ambition and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and are become ſoft and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
all their thoughts and wiſhes
being for peace and quiet. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the privileges of the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
being ſo great and the name
honourable, they get their children
admitted into the ſame order; of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53701:71"/>
which they are very tender and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous;
and leſt they ſhould any
way be diminiſh't by any publick
council or trick of State, there are
ſeveral of their order, (I think about
twelve, whom they call <hi>Ogiack A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galer</hi>)
conſtituted as ſo many Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
to take care of them. Theſe
Agitators are the men whom they
reſpect as their Patrons and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and who have ſuch a great
power and influence upon them. If
they give but the word, they are
preſently up in arms, and the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azzas</hi>
and Streets are full of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
tumults, and the <hi>Seraglio</hi>
it ſelf not ſafe from their aſſaults.
For they know well enough that
the Government is jealous of their
ſtrength, that it is in their power
either to depoſe or make what Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
they pleaſe, that they are the
ſafeguard of the Empire; that <hi>Oſman</hi>
uncle to this Emperor had a deſign
of deſtroying their whole order, and
ſetting up another, which ſhould be
more at command and not ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the publick, as they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53701:72"/>
every diſcontent; that his ſucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
carry on the ſame evil deſigns
againſt them, and that it is want of
a good opportunity, that hinders
them from putting the ſame in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and practice. Whence ariſe
their care and their fears; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
their pride and inſolence
and extravagant demands of greater
priviledges encreaſe, and the diſtrust
they have of the Emperor makes
them unite more cloſely and ſhew a
greater regard and reſpect to their
officers, who manage their intereſt.
They are wholly exempt from the
civil juriſdiction, be the crime never
ſo directly contrary to the Laws;
they are only triable among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
if it be judged and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
capital, before they execute
the ſentence, they firſt ſtrike his
name out of the Regiſter, and then
do it privately and in the night, to
prevent the diſorders this unruly
ſort of men are too apt to be guilty
of. In every City and large Town,
where they abound, there is a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
officer, whom they call <hi>Serdar,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:53701:72"/>
to whoſe juriſdiction they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious.
He according to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſent either from the <hi>Vizir</hi> or
<hi>Janizary Aga</hi> or General, muſters
thoſe who are within his Province,
and diſpoſes of them according to
the exigences of the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
If any quarrel happen
among themſelves, they muſt ſtand
to his deciſion; before him they
can only be impleaded by others;
and the partiality they ſhew to them
is ſo great, that it is much better
to take an injury patiently, than to
go about to redreſs it by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
which oftentimes too is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
and revenged. Such an opinion
they have of themſelves, that
they think they may do any thing,
and for all that go unpuniſht.</p>
            <p>It is the grand concern of the
Emperor to make a wiſe choice of
a General over theſe maſterful Slaves,<note place="margin">The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Janizaries.</hi>
               </note>

and if there be but the leaſt
ſhadow of ſuſpicion, he will take
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53701:73"/>
care, upon ſome plauſible pretence,
to put him out of his command;
the very leaſt compliance and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity
among the Souldiers would
draw him within the danger and
guilt of treaſon; ſo that he is forced
to be ſtiff and fierce, and to draw
upon him their ill-will and hatred,
to keep himſelf in the good graces
of the Emperour, who yet has a
watchful eye over him, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
continual jealouſies and fears
of him, though never ſo much at
the devotion of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> He
has the Government of no Province,
City, or Caſtle; has no ſhare in the
management of State-affairs; is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
inferior not only to the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zir

he is only to hear, and never
to ſpeak, but when his opinion is
aſkt. They will not ſuffer him to

            <p>They are continually in pay,<note place="margin">Their pay.</note> which
is various, according to the quality,
age, and merit of the perſon, from
three Aſpers a day to twenty, which

occaſion. And great numbers of
them are found at <hi>Cairo, Buda,</hi> and
<hi>Bagdat,</hi> to overaw the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
who are of a very unſetled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant
temper, very prone to ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and deſirous of ſhaking off
the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Government, and only
to be reſtrained by force. Before
they meet at the general place of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53701:74"/>
Rendezvous, a proportion of money
is diſtributed among them, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
themſelves with neceſſaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
evil events; but their chiefeſt
care is to get warm Clothes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

of the wind and cold, and to lay in
proviſion <hi>della bocca,</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi>
call it, to paſs the time of their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the field, or before a beſieged
place a little better. Each has his
Tin-pot and his Coffee, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Pulſe, Rice, Fleſh dried in
the Sun, and beaten into powder
for his broth, Onions and Salt in
his little Sack; this is the uſual
entertainment of the Camp. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fountain ſupplies them with
drink; for it is a crime puniſhable
with death, and as rigorouſly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
at ſuch a time, to bring Wine
among them. They go ſoberly to
deſtroy their enemies. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
no women to come nigh the
Army. All private quarrels are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
under pain of death; the leaſt
provocation is ſeverely puniſh'd.
Their marchings and encampings
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53701:74"/>
are done without noiſe; ſilence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one great part of their military
diſcipline. They ever are in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs

Soldiers who are obliged to ſerve

the reward of their ſweat and blood,
but tyes and obligations to further

who are not obliged to go out

think that when they war againſt
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> they make bare the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

<hi>Perſia.</hi> Theſe <hi>Spahyes</hi> are no
better than Country Farmers; their
minds are ſo taken up with the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of good Huſbandry, and the
pleaſure of enjoying what they have
has ſo taken off their minds from

get themſelves exempted from that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53701:75"/>
perſonal ſervice they owe their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror;
which is one reaſon (the
ſucceſs of a Battel depending more
upon diſcipline than number) they
do not care to bring ſuch vaſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

himſelf he ſhould become Maſter of

he ſeems to carry an Armory with
him, having a ſhort ſtrong Bow,
the ſame queſtionleſs which the old
<hi>Parthians</hi> made uſe of, with his
Quiver of Arrows, Sword, Gun,
Sheild, Lance, at the top of which
hangs a little Banner, which ſhews
to what order he belongs. For there

Long experience has taught them
the uſe of theſe ſeveral weapons,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53701:76"/>
which they manage dextrouſly
upon occaſion; as they do their
Horſes, which they can ſtop upon
a full career at the diſtance of a
foot. It is a pleaſant ſight to ſee
them divert themſelves by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
darts on Horſeback, which they
do with great ſtrength and dexterity,
turning and winding their Horſes at

to ſucceed into the places of the
<hi>Janizaryes</hi> and <hi>Spahyes,</hi> who ſhall
happen to be knockt on the head,
which they judg worthy of their
adventure; for if it be their fate
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53701:76"/>
to dye in the field, they believe they
ſhall directly go into Paradiſe; and
if they ſurvive a Battel, they are
ſure to be enrolled in the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> pay, which is the only am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
they ſeem capable of. Others
out of a principle of zeal, for the

prove the moſt deſperate, and

            <p>The Auxiliary Forces are the

ſhall ſucceed, as ſome pretend, but
out of an intereſt to gain by the
war, come in to their aſſiſtance.
They are more for their prey than
for fight, which they endeavour to
avoid, till neceſſity and ſhame put
them upon it. They carry with
them uſually a great number of
lead Horſes, which are of double
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53701:77"/>
uſe, either to ſet their miſerable
Captives upon, or in caſe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
ſhould fail, to ſerve them for
food; Horſeflesh being one of the
<hi>Tartarian</hi> dainties, and which is
ſold in the Market an Asper in the
pound more than Beef or Mutton.</p>
            <p>Thouſands of poor miſerable
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> are forced into the wars,
and ſerve only for Pioners, having
no other Arms than a Mattock and
a Spade; ſometimes placed in the
front of the Army to break the fury
of the onſet; or elſe in a Siege, when
they go to ſtorm, thruſt forward,
that upon their bodies the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi>
may paſs the more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Souldiers do not care
to go out of their Winter-quarters
till the Spring, when they may find
graſs for their Horſes; nor will they
keep in the field after <hi>October,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
bribed with promiſes of reward,
or forced to it by ſome urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.
Among their Baggage there
are uſually great quantities of metal,
to caſt great Guns upon occaſion;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53701:77"/>
which they find more convenient
oftentimes, than to carry Artillery
with them, eſpecially in long and
tedious marches, where there is no
conveyance by water.</p>
            <p>The many great victories the
<hi>Turks</hi> have gained over the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and the cauſes of it.</note>
are too ſad and convincing a
proof of their valour, which is
heightned and rendred deſperate by
a concurrence of cauſes added to
the ſeverity of their diſcipline and
education.</p>
            <p>Before they engage, if there be
any opportunity, the <hi>Surat</hi> or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Sword</hi> is read out of the
<hi>Alcoran;</hi> which contains a warrant
from Heaven to exterminate and
deſtroy all who ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this <hi>new Law, revealed by
God to Mahomet;</hi> hence their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
and their zeal receive new
vigor and force, that they fight in
the defence of <hi>Gods</hi> cauſe, which
makes them look upon cowardiſe
and faint-heartedneſs as a ſin. For
who can be ſo baſe and unworthy
as not to be ambitious of dying at
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53701:78"/>
ſuch a time, when they are the
Champions of God? The ſignal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given, they run upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
with the name of <hi>God</hi> in their
mouths, confusedly repeating it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, and invoking him to
aſſiſt and maintain his own cauſe,
which they are fighting for.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination</hi>
and Fate contributes not a little to
their fury; upon confidence of which
principle they expoſe themſelves to
certain dangers, believing themſelves
ſafe in the midſt of them, if <hi>God</hi>
has ſo decreed it; which they do
not know, whether he has or no,
but by the event; and if ſo, all
their warineſs and endeavours to
eſcape ſignifie nothing in the end.</p>
            <p>They are convinc'd by a thouſand
examples before their eyes, that this
is the readieſt way to riſe to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that there is a certain reward
due to valour, and that the <hi>Baſſas</hi>
and all the other great Officers owe
all to their Scymitars. Thus ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of fame and honour, they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
not their lives in fighting, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53701:78"/>
that if they come off, they are
ſure to be preferred.</p>
            <p>But the moſt effectual and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
machin to skrew up their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to the higheſt degree and pitch
of deſperation is an opinion, which
by the artifices and inſinuations of
the Churchmen paſſes for infallible
among the Souldiers, that whoever
dyes in the wars, is in the account
of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> a Martyr;
his death expiates and atones all his
ſins of what nature ſoever; that ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
facto he merits the joys and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Paradiſe, and his Soul ſhall
not be kept to attend upon the body
in the grave, to undergo the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the two Angels, which
they are ſo terribly afraid of. A <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi>
being conſulted in what order the
followers of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhnuld enter
into Paradiſe, determined it in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Souldiers ſlain in the
wars, that they were to have the
precedence; then the honeſt plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
afterward the Lawyers and
Prieſts; and the reſt promiſcuouſly
without any order at all, as they can
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53701:79"/>
paſs and get in in the croud. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
with theſe hopes, they are
almoſt unwilling to live; no danger
terrifies, death does not mate their
courage; the pleaſant and wanton
thoughts they entertain of their
Fools Paradiſe do ſo run in their
minds.</p>
            <p>They ſhew the ſame, if not a
greater, courage in keeping a forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
where they have fixt their
Half-Moon Standard; much more
a Town or City, where they have
built a <hi>Moſch,</hi> when beſieged by
<hi>Chriſtians;</hi> chuſing rather to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
all the hardſhips of a Siege, or
the moſt diſmal conſequences of an
aſſault, then any way think of a
ſurrender. This is a mighty piece
of Religion among them, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometaniſm</hi>
may looſe no ground;
rather than ſo, they will periſh, not
only without complaint and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
but willingly and with joy
too. Such a fatal obſtinacy are
they wrought up to by their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53701:79"/>
The great waſts, which are made
by plague and war,<note place="margin">Their Slaves.</note> are ſupplied by
the Slaves which are continually
brought into the Empire, and by
the multitude of women allowed by
the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> It is enough
to rend any heart, that gives way
to the leaſt impreſſions of pity, to
conſider the ſad condition of poor
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Captives in <hi>Turkey.</hi> They
are chiefly brought in yearly by the
<hi>Tartars,</hi> who make excurſions into
<hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia</hi> for ſeveral days
journeys, and upon their return
ſweep and carry all before them;
ſeveral Ships laden with them in
the Ports of the <hi>Black Sea</hi> (the
old name of <hi>Euxine</hi> being wholly
loſt and forgot) in the months of
<hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> arriving at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
This is the great Mart for
Slaves, where they are ſure to meet
with a quick and a good Market,
for no commodity is more vendible
or merchantable. Or elſe they are
brought along with the <hi>Caravans</hi>
from the fartheſt parts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in <hi>Aſia,</hi> out of <hi>Georgia</hi> and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53701:80"/>
               <hi>Mengrelia;</hi> wholly intent upon their
private gain in the ſale. The <hi>Tartars</hi>
while they enrich themſelves with
this kind of ſpoil, advance the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
intereſt of the <hi>Turks;</hi> that part
of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which they ravage,
being much weakned by the loſs of
thouſands, thus barbarouſly carried
into captivity, and their own Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
enlarged and ſtrengthened by
ſuch great acceſſions. For few ever
return to their native Country; and
fewer have the courage and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of retaining the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith,
in which they were educated; their
education being but mean, and their
knowledg but ſlight in the principles
and grounds of it; whereof ſome are
frighted into <hi>Turciſm</hi> by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
and too deep reſentments
of the hardſhips of the ſervitude;
others are enticed by the blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and flatteries of pleaſure the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Law allows, and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
they have of making their
condition better, and more eaſie by
a change of their Religion: having
no hopes left of being redeemed,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53701:80"/>
they renounce their <hi>Saviour</hi> and
their <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and ſoon forget
their original Country, and are no
longer lookt upon as ſtrangers, but
paſs for natives. Every <hi>Wedneſday</hi>
morning they are expoſed publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſale, like ſo many Horſes or
Sheep in a Fair, in a peculiar place
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which has the
name of <hi>Jazir Baſar,</hi> or the <hi>Slave-Market,</hi>
where is an eſtabliſht Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
to regiſter the ſales. The <hi>Area</hi>
of which is about fifty paces ſquare;
on the ſides of it are Chambers,
where uſually they put the women.
Here I have ſeen, not without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and confuſion of mind (for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was too mean a paſſion, and ſoon
ſwallowed up with ſo diſmal and
frightful a ſpectacle) above five
hundred at the ſame time, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
victims, ready to be offered to
<hi>Moloch.</hi> The poor Children, ſcarce
yet ſenſible of their misfortune, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
and ſilent; and the women, who
had any skill in Embroidery, at
work with their Needle; by which
artifice the Patrons think to put
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53701:81"/>
them off at better rates; feeding
them well before hand, that they
may look plump and fat, and ſeem
to be in good caſe, and putting them
on handſom clothes, the better to
attract a Chapman. There is ſcarce
a <hi>Turk,</hi> if he be of any faſhion, but
has one Slave at leaſt, and ſome of
them twenty, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their eſtates, and the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
they have of them. They are
their proper goods, and let them
out to hire ſometime; whatever they
get, is their Maſters, who have an
abſolute power and command over
them in all things, except in the
caſe of life and death; otherwiſe
be their uſage never ſo cruel and
barbarous, the poor wretch has no
remedy left but patience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
It is intereſt more than good
nature and humanity which makes
them uſe them well, and puts them
upon providing clothes, victuals,
and whatever is neceſſary to ſuſtain
life, that they may yeild them the
better ſervice, and for fear they
ſhould ſicken and dye; which would
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53701:81"/>
prove their loſs: the care of them
being only the ſame with that they
beſtow upon their Cattel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Baſſas</hi> and other great men
enjoy themſelves unto the height,<note place="margin">The Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezza of the <hi>Baſſas</hi> in what it conſists.</note>
out of foreſight, that in an Empire,
where all things are ſo uncertain,
and where happen daily ſuch ſudden
changes and traverſes of fortune,
they may be ſoon ſtript of all; they
will not loſe one jot of their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
but mightily pride themſelves
in it. In their Houſes indeed they
do not conſult pomp and beauty,
ſo much as largeneſs and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
their riches is more to be
ſeen in their Stables than in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
of their Rooms. No Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos,
no Courts laid out in exact
proportions, no Galleries adorned
with coſtly pieces of art, nothing
either for ſtate or pleaſure; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
being chiefly lookt after;
their diet too is courſe and mean,
and far from luxurious, and little
differing from that which ordinary
perſons content themſelves with.
Their magnificence appears in the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53701:82"/>
number of their Women, of their
Servants, and of their Slaves. Being
bred up Souldiers, their care and
glory is to provide for the ſecurity
of their Provinces by ſtores of Arms
and other warlike Proviſions; to
get an excellent breed of <hi>Arabian</hi>
Horſes, whoſe race they will run
you up to ſeveral ſcores of years;
and to have a conſiderable number of
brave, tall, and well proportion'd
young men to mount them, and to
be of their conſtant retinue. In this
piece of gallantry they ſtrive who
ſhall out-do the other; which they
think is true greatneſs.</p>
            <p>The law confines them to a ſet
number of Wives;<note place="margin">Number of Women-Slaves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</note> but for Women-Slaves
they are left to their own
choice and liberty. They may heap
up as many as their luſt and their
eſtate will and can give way to. It
is wholly indifferent of what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
they be, ſo they be not very
<hi>heathen.</hi> Over them they have a
full power, and can diſpose of them
according to their humour and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and ſend them to the Market,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53701:82"/>
when they are weary of them; it
being no unuſual thing for a poor
miſerable <hi>Chriſtian</hi> woman to be
ſold five or ſix times. I obſerved a
piece of cunning in the <hi>Jews,</hi> who
are well verſed in all the little tricks
and ſhifts of gain, and who uſually
thrive under all Governments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are tolerated: They buy
little Girls of five or ſix years of
age at the rate of thirty or forty
Dollars, and are mighty careful in
their education; teaching them to
dance and ſing, and inſtructing them
in all the ſorts of a winning beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
and the advantage they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
does fully anſwer their labour
and expence; theſe accompliſhments
rendring them valuable at twenty
times more than what they coſt;
being oftentimes taken into the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
or into the Families of the
<hi>Baſſas,</hi> the ordinary <hi>Turks</hi> having
not wherewithall to make ſuch a
purchaſe. And theſe mindful of the
kindneſs of their Educators, whoſe
chief deſign was their own profit,
which has been the happy occaſion
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53701:83"/>
of their preferment, do them, by
the intereſt they get in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Patrons, many real and great
kindneſſes. For the Captive-women
there is ſcarce any poſſibility to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape;
they are forced to keep at
home, and only divert themſelves
by looking through a lattice of an
upper Chamber, if they belong to
a perſon of any condition, who uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
keeps a <hi>Bagno</hi> in his houſe;
the meaner ſort only going abroad,
it being diſgraceful and ſcandalous to

            <p>Fury and impatience oftentimes
drive the Men-Slaves upon deſperate
attempts of eſcaping,<note place="margin">Men-Slaves often make eſcapes.</note> preferring their
liberty to the great hazard of being
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53701:83"/>
retaken and the ill conſequences of
it. Some have lain ſo long in the
woods, and other places, till they
have been forced by hunger into the
highways, which lead to Towns.
The <hi>Turks</hi> ſuſpect all ſtraglers, and
ſeize upon them either for their own
uſe, or upon the firſt notice given,
to reſtore them to their Patrons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they produce an <hi>Hogiet</hi> or Paper
under the <hi>Cadyes</hi> hand, that they
are free-men. Upon the abſence and
flight of a Slave they give notice far
and wide, and order ſeveral to watch
at Bridges, which they muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
paſs. When I paſſ'd the
Bridge laid over the <hi>Cayſter,</hi> not
far from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> too deep to be
forded, ſeveral <hi>Turks</hi> had fixt their
ſtation there, hoping at that paſs to
intercept the Slaves they were in
queſt and purſuit of, and taking us
to be as good <hi>Muſulmans</hi> as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
deſired us, that if in our travels
we met with any ſuch, whom they
deſcribed, we would ſtop them
and carry them before the next <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>
But for all this care on the one
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53701:84"/>
ſide, and hazard on the other, ſome
are ſo happy to get away, and are
mightily favoured in it, by the
<hi>Weſtern Chriſtians</hi> eſpecially, in a
Sea-Port Town, when the Ships are
upon their departure for <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
There is ſuch a viſible appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Providence in the following
ſtories, that I ſhould not pardon my
ſelf if I omitted them. A poor <hi>Ruſs</hi>
Lad, about twelve years old, being
evil intreated of his Maſter, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to try his fortune, and upon
the next opportunity in the evening
ſtole away. He gets haſtily over
the water out of the City, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant whither he went; a
good providence carried him to a
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Village about a mile from
<hi>Pera;</hi> he wanders up and down as
a Stranger, not knowing in that ſad
perplexity of mind, where he was,
or what he had to do, being equally
afraid to go or ſtay; it hapned,
that one of our <hi>Druggermen</hi> had at
that time buſineſs there, and eaſily
gueſſing him to be a poor <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
run away from his Maſter, the Lad
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53701:84"/>
confeſt it, and beg'd of him for
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake to take pity on him.
The good man promiſed him to take
care of him when it was a little dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
when he could do it with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſecurity, and with better hope of
ſucceſſ. About an hour and a half
in the night, he brought the Boy to
our Houſe to kiſs my <hi>Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi>'s
Veſt; immediately he was
put into a Livery, and a Perruke
given him, and kept within doors
for ſome time: but after he began
to talk <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he walked the ſtreets
ſecurely; ſo diſguised in his looks
and habit, that if his <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
had met him, he would not
have known him, he paſſing for
one who had come out of <hi>England</hi>
with us. The other is this, A few
days before we ſet ſail for <hi>Italy,</hi>
lying at Anchor in the Bay of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
about a League without the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
about midnight the Seamen,
who were upon the Watch, heard
a mournful voice of one in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
calling for help; they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
run to the ſides of the Ship,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53701:85"/>
and ſpy one almoſt quite ſpent with
ſwimming, and ready to ſink through
wearineſs; they throw out a Rope,
and get him aboard. We then lay
fourteen miles from the City, and
about a mile and a half from the
ſhore. When they had recovered
him with ſtrong-water and a warm
bed, he told us next day, that he
was a poor <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> of
nineteen or twenty years of age,
who was reſolved to make uſe of
that opportunity of recovering his
liberty; that he got in the evening
out of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and kept along the
ſhore, till he came to the place over
againſt which our Ship rode: a calm
Sea and a bright Star-light night fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
the bold adventure, ſo that
he had the Ship always in his eye;
but the diſtance deceived him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
greater than he expected. He
throwing away his upper Veſt into
the Sea, that it might be no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to him in ſwimming, committed
himſelf to the goodneſs of <hi>God</hi> and
the water, and with much a-do got
to us. We put him into <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:53701:85"/>
habit, like one of the Seamen; but
for his and our greater ſecurity, the
<hi>Turkiſh Cuſtomers</hi> being within a
day or two to ſearch the Veſſel, leſt
they ſhould give us or the Merchants
any trouble, if they found him with
us, our Captain deſired the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War,
that lay in the Bay, to receive him
till we ſet ſail: within four days,
when we were out of all danger, we
received him again, and brought
him for <hi>England.</hi>

no Chriſtian to come nigh them:

were ſo great, that without the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

            <p>The other Slaves,<note place="margin">Slaves in private mens hands</note> who are in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

the greater price their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Maſters ſet upon their heads;
a ſeeming indifference, whether they

beat down the ranſome. They have

that they were to thank themſelves

their Places and Governments upon

            <p>If when they are ſeparated from

both ſhip and men are their own;

            <p>Fifty pounds ſterling is an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

We had a great mind to ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
one honeſt man above the reſt,
and offered a conſiderable ſum of
Money for his ranſom; but it was
refuſed, and would have been, though
we had doubled it. For they could
not, it ſeems, well ſpare him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sail-maker by his profeſſion,
whom they continually employed;
and being ſenſible how uſeful he was
to them, they uſed him very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſo that he could complain of
nothing but the bare want of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Others of theſe <hi>Beyes</hi> out of
pride and peculiar hatred to the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> name and of our Nation,
were ſo obſtinate and inflexible, that
they were not to be moved or
wrought upon, by any overtures of
Money, to part with their Slaves;
which diſtemper we found moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Rhodus;</hi> whoſe
example is an inſtance of the laſting
revenge of <hi>Turks,</hi> which only death
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53701:91"/>
can extinguiſh. His Father had
been Captain <hi>Baſſa,</hi> and having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

the Islands and the coaſts of <hi>Greece,</hi>
went with his Fleet into the <hi>Sinus
Euboeensis,</hi> now called the Gulph of
<hi>Volo,</hi> to the N. of <hi>Boeotia</hi> or <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi>
where were two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships
at anchor, taking in Corn, which was
contraband, for <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> which
he made ſure of, as lawful prize, and
promiſed himſelf an eaſy victory.
The poor Mariners who knew the
danger, and the inconvenience they
were put to for want of Sea-room,
being not able to turn and wind
their Ships, were reſolved however
to fight and die, rather than tamely
yield; there was no hope of flight,
or ſafety, or victory; which made
them the more deſperate. He ſends
them an inſolent ſummons to deliver
up themſelves immediately; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he would beat their Ships
about their ears; and threatens
them with preſent death. This moſt
diſmal accident, inſtead of abating,
increaſed their ſtrength, and made
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53701:91"/>
them the more furious. The <hi>Turks</hi>
fight for prey, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> only
for revenge; and overpreſt with the
diſproportioned number of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi>
moſt of them die bravely, ſome
few unhappily ſurviving to be the
triumph and ſport of their cruelty.
But the <hi>Captain Baſſa,</hi> who thought
to gratify his covetous, proud, and
revengeful humour, was killed in the
fight with a Muſket; the manner of
whoſe death the Son ſo implacably
reſented, vowing revenge upon the
whole Nation for the miſfortune of
it, though it hapned above forty
years ago; getting as many <hi>Engliſh</hi>
as he can, either by money or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
into his hands, and uſing them
with all imaginable cruelty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
to pleaſe his Father's angry
Ghoſt. He had about ten in his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
whom he would not part

rendred them leſs able to endure the

the pleaſantneſs, and ſweetneſs and
refreſhing qualities of Wine,) and
even force their very natures and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to a ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>I expected to have found them
as abſtemious as they have been
fam'd to be,<note place="margin">But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Turks</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched with it.</note> and that no ſuch thing
as drunkenneſs was to be ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong
them, or but rarely at leaſt;
this being the peculiar vice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they uſed to upbraid the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
and <hi>Jews:</hi> but I quickly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53701:93"/>
found, that riot and the love of Wine
were too ſtrong for their firſt belief
and education; and that the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of Senſe had beaten down
the commands of Religion; that
generally all, not only the <hi>Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>
but natural <hi>Turks,</hi> Citizens and
Souldiers, were exceſſively given to
it; except the Prieſts and old men,
and ſuch as had been at <hi>Mecca,</hi>
whoſe age, and profeſſion, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life rendred them averſe from
doing a thing ſo indecent and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous;
and that a man could not
do a <hi>Turk</hi> a greater civility and
kindneſs, or more oblige them, than
by giving them Wine. For the ſake
of this they would viſit the houſes
of <hi>Christians,</hi> and not be ſatisfied
without it. They are for the pure
blood of the grape, and wonder at
our ſpoiling the Wine by our mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of water, and think they have
not drank enough, till they are able
to drink no more. The late <hi>Vizir</hi>
himſelf was not free from this vice
of exceſſive drinking. For being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
(much about the time of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53701:93"/>
taking of <hi>Candia</hi>) by his Phyſician a
little to tranſgreſs the law of his
Prophet for his health ſake, he no
ſooner had taſted the ſweetneſs of
Wine, (for till that time he was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ignorant whether it were ſweet
or bitter) but he loved it ever after;
and was almoſt angry with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
for forbidding a liquor ſo
grateful to the palate; as I believe
he was with himſelf, for living in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
ſo long: it being his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
practice, upon his return from
that Island, to indulge himſelf in it
in the afternoon, when he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
the weighty affairs of the
Empire, relying, I ſuppoſe, upon the
ſtrength of a Proverb that holds as
true in <hi>Turkey</hi> as in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi>
That he who is a wiſe man in the day,
will not be accounted a fool at
night.</p>
            <p>This defection was ſo groſſ, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and notorious, that it alarm'd
the <hi>Church-men,</hi> and filled them with
anger and zeal, which broke out in
bitter invectives; they thunder out
of their Pulpits, that their Religion
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53701:94"/>
and Empire were both like to be at
an end ſpeedily, that the violation
portended nothing but ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation;
that the crime grew to
that exceſs and height, that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
almoſt to be above expiation. But
the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> no way moved with
their zeal, drink on ſtill. At laſt a
certain Prieſt, one <hi>Vani Ephendi,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for his eloquence, and who had
gained a mighty opinion in the
<hi>Court</hi> for his pretenſions to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
piety, (conſisſtent, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and law of the Countrey, with a
multitude of women, which he kept)
upon <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s birth-day, took the
liberty in an harangue before the
Emperor, to put him in mind of the
quarrels of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by this devilliſh liquor, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in his very ſight, and near his
Tent; that this was of evil Omen
to the Government; that the ſtate
of affairs were in an ill condition;
that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> were highly
angry and offended at the practice of
ſo much lewdneſs, which was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
tolerated; and that their
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53701:94"/>
holy <hi>Religion</hi> was in great danger
of being loſt by ſuch prophanation.
He very tragically and paſſionately
laments the miſcarriage; then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
and beſeeches with mighty
earneſtneſs and zeal the <hi>Emperour,</hi>
to think of a fit remedy, that may
put a ſtop to this growing evil: and
for fear his perſwasions might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
he tells him he ſhall never
enter into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and thereatens
him with everlaſting puniſhment in
the other World, unleſs he removes
this grievous Scandal. The <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> was then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid by the Emperor to be drank all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over.</note>
who commands immediately the
Taverns of the poor <hi>Greeks</hi> to be
ſhut up; and the Caſks of Wine,
the occaſion of this great diſorder,
to be ſtaved in the open ſtreets; and
iſſues forth his Royal command, that
no more Wine ſhould be drank all
the Empire over. I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
with what horrour the
<hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> received the
news, how amazed and diſheartned
and how they lamented and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the miſfortune, being ready to act
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53701:95"/>
the Deſperadoes: but their trouble
and ſolicitude are to no purpoſe, the
<hi>Emperour</hi> commands, and he muſt
be obeyed. The <hi>Turks</hi> enter the
Cellars of the publick houſes, and
ſpoil all the Veſſels they light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had not prevented them by
their over haſt, for fear they ſhould
be thought to have diſliked or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed
the <hi>Edict;</hi> for that was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal,
and took in <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
as well as <hi>Turks.</hi> For they for
the future muſt abſtain from Wine
out of reſpect to the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s
command, as the <hi>Turks</hi> out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> are always guilty of
Extreams; when once they have
determined upon a thing, though
never ſo raſhly and without the due
examination of circumſtances, or the
miſchiefs that may follow, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
proceed to execution. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they do, they do it with ſo
much impetuoſity and fury, that
equity and clemency and civility
are wholly laid aſide. To add geater
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53701:95"/>
force and authority to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and to ſtrike a terror into the
people, a ſevere penalty is threatned
to be inflicted upon the tranſgreſſor:
the fear of which made them forbear
drinking Wine in private, leſt their
very breath ſhould betray them.
The <hi>Christians,</hi> who were leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
herein, ſuffered the puniſhment
of their own folly. For I knew ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of them faulty herein ſeized
upon in the ſtreets, and condemned
to the Galleys. Our Drugger-men
would never venture to drink a glaſs
of Wine, whenſoever they croſſed
the waters and went, as they had
occaſion, for the buſineſs of my Lord
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> and the Nation, to the
<hi>Caimaicam</hi>'s houſe; for this had
been an affront, and conſequently an
aggravation of their fault, for a
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> reeking with Wine to
breath in a <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s face.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>Chriſtian
Ambaſſadors</hi> were concerned,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the <hi>Chriſtian Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> for this ſevere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition.</note> leſt

were no Vintage the following Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn,
ſhould be involved under the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53701:96"/>
ſame Inconveniencies; for the
<hi>Greeks</hi> out of deſpair left off culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
their Vineyards, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bare Grapes, whereof there
is ſuch plenty, worth the labour and
coſt and time; and it was juſtly to
be feared, leſt the Cuſtomers in the
Sea-port Towns would prove fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and troubleſom, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any Veſſels of Wine ſent for
Preſents out of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to be
carried to their Palaces. The <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes</hi>
too were very fierce in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of this Order; ſome out of
zeal to Religion, others out of a
principle of obſtinacy and ill will to
the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> others out of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
to get money for a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
and Diſpensation. This laſt
made the <hi>Cady</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſo fierce
upon the poor Religious of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Communions of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
there, ſo as to forbid them the uſe
of Wine in the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
he did but his duty to the
<hi>Emperour,</hi> when it was a luſty Bribe
the Villain aimed at, knowing the
obligations their Religion and their
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53701:96"/>
vows laid upon them of celebrating
a daily Maſſ, as the event ſoon
ſhewed.</p>
            <p>During this diſorder the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors<note place="margin">Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate upon it.</note>
ſend their <hi>Druggermans</hi> (for
ſo they call the Interpreters they
make uſe of in tranſacting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns)
to repreſent to the <hi>Viſir</hi> and
other <hi>Baſſas</hi> the injuſtice of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
them under the prohibition;
that it would be a prejudice to their
health, to be forced upon the liquors
of the Countrey, to which they had
not been accuſtomed; and that it
was againſt the law of Nations that
they ſhould be deprived of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of humane life; upon
a debate in their <hi>Divan,</hi> the requeſt
ſeemed juſt and reaſonable, and fit
to be complied with, that they
ſhould have a liberty of making
what quantity of Wine they pleaſed
for their own uſes; for they would
extend the priviledge no further.
The Ambaſſadors were unſatisfied
with this order, but made further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
that all the <hi>Weſtern Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
who were under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53701:97"/>
diſpersed in the ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
of the Empire, might enjoy
the ſame favour. The <hi>Baſſas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
upon it, and pretend this would
enervate the force of the Emperor's
edict; and that ſuch a conceſſion
would have an evil influence upon
the Government, which is preſerved
by a punctual ſubmiſſion to his will
and pleaſure, which was the higheſt
reaſon of a law. All likelyhood of
ſucceſs ſeemed to vaniſh; our <hi>Drug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german</hi>
however was commanded
to attend, and take all opportunities
of making new propoſals in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's
name: The matter is put off
from day to day, but at laſt (for it
was four months firſt) being wearied
with continued demands, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
their obſtinacy with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to be overcome.</p>
            <p>The drinking of diſtilled liquors
was equally forbid;<note place="margin">Strong wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid.</note> for the <hi>Turks</hi>
ſeemed more pleaſed with them than
with Wine, as affecting their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
and brain with greater heats
and tittillations. Neither <hi>Turks</hi> nor
<hi>Greeks</hi> are ſkilful in the arts of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53701:97"/>
diſtillations; but do it in ſo rude
and groſs a way, as that it rather
ſeems a boyling of liquors, than a
ſeparating the pure and ſpirituous
parts from the groſs and ſaeculent;
which makes a company of Brutes,
who make ſenſe if not the only yet
the leading principle of life ſo mad
for ſtrong waters ſent out of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi>
diſtilled with ſo much art
and coſt, out of ſpices, herbs, and ſuch
like hot materials and ingredients.
They have no moderation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over themſelves or appetite,
and think it can never be ſatiſfied,
unleſs cloyed with exceſs. And if
any <hi>Turk,</hi> who indulges himſelf in
the drinking of Wine or ſtrong Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
does not loſe his reaſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
ſober from ſuch a debauch, it
muſt be wholly imputed to the
ſtrength of his brain, not to his good
will, much leſs to his virtue.</p>

            <p>But which is moſt peculiar to
them,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of <hi>Opium</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them</note> is the uſe of crude <hi>Opium,</hi>
which they ſwallow whole in little
pills without any the leaſt maſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The ſtomack performing its
vital function in the opening and
diſſolving this concreted juice, the
brain feels the violent operation of
it; the ſpirits are put into a rapid
motion; a vertigo ſeizes upon the
perſon; and a kind of <hi>delirium,</hi>
which takes away the free and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
uſe of reaſon; if they walk,
their motion is very unſteady, like
men who are drunk or mad; and
their tongues faltering, and the whole
body diſordered. A thouſand fooliſh
ideas of things poſſeſs their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
their fancies are then moſt
raving, as if all that time they were
as happy as the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53701:98"/>
They think this the greateſt
pleaſure of life, which they can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
at the rate of a few aſpers;
for to this purpoſe ſome vile perſons
take it, as they do Wine, being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of no greater pleaſure than
what ariſes from a preternatural

there being no eſtablisht con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of Letters all <hi>Turkey</hi> over,
(which is one argument of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſneſſ)
their ſervice is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and neceſſary. They are reduced
to a ſet company, and have a <hi>Chief</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:53701:99"/>
over them, who diſpatches them to
the ſeveral parts of the Empire; and
they perform great journeys with
incredible haſte, unleſs when the
ways are rendred unpaſſable by deep
ſnow or great rain and inundations
of waters, and are very faithful in
the diſcharge of their truſt. Dozed
and intoxicated with <hi>Opium,</hi> they
go on their way, and have juſt ſo
much ſenſe left as to know they are
not out of it; at firſt they ſhake off
the drouzineſs, which the poiſonous
medicament brings upon them, by
a continual agitation of the body;
and when they are tired and forced
to reſt, they are content with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſleep as poſſible, not lying ſtretcht
out to their full length, but leaning
down with their backs againſt a wall
or banke, with their knees againſt
their belly to keep it warm; every
one knows his convenient doſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his ſtrength and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
ſome will receive the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of a little pea, as ordinarily as
they do their daily food, or rather
make that ſerve for it; ſtronger ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks

How ſmall a part of that, which
cuſtom has made ſo neceſſary to
their lives, as that they cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
ſo much as one day, would put
us into our laſt ſleep, and awaken us
in another World! This affected
phrenzy has this event uſually, the
ſpirits being ſo often fired and put
into a preternatural motion, their
whole force being ſpent, grow dull
and torpid; their looks pale and
frightful, like men diſtracted; their
eyes ſunk in their heads; a palſy in
their hands, and all the infirmities of
old age ſeizing upon them in the
time of their manhood: ſo that they
appear to be as ſo many walking
ghoſts. Which horrid and neceſſary
effects of it have of late made the
uſe of it leſs frequented among the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53701:100"/>
more conſidering <hi>Turks,</hi> who are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
their exceſſes and debaucheries
with Wine are leſs dangerous and
pernicious to their health. I know
not how true the experiment is, but
this is certain, that thoſe who uſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi>
abſtain moſt carefully, for ſome
time at leaſt, from drinking cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,:
which they ſay would cauſe
death incurably, though without any
convulſion or agonies. This is the
only uſe of <hi>Opium</hi> with them, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of correcting its noxious and
ſtupifying qualities, and ſo making
it fit for medicine.</p>
            <p>There is ſo great and univerſal a

of eating Swines-fleſh,<note place="margin">Swines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</note> that the

and void of all conſcience, who dares
defile his ſoul with it, as they firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe it does; which opinion is
ſo rooted in their minds, that they
may be ſooner brought to renounce
any part of their Religion, than this
particular inſtitution. Thoſe who
will indulge themſelves to drinke
Wine, abhor the very thought of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53701:100"/>

in their children toward it,
they teach them, as ſoon as they
can ſpeak, to call <hi>Christians</hi> by the
opprobrious name of <hi>Hogs;</hi> which
hatred grows up with their years;
ſo that they had rather die with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
than meddle with ſuch profane
and curſed diet, in what ſtrait or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of life ſoever. The very ſight
of a Hog puts ſome into a fright
and trembling, which ſoon paſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fretting and indignation; and
woe to the poor Swine, if the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
come in their way; for they
are ſure to come by the worſt of it,
if they eſcape being killed with their
ſmall ſhot; the ſteams of the dreſſed

<hi>Turk</hi> condeſcends to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
by a <hi>Christian,</hi> great care is
taken that nothing may be ſerved up
of Hogs-fleſh, however diſguised:
for this would be an affront not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Perſon, but Religion, and
would fright him from the table.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53701:101"/>
Which I remember hapned particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
at a worthy <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant's

was ſuch a Gueſt in the company,
ſent up a meſs of Pork, which one
of the ſervants as ignorantly put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the table. The <hi>Turk</hi> ſuſpecting
what it was, aſked the queſtion, the
thing being confeſſed, (for there was
no poſſible denying or diſſembling it)
he riſes from his ſeat in great haſte
as one out of his wits, looks about
for water, and obſerving a little Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
in one corner of the room (as
is uſual) waſhes his hands, mouth,
and noſtrils, as if all had been pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,
and left us immediately in
great diſdain, though fully ſatiſfied
it was a miſtake, and no way out of
deſign. The <hi>Greeks</hi> who live in Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
apart from <hi>Turks,</hi> breed up
theſe creatures not ſo much for their
own uſe, as to ſell them to the <hi>We,

Ships for their Sea-proviſion; a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg
which they are forced to buy
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53701:101"/>

with greater ſecurity, the <hi>Drugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
are forced to procure a warrant
from the <hi>Caimacam</hi> every year at
the beginning of Winter; and then
the Swineherd muſt remain in the
fields, in ſome by-place out of the
road, till the dusk of the evening;
at which time the <hi>Turks,</hi> not uſed to
ſtay out late, retire to their houſes;
there being as great ſilence at an
hour and an half in the night as at

taken to prevent and take off all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

and fork, tearing the fleſh aſunder
with their fingers; a wooden ſpoon
being the chief furniture of their
table. There are ſome diſhes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the great mens tables,
which an <hi>European</hi> ſtomack, though
not nice and curious, would reject;
fiſh and ſoul, though they have in
abundance, they do not much affect.
They cut the fleſh they roaſt into
little mammocks, and put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wooden ſpits. The common food
of the <hi>Levant</hi> from <hi>Constantinople</hi>
to the walls of <hi>China</hi> and beyond,
is Rice; which they diſguise with
ſeveral colours with ſaffron and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts of ſeeds and juices which
yields hearty nouriſhment. The
uſual time of dinner is about nine
of the clock in the morning; they
ſit cloſe and round a copper veſſel,
placed upon a ſtool a foot and half
high from the ground, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
their plates and diſhes
either of tin or earth; (for the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53701:102"/>
their meat in great haſte, as if they
ſtrove who ſhould eat moſt, or have
done firſt. This Paragraph of their
diet I ſhould altogether have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

if it did not conduce
ſomewhat to the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Their Weddings are celebrated
with great noiſe and tumult;<note place="margin">Their Weddings.</note> the
Bride muffled up and covered with
a red veil is brought home on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
riding aſtride, attended by her
relations and friends, and Muſick
playing before, and the boys running
up and down and making a confuſed
noiſe. This is the firſt day of their
coming together; the whole buſineſs
of the contract and marriage being
managed in their abſence by the
friends of each party. But foraſmuch
as the <hi>Mahometan</hi> law permits the
man to put away his wife upon every
ſlight occaſion, that they may not
leave their Daughters wholly at the
mercy of their Huſbands, whoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
are ſo fickle and inconstant,

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53701:103"/>
to provide better againſt it, a Writing
is ſigned before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> whereby
they oblige themſelves to make ſuch

turn them off: which allowance is
exacted as a juſt debt and always

is invited to the Nuptial entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

though otherwiſe not much better

go abroad without a keeper; barr'd
from all outward converſation; their
Brothers grown up to be men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied

or thrice in a year, and then in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53701:103"/>
preſence of their jealous Husbands:
forced thus to live an idle and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick
kind of life at home, their
chiefeſt diverſion is to bath often, or
to ſtand at their lattice-window to
obſerve the paſſengers; but the good
Houſewives, who are almoſt dead
with this idle and dull kind of
life, deceive the ſlow hours by
embroidering Handkerchiefs and
Quilts. Their chiefeſt care is how
to pleaſe their Husbands, in whoſe
favour they place their happineſs;
it being in their power to retain
them, or put them away; ſo that
their obſervance and love ſpring
wholly from a principle of fear.
Examples of which ſeverity are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;

to reaſſume them, unleſs after

of folly is eſtablisht by law, and is
horribly diſgraceful; a greater curſe

firſt thought he could not wiſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

by <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to fight, if he did not
meet him and joyn battel upon a
certain day. The <hi>Jews</hi> practice the
ſame liberty of divorcing themſelves
from their Wives, allowed by <hi>Moſes</hi>
for the hardneſs of their hearts. A
certain <hi>Jew</hi> had bebauched a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi>
Wife to another of his own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which being known, the man
was excommunicated, and turned
out of the Synagogue, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
lockt up and deprived of her
liberty. But they were reſolved to
keep company together, and by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
conſent turn <hi>Turks,</hi> to the great
forrow and regret of the Husband,
from whom ſhe was violently forced
away. At laſt being convinced of
her ſin, and her <hi>Jew-Turk-Gallant</hi>
weary of her, ſhe is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to her firſt Husband; but this
was inconſiſtent, ſhe being an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi>
with the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
with the law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which
forbids any <hi>Turkiſh</hi> woman to marry

into a condition to receive her,
he turns <hi>Turk,</hi> and marries her, the
other having given her a Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.
After ſome time they both
go to <hi>Salonichi,</hi> where is the greateſt

proper in the caſe. This care and
kindneſs continue as long as there
is hope of life; but when that is
paſt, and the pangs of death ſeize
upon the perſon, the Prieſt or any
other whiſpers ſeveral times in his
ear, and puts him in mind of that
uſual form, of the profeſſion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometiſm,</hi>
that there is no <hi>God</hi> but
<hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
They are much concerned for
them in their agonies, and expreſs
it by their looks and by their moan;
but when once they are dead, their
mourning and trouble are at an end;
they ceaſe from all complaints, and
ſcarce a ſigh to be hard, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, as a finding fault with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of <hi>God</hi> Almighty and a reſiſting
his will. The dead body is perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with Frankincenſe, carefully
waſhed with clean ſoap and warm
water, and ſowed up in linnen: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
towards the head and feet,
(which are left free, that the perſon
may ſtand on his legs, and ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the grave, when he gives an
account of his faith to the <hi>Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53701:105"/>

ground. They have not the art of
embalming. Their Funerals are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
without Obſequies;<note place="margin">Their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</note> no
ſhew, or pomp, or expence in the

lighted Tapers and Torches, and the
Prieſts their Cenſers, and hire wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to cut and tear their hair, and
is a neceſſary part of the ſolemnity.
The Prieſt uſually goes before the
corps mumbling out ſomewhat, who
ſays peculiar prayers for the ſoul of
the dead perſon at his grave; nigh
which he ſtands alone by himſelf,
the reſt about twenty foot diſtant,
and there reads ſome ſhort Chapters
of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Then he gravely
admoniſhes him about the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of his Religion, that the
<hi>Angel Inquiſitor</hi> may not ſurprize
him, and find him unprepared with
ſutable anſwers; and that he boldly
confeſs that <hi>God</hi> is the Creator, and
<hi>Mahomet</hi> his Meſſenger, and that he
uſed in his prayers to turn his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53701:106"/>
               <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the like; which
ceremony being finiſh'd, they lay the
body in the ground, and wiſh the
man a good ſucceſs in his examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Their care and reſpect is not
confined to the grave; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
Money to the poor to pray for
their ſouls, which they believe find
eaſe and benefit by their ſuffrages,
and often go themſelves to their
graves, out of love and reſpect to
their memory. Some Emperors and
great men have left lands for theſe
very purpoſes, that theſe religious
offices may never be omitted. Their
women are not permitted to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at a Funeral; only the laſt day
of <hi>Ramazan,</hi> as I ſaid before, they
are allowed to go to the publick
burying places. Theſe burying-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are without the City,<note place="margin">Their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> and uſually

muſt dye alſo, and ſerve for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

ſomewhat hollow, that they may
the better riſe and ſit before the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53701:106"/>
               <hi>Angels,</hi> planks being laid athwart to
keep the ſand and duſt, that cover
them, from falling upon them. At
the extremities are erected two
broken pieces of pillars (which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
belong'd to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
or great ſtones, ſome of which
are between four and five yards
high, as I found by meaſure in the
burying-place of <hi>Galata.</hi> They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
doing any poſſible injury to the
dead; their bones lye quiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed;
they do not dig up a
grave a ſecond time; every one has
his grave apart; no mixture of aſhes
or bones, which are as ſafely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
as if they were in diſtinct
urnes and peculiar vaults and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories:
The ſepulchral monuments
of the great men are made of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,<note place="margin">Their Tombes.</note>
well cut and ſmoothed, in the
faſhion of a cheſt, whoſe cover is
taken off, with a ſtone-step running
round and jetting out. Both ſides
are adorned with gilt circles, and
one at each end, the intermedial
ſpaces being filled up with flowers,
very handſomely wrought; for here
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53701:107"/>
as in their cielings they ſhew their
ſkill of engraving and painting.
Statuary and drawing a mans face
they do not pretend to in the leaſt;
this being altogether unlawful; which
makes them ſo brutiſhly fierce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all humane figures, whether
wrought by the chezil or pencil. In
either of the extremes is placed a
pillar, which riſing from a ſquare, ends
in a cone; on the tip of which is plac'd
a turbant, or a cap, ſuch as the women
wear, to diſtinguish whoſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
is. Theſe monuments are
in the open air. The Emperors and
great men lie buried in Cities, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
Chappels, which they have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
&amp; built for this very purpoſe.</p>
            <p>An Oath is of great force with

cauſes;<note place="margin">Their Oaths.</note> they lay their hands
upon the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and call <hi>God</hi> to
witneſs to the truth of what they

put to their forehead, having firſt
waſhed their hands; for no unclean
perſon muſt dare to touch it, as they
are warned by the inſcription, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53701:107"/>
is always on the outſide cover of
the book. If any <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Jew</hi>
are to give in witneſs upon Oath,
they adjure them to tell the truth
of what they know, making them
alſo lay their hands upon the holy
<hi>Goſpels</hi> or books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> An <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Gentleman being cited before a
<hi>Cady</hi> as a witneſs of a bargain, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
appeared, and was very willing
to take his Oath, as he could do
moſt conſcientiously and religiouſly;
but they wanted a book to ſwear
him, which put a ſudden ſtop to the
conteſtation and trial; after much
ſearch among the neighbouring
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they brought in an old
<hi>Latin</hi> book, which they took for
the Goſpels; He quickly perceiving
what it was, began to refuſe, till his
Interpreter, from whom I received
this account, told him, that ſuch a
ſcrupuloſity would ſpoil the cauſe,
and make the <hi>Turks</hi> ſuſpect the
truth of his teſtimony; that it was
brought there inſtead of the book
of the Goſpels, and that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by them ſo to be; and that it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53701:108"/>
was the ſame thing in effect, as if
the original hand-writing of the
<hi>Evangelists</hi> were put into his hands;
wrought upon by theſe arguments,
he took his Oath accordingly.</p>
            <p>Some of them will ſwear horribly
in their private diſcourſe; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
out of deſign to gain belief,
and ſometimes in their paſſion; and
the forms are very odd, and which
are not worth being recited or
known. But it is the higheſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs
in the world not to believe
them, when they ſwear one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Oath; for then they are moſt
ſerious, and deſire to remove all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſuſpicion of falſhood; which is, <hi>by
the truth of the four books the thing
is ſo or ſo, or I will do this or that;</hi>
meaning the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>David,</hi> the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>

            <p>From the Caſtle there runs down
Eaſtward a good part of the hill a
ſtone-wall; at the end of which
ſome ruines of a fortification, that
ſeems to have been built for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of it that way.</p>
            <p>The ancient Stone-buildings, now
the ordinary dwelling houſes of the
<hi>Turks,</hi> ſtill continue in ſeveral ſtreets;
the City by this means retaining
ſomewhat of its former glory, amidſt
thoſe many and vaſt ruines that lye
about it, contrary to the fate of other
Churches; moſt of whoſe ancient
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53701:114"/>
ſtructures are wholly ruined, and
pitiful <hi>Turkiſh</hi> houſes built of earth
baked in the Sun, and beggerly Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
raiſed upon their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>We went firſt to ſee the ruines of
a Palace, (as it is judged to be) which
lye in a ſtreet to the Eaſt part of the
City; where we found five Pillars
of poliſhed Marble, of about ſeven
yards in length, the Chapiters curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
wrought, in a line equally
diſtant: and further on, there being
a larger ſpace between, two other
Pillars; all which ſerve now only
as ſo many props to ſupport a wall
that is built cloſe to them. They are
confronted on the other ſide of the
ſtreet with other Pillars of the ſame
make, but whoſe Chapiters are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
two lying along upon the
ground.</p>
            <p>More Eaſtward toward the plain
lye very famous ruines of a Church
dedicated to St. <hi>John,</hi> built of brick;
about fifty ſix paces in length, and
in bredth thirty two; the walls of
a very great heigth, two rows of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53701:115"/>
windows on each ſide. Several Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
fixt within the body of the
Church, but broken of, and wanting
much of their due height: the
<hi>Turks</hi> not willing to be at any pains
to clear the earth where they are
fixt, and the broken pieces ſerving
their purpoſe as well; which is to
place them at the extremities of
their graves: abundance of which
we found in their burying-places in
our travels where ever we came. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Eaſt end, a large Vault. On
each ſide of the Church is a round
building, the one exactly agreeing
with the other. The doors very
high; oppoſite to which is a great
Nicchio or cavity in the wall; a
Vault underneath ſuſtained by a
great Pillar; the foundation ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
by ſeveral arches and pillars;
it is eighteen of my paces in diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
within; the walls very thick.</p>
            <p>In the upper part of the City is
the Rivolet <hi>Selinus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Selinus.</note> whoſe ſtream is
very ſwift, running toward the
South South-eaſt into the <hi>Caicus;</hi>
over which are built ſeveral Stone-bridges;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53701:115"/>
ſome with two, ſome with
three arches. By the ſtream not far
from the great Church, part of a
wall is yet ſtanding of about ninety
paces.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of <hi>Selinus</hi> is a
very handſome and large Church,
formerly called <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> into
which you aſcend by ſeveral ſtone-ſtairs;
now polluted by the <hi>Turks,</hi>
and made a <hi>Moſch.</hi> We obſerved a
paſſage under ground from the Caſtle
to the <hi>Selinus,</hi> by which they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
themſelves with water. Along
the ſide of a hill from the South-weſt
are the remainders of an Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>On a hill to the weſt of the City
we met with ſeveral vaſt ruines with
ſix great arches over a water, which
ſeems to have been formerly a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-shore;
and South of this ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
range of ſix arches more, with
two large rooms. The former of
theſe ruines the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Kiz-serai</hi>
or the <hi>Womens Seraglio;</hi> telling us,
that anciently they were kept there,
accommodating according to their
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53701:116"/>
rude conception of things, who have
not the leaſt knowledg of Antiquity,
the cuſtoms of former ages to the
practice of their Emperor at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
and fancying them to
have been the very ſame.</p>
            <p>More Southward is another great
ruined building with arches, ſituated
pleaſantly upon a hill; from whence
we had a good proſpect of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and the neighbouring Plain; hard
by which is a Theatre, that opens
to the South, the marks of the ſteps
ſtill remaining. In the declivity of
which almoſt at the bottom is a
Marble-ſtone about ſeven ſpans in
length and two in bredth, with this
inſcription, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. On the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
ſide a Marble ſtatue about two
or three foot in the rubbiſh, which
we cauſed to be removed by a poor
<hi>Christian;</hi> this being the only way
to preſerve it; the <hi>Turks</hi> being ſuch
profeſt enemies to all humane figures,
whether painted, or in Moſaick, or
wrought in Braſs or Marble, that it
would quickly be defaced and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
if it appeared above ground.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53701:116"/>
As we walk'd in the ſtreets, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ſeveral Vaults almoſt every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>We went to ſee ſeveral ruines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a quarter of a mile out of
Town, to the S. W. which ſeem to
have been a fortification; under
which are ſeveral Vaults that open
one into another, which ſerve not
only for the foundation of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but might alſo very convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be made uſe of for a granary to
lay their ſtores in, though now only
a receptacle of cattel.</p>
            <p>To the South much about the
ſame diſtance are two mounts oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
one to the other, raiſed artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to command the paſſage, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Avenues that way; in the
mid way lies the road: and the
like toward the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the Chriſtians here
is very ſad and deplorable, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not above fifteen families of
them: their chief employment is
gardening, by which they make a
ſhift to get a little money to pay
their <hi>harache,</hi> and ſatisfy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53701:117"/>
of their cruel and greedy
oppreſſors, and maintain a ſad miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life. They have one Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to St. <hi>Theodore;</hi> the Biſhop
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> under whoſe juriſdiction
they are, taking care to ſend a Prieſt
to officiate among them.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Bagno</hi> we found an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
jarr of marble, not unlike a
font; about five or ſix foot from
the pavement, very neer ſeven yards

ſome fixt in the ground, and others
lying upon the graſs, no other ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
being near. From this Village

            <p>
               <hi>Thyatira</hi> (called by the <hi>Turks Ak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſar</hi>
or the white Caſtle) a City of
<hi>Lydia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Thyatira.</note> is diſtant from <hi>Pergamus</hi>
about forty eight miles; almoſt
South-eaſt, ſituated in a ſpacious
plain about two miles and an half in
compaſs. Very few of the ancient
buildings remain here; one we ſaw,
which ſeems to have been a market-place,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53701:118"/>
having ſix pillars ſunk very
low in the ground, about four ſpans
only left above. We could not find
any ruines of Churches; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of the <hi>Turks</hi> about it, they
told us there were ſeveral great
buildings of ſtone under ground,
which we were very apt to believe
from what we had obſerved in other
places, where digging ſomewhat
deep, they met with ſtrong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
that without all queſtion
have formerly ſupported great build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but the deſcriptions of the
Ancients and the ſeveral inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that we found there put it out
of doubt, that this is the true <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira:</hi>
though the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who are
prodigiouſly ignorant of their own
Antiquities, take <hi>Tyreh,</hi> a Town
twenty five miles to the South-eaſt
of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to be the place, being
deceived by the neerneſs of the ſound
the one has with the other; upon
the ſame weak pretence, as they
have miſtaken hitherto <hi>Laotik,</hi> a
Town not far from <hi>Ancyra (Angury</hi>
the <hi>Turks</hi> call it) in <hi>Galatia,</hi> for
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53701:119"/>
               <hi>Laodicea;</hi> when we have moſt
authentick proofs that it is placed
neer to the river <hi>Lycus,</hi> and not far
from <hi>Hierapolis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the pedeſtal of a pillar in the
middle of a market-place covered,
we found this inſcription engraven

about a mile off; there being above

it to every part of it. It is

            <p>As in the City we found ſeveral
ſtones that had the name of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi>
engraven on them.</p>
            <p>Within two hours we paſt a ſmall
river, which croſt the plain from
Eaſt to Weſt; and a mile off another
ſtream, which we ſuppoſed might
ariſe from the ſame ſpring, and be
divided from it.</p>
            <p>After two hours more we arrived
at a Village called <hi>Selinte-kuy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Selinte-kuy.</note> where
were to be ſeen ſeveral excellent
pieces of poliſhed marble up and

aſſure us ſufficiently, though we had

is not originally a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Village,
but was once inhabited by <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:53701:123"/>
eſpecially conſidering the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

I ſuppoſe the <hi>Cryon,</hi> or rather the
<hi>Halys,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Halys.</note> ſo fatal to <hi>Croeſus</hi> formerly
King of this Province; whoſe ſtream
we found very ſwift, according to

               <note place="margin">Lacus Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeus.</note> of about five miles

formerly for the ſepulchre of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyattes</hi>

encline, (the diſpute being a long

falling to the latter, who hereupon
had conferred upon him by the
Souldiery firſt, and after by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
the glorious title of <hi>Asiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi>
which title he juſtly merited:

a <hi>Baſhalick,</hi> though of late

            <p>In our way we repaſt the <hi>Hermus</hi>

to have been built of late years, and
after two hours and a half paſſing
through a Village called <hi>Jaroſh-kuy,</hi>

               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:53701:124"/>

ariſing from the ſame,<note place="margin">Pactolus;</note> on the

the ſtream of <hi>Hermus,</hi> into which it
runs; now a very pitiful and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
Village, the houſes few and
mean; but for the accommodation
of travellers, it being the road for
the <hi>Caravans</hi> that come out of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
to <hi>Smyrna</hi> with ſilk, there is a
large Chane built in it, as is uſual in
moſt Towns that are neer ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53701:125"/>
the <hi>Turks</hi> refuſing to admit us

            <p>To the ſouthward of the Town
at the bottom of a little hill, the
Caſtle lying eaſtward of them, are
very conſiderable ruines ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which quickly put us in mind
of what <hi>Sardes</hi> was, before earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
and war had cauſed thoſe
horrid deſolations there; there being
ſix pillars ſtanding of about ſeven
yards in compaſs; and about ten in
heigth; beſides ſeveral vaſt ſtones,
of which the other pillars that are
thrown down were made, one pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
upon the other, and ſo exactly
cloſed in thoſe that ſtand, as if they
were one entire piece, now lying by
in a confuſed heap; the firſt row of
pillars ſupporting huge maſſy ſtones
that lye upon them.</p>
            <p>From hence we went up to the
Caſtle which lies eaſtward;<note place="margin">Caſtle of <hi>Sardes.</hi>

very ſteep, in ſome places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

forced to take a great compaſs about
to gain the top of the hill, whereon
it ſtands; eaſy enough to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
having no rock to ſupport
it; but what might be as well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable

which knew nothing of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

            <p>By which it appears that it was
erected in honour of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the
Emperor, whom <hi>Sardes</hi> ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
as a ſecond Founder; he
having taken care to repair the
breaches cauſed by an earthquake,
and having given it the form of a
City again, as <hi>Strabo</hi> has record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Eaſterly of the Caſtle lie the ruins
of a great Church; and North of them
other vaſt ruins, the walls ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a very conſiderable length,
with ſeveral diviſions &amp; apartments;
all which take up a great compaſs
of ground: whether it was the chief
Seat of the Governour, or the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Court of Juſtice, or the place
where the Citizens uſed to convene
at this diſtance of time and in ſo
great a confuſion wherein it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved,
is difficult to conjecture: but
whatever it was when it ſtood, it
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53701:126"/>
muſt needs have been very ſtately
and glorious. We met with other
ruines all along this tract, which
made us quickly conclude, that the
greateſt part of the City lay this
way.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have a Moſch, which
was formerly a Chriſtian Church;
at the entrance of which are ſeveral
curious pillars of poliſhed marble.
Some few Chriſtians there are who
live among them, working in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
and doing ſuch like drudgery;
but who have neither Church nor
Prieſt to aſſiſt them and adminiſter
the holy Sacraments to them: into
ſuch a ſad and miſerable condition
is this once glorious City &amp; Church
of <hi>Sardes,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Lydia,</hi>
now reduced.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>10th</hi> we ſet out from <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>

ſtreams running down from <hi>Tmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>

            <p>After ſix hours we found in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial-place

of pillars and marble-ſtones (among

ſeveral others, but what were ſcarce

which gives it a very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
proſpect from moſt parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the plain both toward the North

            <p>It is called by the <hi>Turks Alah
ſhahr</hi> or the <hi>fair City;</hi> which muſt
be underſtood only in reference to
the ſituation; for there is nothing
of building in it to make it deſerve
that name. A City formerly of as
great ſtrength as beauty, having had
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53701:127"/>
three ſtrong walls toward the plain;
a great part of the inmoſt wall yet
ſtanding, though decayed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down in ſeveral places, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
baſtions upon it. Defended by
them, but more by the valour of the
inhabitants, it maintained its liberty,
and held out againſt <hi>Vr-chan</hi> and
<hi>Morat</hi> the firſt, when all the leſſer
<hi>Asia</hi> beſides had been over-run by
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> forces; but at laſt in

after a long diſtance the <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians</hi>
having made ſeveral ſallies,
but all in vain, to remove and raiſe
the ſiege, it was forced to ſubmit to
the fate of other Cities, and became
a prey to the barbarous Conqueror,
who was not wanting in cruelty to
expreſs his revenge and furious rage
againſt the diſtreſſed Citizens for
daring to withſtand ſo long his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
arms: there being about a
mile and a half out of Town to the
South, a thick wall of mens bones
conſuſedly cemented together with
the ſtones; in all probability raiſed
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53701:128"/>
by his command: (for ſure none but
ſuch a Barbarian would have done
it) in complyance perchance with
ſome raſh vow that he had made,
when he lay fretting and ſtorming
before it. The Churches felt the
terrible effects of his fury as well as
the inhabitants; moſt of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demoliſhed and turned into dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills;
as it that of St. <hi>Johns</hi> to the
South-eaſt, moſt probably the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
for its largeneſs, where they
throw their rubbiſh and filth, and
the reſt made Moſchs. South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is the river <hi>Cogamus</hi> flowing
from the hill; abundance of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
all along, which the poor
<hi>Greeks</hi> uſed to cultivate, but were
at that time deterred from making
Wine, by reaſon of the ſevere prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the <hi>Grand Signor;</hi> ſo that
here, as a <hi>Greek Pappas</hi> told us,
they had ſcarce wine enough for the
Sacrament. The City is very popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
there being above five hundred
<hi>Janizaries</hi> in it, who according to
their priviledges (the government
being ſo much in their favour) can
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53701:128"/>
be judged only by their <hi>Serdar</hi> or

having no power over them in
the leaſt. Next to <hi>Smyrna, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi>
has the greateſt number of
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> above the other Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical

            <p>On the <hi>12th,</hi> after three hours
riding from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> we paſt
over the river <hi>Cogamus,</hi> whoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
was narrow, but ſtream deep and
full; and leaving the plains ſome
hours after, we climbed up the <hi>Tmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
which we found in ſome places
very ſleep and rocky; on each ſide
covered with vaſt numbers of Pine
and Firr-trees: and having gain'd
the top, we entred into a wood very
dangerous to paſſengers, there being
that ſhelter for thieves in it, and that
advantage they have, keeping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the hills, between which
the road lies, to pour down their
ſhot upon them, and after three hours
paſt out of it, and getting on the
other ſide of the mountain, we came
at laſt to a Village called <hi>Koſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenigeh-kuy,</hi>
where we lodged that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53701:129"/>
night, having travelled twelve hours
compleat.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>13th,</hi> about a quarter of
a mile hence, we went to ſee ſeveral
ruines, which in all probability, by
their diſtance from <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> muſt
be thoſe of <hi>Tripolis;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tripolis.</note> of which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left but huge maſſy ſtones ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
confuſedly in heaps, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a Caſtle and Theatre;
neer to which we forded the <hi>Maean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maeander.</note>
and about four hours after we
came to <hi>Hierapolis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hierapolis</hi> (now called by the
<hi>Turks Pambuck-Kulaſi</hi> or the <hi>Cotton
Tower,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hierapolis.</note> by reaſon of the white cliffs
lying thereabouts) a City of the
greater <hi>Phrygia,</hi> lies under a high
hill to the North, having to the
Southward of it a fair and large
plain about five miles over, almoſt
directly oppoſite to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the
river <hi>Lycus</hi> running between,<note place="margin">Lycus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> but
neerer the latter; now utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
and deſolate, but whoſe ruines
are ſo glorious and magnificent, that
they will ſtrike one with horror at the
firſt view of them, and with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53701:130"/>
too; ſuch walls, and arches, and
pillars of ſo vaſt a heigth, and ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
wrought, being ſtill to be found
there, that one may well judge, that
when it ſtood, it was one of the moſt
glorious Cities not only of the Eaſt,
but of the World. The numerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Temples there erected
in the times of idolatry with ſo much
art and coſt, might ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the title of the <hi>holy City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which it had at firſt, derived from
the hot waters flowing from ſeveral
ſprings, to which they aſcribed a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
healing virtue, and which made
the City ſo famous; and for this
cauſe <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom both <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Romans</hi> adored as the God of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,</hi>
had his Votaries and Altars
here, and was very probably their
chiefeſt Deity. In the Theatre, which
is of a large compaſs and heigth
from the top, there being above for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtone-ſeats, we found upon a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
piece of wrought marble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to a portal theſe words
<q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:53701:130"/>
               <hi>To</hi> Apollo <hi>the chief Preſident,</hi> a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
peculiar to him. Where theſe
ſprings ariſe, is a very large Bath
curiouſly paved with white marble,
about which formerly ſtood ſeveral
pillars now thrown into it.</p>
            <p>Hence the waters make their way
through ſeveral channels which they
have formed for themſelves; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
overflowing them, and which
curſting the ground thereabouts,
which is a whitiſh ſort of earth,
turns the ſuperficial parts into a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.
Several Tombs ſtill remain;
ſome of them almoſt entire, very
ſtately and glorious, as if it had been
accounted a kind of ſacrilege to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
the dead; and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they had abſtained from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
their monuments; entire ſtones
of a great length and heigth, ſome
covered with ſtones ſhaped into the
form of a Cube, others ridge-wiſe.
Some inſcriptions we took, which
here follow: the ſhortneſs of the
time we ſtaid there, and great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
we were in, not permitting us to

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53701:135"/>
under two hills; the one to

lay the moſt conſiderable parts of
the City: between which is a plain
of about a quarter of a mile in
bredth: upon the ſides of both are
very great ruines, the walls and
ſome arches remaining: upon the
latter are the ruines of a wall, which
ſeemed to have bounded the City
that way with ſeveral caves upon

upon the ground in ſeveral
places vaſt marble pillars; ſome
white, others ſpeckled; theſe latter
hard by the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> of

where lye ſtones of a huge

it lies North North-eaſt, and South

ſtill remaining, formerly encloſed
with a wall (taking up a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs

have their gardens and other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations)

a deſcent of ſeveral foot, we
crept through a narrow paſſage, and
ſo paſt forward in a direct line; on

open into others, built arch-wiſe;
the alleys being ſo low, that we

though the ſituation, and the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs

            <p>On the <hi>21th,</hi> within a mile of
<hi>Epheſus</hi> we paſt over the <hi>Cayster,</hi> a
very deep river; and two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
paſt through a narrow place of
about thirty yards in length, cut ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deep through a rock, I ſuppoſe,
done out of a capriccio to exerciſe
the Souldiers, and to ſhew that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is too difficult and impoſſible
for art and induſtry to effect. The
mariſhes that lye below it on each
ſide of the cauſe-way, and the low
ground ſo apt to be overflown, may
make it unpaſſable that way at ſome
time of the year; but here, this ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the aſcent of the hill, that
cannot be pretended.</p>
            <p>From hence we clambered over
the <hi>Alyman,</hi> which is extraordinary
bad way; part of the famous moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Mimas,</hi> (which runs as far as
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53701:139"/>
Cape <hi>Cornobbero,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> call it
<hi>Kara-borun</hi> or the Cape with the
black noſe, at the entrance into
<hi>Smyrna</hi> Bay) which we paſt over in
two hours. After ten hours we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a little river called <hi>Haleſus,</hi> that
runs into the Sea at <hi>Colophon;</hi> two
hours beyond which is a <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Town called <hi>Giamo-baſhee,</hi> ſituated
in a ſpacious plain with ſeveral hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Moſchs in it; where not meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with any accommodation, we
rode half a mile further to a poor
Village called <hi>Karagick-kuy,</hi> where
we lodged, and the next morning
we arrived ſafe at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> being the
twentieth day from our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Smyrna.</note> called by the <hi>Turks Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi>
lyes in the bottom of a Bay,
which is encompaſſed with high
mountains on all ſides except to the
Weſt, about ten leagues in length,
where is good anchoring ground,
and the water deep; ſo that the
Ships ride neer the Merchants ſcales,
who for their convenience live to
the water ſide. The bredth at the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53701:139"/>
bottom may be, I gheſs, about two
or three miles. To the North is
the river <hi>Meles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Meles.</note> This is one of
the moſt flouriſhing Cities of the
leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> both for its great trade
and the number of its inhabitants;
in which I include <hi>Franks, Jews</hi>
and <hi>Armenians,</hi> as well as <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Turks.</hi> Little of its ancient
glory is left ſtanding, earthquakes
and fire and war having made as
great deſolations and waſtes here, as
in the other parts of <hi>Anatolia.</hi> 'Tis
certain from the numerous founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
continually dug up, that the
greateſt part of the buildings anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
were ſituated upon the ſide of
the hill, and more to the South: the
houſes below toward the Sea being
built, ſince <hi>Smyrna</hi> became of late
years a place of trade. On the top
of the hill, which overlooks the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Bay, is an old Caſtle without
any regular fortifications about it,<note place="margin">Old Caſtle.</note>
and in a manner ſlighted; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only two or three guns for

they ſalute the new Moon of <hi>Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:53701:140"/>
and the Captain <hi>Baſſa,</hi> when
he comes into the Port with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata
of <hi>Galleys.</hi> Neer the entrance
is a marble head, the noſe of which
is cut off by <hi>Turks</hi> out of their great
zeal and hatred of all kind of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
figures eſpecially. I found
nothing in it obſervable but a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern
or perchance Granary under
ground propt by pillars, and the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
curiouſly plaiſtered over; the
work of the ancient <hi>Greeks:</hi> but
much inferior to one I ſaw in the
<hi>long Iſland</hi> juſt within the Bay on
the ſide of a hill, into which there
is a deſcent of about eight or nine
feet; the buildings very regular
and ſtately, having twenty pillars
in length, and five in bredth, the
diſtance between each about ſeven
of my paces, that is above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ſixty paces one way, and
above thirty five another.</p>
            <p>At a little diſtance from which is
another almoſt of the ſame bigneſs,
but filled with water; the Iſland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
altogether uninhabited, but full
of wild hogs and hares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:53701:140"/>
On the ſides of the other gate of
the Caſtle are yet to be ſeen two
Eagles, the enſigns of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
delineated at large, and handſomely
enough.</p>
            <p>In our deſcent to the South-eaſt
we entred the Amphitheatre,<note place="margin">Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre.</note> where
St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> firſt Biſhop of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

removed for the moſt part by

            <p>In the ſides are ſtill to be ſeen the

where they uſed to encloſe their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

the people of this Countrey, and to
which they uſually condemned their

Nigh hereunto are ſeveral arches,
ſtones of huge bigneſs lying upon
the ground, and a great building ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
three large rooms upon a floor;
which perchance was a place of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature:
the front having been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
adorned with four pillars, the
baſes of which at preſent only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.
Not many years ſince in a
lane towards the North-eaſt, digging
for a foundation they met with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
rows of ſquare ſtones placed
regularly one above another, and in
all probability it might be part of a
Fane or Temple in the times of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm.
In the walls of the City
I obſerved a great cavity almoſt in
every ſquare ſtone, reſembling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a <hi>Roman</hi> V, which ſome fancy
might be in the honour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who was a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor
to this City. But the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
not being always the ſame, but
admitting great variety, I am apt to
believe it was rather made by the
Maſons, that the ſtones might be the
better cemented together. About
a mile from the Town are the ruines
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53701:142"/>
of a Church, which the <hi>Franks</hi> call
by the name of <hi>Janus</hi>'s Temple:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Janus</hi>'s Temple.</note>
which I believe rather to have been
dedicated to St. <hi>John</hi> the great Saint

of the name is to be fetch'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> have here thirteen

and yet tho <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the dignity of a Metropolitical
ſeat; the <hi>Greeks</hi> have but two
Churches, the one dedicated to St.
<hi>George,</hi> the other, if I do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remember,
to St. <hi>Photinus.</hi> The
<hi>Armenians</hi> have only one Church:

For the other inſcriptions, I muſt

            <p>By this ſhort and imperfect ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the curious Reader may be ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced, in what a pitiful and
deplorable condition theſe once fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and glorious Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi>
are at this day; Churches, which
had the <hi>Apostles</hi> for their Founders,
and which yielded ſo many Martyrs,
and which abounded with ſo many
myriads of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whoſe pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and valour tired out and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and at laſt triumphed over the
tyranny, the malice, and the hatred
of their <hi>Heathen</hi> perſecutors; and
which afterward, when the Empire
became <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the civil power
ſubmitted it ſelf to the law and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and when the Croſs,
which before was had in ſuch exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
was held the higheſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Crown, advanced in

had enjoyed in the times of <hi>Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi>
&amp; which upon a due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of circumſtances one might have
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53701:144"/>
truly enough judged ſhould have
been eternal and placed almoſt out
of all poſſibility of danger and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
now turned into heaps of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh;
ſcarce one ſtone left upon
another, ſome of them utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited,
and the remains of all
horribly frightful and amazing. I
ſhall not here lament the ſad traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and viciſſitudes of things, and
the uſual changes and chances of
mortal life, or upbraid the <hi>Greeks</hi> of
luxury and ſtupidity, which have
brought theſe horrid deſolations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Countrey: theſe are very
uſeful but very mean and ordinary
ſpeculations. That which affected
me with the deepeſt anguiſh and
moſt ſorrowful reſentment when I
was upon the place, and does ſtill,
was and is a reflexion upon the
threat made againſt <hi>Epheſus</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the ſecond Chapter of the
<hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> who made
his abode in that City, and died
there. <hi>Remember from whence thou
art fallen, and do the first works:
or elſe I will come unto thee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53701:144"/>
and will remove thy Candleſtick
out of its place, except thou repent.</hi>
And upon a farther and more ſerious
conſideration, as I ſorrowfully walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through the ruines of that City
eſpecially, I concluded moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
not only to my function, but
to the nature of the thing, (and I am
confident no wiſe or good man who
ſhall caſt his eyes upon theſe looſe
and haſty obſervations will deny the
concluſion to be juſt and true) that
the ſad and direful calamities which
have involved theſe <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches,
ought to proclaim to the preſent
flouriſhing Churches of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi>
(as much as if an Angel were ſent
expreſs from Heaven to denounce
the judgment) what they are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
and what may be their caſe
one day, if they follow their evil
example, that <hi>their Candlestick may
be removed</hi> too, <hi>except they repent
and do their firſt works;</hi> and that
their ſecurity lyes not ſo much in
the ſtrength of their frontiers, and
the greatneſs of their armies, (for
neither of theſe could defend the

DESCRIPTION

            <p>

deſigned by God for the chief
ſeat of Empire and command. The
high hills, upon which it is ſeated,
add much to the beauty and glory
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53701:146"/>
of it; ſeveral knots of Cypreſs-trees
appearing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> set upon them, that
to one ſailing in the <hi>Propontis,</hi> it
looks like a City placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of a wood: but in the haven it
reſembles a great Amphitheatre, the
houſes like ſo many ſteps riſing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
one above another; the gilded
ſpires of the Moſchs reflecting the
light with great pleaſure to the eye:
ſo that to all travellers it ſeems juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the moſt delightful, the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
and moſt charming ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of nature: and what would even
ſatiſfy for the tediouſneſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
of a Sea-voyage, were there
nothing in it to pleaſe the fancy or
curioſity beſides.</p>
            <p>Though it lies upon the Sea,<note place="margin">Difficulty of acceſſ.</note> yet
on both ſides the paſſages to it are
ſo narrow, that there can be no
coming at it without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>The entrance to it toward the
<hi>Mediterranean</hi> is by the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Helleſpont.</note>
which is there about five miles over:
where is a perpetual current into the
<hi>Archipelago,</hi> which is ſtrong and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53701:146"/>
violent, and eſpecially when the
wind is at North, which blows for
the moſt part here and at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>
eight or nine months of the
twelve: the want of a Southerly
wind, which is neceſſary to get up
the channel, making the paſſage ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
long and tedious. Neer the two
head lands the <hi>Turks</hi> have, ſince the
beginning of the war: of <hi>Candia,</hi>
built two Caſtles, to prevent the
landing of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
paſt unmoleſted with their ſhips
and galleys up as high as the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danels.</hi>
In the Caſtle on the level
within Cape <hi>Janizary,</hi> anciently
<hi>Promontorium Sigaeum</hi> on the <hi>Asian</hi>
ſhore I counted ſix and twenty great
guns in front; and about ſixteen on
the ſide toward <hi>Tenedos.</hi> A little
above at the end of a long ſand is
the river <hi>Scamander.</hi> Sailing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
in the middle of the ſtream,
the guns can do no great execution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Helleſpont</hi> widens hence Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
till almoſt at an equal diſtance

Seas (for it ends at <hi>Gallipoli</hi>)
you arrive at the narroweſt ſtrait,
being ſcarce three quarters of an
Engliſh mile over: where are two
ſtrong Caſtles to command the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage;
which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Boghas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dardanelli.</note> or the Caſtles in the ſtrait or

<hi>Dardanelli;</hi> directly oppoſite to
one another.<note place="margin">Seſtos.</note> The Caſtle of <hi>Seſtos</hi>
on <hi>Europe</hi> ſide, lying under a hill,
is triangular: having twenty five
guns level with the water; and a
Baſtion at each angle: in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
an high Tower conſisting of
three ſemicircles, encompaſſing a
ſquare fortification.<note place="margin">Abydus.</note> 
               <hi>Abydus</hi> on the
oppoſite ſhore lies in a plain; the
Caſtle ſquare, having about ſixteen
guns, which almoſt touch the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the water. On the ſides are
raiſed round Towers, and in the
middle an oblong work. The ſtrength
of theſe Caſtles is the great ſecurity
of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> no ſhips being
able to get by without manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being ſunk: and if at any
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53701:147"/>
time a ſhip or gally coming from
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> have part, helpt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by the current and a briſk
Northerly gale, it ought not to be
aſcribed ſo much to good fortune or
a wily ſtratagem, as to the careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and ſtupidity of the Caſtellans.
For any but <hi>Turks,</hi> who do not well
underſtand fortification, and the uſe
of great guns, to make them bear
to the beſt advantage, would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly,
humanely ſpeaking, defend and
ſecure the paſſage.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea,<note place="margin">Boſphorus.</note>
               <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is defended by the
<hi>Boſphorus,</hi> whoſe channel is about
eighteen miles in length. The firſt
Caſtles, which guard each ſide of it,
are about five miles from the City,
built by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the great, from
which about nine miles to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
where the diſtance between
the two ſhores is not much above a
mile. The current ſo violent, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the wind blows hard at
North, that the water-men, who paſs
toward the black Sea, are at ſuch
times forced to go aſhore, and hale
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53701:148"/>
their boats. I obſerved in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
a ripling or bubbling of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as in the Race at <hi>Portland.</hi> In
the ſeveral turnings and windings
are large Bays for ſmall Veſſels,
(made by the Promontories, which
run out ſo far, that they ſeem at a
diſtance to ſtop the paſſage) eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on the <hi>Thracian</hi> ſhore, upon
which ſeveral Villages are ſituated,
and where the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and other
great men have their villas and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of pleaſure. The <hi>Bithynian</hi>
ſhore, for the moſt part covered with
wild Olive, Cheſnut, and Cypreſs-trees,
ſeems to be one continued
wood or garden, and yields a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
and curious entertainment to
the eye, Almoſt in the entrance or
mouth of the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> are placed
ſeveral rocks,<note place="margin">Symplega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> the <hi>Symplegades</hi> of
the ancients, which break the force
of the waters continually poured
out of the black Sea. On <hi>Europe</hi>
ſide I counted four, which lye ſo cloſe
one to another, that the Sea at ſome
little diſtance not being diſcerned to
run between, they ſeem to joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53701:148"/>
In the greateſt of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
ſtill a pillar of white marble
of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> order, about
eighteen foot in height, commonly
called by the <hi>Weſtern Chriſtians,
Pompey</hi>'s pillar, as if it had been

of a victory gained over <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
King of <hi>Pontus.</hi> But this
is the invention of an ignorant and
trifling fancy, taken up without any
ground of reaſon or old tradition,
(juſt after the ſame manner as they
call the ruines, which are neer <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade</hi>
a Village about four miles from

On the neighbouring ſhore is a

long before the <hi>Turks</hi> were maſters
of a foot of land in <hi>Europe,</hi> now
ſerving for a light houſe to direct
Veſſels in the nigh to enter the
<hi>Boſphorus</hi> with greater eaſe and
ſafety: which I aſcended that I
might take the better view of the
<hi>Euxine,</hi> which not ſo much for want
of good Ports, as for their ignorance

            </p>
            <p>This ſituation of <hi>Byzantium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

pretence of debt upon a <hi>Jew</hi> in
<hi>Smyrna,</hi> and attended by our chief
Interpreter, by whoſe contrivance
the little plot was laid, went boldly
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53701:157"/>
into the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to demand juſtice;
my requeſt was very plauſible; and
upon the propoſal of it, they granted
me a warrant to arreſt my <hi>Jew</hi> in
caſe the debt was not ſpeedily ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
the fees not coming to above
one hundred or ſix-score aſpers. The
inmoſt part of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> beyond
the third gate, and the womens

Chriſtians inacceſſible, except upon
extraordinary occaſions. The whole,
(though not built according to the
rules of modern Architecture, not to
be compared with the Palaces of
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes) as to the outward
appearance ſeems handſome and
ſtately.</p>
               <p>For the better accommodation of

there is no diviſion into ſtories or

                  <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> owes the chiefeſt

after the manner of their eloquence,

may maintain the publick ſervice of

and equal the glory of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
but out of a principle of

a fine ſhew, eſpecially toward the

with the moſt glorious Emperor <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi>
the Founder, and one of the

at the entrance from the aſcent;
five gates covered with plates of
<hi>Corinthian</hi> braſs lead into the nave
of the Church. Its length about
one hundred and twenty of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

upheld by three rows of pillars of
different marble, Serpentine, Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and a kind of Alabaſter, whoſe
baſes and capitels are bound about
with braſs wreaths. In the middle
there ariſes a large cuppola, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

ſeveral little Chappels of an oblong
figure toward the ſides. There is
an aſcent by a winding pair of ſtairs
into the galleries, which take up
three ſides of the Church, ſupported
by ſeveral curious marble pillars.
The pavement both of the Church
and gallery is marble, not made up
of little ſquares, but of very large
tables: the walls cruſted over and
ſlagged with the ſame. The roof
of the Church and portico in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick;

to call the people to their devotion,
raiſed from the ground, and placed
at a due diſtance and in oppoſite

the tops of theſe towers are gilt and

The marble coffins, which are very

covered for the moſt part with a ſilk

every year, being placed over
their heads. Their women lye neer

large, nor raiſed ſo high from the
ground, covered with purple or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let

and both deprived of it; alike
in their lives and deaths: both
fooliſh and frantick, and equally

ſquare,<note place="margin">Ciſterns.</note> round, oblong, hexagonal,
made of free-stone, the bottom either

you deſcend by a pair of ſtairs
ſometimes twenty foot deep. Two

pile of building, and of a
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53701:169"/>
great length, with a double range of
arches about eight and forty or
fifty in number, joyning two hills,
and in the middle to the bottom of
the valley it may be about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
feet: the water running in a
covered channel at the top. Not
far on the other ſide of the plain is
another great Aqueduct, which
makes an angle, having three ranges
of arches one above another. On
one line are two and twenty arches
in the uppermoſt range, through
which and the other below it are
two galleries about five foot wide,
in ſome places ſhut up on each ſide,
in others open at the regular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of about twelve foot: the
contrivance was but neceſſary: for
after the fall of rains or melting of
the ſnow, which in ſome winters lies
here very deep, there are ſuch bogs
below in the valleys, that no horſe
can paſs that way: the other line is
ſhorter, and conſiſts of twelve arches,
which grow leſs and leſs according
to the greater or leſſer ſteepineſs of
the hill. Hence about a mile you

paſs to a third Aqueduct: which
indeed is a moſt ſplendid and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſtructure, containing only four
arches in two ranges, the diſtance of
the ſides of the arches being above
fifty foot. This Aqueduct is raiſed
to a great heigth, whence the waters
paſs in an uninterrupted courſe, and
fall into a large ciſtern in the City

The paſſage is very eaſy, and a great
number of boat-men get their living

continually. This arm of the Sea
is about half a mile wide, and in
length from the <hi>Seraglio-point</hi> to the
freſh water rivers between four and
five miles; of a great depth, that
Ships of a conſiderable burthen may
lye with their bolt-ſprits aſhore, and
have ſeveral fathoms of water at the
ſtern; and ſo ſecure withal, being
ſhut up with the ſeveral high hills
and promontories, which break the
force and violence of the wind and
waves, that let the weather be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo ill, and the Sea boiſterous in

a wide and deep ditch to the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
It runs along the ſide of a

the ridge of the hill and upon the
plain, farther in, toward and parallel

ſtreets, which whole tract of ground,
by reaſon of its ſituation on the
