            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOOD People, most Illustrious Drinkers, and you thrice preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gouty Gentlemen. Did you ever <hi>see Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Cynick</hi> Philosopher, if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43704:3"/>
you have <hi>seen</hi> him, you then had your Eyes in your Head, or I am very much out of my Understanding and Logical Sense. It is a gallant thing to see the clearness of (Wine, Gold) the Sun. I'll be judged by the blind born so renowned in the Sacred Scriptures; who having at his choice to ask whatever he would from him who is Almighty, and whose Word in an Instant is effectually performed, asked nothing else but that he might <hi>see. Item</hi> you are not young, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Quality for you to Philosophat more than Physically in <hi>Wine</hi> (not in vain) and henceforwards to be of the <hi>Bacchick</hi> Council; to the end that <hi>opining</hi> there, you may give your <hi>Opinion</hi> faithfully of the Substance, Colour, excellent Odour, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency, Propriety, Faculty, Vertue, and effectual Dignity of the said blessed and desired Liquor.</p>
            <p>If you have not <hi>seen</hi> him (as I am ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily induced to believe that you have not) at least you have heard some talk of him. For through the Air, and the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Hemisphere of the Heavens hath his Report and Fame, even until this present time, remained very memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and renowned. Then all of you are derived from the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Blood (if I be not deceived) if you have not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Duty, in doing their best Endeavours to put themselves in a fit posture to resist his Hostile Approach, and defend their own City.</p>
            <p>Some from the Fields brought into the Fortify'd Places their Moveables, Bestial, Corn, Wine, Fruit, Victuals, and other necessary Provision.</p>
            <p>Others did fortify and rampire their Walls, set up little Fortresses, Bastions, squared Ravelins, digged Trenches, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Countermines, fenced themselves with <hi>Gabions,</hi> contrived Platforms, emptied <hi>Casemates,</hi> barricado'd the false <hi>Brayes,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the <hi>Cavalliers,</hi> repaired the <hi>Contre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scarfes,</hi> plaister'd the <hi>Courtines,</hi> lengthned <hi>Ravelins,</hi> stopped <hi>Parapets,</hi> mortaised <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacans,</hi> assured the <hi>Port-culleys,</hi> fastned the <hi>Herses, Sarasinesks</hi> and <hi>Cataracks,</hi> placed their Centries, and doubled their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouille.</hi>

            <p>Every one did watch and ward, and not one was exempted from carrying the Basket.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Diogenes</hi> seeing them all so warm at work, and himself not employed by the Magistrates in any business whatsoever, he did very seriously (for many days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without speaking one Word) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,

and contemplate the Countenance of his Fellow-Citizens.</p>
            <p>Then on a sudden, as if he had been roused up and inspired by a Martial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he girded his Cloak, scarf-ways, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Left Arm, tucked up his Sleeves to the Elbow, trussed himself like a Clown gathering Apples, and giving to one of his old Acquaintance his Wallet, Books, and <hi>Opistrographs,</hi> away went he out of Town towards a little Hill or Promonto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Corinth</hi> called <hi>Cranie;</hi> and there on the Strand, a pretty level place, did he roul his Jolly Tub, which serv'd him for an House to shelter him from the Injuries of the Weather: The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And then again in a mighty bustle he bandy'd it, slubber'd it, hack'd it, whitled it, way'd it, darted it, hurled it, stagger'd

            <p>Which when one of his Friends had seen, and asked him why he did so toil his Body, perplex his Spirit, and torment his Tub?

            </p>
            <p>Therefore by reason of my Weakness and Inability, being reputed by my Compatriots unfit for the <hi>Offensive</hi> part of Warfare; and on the other side, being no way employed in matter of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive,</hi> although it had been but to carry Burthens, fill Ditches, or break Clods, either whereof had been to me indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I held it not a little disgraceful to be only an <hi>Idle Spectator</hi> of so many valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, eloquent and warlike Persons, who in the view and sight of all <hi>Europe</hi> act this notable <hi>Interlude</hi> or <hi>Tragicomedy,</hi> and not make some Effort towards the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this, <hi>nothing at all</hi> remains for me to be done.

            <p>Having made this Choice and Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it seemed to me that my Exercise therein would be neither unprofitable nor troublesom to any, whilst I should thus set agoing my <hi>Diogenical</hi> Tub, which is all that is left me safe from the Shipwrack of my former Misfortunes.</p>

If you after the same manner would take one great Draught, or two little ones, whilst you have your Gown about you.

               </gap>bdued the Land of <hi>Dypsodie,</hi> transported thereunto a Colony of <hi>Utopians,</hi> to the number of 9876543210 Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Women and little Children, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers of all Trades, and Professors of all Sciences; to people, cultivate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that Country, which otherways was ill inhabited, and in the greatest part thereof but a meer Desert and Wilderness; and did transport them so much for the excessive multitude of Men and Women which were in <hi>Utopia,</hi> multiplied (for number) like Grashoppers upon the face of the Land. You understand well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nor is it needful further to explain it to you, that the <hi>Utopian</hi> Men had so rank and fruitful Genetories, and that the <hi>Utopian</hi> Women carryed Matrixes so ample, so glutonous, so tenaciously reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and so <hi>Architectonically cellulated,</hi> that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43704:11"/>
at the end of every Ninth Month Seven Children at the least (what Male what Female) were brought forth by every Married Woman, in imitation of the People of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> if <hi>Anthony de Lira</hi> be to be trusted. Nor yet was this Transplantation made so much for the Fertility of the Soil, the Wholsomness of the Air, or Commodity of the Country of <hi>Dypsodie,</hi> as to retain that Rebellious People within the bounds of their Duty and Obedience, by this new Transport of his ancient and most faithful Subjects, who from all time out of mind, never knew, acknowledged, owned or served any other <hi>Soveraign Lord</hi> but him; and who likewise from the very instant of their Birth, as soon as they were entred into this World, had, with the <hi>Milk</hi> of their Mothers and Nurses, sucked in the Sweetness, Humanity and Mildness of his Government, to which they were all of them so nourished and habituated, that there was nothing surer, than that they would sooner abandon their Lives, than swerve from this singular and primitive Obedience <hi>naturally</hi> due to their Prince, whithersoever they should be dispersed or removed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:43704:12"/>And not only should they, and their Children successively descending from their Blood, be such, but also would keep and maintain in this same <hi>Fealty,</hi> and obsequious Observance, all the Nations lately annexed to his Empire; which so truly came to pass, that therein he was not disappointed of his intent. For if the <hi>Utopians</hi> were before their Transplantation thither dutiful and faithful Subjects, the <hi>Dypsodes,</hi> after some few days conversing with them, were every whit as (if not more) <hi>loyal</hi> than they; and that by vertue of I know not what <hi>natural</hi> Fervency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to all Humane Creatures at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of any labour wherein they took delight; solemnly attesting the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and supreme <hi>Intelligences</hi> of their being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorry, that no sooner unto their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge had arrived the great Renown of the good <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Remark therefore here (honest Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) that the manner of preserving and retaining Countries newly Conquered in Obedience, is not (as hath been the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious Opinion of some <hi>Tyrannical</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to their own Detriment and Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) to pillage, plunder, force, spoil, trouble, oppress, vex, disquiet, ruine and destroy the People, ruling, governing and keeping them in awe with <hi>Rods of Iron;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43704:12"/>
and (in a word) <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>devouring</hi> them, after the fashion that <hi>Homer</hi> calls an unjust and wicked King, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            </p>
            <p>I will not bring you to this purpose the Testimony of Ancient Writers; it shall suffice to put you in mind of what your Fathers have seen thereof, and your selves too, if you be not very Babes. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, they must be given suck to, rocked in a Cradle, and dandled. Trees newly planted must be supported, underpropped, strengthened and defended against all Tempests, Mischiefs, Injuries and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. And one lately saved from a long and dangerous Sickness, and new upon his Recovery, must be forborn, spared and cherished, in such sort, that they may harbour in their own Breasts this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there is not in the World a <hi>King or a Prince, who does not desire fewer Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and more Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Osiris</hi> the great King of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> conquered almost the whole Earth, not so much by Force of Arms, as by <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the People</hi> of their Troubles, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them how to <hi>live well,</hi> and honestly giving them <hi>good Laws,</hi> and using them with all possible Affability, Curtesie, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness and Liberality: Therefore was he by all Men deservedly Entituled, The

Great King <hi>Evergetes</hi> (that is to say <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor</hi>) which Style he obtained by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Command of <hi>Iupiter</hi> to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in effect, <hi>Hesiod,</hi> in his <hi>Hierarchy</hi> placed the <hi>good Demons</hi> (call them <hi>Angels</hi> if you will, or <hi>Geniuses</hi>) as <hi>Intercessors</hi> and <hi>Mediators</hi> betwixt the Gods and Men, they being of a degree inferiour to the Gods, but superiour to Men; and for that through their Hands the Riches and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits we get from Heaven are dealt to us; and that they are <hi>continually doing us good,</hi> and still <hi>protecting us from evil.</hi> He saith, that they exercise the Offices of <hi>Kings;</hi> because to <hi>do always good,</hi> and <hi>never ill,</hi> is an Act most <hi>singularly Royal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Just such another was the Emperor of the Universe, <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Macedonian.</hi> After this manner was <hi>Hercules</hi> Sovereign Possessor of the whole Continent, reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men from monstrous Oppressions, Exactions and Tyrannies; governing them with Discretion, maintaining them in Equity and Justice, instructing them with seasonable Policies and wholsom Laws, convenient for, and suitable to the Soil, Climate and Disposition of the Country, supplying where was wanting, abating what was superfluous, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning all that was past, with a sempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> How <hi>Panurge</hi> was made <hi>Laird</hi> of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mygoudin</hi> in <hi>Dypsodie,</hi> and did waste his Revenue before it came in.</head>
            <p>WHilst <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was giving Order for the Government of all <hi>Dyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sodie,</hi> he assigned to <hi>Panurge</hi> the <hi>Laird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of <hi>Salmygoudin,</hi> which was yearly worth 6789106789 Ryals of certain Rent, besides the uncertain Revenue of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custs</hi> and <hi>Periwinkles,</hi> amounting one year with another to the value of 435768, or 2435769 <hi>French</hi> Crowns of <hi>Berry.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it did amount to 1230554321 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphs when it was a good Year, and that Locusts and Periwinkles were in request; but that was not every Year.</p>
            <p>Now his Worship, the new <hi>Laird,</hi> hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded this his Estate so providently well and prudently, that in less than fourteen days he wasted and dilapidated all the certain and uncertain Revenue of his Lairdship for three whole Years: Yet did
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43704:15"/>
not he properly dilapidate it, as you might say, in founding of Monasteries, building of Churches, erecting of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and setting up of Hospitals, or casting his Bacon-Flitches to the Dogs; but spent it in a thousand little Banquets and jolly Collations, keeping open House for all Comers and Goers; yea, to all good Fellows, young Girls, and pretty Wenches; felling Timber, burning the great Logs for the Sale of the Ashes, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing Money before-hand, buying dear, selling cheap, and eating his Corn (as it were) whilst it was but Grass.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pantagruel</hi> being advertised of this his Lavishness, was in good sooth no way offended at the matter, angry nor sorry; for I once told you, and again tell it you, that he was the best, little, great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ever girded a Sword to his Side; he took all things in good part, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted every Action to the best Sence: He never vexed nor disquieted himself with the least pretence of Dislike to any thing; because he knew that he must have most grosly abandoned the Divine Mansion of Reason, if he had permitted his Mind to be never so little grieved, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted or altered at any occasion whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. For all the Goods that the <hi>Heaven</hi> covereth, and that the <hi>Earth</hi> containeth in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43704:16"/>
all their Dimensions of Heighth, Depth, Breadth and Length, are not of so much worth, as that we should for them disturb or disorder our Affections, trouble or perplex our Senses or Spirits.</p>
            <p>He drew only <hi>Panurge</hi> aside, and then making to him a sweet Remonstrance and mild Admonition, very gently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented before him in strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, That if he should continue in such an unthrifty course of living, and not become a better <hi>Mesnagier,</hi> it would prove altogether impossible for him, or at least hughly difficult at any time to make him rich. Rich! answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> Have you fixed your Thoughts there? Have you undertaken the Task to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich me in this World? Set your Mind to live merrily in the Name of God and good Folks, let no other Cark nor Care be harboured within the <hi>Sacro sanctified Domicile</hi> of your Celestial Brain. May the Calmness and Tranquility thereof be never incommodated with, or over-sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by any frowning Clouds of sullen Imaginations and displeasing Annoyance. For if you live joyful, meery, jocund and glad, I cannot be but rich enough. Every body cries up <hi>thrift, thrift,</hi> and good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry; but many speak of <hi>Robin Hood</hi> that never shot in his Bow; and talk of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43704:16"/>
that Vertue of <hi>Mesnagery,</hi> who know not what belong to it. It is by me that they must be advised. From me therefore take this Advertisement and Information, that what is imputed to me for a Vice, hath been done in imitation of the <hi>University</hi> and Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> places in which is to be found the true Spring and <hi>Source</hi> of the lively <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Pantheology,</hi> and all manner of Justice. Let him be counted an <hi>Heretick</hi> that doubteth thereof, and doth not firmly believe it: Yet they in one day eat up their <hi>Bishop,</hi> or the Revenue of the <hi>Bishoprick</hi> (is it not all one) for a whole year; yea, sometimes for two. This is done on the day he makes his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and is <hi>installed:</hi> Nor is there any place for an Excuse; for he cannot avoid it, unless he would be houted at and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his Parsimony.</p>
            <p>It hath been also esteemed an act flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Habit of the Four <hi>Cardinal</hi> Vertues. Of <hi>Prudence</hi> in borrowing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney before-hand; for none knows what may fall out; who is able to tell if the World shall last yet three years? But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it should continue longer, is there any Man so foolish, as to have the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to promise himself three years?</p>

               <l>That he shall live one other day?</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Of <hi>Commutative Iustice,</hi> in buying dear (I say upon trust) and selling good cheap, (that is, for ready Money) what says <hi>Cato</hi> in his Book of <hi>Husbandry</hi> to this purpose? The <hi>Father of a Family</hi> (says he) <hi>must be a perpetual Seller;</hi> by which means it is impossible but that at last he shall become rich, if he have of vendible Ware enough still ready for sale.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Distributive Iustice</hi> it doth partake, in giving Entertainment to good (remark good) and gentle Fellows, whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had Shipwrack'd (like <hi>Ulysse:</hi>) upon the Rock of a hungry Stomach without provision of Sustenance: And likewise to the good (remark the good) and young Wenches: For according to the Sentence of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Youth is impatient of Hunger, chiefly if it be vigorous, lively, frolick, brisk, stirring and bouncing; which wanton Lasses willingly and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily devote themselves to the pleasure of Honest Men; and are in so far both <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick</hi> and <hi>Ciceronian,</hi> that they do a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Vertue of <hi>Fortitude</hi> appears there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the cutting down and overthrowing of the great Trees, like a second <hi>Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> making Havock of the dark Forests, which did serve only to furnish Dens, Caves, and Shelter to Wolves, wild Boars and Foxes; and afford Receptacles, withdrawing Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Refuges to Robbers, Thieves and Murtherers; lurking holes and sculking places for Cut-throat Assassinators; secret obscure Shops for Coiners of false money, and safe Retreats for <hi>Hereticks,</hi> laying them even and level with the plain Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Fields and pleasant Heathy Ground, at the sound of the Hau-bois and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipes playing, reeks with the high and stately Timber, and preparing Seats and Benches for the Eve of the dreadful day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>I gave thereby proof of my <hi>Temperance</hi> in eating my Corn whilst it was but Grass, like an <hi>Hermit</hi> feeding upon Sallets and Roots, that so affranchising my self from the Yoak of sensual Appetites to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter disclaiming of their Sovereignty, I might the better reserve somewhat in store, for the relief of the lame, blind, cripple, maimed, needy, poor and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Wretches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:43704:18"/>In taking this course I save the Expence of the <hi>Weed-grubbers,</hi> who gain Money; of the <hi>Reapers</hi> in Harvest-time, who drink lustily, and without Water; of <hi>Gleaners,</hi> who will expect their Cakes and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocks of <hi>Threshers,</hi> who leave no Garlick, Scallions, Leeks nor Onyons in our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, (by the Authority of <hi>Thestilis</hi> in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>) and of the <hi>Millers,</hi> who are generally Thieves; and of the <hi>Bakers,</hi> who are little better; is the small Saving or Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality; besides the mischief and damage of the <hi>Field-mice,</hi> the decay of <hi>Barns,</hi> and the destruction usually made by <hi>Weesils</hi> and other Vermin.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Corn</hi> in the Blade. You may make good green Sauce of a light Concoction, and easie Digestion, which recreates the Brain, and exhilerates the Animal Spirits, rejoyceth the Sight, openeth the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, delighteth the taste, comforteth the Heart, tickleth the Tongue, cheareth the Countenance, striking a fresh and lively Colour, strengthening the Muscles, tempers the Blood, disburthens the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drif, refresheth the Liver, disobstructs the Spleen, easeth the Kidneys, suppleth the Reins, quickens the Joynts of the Back, cleanseth the Urine-Conduits, dilates the Spermatick Vessels, shortens the <hi>Crema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> purgeth the Bladder, puffeth up the

It will make you have a current Belly to trot, fart, dung, piss, sneeze, cough, spit, belch, spew, yawn, snuff, blow, breath, snort, sweat, and set taunt your <hi>Robin,</hi> with a thousand other rare advantages. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand you very well (says <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) you would thereby infer, that those of a mean Spirit and shallow Capacity, have not the <hi>skill to spend much in a short time:</hi> You are not the first in whose Conceit that <hi>Heresie</hi> hath entred: <hi>Nero</hi> maintained it, and above all Mortals admired most his Unkle <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> for having in few days, by a most wonderfully pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, totally spent all the Goods and Patrimony which <hi>Tiberius</hi> had left him.</p>
            <p>But instead of observing the <hi>Sumptuous Supper-curbing</hi> Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Orchia,</hi> the <hi>Fannia,</hi> the <hi>Didia,</hi> the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinia,</hi> the <hi>Cornelia,</hi> the <hi>Lepidiana,</hi> the <hi>Antia,</hi> and of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> by the which they were inhibited, under pain of great punishment, not to spend more in one year than their annual Revenue did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to. You have offered up the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Protervia,</hi> which was with the <hi>Romans</hi> such a Sacrifice as the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> was amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> wherein all that was eatable was to be eaten, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder

to be thrown into the Fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reserving any thing for the next day. I may very justly say of you, as <hi>Cato</hi> did of <hi>Albidius,</hi> who after that he had by a most extravagant Expence wasted all the Means and Possessions he had to one only House, he fairly set it on Fire, that he might the better say, <hi>Consummatum est.</hi> Even just as since his time St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> did when he had eaten up the whole Lamprey, although there was no necessity in it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Be still indebted to some body or other, that there may be some body always to pray for you; that the Giver of all good things may grant unto you a blessed, long, and prosperous Life, fearing if Fortune should deal crosly with you, that it might be his chance to come short of being paid by you; he will always speak good of you in every Company, ever and anon purchase new Creditors unto you; to the end that through their means you may make a shift by borrowing from <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul,</hi> and with other folks Earth fill up his Ditch. When of old in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> by the Institution of the <hi>Druids,</hi> the Servants, Slaves and Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were burnt quick at the Funerals and Obsequies of their Lords and Masters; had not they fear enough, think you, that their Lords and Masters should die? for <hi>per force,</hi> they were to die with them for Company. Did not they uncessantly send up their Supplications to their great God <hi>Mercury,</hi> as likewise unto <hi>Dis</hi> the Father of Wealth, to lengthen out their days, and preserve them long in health? Were not they very careful to entertain them well, punctually to look unto them, and to attend them faithfully and circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43704:20"/>
For by those means were they to live together at least until the hour of Death. Believe me, your Creditors with a more fervent Devotion will beseech Almighty God to prolong your Life, they being of nothing more afraid than that you should die; for that they are more concerned for the Sleeve than the Arm, and love Silver better than their own Lives; as it evidently appeareth by the Usurers of <hi>Landerousse,</hi> who not long since hanged themselves, because the price of the Corn and Wines was fallen, by the return of a gracious Season. To this <hi>Pantagruel</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering nothing, <hi>Panurge</hi> went on in his Discourse, saying, Truly, and in good sooth (Sir,) when I ponder my Destiny aright, and think well upon it, you put me shrewdly to my Plunges, and have me at a Bay in twitting me with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of my Debts and Creditors: And yet did I, in this only respect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of being a <hi>Debtor,</hi> esteem my self worshipful, reverend and formidable. For against the Opinion of most Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that of <hi>nothing ariseth nothing;</hi> yet without having bottomed on so much as that which is called the <hi>First Matter,</hi> did I out of <hi>nothing</hi> become such <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43704:20"/>
               <hi>Creditors</hi> (I will maintain it, even to the very <hi>Fire</hi> it self exclusively) are fair and <hi>goodly Creatures.</hi> Who lendeth nothing is an ugly and <hi>wicked Creature,</hi> and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed <hi>Imp</hi> of the Infernal <hi>Old Nick.</hi> And there is made, what? <hi>Debts:</hi> A thing most precious and dainty, of great Use and Antiquity. <hi>Debts</hi> (I say) surmounting the number of Syllables which may result from the Combinations of all the Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, with each of the Vowels hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore projected, reckoned and calculated by the Noble <hi>Xenocrates.</hi> To judge of the perfection of <hi>Debtors</hi> by the Numerosity of their <hi>Creditors,</hi> is the readiest way for entring into the Mysteries of <hi>Practical Arithmetick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You can hardly imagine how glad I am, when every Morning I perceive my self environed and surrounded with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of <hi>Creditors;</hi> humble, fawning, and full of their Reverences: And whilst I remark, that as I look more favourably upon, and give a chearfuller Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to one than to another, the Fellow thereupon buildeth a Conceit that he shall be the first Dispatched, and the foremost in the Date of Payment; and he valueth my Smiles at the rate of ready Money. It seemeth unto me, that I then act and personate the <hi>God of the Passion of</hi> Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43704:21"/>
accompanied with his Angels and Cherubims.</p>
            <p>These are my Flatterers, my Soothers, my Claw backs, my Smoothers, my Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, my Saluters, my Givers of good Morrows, and perpetual Orators; which makes me verily think, that the supream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Height of <hi>Heroick</hi> Vertue, described by <hi>Hesiode,</hi> consisteth in being a <hi>Debtor,</hi> wherein I held the first <hi>degree</hi> in my <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement.</hi> Which Dignity though all Humane Creatures seem to aim at, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire thereto, few nevertheless, because of the difficulties in the way, and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of hard Passages are able to reach it, as is easily perceivable by the ardent desire and vehement longing harboured in the Breast of every one, to be still creating more <hi>Debts,</hi> and the new <hi>Creditors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet doth it not lie in the power of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to be a <hi>Debtor.</hi> To acquire <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> is not at the Disposure of each Man's Arbitriment. You nevertheless would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of this sublime Felicity. You ask me when I will be out of Debt. Well, to go yet further on, and possibly worse in your Conceit, may <hi>Sanct Bablin,</hi> the good Sanct, snatch me, if I have not all my Life-time held <hi>Debt</hi> to be as an Union or Conjunction of the Heavens with the Earth, and the whole Cement whereby
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43704:21"/>
the Race of Mankind is kept together; yea, of such Vertue and Efficacy, that, I say, the whole Progeny of <hi>Adam</hi> would very suddenly perish without it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, perhaps, I do not think amiss, when I repute it to be the great Soul of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> which (according to the Opinion of the <hi>Academicks</hi>) vivifyeth all manner of things. In Confirmation whereof, that you may the better believe it to be so, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present unto your self, without any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicacy of Spirit, in a clear and serene Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the <hi>Idea</hi> and Form of some other World than this; take if you please, and lay hold on the <hi>thirtieth</hi> of those which the Philosopher <hi>Methrodorus</hi> did enumerate, wherein it is to be supposed there is no <hi>Debtor</hi> or <hi>Creditor,</hi> that is to say, a World without Debts.</p>
            <p>There amongst the Planets will be no regular Course, all will be in Disorder, <hi>Iupiter</hi> reckoning himself to be nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted unto <hi>Saturn,</hi> will go near to detrude him out of his Sphere, and with the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick</hi> Chain will be like to hang up the <hi>Intelligences,</hi> Gods, Heavens, Demons, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, Devils, Earth and Sea together with the other Elements. <hi>Saturn</hi> no doubt combining with <hi>Mars</hi> will reduce that so disturbed World into a Chaos of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:43704:22"/>
               <hi>Mercury</hi> then would be no more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the other Planets; he would scorn to be any longer their <hi>Camillus,</hi> as he was of old termed in the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Tongue; for it is to be imagined that he is no way a Debtor to them.</p>

            <p>ON the contrary, be pleased to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto your Fancy another World, wherein every one lendeth, and every one oweth, all are Debtors, and all Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors. O how great will that Harmony be, which shall thereby result from the regular Motions of the Heavens! Me thinks I hear it every whit as well as ever <hi>Plato</hi> did. What Sympathy will there be amongst the Elements? O how dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable then unto Nature will be our own Works and Productions? Whilst <hi>Ceres</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth loaden with Corn, <hi>Bacchus</hi> with Wines, <hi>Flora</hi> with Flowers, <hi>Pomona</hi> with Fruits, and <hi>Iuno</hi> fair in a clear Air, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and pleasant: I lose my self in this high Contemplation.</p>
            <p>Then will among the Race of Mankind Peace, Love, Benevolence, Fidelity, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, Rest, Banquets, Feastings, Joy, Gladness, Gold, Silver, single Money,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43704:24"/>
Chains, Rings, with other Ware, and Chaffer of that nature be found to trot from hand to hand; no Suits at Law, no Wars, no Strife, Debate, nor wrangling; none will be there an Usurer, none will be there a Pinch-penny; a Scrape-good Wretch, or churlish hard-hearted Refuser. Good God! Will not this be the Golden Age in the Reign of <hi>Saturn?</hi> The true Idea of the Olympick Regions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Vertues cease; Charity alone ruleth, governeth, domineereth and triumpheth? All will be fair and goodly People there, all just and vertuous.</p>
            <p>O happy World! O People of that World most happy! Yea, thrice and four times blessed is that People! I think in very deed that I am amongst them, and swear to you, by my good Forsooth, that if this glorious aforesaid World had a Pope, abounding with Cardinals, that so he might have the Association of a Sacred Colledge, in the space of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few years you should be sure to see the Sancts much thicker in the Roll, more numerous, wonder-working and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick, more Services, more Vows, more Staves and Wax-Candles than are all those in the Nine Bishopricks of <hi>Britany,</hi> St. <hi>Yves</hi> only excepted. Consider (Sir) I pray you, how the noble <hi>Patelin,</hi> having a

mind to Deity, and extol even to the Third Heavens the Father of <hi>William Ios<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seaume,</hi> said no more but this, <hi>And he did lend his Goods to those who were desirous of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O the fine Saying! Now let our <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosm</hi> be fancied conform to this Model in all its Members; <hi>lending, borrowing</hi> and <hi>owing,</hi> (that is to say) according to its own Nature: For Nature hath not to any other end created Man, but to <hi>owe, borrow</hi> and <hi>lend;</hi> no greater is the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony amongst the Heavenly Spheres, than that which shall be found in its well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Policy. The Intention of the Founder of this Microcosm is, to have a Soul therein to be entertained, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> lodged there, as a Guest with its Host, it may live there for a while. Life consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in Blood, Blood is the Seat of the Soul; therefore the chiefest Work of the Microcosm, is, to be making Blood continually.</p>
            <p>At this Forge are exercised all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body; none is exempted from Labour, each operates apart, and doth its proper Office. And such is their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchy, that perpetually the one <hi>borrows</hi> from the other, the one <hi>lends</hi> the other, and the one is the others <hi>Debtor.</hi> The stuff and matter convenient which Nature
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43704:25"/>
giveth to be turned into Blood is <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> All kind of nourishing Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals is understood to be comprehended in these two, and from hence in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thish</hi> Tongue is called <hi>Companage.</hi> To find out this Meat and Drink, to prepare and boil it, the Hands are put to Work, the Feet do walk and bear up the whole Bulk of the Corporal Mass; the Eyes guide and conduct all; the Appetite in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Stomach, by means of little sowrish black Humour (called Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) which is transmitted thereto from the Milt, giveth warning to shut in the Food. The Tongue doth make the first Essay, and tastes it; the Teeth do chaw it, and the Stomach doth receive, digest and chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie it; the Mesaraick Veins suck out of it what is good and fit, leaving behind the Excrements, which are, through spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Conduits for that purpose, voided by an expulsive Faculty; thereafter it is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Liver, where it being changed again, it by the vertue of that new Transmutation becomes <hi>Blood.</hi> What Joy, conjecture you, will then be found amongst those Officers, when they see this <hi>Rivolet of Gold,</hi> which is their sole <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storative?</hi> No greater is the Joy of Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, when after long Travel, Toil and Expence, they see in their Furnaces the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43704:26"/>
Transmutation: Then is it that every Member doth prepare it self, and strive a-new to purifie and to refine this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Kidneys through the emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Veins draw that Aquosity from thence which you call Urine, and there send it away through the Ureters to be slipt downwards; where, in a lower Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepticle, and proper for it, (to wit, the Bladder) it is kept, and stayeth there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til an opportunity to void it out in his due time. The Spleen draweth from the <hi>Blood</hi> its Terrestrial part, <hi>viz.</hi> The Grounds, Lees or thick Substance setled in the bottom thereof, which you term <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly:</hi> The Bottle of the Gall substracts from thence all the superfluous <hi>Choler;</hi> whence it is brought to another Shop or Work-house to be yet better purified and fined, that is, the Heart, which by its agitation of <hi>Diastolick</hi> and <hi>Systolick</hi> Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons so neatly subtilizeth and inflames it, that in the <hi>right side</hi> Ventricle it is brought to perfection, and through the Veins is sent to all the Members; each parcel of the Body draws it then unto its self, and after its own fashion is cherished and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by it: Feet, Hands, Thighs, Arms, Eyes, Ears, Back, Breast, yea, all; and then it is, that who before were <hi>Lender<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Cops body, I sink, I drown, I perish, I wander astray, and quite fly out of my self, when I enter into the Consideration of the profound Abyss of this World, thus <hi>lending,</hi> thus <hi>owing.</hi> Believe me, it is a Divine thing to <hi>lend,</hi> to <hi>owe</hi> an Heroick Vertue. Yet is not this all; this little World thus <hi>lending, owing</hi> and <hi>borrowing,</hi> is so good and charitable, that no sooner is the above-specified Alimentation finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that it forthwith projecteth, and hath already forecast, how it shall <hi>lend</hi> to those who are not as yet born, and by

that Loan endeavour, what it may, to eternize it self, and multiply in Images like the Pattern, that is, Children. To this end every Member hath of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest and most precious of its Nourishment, pare and cut off a Portion, then instantly dispatcheth it downwards to that place, where Nature hath prepared for it very fit Vessels and Receptacles, through which descending to the Genitories by long Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages, Circuits and Flexuosities, it receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a competent Form, and Rooms apt enough both in the Man and Woman for the future Conservation and perpetuating of Humane kind. All this is done by <hi>Loans</hi> and <hi>Debts</hi> of the one unto the other; and hence have we this word, the <hi>Debt of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> Nature doth reckon Pain to the Refuser, with a most grievous Vexation to his Members, and an outragious Fury amidst his Senses.

               <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> altogether abhorreth the Debtors and Borrowers.</head>
            <p>I Understand you very well, (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) and take you to be very good at Topicks, and throughly affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your own Cause: But preach it up, and patrocinate it; prattle on it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it as much as you will, even from hence to the next <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi> if you please so to do, yet in the end will you be astonished to find how you shall have gained no ground at all upon me, nor perswaded me by your fair Speeches and smooth Talk to enter never so little into the Thraldom of <hi>Debt.</hi> You <hi>shall owe to none</hi> (saith the Holy Apostle) <hi>any thing save Love,</hi> Friendship and a mutual Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</p>
            <p>You serve me here, I confess, with fine <hi>Graphides</hi> and <hi>Diatyposes,</hi> Descriptions and Figures, which truly please me very well: But let me tell you, if you will represent unto your Fancy an impudent blustering Bully and an importunate Borrower, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring

afresh and newly into a Town al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready advertised of his Manners, you shall find that at his Ingress the Citizens will be more hideously affrighted and amazed, and in a greater terror and fear, dread and trembling, than if the Pest it self should step into it in the very same Garb and Accoutrement wherein the <hi>Tyanaean</hi> Philosopher found it within the City of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> And I am fully confirmed in the Opinion, that the <hi>Persians</hi> erred not, when they said, That <hi>the Second Vice was to Lie,</hi> the <hi>first</hi> being that of <hi>owing Money.</hi> For in very truth, <hi>Debts</hi> and <hi>Lying</hi> are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily joyned together. I will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless not from hence infer, that none must <hi>owe</hi> any thing, or <hi>lend</hi> any thing. For who so rich can be, that sometimes may not <hi>owe;</hi> or who can be so poor, that sometimes may not <hi>lend?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the occasion notwithstanding in that case (as <hi>Plato</hi> very wisely sayeth, and ordaineth in his Laws) be such, that none be permitted to draw any Water out of his Neighbour's Well, until first, they by continual digging and delving into their own proper Ground, shall have hit upon a kind of Potters Earth, which is called <hi>Ceramite,</hi> and there had found no source or drop of Water; for that sort of Earth, by reason of its Substance, which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43704:28"/>
is fat, strong, firm and close; so retaineth its Humidity, that it doth not easily eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it by any outward excursion or evaporation.</p>
            <p>In good sooth, it is a great shame to choose rather to be still <hi>borrowing</hi> in all places from every one, than to work and win. Then only in my Judgment should one <hi>lend,</hi> when the diligent, toiling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious Person is no longer able by his labour to make any Purchase unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or otherwise, when by mischance he hath suddenly fallen into an unexpected loss of his Goods.</p>
            <p>Howsoever let us leave this Discourse, and from henceforwards do not hang upon <hi>Creditors,</hi> nor tie your self to them; I make account for the time past to rid you freely of them, and from their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to deliver you. The least I should in this point, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) is to thank you, though it be the most I can do: And if Gratitude and Thanksgiving be to be estimated and prized by the Affection of the Benefactor, that is to be done in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely and sempiternally; for the love which you bear me of your own accord and free Grace, without any merit of mine, goeth far beyond the reach of any price or value; it transcends all weight, all number, all measure, it is endless and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43704:29"/>
everlasting; therefore should I offer to commensurate and adjust it, either to the size and proportion of your own noble and gracious Deeds, or yet to the Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Delight of the obliged Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, I would come off but very faintly and flaggingly. You have verily done me a great deal of good, and multiplied your Favours on me more frequently than was fitting to one of my condition. You have been more bountiful towards me than I have deserved, and your Courtesies have by far surpassed the extent of my merits, I must needs confess it. But it is not, as you suppose, in the proposed matter: For there it is not where I itch, it is not there where it fretteth, hurts or vexeth me; for henceforth being <hi>quit</hi> and out of <hi>Debt,</hi> what Countenance will I be able to keep? You may imagine that it will become me very ill, for the first month, because I have never hitherto been brought up or accustomed to it, I am very much afraid of it. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, there shall not one hereafter, Native of the Country of <hi>Salmigondy,</hi> but he shall level the Shot towards my Nose; all the back-cracking Fellows of the World, in discharging of their Postern Petarades, use commonly to say, <hi>Voila pour les quitters;</hi> that is, <hi>For the quit.</hi> My
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43704:29"/>
Life will be of very short continuance, I do foresee it, I recommend to you the making of my Epitaph; for I perceive I will die confected in the very stinch of Farts. If at any time to come, by way of restorative to such good Women as shall happen to be troubled with the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous pain of the Wind-Cholick, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Medicaments prove nothing effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the Mummy of all my befarted Body will streight be as a present Remedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Physicians; whereof they taking any small <hi>Modicum,</hi> it will inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently for their Ease afford them a Rattle of Bum-shot, like a Sal of Muskets.</p>
            <p>Therefore would I beseech you to leave me some few Centuries of <hi>Debts;</hi> as King <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh, exempting from Suits in Law the Reverend <hi>Milles d' Illiers,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Chartre,</hi> was by the said Bishop most earnestly sollicited to leave him some few for the Exercise of his mind. I had rather give them all my Revenue of the <hi>Periwinkles,</hi> together with the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the <hi>Locusts,</hi> albeit I should not thereby have any parcel abated from off the principal Sums which I owe.

year reap a full and compleat Fruition of their Pleasures in their mutual exercise of the act of Love, in such sort, that in waiting more at leisure on the production of Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and propagating of their Progeny, they might the better encrease their Race, and make Provision of new Heirs. That if in the years thereafter the Men should, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their undergoing of some Military Adventure, happen to be killed, their Names and Coats of Arms might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with their Children in the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: And next that, the Wives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, coming to know whether they were barren or fruitful (for one years Trial, in regard of the maturity of Age, wherein; of old, they married, was held sufficient for the Discovery) they might pitch the more suitably, in case of their first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Decease, upon a <hi>Second Match.</hi> The fertile Women to be wedded to those who desire to multiply their Issue; and the steril ones to such other Mates, as misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the storing of their own Lineage, choose them only for their Vertues, Learning, Genteel Behaviour, Domestick Consolation, management of the House, and Matrimonial Conveniences and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and such like. The Preacher of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes</hi> (saith <hi>Panarge</hi>) detest and abhor the <hi>Second Marriages,</hi> as altogether foolish and dishonest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:43704:31"/>Foolish and dishonest, (quoth <hi>Pantagru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>) a plague take such Preachers! Yea but (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) the like Mischief also befal the Friar, <hi>Charmer,</hi> who in a full Auditory, making a Sermon at <hi>Perille,</hi> and therein abominating the Reiteration of Marriage, and the entring again in the Bonds of a Nuptial Tie, did swear and heartily give himself to the swiftest Devil in Hell, if he had not rather choose, and would much more willingly undertake the <hi>unmaidning</hi> or <hi>depucelating</hi> of a hundred Virgins, than the simple Drudgery of one Widow. Truly I find your Reason in that point right good, and strongly grounded.</p>
            <p>But what would you think, if the Cause why this Exemption or Immunity was granted, had no other Foundation, but that, during the whole space of the said first year, they so lustily bobbed it with their Female Consorts, (as both Reason and Equity require they should do) that they had drained and evacuated their Spermatick Vessels; and were become thereby altogether feeble, weak, emascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, drooping and flaggingly pithless; yea, in such sort, that they in the day of Battel, like Ducks which plunge over Head and Ears, would sooner hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves behind the Baggage than in the Company of valiant Fighters and daring

            </p>
            <p>In confirmation whereof, amongst other Relicks and Monuments of Antiquity, we now as yet often see, that in all great Houses, after the expiring of some few days, these young married Blades are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily sent away to visit their <hi>Uncles,</hi> that in the Absence of their Wives, reposing themselves a little, they may recover their decayed Strength by the Recruit of a fresh Supply, the more vigorous to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and face about to renew the dueling Shock and Conflict of an amorous Dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Albeit (for the greater part) they have neither <hi>Uncle</hi> nor <hi>Aunt</hi> to go to.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> How <hi>Panurge</hi> had a Flea in his Ear, and forbore to wear any longer his magnificent Codpiece.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PAnurge</hi> the day thereafter, caused pierce his right Ear, after the <hi>Pewish</hi> Fashion, and thereto clasped a little Gold Ring, of a Fearny-like kind of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, in the Beazil or Collet where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was set and inchased a <hi>Flea;</hi> and to the end you may be rid of all Doubts, you are to know that the Flea was black. O what a brave thing it is, in every case and circumstance of a matter, to be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well informed! The Sum of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence hereof, being cast up, brought in, and laid down upon his Council-board Carpet, was found to amount to no more quarterly than the Charge of the Nuptials of a <hi>Hircanian</hi> Tigress; even as you would say 600000 <hi>Maravedis.</hi> At these vast Costs and excessive Disbursements, as soon as he perceived himself to be out of Debt, he fretted much; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43704:33"/>
as Tyrants and Lawyers use to do, he nourish'd and fed her with the Sweat and Blood of his Subjects and Clients.</p>
            <p>He then took four <hi>French</hi> Ells of a course brown Russet Cloth, and therein appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling himself, as with a long, plain-seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and single-stitched Gown, left off the wearing of his Breeches, and tied a pair of Spectacles to his Cap. In this Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page did he present himself before <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel;</hi> to whom this <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Disguise appeared the more strange, that he did not, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, see that goodly, fair and stately Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, which was the sole Anchor of Hope, wherein he was wonted to rely, and last Refuge he had 'midst all the Waves and boysterous Billows, which a stormy Cloud in a cross Fortune would raise up against him. Honest <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> not understanding the Mystery, asked him by way of interrogatory; what he did intend to personate in that new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled <hi>Prosopopeia?</hi> I have (answered <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge) a Flea in mine Ear,</hi> and have a mind to marry. In a good time (quoth <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>) you have told me joyful Tidings; yet would not I hold a red hot Iron in my hand for all the Gladness of them. But it is not the fashion of Lovers to be accoutred in such dangling Vestments, so as to have their Shirts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lagging down over
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43704:33"/>
their Knees, without Breeches, and with a long Robe of a dark brown mingled Hue, which is a Colour never used, in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larian</hi> Garments amongst any Persons of Honour, Quality or Vertue. If some <hi>Heretical</hi> Persons and Schismatical Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have at any time formerly been so arrayed and cloathed, (though many have imputed such a kind of Dress to Cosenage, Cheat, Imposture, and an Affectation of Tyranny upon credulous Minds of the rude Multitude) I will nevertheless not blame them for it, nor in that point judge rashly or sinistrously of them; every one overflowingly aboundeth in his own Sense and Fancy: Yea, in things of a Foreign Consideration, altogether extrinsical and indifferent, which in and of themselves are neither commendable nor bad, because they proceed not from the Interior of the Thoughts and Heart, which is the Shop of all Good and Evil. Of Goodness, if it be upright, and that its Affections be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the pure and clean Spirit of Righteousness; and on the other side, of Wickedness, if its Inclinations, stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the bounds of Equity be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraved by the Malice and Suggestions of the Devil. It is only the Novelty and new-fangledness thereof which I dislike, together with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43704:34"/>
of common Custom, and the Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in use.</p>
            <p>The Colour (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, for it is conform to that of my Council-Board Carpet, therefore will I henceforth hold me with it, and more narrowly and circumspectly than ever hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have done, look to my Affairs and Business. Seeing I am once out of <hi>Debt,</hi> you never yet saw Man more unpleasing then I will be, if God help me not. Lo here be my Spectacles. To see me afar off, you would readily say, that it were Eryar <hi>Burgess.</hi> I believe certainly, that in the next ensuing Year, I shall once more preach the <hi>Croisade, Bounce Buckram.</hi> Do you see this Russet? doubt not but there lurketh under it some hid Property and occult Vertue, known to very few in the World. I did not take it on before this Morning; and nevertheless, am already in a rage of Lust, mad after a Wife, and vehemently hot upon untying the Codpiece-point, I itch, I tingle, I wriggle, and long exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to be married; that without the danger of Cudgel-blows, I may labour my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Female Copes-mate with the hard push of a Bull-horned Devil. O the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and thrifty Husband that I then will be! After my Death, with all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Respect due to my Frugality,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43704:34"/>
will they burn the Sacred Bulk of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of purpose to preserve the Ashes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in memory of the choicest Pattern that ever was, of a perfectly wary, and compleat Housholder. Cops-body, this is not the Carpet whereon my Treasurer shall be allowed to play false in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts with me, by setting down an X for an V, or an L for an S; for in that case, should I make a hail of Fisti-cuffs to fly into his face. Look upon me (Sir) both before and behind, it is made after the manner of a <hi>Toge,</hi> which was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fashion of the <hi>Romans</hi> in time of Peace. I took the Mode, Shape, and Form thereof in <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Column at <hi>Rome,</hi> as also in the Triumphant Arch of <hi>Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Severus.</hi> I am tired of the Wars, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of wearing Buff-coats, Cassocks, and Hoquetons. My Shoulders are pitifully worn, and bruised with the carrying of Harness; let Armour cease, and the Long Robe bear sway: at least it must be so for the whole space of the succeeding Years. If I be married as yesterday, by the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, you evidenced, in what concerneth the Breeches: my great Aunt <hi>Laurence</hi> did long ago tell me, that the Breeches were only ordained for the use of the Codpiece, and to no other end; which I, upon a no less forcible consequence, give Credit to,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43704:35"/>
every whit as well, as to the Saying of the fine Fellow <hi>Galen,</hi> who in his Ninth Book <hi>Of the Use,</hi> and <hi>Employment of our Members,</hi> alledgeth, That the <hi>Head was made for the Eyes:</hi> for Nature might have placed our Heads in our Knees or Elbows, but having before-hand determined that the Eyes should serve to discover things from afar, she for the better enabling them to execute their designed Office, fixed them in the Head (as on the top of a long Pole) in the most eminent part of all the Body: no otherwise then we see the <hi>Phares,</hi> or high Towers erected in the Mouths of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, that Navigators may the further off perceive with ease the Lights of the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fires and Lanterns. And because I would gladly, for some short while (a Year at least) take a little rest and breathing-time from the toylsome Labour of the Military Profession; that is to say, be married, I have desisted from wearing any more a Codpiece, and consequently have laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side my Breeches: for the Codpiece is the principal and most especial Piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that a Warriour doth carry; and therefore do I maintain even to the Fire (exclusively, understand you me) that no <hi>Turks</hi> can properly be said to be armed Men, in regard that Codpieces are by their Law forbidden to be worn.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Why the Codpiece is held to be the chief piece of Armour amongst Warriours.</head>
            <p>WIll you maintain (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) that the Codpiece is the chief piece of a Military Harness? It is a new kind of Doctrine very paradoxical: for we say at Spurs begins the arming of a Man. Sir, I maintain it, (answered <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) and not wrongfully do I maintain it. Behold how Nature having a servent desire after its Production of Plants, Trees, Shrubs, Herbs, Sponges, and plant Animals, to eternize, and continue them unto all Succession of Ages (in their several Kinds, or Sorts at least, although the Individuals perish) unruinable, and in an everlasting Being, hath most cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously armed and fenced their Buds, Sprouts, Shutes, and Seeds, wherein the above-mentioned perpetuity consisteth, by strengthning, covering, guarding, and fortifying them with an admirable indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, with Husks, Cases, Scurfs, and Swads,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43704:36"/>
Hulls, Cods, Stones, Films, Cartels, Shells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ears, Rinds, Barks, Skins, Ridges, and Prickles, which serve them instead o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> strong, fair, and <hi>natural Codpieces:</hi> as is manifestly apparent in Pease, Beans, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, Pomegranates, Peaches, Cottons, Gourds, Pumpions, Melons, Corn, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Almonds, Walnuts, Filberts, and Chestnuts; as likewise in all Plants, Slips, or Sets whatsoever, wherein it is plainly and evidently seen, that the Sperm and <hi>Semenae</hi> is more closely veiled, oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, corroborated, and throughly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed than any other part, portion, or parcel of the whole.</p>
            <p>Nature nevertheless did not after that manner provide for the sempiternizing of Human Race: but on the contrary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man naked, tender, and frail, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either offensive or defensive Arms; and that in the Estate of Innocence, in the first Age of all, which was the Golden Season; not as a Plant, but living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, born for Peace, not War, and brought forth into the World with an unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Right and Title to the plenary fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition and enjoyment of all Fruits and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; as also to a certain calm and gentle Rule and Dominion over all Kinds of Beasts, Fowls, Fishes, Reptils, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects. Yet afterwards it hapning in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43704:36"/>
time of the Iron Age, under the Reign of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> when to the multiplication of mischievous Actions, wickedness and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice began to take root and footing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the then perverted Hearts of Men, that the Earth began to bring forth Nettles, Thistles, Thorns, Bryars, and such other stubborn and rebellious Vegetables to the Nature of Man; nor scarce was there any Animal, which by a fatal disposition did not then revolt from him, and tacitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, and covenant with one another to serve him no longer, (nor in case of their ability to resist) to do him any manner of Obedience, but rather (to the uttermost of their power) to annoy him with all the hurt and harm they could. The Man then, that he might maintain his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Right and Prerogative, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his Sway and Dominion over all, both Vegetable and Sensitive Creatures; and knowing of a truth, that he could not be well accommodated as he ought, without the servitude and subjection of several A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, bethought himself, that of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he must needs put on Arms, and make provision of Harness against Wars, and Violence. By the holy Saint <hi>Babingoose,</hi> (cried out <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) you are become, since the last Rain, a great <hi>Lifre lofre, Philosopher,</hi> I should say. Take Notice,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43704:37"/>
Sir, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) when Dame Nature had prompted him to his own Arming, what part of the Body it was, where, by her Inspiration, he clapped on the first Harness: It was forsooth by the double pluck of my little Dog the <hi>Ballock,</hi> and good <hi>Senor Don Priapos Stabo-stando,</hi> which done, he was content, and sought no more. This is certified by the Testimony of the great <hi>Hebrew</hi> Captain Philosopher <hi>Moyses,</hi> who affirmeth, That he fenced that Member with a brave and gallant Codpiece, most exquisitely framed, and by right curious Devices of a notably pregnant Invention, made up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of <hi>Fig-tree-leaves,</hi> which by reason of their solid stiffness, incisory notches, curled frisling, sleeked smoothness, large ampleness, together with their colour, smell, vertue, and faculty, were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper, and fit for the covering and arming of the Sachels of Generation, the hideously big Lorram Cullions being from thence only excepted; which swaggring down to the lowermost bottom of the Breeches, cannot abide (for being quite out of all order and method) the stately fashion of the high and lofty Codpiece; as is manifest, by the Noble <hi>Valentin Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiere,</hi> whom I found at <hi>Nancie,</hi> on the First Day of <hi>May</hi> (the more flauntingly
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43704:37"/>
to gallantrize it afterwards) rubbing his Ballocks, spread out upon a Table after the manner of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Cloak. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that none should henceforth say, who would not speak improperly, when any Country-Bumpkin hyeth to the Wars, <hi>Have a care,</hi> (my Roysters, <hi>of the Wine-pot,</hi> that is the Scull, but <hi>have a care</hi> (my Royster) <hi>of the Milk-pot;</hi> that is, the Testicles. By the whole Rabble of the horned Fiends of Hell, the Head being cut off, that single Person only thereby dieth: but if the Ballocks be marred, the whole Race of Humane Kind would forthwith perish, and be lost for ever.</p>
            <p>This was the motive which incited the goodly Writer <hi>Galen, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De Spermate,</hi> to aver with boldness, <hi>That it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vere better</hi> (that is to say, a less evil) <hi>to have no Heart at all, than to be quite destitute of Genitories:</hi> for there is laid up, conserved, and put in store, as in a Secessive Repository, and Sacred Warehouse, the <hi>Semenae,</hi> and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Source of the whole Off-spring of Mankind. Therefore would I be apt to believe, for less than a hundred Franks, that those are the very same Stones, by means whereof <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Pyrrha</hi> resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Humane Race, in peopling with Men and Women the World, which a little before that, had been drowned in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43704:38"/>
the overflowing Waves of a Poetical Deluge. This stirred up the valiant <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian,</hi> L. 1. 4. <hi>De Cagotis tollendis,</hi> to collocate his <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guibus, &amp; Braguetis.</hi> For this, and other Causes, the Lord <hi>Humphry de Merville,</hi> following of his King to a certain War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Expedition, whilst he was in trying upon his own Person a new Suit of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, for of his old rusty Harness he could make no more use, by reason that some few Years since, the Skin of his Belly was a great way removed from his Kidneys, his Lady thereupon in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found musing of a contemplative Spirit, very maturely considering that he had but small care of the Staff of Love, and Packet of Marriage, seeing he did no otherways arm that part of the Body, then with Links of Mail, advised him to shield, fence, and gabionate it with a big tilting Helmet, which she had lying in her Closet, to her otherways utterly unprofitable. On this Lady was penned these subsequent Verses; which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Third Book of the <hi>Shitbrana</hi> of paultry Wenches.</p>

            <p>TO this <hi>Pantagruel</hi> replying nothing, <hi>Panurge</hi> prosecuted the Discourse he had already broached, and therewithal fetching, as far from the bottom of his Heart, a very deep sigh, said, My Lord and Master, you have heard the Design I am upon, which is to marry, if by some disastrous mischance, all the Holes in the World be not shut up, stopped, closed, and bush'd. I humbly beseech you for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which of a long time you have born me, to give me your best Advice therein. Then (answered <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) seeing you have so decreed, taken deliberation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that the matter is fully determined, what need is there of any further Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k thereof, but forthwith to put it into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution what you have resolved. Yea, but (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) I would be loath to act any thing therein without your Counsel
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43704:39"/>
had thereto. It is my Judgment also (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) and I advise you to it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) if I understood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right that it were much better for me to remain a Batchellor as I am, than to run headlong upon new hair-brain'd Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of Conjugal Adventure, I would rather choose not to marry, quoth <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel.</hi> Then do not marry. Yea, but (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) would you have me so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarily drive out the whole Course of my Life, without the Comfort of a Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Consort? You know it is written, <hi>Vae soli,</hi> and a single Person is never seen to reap the Joy and Solace that is found with married Folks. Then marry, in the Name of God, quoth <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> But if (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) my Wife should make me a Cuckold; as it is not unknown unto you, how this hath been a very plentiful Year in the production of that kind of Cattel; I would fly out, and grow impatient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all measure and mean. I love Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kolds with my Heart, for they seem unto me to be of a right honest Conversation, and I, truly, do very willingly frequent their Company: but should I die for it, I would not be one of their number, that is a Point for me of a two-sore prickling Point. Then do not marry (quoth <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi>) for without all controversie, this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43704:40"/>
Sentence of <hi>Seneca</hi> is infallibly true, <hi>What thou to others shalt have done, others will do the like to thee.</hi> Do you (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) aver that without all exceptions? Yes, truly, (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Ho, ho (says <hi>Panurge</hi>) by the Wrath of a little Devil, his meaning is, either <hi>in this World,</hi> or in <hi>the other,</hi> which <hi>is to come.</hi> Yet seeing I can no more want a Wife, then a blind Man his Staff, the Funnel must be in agitation, without which manner of Occupation I cannot live. Were it not a great deal better for me to apply and associate my self to some one honest, lovely, and vertuous Woman, then (as I do) by a new change of Females every Day, run a hazard of being Bastinadoed, or (which is worse) of the Great Pox, if not of both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For never (be it spoken, by their Husbands leave and favour) had I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment yet of an honest Woman. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then in God's Name, quoth <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel.</hi> But if (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) it were the Will of God, and that my Destiny did unluckily lead me to marry an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Woman who should beat me, I would be stor'd with more than two third parts of the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> if I were not stark mad by it, and quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted with such rugged Dealings: for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43704:40"/>
it hath been told me, that those exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honest Women have ordinarily very wicked Head-pieces; therefore is it that their Family lacketh not for good Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar. Yet in that case should it go worse with me, if I did not then in such sort bang her Back and Breast, so thump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly bethwack her Gillets, to wit, her Arms, Legs, Head, Lights, Liver, and Milt, with her other Intrails, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, jag, and flash her Coats, so after the Cross billet fashion, that the greatest Devil of Hell should wait at the Gate for the reception of her damned Soul. I could make a shift for this Year to wave such molestation and disquiet, and be content to lay aside that trouble, and not to be engaged in it.</p>
            <p>Do not marry then, answered <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel.</hi> Yea, but (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Condition wherein I now am, out of Debt and Unmarried; mark what I say, free from all Debt, in an ill hour (for were I deeply on the Score, my Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors would be but too careful of my Paternity) but being quit, and not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, no Body will be so regardful of me, or carry towards me a Love like that which is said to be in a Conjugal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if by some mishap I should fall sick, I would be lookt to very waywardly.

The wise Man saith, <hi>Where there is no Woman</hi> (I mean the Mother of a Family, and Wife in the Union of a lawful Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock) <hi>the Crazy and Diseased are in danger of being ill used, and of having much brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and strife about them:</hi> as by clear Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath been made apparent in the Persons of Popes, Legates, Cardinals, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Abbots, Priors, Priests and Monks: but there, assure your self, you shall not find me. Marry then in the Name of God, answered <hi>Pantagruel.</hi> But if (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) being ill at ease, and possibly thrô that Distemper, made unable to discharge the Matrimonial Duty that is incumbent to an active Husband, my Wife, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of that drooping Sickness, and faint Fits, of a pining Languishment, should abandon and prostitute herself to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of another Man, and not only then not help and assist me in my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity and need, but withal flout at, and make sport of that my grievous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress and Calamity; or peradventure, (which is worse) imbezzle my Goods, and steal from me, as I have seen it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times besal unto the lot of many other Men, it were enough to undo me utterly, to fill brimfull the Cup of my Misfortune, and make me play the Mad-pate Reeks of <hi>Bedlam.</hi> Do not marry then (quoth

               <hi>Pantagruel</hi>). Yea, but (saith <hi>Panurge</hi>) I shall never by any other means come to have lawful Sons and Daughters, in whom I may harbour some hope of perpetuating my Name and Arms, and to whom also I may leave and bequeath my Inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and purchased Goods, (of which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort you need not doubt, but that in some one or other of these Mornings, I will make a fair and goodly show) that so I may chear up and make merry, when otherways I should be plunged into a pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish sullen Mood of pensive sullenness, as I do perceive daily by the gentle and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Carriage of your kind and gracious Father towards you; as all honest Folks use to do at their own Homes, and private Dwelling-houses. For being free from Debt, and yet not married, if casually I should fret and be angry, although the cause of my Grief and Displeasure were never so just, I am afraid instead of Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that I should meet with nothing else but Scoffs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Frumps, Gibes, and Mocks at my disastrous Fortune. Marry then in the Name of God, quoth <hi>Pantagruel.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP.

I know not (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) which of all my Answers to lay hold on; for your Proposals are so full of <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>buts,</hi> that I can ground no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on them, nor pitch upon any solid and positive Determination satisfactory to what is demanded by them. Are not you assured within your self of what you have a mind to? the chief and main point of the whole matter lieth there; all the rest
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43704:42"/>
is meerly casual, and totally dependeth upon the fatal Disposition of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
            <p>We see some so happy in the fortune of this Nuptial Encounter, that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily shineth (as it were) with the radiant Effulgency of an Idea, Model or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the Joys of Paradice; and perceive others again to be so unluckily match'd in the Conjugal Yoak, that those very basest of Devils, which tempt the Hermits that inhabit the Deserts of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baida</hi> and <hi>Montserrat,</hi> are not more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than they. It is therefore expedient, seeing you are resolved for once to take a trial of the state of Marriage, that, with shut Eyes, bowing your Head, and kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Ground, you put the business to a Venture, and give it a fair hazard in recommending the success of the residue to the disposure of Almighty God. It lieth not in my power to give you any other manner of Assurance, or otherways to certifie you of what shall ensue on this your Undertaking. Nevertheless (if it please you) this you may do, Bring hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Poems, that after having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the Book, and without Fingers se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Leaves thereof three several times, we may, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber agreed upon betwixt our selves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore

the future Hap of your intended Marriage: For frequently, by a <hi>Homerick</hi> Lottery, have many hit upon their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinies; as is testified in the Person of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who, whilst he was in Prison, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Recitation of this Verse of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> said of <hi>Achilles,</hi> in the Ninth of the <hi>Iliads,</hi>

            <p>He within very few years thereafter was effectually and in good earnest created and installed <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor. A sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable Story thereto is related of <hi>Adrian,</hi> who being hughly perplexed within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, out of a longing Humour to know in what Accompt he was with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Trajan,</hi> and how large the measure of that Affection was which he did bear unto him, had recourse after the manner above specified, to the <hi>Maronian</hi> Lottery, which by hap hazard tender'd him these Lines out of the Sixth of the <hi>Aeneids,</hi>

               <l>By the white Hair and Beard I know him plain,</l>

            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43704:44"/>Shortly thereafter was he adopted by <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,</hi> and succeeded to him in the Empire. Moreover to the Lot of the praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> befel this Line of <hi>Virgil,</hi> written in the Sixth of his <hi>Aeneids,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Tertia dum Latio regnantem viderit aestas,</q>

            </q>
            <p>And in effect he did not Reign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two years. To the said <hi>Claudian</hi> also, enquiring concerning his Brother <hi>Quintilius,</hi> whom he proposed as a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league with himself in the Empire, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Responce following in the sixth of the <hi>Aeneids,</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>And it so fell out; for he was killed on the Seventeenth day after he had attained unto the management of the Emperial Charge. The very same Lot also, with the like misluck, did betide the Emperor
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43704:45"/>
               <hi>Gordian</hi> the younger. To <hi>Claudius Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> being very sollicitous to understand somewhat of his future Adventures, did occur this Saying, which is written in the sixth of the <hi>Aeneids,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Hic rem Romanam magno turbante tumultu Sistet Eques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <lg>
               <l>The <hi>Romans</hi> boyling with tumultuous rage,</l>
               <l>This Warriour shall the dangerous Storm asswage:</l>
               <l>With Victories he the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> mawls,</l>
               <l>And with strong hand shall crush the Rebel <hi>Gauls.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>Likeways when the Emperor <hi>D. Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Aurelian</hi>'s Predecessor, did with great eagerness research after the Fate to come of his Posterity, his hap was to alight on this Verse in the first of the <hi>Aeneids,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Hic ego nec metas rerum, nec tempore pono.</q>
            <q>No bounds are to be set, no limits here.</q>
            <p>Which was fulfilled by the goodly Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogical Row of his Race. When Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Amy</hi> did in like manner explore and make trial, if he should escape the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush of the <hi>Hobgoblins,</hi> who lay in wait
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43704:45"/>
all-to-bemawl him, he fell upon this Verse in the third of the <hi>Aeneids,,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Hugh fuge credules terras, fuge Littus ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum!</q>
            <q>Oh flee the bloody Land, the wicked Shoar!</q>
            <p>Which Counsel he obeying, safe and sound forthwith avoided all these Ambuscades.</p>
            <p>Were it not to shun Prolixity, I could enumerate a thousand such like Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which conform to the Dictate and Verdict of the Verse, have by that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Lot-casting encounter befallen to the curious Researchers of them. Do not you nevertheless imagine, lest you should be deluded, that I would upon this kind of Fortune flinging Proof infer an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable, and not to be gainsaid Infallibility of Truth.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> sheweth the Trial of ones Fortune by the throwing of Dice to be unlawful.</head>
            <p>IT would be sooner done (quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) and more expeditely, if we should trie the matter at the chance of three fair Dice. (Quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) that fort of <hi>Lottery</hi> is deceitful, abusive, illici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and exceedingly scandalous; never trust in it; the accursed Book of the <hi>Recreation of Dice</hi> was a great while ago excogitated in <hi>Achaia</hi> near <hi>Bourre,</hi> by that ancient Enemy to Mankind, the Infernal Calumniator, who before the Statue or Massive Image of the <hi>Bourraick Hercules,</hi> did of old, and doth in several places of the World as yet, make many simple Souls to err and fall into his Snares. You know how my Father <hi>Gargantua</hi> hath forbidden it over all his Kingdoms and Dominions; how he hath caused burn the Moulds and Draughts thereof, and altogether suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, abolished, driven forth and cast it out
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43704:46"/>
of the Land, as a most dangerous Plague and Infection to any well-polished State or Commonwealth. What I have told you of <hi>Dice,</hi> I say the same of the Play at <hi>Cockall.</hi> It is a Lottery of the like Guile and Deceitfulness; and therefore do not for convincing of me, alledge in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this my Opinion, or bring in the Example of the fortunate Cast of <hi>Teberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> within the Fountain of <hi>Appona,</hi> at the Oracle of <hi>Gerion.</hi> These are the bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hooks by which the Devil attracts and draweth unto him the foolish Souls of silly People into eternal Perdition.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless to satisfie your Humour in some measure, I am content you throw three <hi>Dice</hi> upon this Table, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of the Blots which shall happen to be cast up, we may hit upon a Verse of that Page, which in the setting open of the Book you shall have pitched upon.</p>
            <p>Have you any Dice in your Pocket? A whole Bag full, answered <hi>Panurge,</hi> that is Provision against the Devil, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Merlin Coccajus,</hi> Lib. 2. <hi>De Patria Diabolorum,</hi> the Devil would be sure to take me napping, and very much at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, if he should find me without Dice. With this the three Dice being taken out, produced and thrown, they fell so pat
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43704:47"/>
upon the lower Points, that the Cast was <hi>Five, Six</hi> and <hi>Five.</hi> These are (quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge) Sixteen</hi> in all. Let us take the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Line of the Page, the number pleaseth me very well; I hope we shall have a prosperous and happy Chance. May I be thrown amidst all the Devils of Hell, even as a great Bowl cast athwart at a Set of Nine Pins, or Cannon-ball shot among a Batalion of Foot, in case so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times I do not boult my future Wife the first Night of our Marriage. Of that, forsooth, I make no doubt at all: (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) You needed not to have rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forth such a horrid Imprecation, the sooner to procure Credit for the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of so small a business, seeing possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the first Bout will be <hi>amiss,</hi> and that you know is usually at Tennis called <hi>Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.</hi> At the next justling Turn you may readily amend that Fault, and so compleat your Reckoning of <hi>Sixteen.</hi> Is it so (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) that you understand the matter? and must my Words be thus interpreted? Nay, believe me, never yet was any <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecism</hi> committed by that valiant Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who often hath for me in <hi>Belly-dale</hi> stood Centry at the <hi>Hypogastrian</hi> Crany. Did you ever hitherto find me in the Confraternity of the Faulty? Never, I trow; never, nor ever shall, for ever and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43704:47"/>
a day. I do the Feat like a goodly Friar, or Father Confessor without Default: And therein am I willing to be judged by the Players. He had no sooner spoke these Words, than the Works of <hi>Virgil</hi> were brought in: But before the Book was laid open, <hi>Panurge</hi> said to <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> My Heart, like the Furch of a Hart in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rut, doth beat within my Breast. Be pleased to feel and grope my Pulse a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on this Artery of my Left Arm; at its frequent Rise and Fall you would say that they swinge and belabour me after the manner of a Probationer posed, and put to a peremptory Trial in the Examination of his Sufficiency for the Discharge of the Learned Duty of a Graduate in some Eminent Degree in the Colledge of the <hi>Sorbonists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But would not you hold it expedient, before we proceeded any further, that we should invocate <hi>Hercules</hi> and the <hi>Teni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Goddesses, who in the Chamber of Lots are said to Rule, sit in Judgment, and bear a Presidential Sway? Neither him nor them, (answered <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen up the Leaves of the Book with your Fingers, and set your Nails a work.</p>

            <p>THen at the opening of the Book in the Sixteenth Row of the Lines of the disclosed Page, did <hi>Panurge</hi> encounter upon this following Verse:</p>
            <q>Nec Deus hunc mensa Dea nec Dignata cubili est.</q>
            <lg>
               <l>The God him from his Table banished,</l>
               <l>Nor would the Goddess have him in her Bed.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This Response (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not very much for your benefit or advantage: for it plainly signifies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth, that your Wife shall be a Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and your self by consequence a <hi>Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold;</hi> the Goddess, whom you shall not find propitious nor favourable unto you, is <hi>Minerva,</hi> a most redoubtable and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43704:48"/>
Virgin, a powerful and fulminating Goddess, an Enemy to Cuckolds, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Youngsters, to Cuckold-makers and Adulterers: the God is <hi>Iupiter,</hi> a terrible and Thunder-striking God from Heaven; and withal, it is to be remarked, that conform to the Doctrine of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Hetrurians,</hi> the <hi>Manubes</hi> (for so did they call the darting Hurls, or slinging Casts of the <hi>Vulcanian Thunderbolts</hi>) did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appertain to her, and to <hi>Iupiter</hi> her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Capital. This was verified in the Conflagration of the Ships of <hi>Ajax Oileus,</hi> nor doth this fulminating Power belong to any other of the <hi>Olympick</hi> Gods; Men therefore stand not in such fear of them. Moreover, I will tell you, and you may take it as extracted out of the profoundest Mysteries of Mythology, that when the Giants had enterprized the waging of a War against the Power of the Coelestial Orbs, the Gods at first did laugh at those Attempts, and scorn'd such despicable Enemies, who were in their conceit, not strong enough to cope in Feats of Warfare with their Pages: but when they saw by the Gigantine labour the high Hill <hi>Pelion</hi> set on lofty <hi>Ossa,</hi> and that the Mount <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympus</hi> was made shake to be erected on the top of both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:43704:49"/>Then was it that <hi>Iupiter</hi> held a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or General Convention, wherein it was unanimously resolved upon, and condescended to by all the Gods, that they should worthily and valiantly stand to their Defence.

Nay, it is quite otherways, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) for it is certain that this Verse
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43704:51"/>
presageth, that she will love me with a perfect liking: nor did the Satyr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> writing Poet lye in proof hereof, when he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>a Woman burning with extream Affection, takes sometimes pleasure to steal from her Sweetheart.</hi> And what I pray you? a Glove, a Point, or some such trifling Toy of no importance, to make him keep a gentle kind of stirring in the research and quest thereof: in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner these small scolding Debates, and petty brabling Contentions, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we see spring up, and for a certain space boyl very hot betwixt a couple of high-spirited Lovers, are nothing else but recreative Diversions for their refreshment, spurs to, and incentives of a more fervent Amity than ever.

               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:43704:52"/>
and others, the Soul doth often times foresee what is to come.</p>
            <p>How true this is, you may conceive by a very vulgar and familiar Example; as when you see that at such a time as Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Babes, well nourished, fed and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with good Milk, sleep soundly and profoundly, the Nurses in the interim get leave to sport themselves, and are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiated to recreate their Fancies at what Range to them shall seem most fitting and expedient; their Presence, Sedulity and Attendance on the Cradle being, during all that space, held unnecessary.</p>
            <p>Even just so, when our Body is at rest, that the Concoction is every where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, and that, till it awake, it lacks for nothing, our Soul delighteth to disport it self, and is well-pleased in that Frolick to take a review of its Native Country, which is the Heavens, where it receiveth a most notable Participation of its first beginning with an Imbuement from its Divine Source, and in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of that Infinite and Intellectual Sphere, whereof the Center is every where, and the Circumference in no place of the universal World, to wit, God, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Hermes Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus,</hi> to whom no new thing hapneth, whom nothing that is past escapeth, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43704:53"/>
unto whom all things are alike present, remarketh not only what is <hi>preterit,</hi> and gone in the inferiour Course and Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sublunary matters, but withal taketh notice what is to come; then bringing a Relation of those future Events unto the Body by the outward Senses and exterior Organs, it is divulged abroad unto the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing of others. Whereupon the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that Soul deserveth to be termed a <hi>Vatiemator,</hi> or Prophet.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless the truth is, that the Soul is seldom able to report those things in such Sincerity as it hath seen them, by reason of the Imperfection and Frailty of the Corporeal Senses, which obstruct the effectuating of that Office; even as the Moon doth not communicate unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Earth of ours that Light which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from the Sun with so much Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, Heat, Vigour, Purity and Liveliness as it was given her. Hence it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for the better reading, explaining and unfolding of these <hi>Somniatory Vaticiations</hi> and Predictions of that nature, that a dexterous, learned, skilful, wise, industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, expert, rational and peremptory Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder or Interpreter be pitched upon, such a one as by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <hi>Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocrit,</hi> or <hi>Oniropolist.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:43704:53"/>For this cause <hi>Heraclitus</hi> was wont to say, that nothing is by Dreams revealed to us, that nothing is by Dreams conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us, and that only we thereby have a mystical Signification and secret Evidence of things to come, either for own prosperous or unlucky Fortune, or for the favourable or disastrous Success of another. The Sacred Scriptures testifie no less, and profane Histories assure us of it, in both which are exposed to our view a thousand several kinds of strange Adventures, which have befallen pat according to the nature of the Dream, and that as well to the Party Dreamer as to others. The <hi>Atlantick</hi> People, and those that inhabit the Land of <hi>Thasos,</hi> (one of the <hi>Cyclades</hi>) are of this grand Commodity deprived; for in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries none yet ever dreamed. Of this sort <hi>Cleon</hi> of <hi>Daulia, Thrasymedes;</hi> and in our days the Learned Frenchman <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novanus,</hi> neither of all which knew what Dreaming was.</p>
            <p>Fail not therefore to morrow, when the jolly and fair <hi>Aurora</hi> with her rosie Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers draweth aside the Curtains of the Night, to drive away the sable Shades of Darkness, to bend your Spirits wholly to the task of sleeping sound, and thereto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your self.

must denude your Mind of every Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Passion or Affection, such as are Love and Hatred, Fear and Hope; for as of old the great Vaticinator, most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowned Prophet <hi>Proteus</hi> was not able in his Disguise or Transformation into Fire, Water, a Tyger, a Dragon, and other such like uncouth Shapes and Visors to presage any thing that was to come, till he was restored to his own first natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and kindly Form.

I do not ask this without Cause: For if I sup not well, large, round and amply, my sleeping is not worth a sorked Turnep; all the Night long I then but dose and rave, and in my stumbering Fits talk idle Nonsence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Thoughts being in a dull brown Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and as deep in their Dumps as is my Belly hollow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:43704:54"/>Not to sup (answered <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) were best for you, considering the state of your Complexion, and healthy Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of your Body. A certain very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophet named <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> wished such as had a mind by Dreams to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with any Oracles, for Four and Twenty Hours to taste no Victuals, and to abstain from Wine three days together; yet shall not you be put to such a sharp, hard, rigorous and extream sparing Diet.</p>
            <p>I am truly right apt to believe, that a Man whose Stomach is repleat with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cheer, and in a manner surfeited with drinking, is hardly able to conceive aright of Spiritual things; yet am not I of the Opinion of those, who after long and pertinacious Fastings, think by such means to enter more profoundly into the Speculation of Celestial Mysteries.

It is a most difficult thing for the Spirits to be in a good plight, serene and lively, when there is nothing in the Body but a kind of Voidness and Inanity: Seeing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43704:55"/>
the Philosophers with the Physicians joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, that the Spirits which are styled <hi>Animal,</hi> spring from, and have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant practice in, and through the <hi>Arteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Blood,</hi> refin'd and purify'd to the Life within the <hi>admirable N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He gave us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Example of the Philosopher, who, when he thought most seriously to have withdrawn himself unto a solitary Privacy, far from the rusling clutterments of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous and confused World, the better to improve his <hi>Theory,</hi> to contrive, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ratiocinate, was, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his uttermost endeavours to free himself from all untoward noises, surrounded and environ'd about so with the barking of Currs, bawling of Mastiffs, bleating of Sheep, prating of Parrets, tatling of Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daws grunting of Swine, girning of Boars, yelping of Foxes, mewing of Cats, cheeping of Mice, squeaking of Weasils, croaking of Frogs, crowing of Cocks, kekling of Hens, calling of Partridges, chanting of Swans, chattering of Jays, peeping of Chickens, singing of Larks, creaking of Geese, chirping of Swallows, clucking of Moorfowls, cucking of Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kows, bumling of Bees, rammage of Hawks, chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Just so is it with those who are tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the grievous pangs of Hunger; the Stomach begins to gnaw, (and bark as it were) the Eyes to look dim, and the

Veins, by greedily sucking some refection to themselves from the proper substance of all the Members of a Fleshy Consistence; violently pull down and draw back that vagrant, roaming Spirit, careless and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting of his Nurse and natural Host, which is the Body. As when a Hawk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fist, willing to take her Flight by a soaring aloft into the open spacious Air, is on a sudden drawn back by a Leash tied to her Feet.</p>
            <p>To this purpose also did he alledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the Authority of <hi>Homer,</hi> the Father of all Philosophy, who said, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> did not put an end to their mournful mood for the Death of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> the most intimate Friend of <hi>Achilles,</hi> till Hunger in a rage declared her self, and their Bellies protested to furnish no more Tears unto their Grief. For from Bodies emptied and mecerated by long Fasting, there could not be such supply of Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture and brackish Drops, as might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on that occasion.</p>

Cabbidge, and all other such like windy Victuals, which may endanger the troubling of your Brains, and the dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or casting a kind of Mist over your Animal Spirits: For as a Looking-glass cannot exhibit the Semblance or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the Object set before it, and exposed, to have its Image to the life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, if that the polish'd sleekedness thereof be darken'd by gross Breathings, dampish Vapours, and foggy, thick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Exhalations; even so the Fancy cannot well receive the impression of the likeness of those things, which <hi>Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> doth afford by Dreams, if any way the Body be annoyed or troubled with the fumish Steam of Meat, which it had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a while before; because betwixt these two there still hath been a mutual Sympathy and Fellow-feeling, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolubly knit Affection. You shall eat good <hi>Eusebian</hi> and Bergamot-Pears, one Apple of the short-shank Pepin-kind, a parcel of the little Plums of <hi>Tours,</hi> and some few Cherries of the growth of my Orchard: Nor shall you need to fear, that thereupon will ensue doubtful Dreams, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, uncertain, and not to be trusted to, as by some <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Philosophers hath been related; for that, say they, Men do more copiously in the Season of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43704:57"/>
Harvest feed on Fruitages, then at any other time. The same is mystically taught us by the ancient Prophets and Poets, who alledge, <hi>That all vain and deceitful Dreams lie hid and in covert, under the Leaves which are spread on the ground:</hi> by reason that the Leaves fall from the Trees, in the Autumnal Quarter: for the natural fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which abounding in ripe, fresh, recent Fruits, cometh by the quickness of its ebullition, to be with ease evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Animal parts of the dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Person (the Experiment is obvious in <hi>most</hi>) is a pretty while before it be expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, dissolved, and evanished. As for your Drink, you are to have it of the fair, pure Water of my Fountain.</p>
            <p>The Condition (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) is very hard: nevertheless, cost what price it will, or whatsoever come of it, I heartily condescend thereto; protesting, that I shall to morrow break my Fast betimes, after my somniatory Exercitations; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, I recommend my self to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's</hi> two Gates, to <hi>Morpheus,</hi> to <hi>Iselon,</hi> to <hi>Phautasus,</hi> and unto <hi>Phabetor.</hi> If they in this my great need succour me, and grant me that assistance which is fitting, I will, in honour of them all, erect a jolly, gentiel Altar, composed of the softest Down. If I were now in <hi>Laconia,</hi> in the Temple of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43704:57"/>
               <hi>Iuno,</hi> betwixt <hi>Oetile</hi> and <hi>Thalamis,</hi> she suddenly would disintangle my Perplexity, resolve me of my Doubts, and chear me up with fair and jovial Dreams in a deep Sleep. Then did he say thus unto <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel:</hi> Sir, were it not expedient for my purpose, to put a Branch or two of curious <hi>Laurel</hi> betwixt the Quilt and Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of my Bed, under the Pillow on which my Head must lean? There is no need at all of that (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) for besides that it is a thing very superstitious, the Cheat thereof hath been at large dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto us, in the Writings of <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, Ascalonites, Antiphon, Philochorus, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temon,</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Placiades.</hi> I could say as much to you of the Left Shoulder of a Crocodile, as also of a Camelion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without prejudice be it spoken to the Credit which is due to the Opinion of old <hi>Democritus;</hi> and likewise of the Stone of the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> called <hi>Eumerites,</hi> and of the <hi>Hamonian Horn:</hi> for so by the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> is termed a certain precious Stone, colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like Gold, and in the fashion, shape, form, and proportion of a Ram's Horn, as the Horn of <hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi> is reported to have been: they over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and above assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly affirming, that the Dreams of those who carry it about them are no less veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and infallible, than the Truth of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43704:58"/>
Divine Oracles. Nor is this much unlike to what <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote of these two <hi>Gates of Sleep:</hi> to which you have been pleased to recommend the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what you have in hand. The one is of <hi>Ivory,</hi> which setteth in confused, doubtful, and uncertain Dreams; for thro' <hi>Ivory,</hi> how small and slender it soever be, we can see nothing, the density, opacity, and close compactedness of its material parts, hindring the penetration of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Rays, and the reception of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciesses of such things as are visible: the other is of <hi>Horn,</hi> at which an entry i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Your meaning is, and you would thereby infer (quoth Fryar <hi>Iohn</hi>) that the Dreams of all horned Cuckolds (of which number <hi>Panurge,</hi> by the help of God, and his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Wife, is without controversie to be one) are always true and infallible.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XIV. Panurge</hi>'s Dream, with the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</head>
            <p>AT Seven a Clock of the next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Morning, <hi>Panurge</hi> did not fail to present himself before <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> in whose Chamber were at that time <hi>Episte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Fryar <hi>Iohn of the Funnels, Ponocrates, Eudemon, Carpalin,</hi> and others, to whom, at the entry of <hi>Panurge, Pantagruel</hi> said, <hi>Lo, here cometh our Dreamer.</hi> That word (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) in ancient times cost very much, and was dearly sold to the Children of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Then, said <hi>Panurge,</hi> I have been plunged into my dumps so deeply, as if I had been lodged with Gaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Noddy cap:</hi> dreamed indeed I have, and that right lustily; but I could take a long with me no more thereof, that I did goodly understand, save only, that I in my Vision had a pretty, fair, young, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, handsome Woman, who no less lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly and kindly treated and entertained me, hugg'd, cherish'd, cocker'd, dandled,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43704:59"/>
and made much of me, as if I had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother neat dillidarling Minion, like <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi> never was Man more glad then I was then, my joy at that time was incompera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; she flattred me, tickled me, stroaked me, groped me, frizled me, curled me, kissed me, embraced me, laid her Hands about my Neck, and now and then made jestingly, pretty little Horns above my Forehead: I told her in the like disport, as I did play the Fool with her, that she should rather place and fix them in a little below mine Eyes, that I might see the better what I should stick at, with them: for being so situated, <hi>Momus</hi> then would find no fault therewith, as he did once with the position of the Horns of Bulls. The wanton, toying Girl, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any remonstrance of mine to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, did always drive and thrust them further in: yet thereby (which to me seemed wonderful) she did not do me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurt at all. A little after, though I know not how, I thought I was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into a <hi>Tabor,</hi> and she into a <hi>Chough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My sleeping there being interrupted, I awaked in a start, angry, displeased, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, chasing, and very wroth. There have you a large Platter-full of Dreams, make thereupon good Chear, and, if you
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43704:59"/>
please, spare not to interpret them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Understanding which you may have in them. Come <hi>Carpalin,</hi> let us to Breakfast. To my sence and meaning, (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) if I have skill or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Art of Divination by Dreams, your Wife will not really, and to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance of the World, plant, or set Horns, and stick them fast in your Forehead, after a visible manner, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs use to wear and carry them; but she will be so far from preserving herself Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in the discharge and observance of a Conjugal Duty, that on the contrary she will violate her plighted Faith, break her Marriage-Oath, infringe all Matrimonial Tyes, prostitute her Body to the Dalliance of other Men, and so make you a Cuckold. This point is clearly and manifestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and expounded by <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> just as I have related it. Nor will there be any metamorphosis, or transmutation made of you into a <hi>Drum,</hi> or <hi>Tabor,</hi> but you will surely be as soundly beaten as e're was <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> at a merry Wedding: nor yet will she be changed into a <hi>Chough,</hi> but will steal from you, chiefly in the Night, as is the nature of that thievish Bird. Hereby may you perceive your <hi>Dreams</hi> to be in every jot conform and agreeable to the <hi>Virgilian</hi> Lots: A Cuckold you will be, beaten
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43704:60"/>
and robbed. Then cryed out Father <hi>Iohn</hi> with a loud Voice: He tells the truth; upon my Conscience, thou wilt be a Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold, an honest one, I warrant thee; O the brave Horns that will be born by thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ha, ha, ha. Our good Master <hi>De Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> God save thee, and shield thee; Wilt thou be pleased to preach but two words of a Sermon to us, and I will go through the Parish-Church to gather up Alms for the poor.</p>
            <p>You are (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) very far mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in your Interpretation; for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is quite contrary to your sence thereof; my Dream presageth, that I shall by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be stored with plenty of all manner of Goods, the hornifying of me shewing, that I will possess a <hi>Cornucopia,</hi> that <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaean</hi> Horn, which is called, <hi>The Horn of Abundance,</hi> whereof the fruition did still portend the Wealth of the Enjoyer. You possibly will say, that they are rather like to be Satyrs Horns; for you of these did make some mention. <hi>Amen, Amen, Fiat siat, ad differentiam papae.</hi> Thus shall I have my <hi>Touch-her-home</hi> still ready; my <hi>Staff of Love</hi> sempiternally in a good case, will, Satyr-like, be never toyled out; a thing which all Men wish for, and send up their Prayers to that purpose, but such a thing as nevertheless is granted but to a few; hence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43704:60"/>
doth it follow by a consequence as clear as the Sun-beams, that I will never be in the danger of being made a Cuckold, for the defect hereof is, <hi>Causa sine qua non;</hi> yea, the sole cause (as many think) of making Husbands Cuckolds. What makes poor scoundrel Rogues to beg (I pray you)? Is it not because they have not enough at home, wherewith to fill their Bellies, and their Poaks. What is it makes the Wolves to leave the Woods? Is it not the want of Flesh Meat. What maketh Women Whores? you understand me well enough. And herein may I very well submit my Opinion to the Judgment of learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, Presidents, Counsellors, Advocates, Procurers, Attorneys, and other Glossers and Commentators on the venerable Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, <hi>De Frigidis, &amp; maleficiatis.</hi> You are in truth, Sir, as it seems to me (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse my boldness if I have transgressed) in a most palpable and absurd Error, to attribute my Horns to Cuckoldry: <hi>Diana</hi> wears them on her Head after the manner of a <hi>Cressant,</hi> is she a <hi>Cucquean</hi> for that? How the Devil can she be cuckolded, who never yet was married? Speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more correctly, I beseech you, least she being offended, furnish you with a pair of Horns, shapen by the Pattern of those which she made for <hi>Actaeon.</hi> The
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43704:61"/>
goodly <hi>Bacchus</hi> also carries Horns; <hi>Pan, Iupiter Hammon,</hi> with a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are they all Cuckolds? If <hi>Iove</hi> be a Cuckold, <hi>Iuno</hi> is a Whore: this follows by the Figure <hi>Metalepsis.</hi> As to call a Child in the presence of his Father and Mother, a Bastard, or Whore's Son, is tacitly and under-board, no less than if he had said openly, the Father is a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold, and his Wife a Punk. Let our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse come nearer to the purpose: The Horns that my Wife did make me are Horns of Abundance, planted and grafted in my Head for the increase and shooting up of all good things: this will I affirm for truth, upon my Word, and pawn my Faith and Credit both upon it; as for the rest, I will be no less joyful, frolick, glad, cheerful, merry, jolly, and gamesome then a well-bended <hi>Tabor</hi> in the Hands of a good Drummer, at a Nuptial Feast, still making a noise, still rowling, still buzzing and cracking.

            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:43704:61"/>I remark (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) the last point or particle which you did speak of, and having seriously conferred it with the first, find that at the beginning you were delighted with the sweetness of your Dream; but in the end and final closure of it, you startingly awaked, and on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den were forthwith vexed in Choler, and annoyed. Yea, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that was, because I had fasted too long. Flatter not your self (quoth <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi>) all will go to ruine: know for a certain truth, that every Sleep that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with a starting, and leaves the Person irksome, grieved, and fretting, doth either signifie a present evil, or otherways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sageth, and portendeth a future imminent mishap. To signifie an Evil, that is to say, to shew some Sickness hardly cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a kind of pestilentious, or malignant Bile, Botch, or Sore, lying and lurking, hid, occult, and latent within the very Center of the Body, which many times doth by the means of Sleep (whose nature is to reinforce, and strengthen the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vertue of Concoction) begin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Theorems of Physick to declare itself, and moves toward the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Superficies. At this sad stirring is the Sleeper's rest and ease disturbed and broken, whereof the first feeling and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43704:62"/>
stinging smart admonisheth, that he must patiently endure great pain and trouble, and thereunto provide some remedy: as when we say proverbially to incense Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, to move a stinking Puddle, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake a sleeping Lyon, instead of these more usual expressions, and of a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar and plain meaning, to provoke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Persons, to make a thing the worse by medling with it, and to irritate a testy cholerick Man when he is at quiet. On the other part, to presage or fore-tell an Evil, especially in what concerneth the Exploits of the Soul, in matter of <hi>Somnial Divinations,</hi> is as much to say, as that it giveth us to understand, that some dismal Fortune or Mischance is destinated and prepared for us, which shortly will not fail to come to pass. A clear and evident Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof is to be found in the Dream, and dreadful awaking of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in that of <hi>Euridice,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus,</hi> (neither of which was sooner finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, saith <hi>Cunius</hi>) but that incontinently thereafter they awaked in a start, and were affrighted horribly; thereupon these Accidents ensued, <hi>Hecuba</hi> had her Husband <hi>Priamus,</hi> together with her Children, slain before her eyes, and saw then the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of her Country; and <hi>Euridice</hi> died speedily thereafter, in a most miserable
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43704:62"/>
manner. <hi>Aeneas</hi> dreaming that he spoke to <hi>Hector</hi> a little after his Decease, did on a sudden in a great start awake, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: now hereupon did follow this event; <hi>Troy</hi> that same Night was spoil'd, sack'd, and burnt. At another time the same <hi>Aeneas,</hi> dreaming that he saw his familiar <hi>Geniuses</hi> and <hi>Penates,</hi> in a ghastly fright and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment awaked, of which terrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the issue was, that the very next day subsequent, by a most horrible Tempest on the Sea, he was like to have perished, and been cast-away. Moreover, <hi>Turnus</hi> being prompted, instigated, and stirred up, by the fantastick Vision of an infernal Fury, to enter into a bloody War against <hi>Aeneas,</hi> awaked in a start much troubled and disquieted in Spirit, in sequel whereof, after many notable and famous Routs, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats and Discomfitures in open Field, he came at last to be killed in a single Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, by the said <hi>Aeneas.</hi> A thousand other instances I could afford, if it were needful, of this matter. Whilst I relate these Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> remark the saying of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Pictor,</hi> who faithfully averred, That nothing had at any time befallen unto, was done, or enterprized by him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he <hi>preallably</hi> had not Notice, and before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand fore seen it to the full, by sure Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, altogether founded on the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43704:63"/>
of <hi>Somnial Divination.</hi> To this there is no want of pregnant Reasons, no more then of Examples: for if Repose and Rest in Sleeping be a special Gift and Favour of the Gods, as is maintained by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, and by the Poet attested in these Lines:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Then Sleep, that heavenly Gift, came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,</l>
               <l>Of humane Labourers, the wearied Flesh.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Such a Gift or Benefit can never finish or terminate in wrath and indignation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out portending some unlucky Fate, and most disastrous Fortune to ensue; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways it were a Molestation, and not an Ease; a Scourge and not a Gift, at least, proceeding from the Gods above, but from the infernal Devils our Enemies, according to the common vulgar Saying.</p>
            <p>Suppose the Lord, Father, or Master of a Family, sitting at a very sumptuous Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, furnished with all manner of good Cheer, and having at his entry to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Appetite sharp set upon his Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, whereof there was great plenty, should be seen rise in a start, and on a sudden fling out of his Chair, abandoning his Meat, frighted, appalled, and in a horrid terrour, who should not know the cause
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43704:63"/>
hereof would wonder, and be astonished exceedingly: But what? he heard his Male Servants cry, <hi>Fire, fire, fire, fire;</hi> his Serving Maids and Woman yell, <hi>Stop Thief, stop Thief;</hi> and all his Children shout as loud as ever they could, <hi>Murther, O Murther, Murther.</hi> Then was it not high time for him to leave his Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for application of a Remedy in hast, and to give speedy Order for succouring of his distressed Houshold. Truly, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the <hi>Cabalists</hi> and <hi>Massorats,</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Sacred Scriptures, in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how with verity one might judge of Evangelical Apparitions (because often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> is disguized and transfigured into an Angel of Light) said; That the difference of these two mainly did consist in this: the favourable and comforting <hi>Angel</hi> useth in his appearing unto Man at first to terrifie and hugely affright him; but in the end he bringeth Consolation, leaveth the Person who hath seen him, joyful, well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pleased, fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and satisfied: on the other side, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> of Perdition, that wicked, devilish, and malignant Spirit, at his appearance unto any Person, in the beginning cheareth up the Heart of his Beholder, but at last for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes him, and leaves him troubled, angry, and perplexed.</p>

            <p>THE Lord save those who see, and do not hear, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) I see you well enough, but know not what it is that you have said: the Hunger-starved Belly wanteth Ears: For lack of Victuals, before God, I roar, bray, yell and fume as in a furious Madness. I have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med too hard a Task to day, an extrordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Work indeed: He shall be craftier, and do far greater Wonders than ever did Mr. <hi>Mush,</hi> who shall be able any more this year to bring me on the Stage of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a dreaming Verdict. Fy; not to sup at all, that is the Devil. Pox take that Fashion. Come Friar <hi>Iohn,</hi> let us go break our Fast; for if I hit on such a round Refection in the morning as will serve throughly to fill the Mill-hopper and Hogshide of my Stomach, and furnish it with Meat and Drink sufficient, then at a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43704:64"/>
pinch, as in the case of some extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity which presseth, I could make a shift that day to forbear Dining. But not to Sup: A Plague rot that base Custom, which is an Error offensive to Nature. That <hi>Lady</hi> made the Day for Exercise, to travel, work, wait on and labour in each his Negotiation and Employment; and that we may with the more Fervency and Ardour prosecute our business, she sets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us a clear burning Candle, to wit, the Suns Resplendency: And at Night, when she begins to take the Light from us, she thereby tacitly implies no less, than if she would have spoken thus unto us: <hi>My Lads and Lasses,</hi> all of you are good and honest Folks, you have wrought well to day, toiled and turmoiled enough, the Night approacheth, therefore cast off these moiling Cares of yours, desist from all your swinking painful Labours, and set your Minds how to refresh your Bodies in the renewing of their Vigour with good Bread, choice Wine, and store of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Meats; then may you take some Sport and Recreation, and after that lie down and rest your selves, that you may strongly, nimbly, lustily, and with the more Alacrity to morrow attend on your Affairs as formerly.</p>

               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:43704:65"/>Falconers in like manner, when they have fed their Hawks, will not suffer them to fly on a full Gorge, but let them on a Pearch abide a little, that they may rouse, bait, tour and soar the better. That good <hi>Pope,</hi> who was the first Instituter of Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, understood this well enough; for he ordained that our <hi>Fast</hi> should reach but to the hour of <hi>Noon;</hi> all the remainder of that day was at our disposure, freely to eat and feed at any time thereof. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times there were but few that dined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you would say, some Church-men, Monks and Canons; for they have little other Occupation; each day is a Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val unto them; who diligently heed the Claustral Proverb, <hi>De missa ad mensam.</hi> They do not use to linger and defer their sitting down and placing of themselves at Table, only so long as they have a mind in waiting for the coming of the Abbot; so they fell to without Ceremony, Terms or Conditions; and every body supped, unless it weresome vain, conceited, dreaming Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard. Hence was a Supper called <hi>Caena,</hi> which sheweth that it is <hi>common</hi> to all sorts of People. Thou knowest it well, Friar <hi>Iohn.</hi> Come let us go, my dear Friend, in the name of all the Devils of the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Regions, let us go: The Gnawings of my Stomach, in this rage of Hunger, are
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:43704:65"/>
so taring, that they make it bark like a Mastiff. Let us throw some Bread and Beef into his Throat to pacifie him, as once the <hi>Sibyl</hi> did to <hi>Cerberus.</hi> Thou likest best <hi>Monastical Browess,</hi> the prime, the flower of the Pot. I am for the solid, principal Verb that comes after: The good brown Loaf, always accompany'd with a round slice of the <hi>Nine-lecture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poudred Labourer.</hi> I know thy meaning, (answered Friar <hi>Iohn</hi>) this Metaphor is extracted out of the <hi>Claustral Kettle;</hi> the <hi>Labourer</hi> is the Ox, that hath wrought and done the Labour; after the fashion of <hi>Nine Lectures,</hi> that is to say, most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely well and throughly boil'd. These holy Religious Fathers, by a certain Cabalistick Institution of the Ancients, not written, but carefully by <hi>Tradition</hi> conveyed from hand to hand, rising betimes to go to Morning Prayers, were wont to flourish that their matutinal Devotion with some certain notable Preambles before their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> They dunged in the Dungeries, pissed in the Pisseries, spit in the Spitteries, melodiously coughed in the Cougheries, and doted in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, that to the Divine Service they might not bring any thing that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean or foul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:43704:66"/>These things thus done, they very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously made their repair to the <hi>Holy Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> (for so was, in their canting Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, termed the <hi>Covent Kitchin</hi>) where they with no small earnestness, had Care that the <hi>Beef Pot</hi> should be put on the Crook for the Breakfast of the Religious <hi>Brothers</hi> of our Lord and Saviour; and the Fire they would kindle under the Pot themselves. Now the <hi>Matines</hi> consisting of <hi>Nine Lessons,</hi> was so incumbent on them, that they must have risen the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the more expedite dispatching of them all. The sooner that they rose, the sharper was their Appetite, and the Barkings of their Stomachs, and the Gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings increase in the like proportion, and consequently made these Godly Men thrice more a hungred and a-thirst, than when their <hi>Matines</hi> were <hi>hem'd</hi> over only with three Lessons.</p>
            <p>The more betimes they rose by the said Cabal, the sooner was the <hi>Beef Pot</hi> put on; the longer that the Beef was on the Fire, the better it was boiled; the more it boiled, it was the tenderer; the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer that it was, the less it troubled the Teeth, delighted more the Palats, less charged the Stomach, and nourished our good <hi>Religious</hi> Men the more substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which is the only end and prime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intention
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:43704:66"/>
of the first <hi>Founders,</hi> as appears by this, That <hi>they eat not to live,</hi> but <hi>live to eat,</hi> and in this World have nothing but their Life. Let us go, <hi>Panurge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now have I understood thee, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) my Plushcod Friar, my Cabal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Claustral Ballock. I freely quit the Costs, Interest and Charges, seeing you have so egregiously commented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most especial Chapter of the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linary</hi> and <hi>Monastick Cabal.</hi> Come along, my <hi>Garpalin,</hi> and you Friar <hi>Iohn,</hi> my Leather-dresser: Good morrow to you all, my good Lords: I have dreamed too much to have so little. Let us go. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> had no sooner done speaking, than <hi>Epistemon</hi> with a loud Voice said these Words: It is a very ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing amongst Men to conceive, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, know and presage the misfortune, bad luck or disaster of another; but to have the understanding, providence, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prediction of a Man's own mishap is very scarce and rare to be found any where. This is exceeding judiciously and prudently deciphered by <hi>Esop</hi> in his Apologues, who there affirmeth, That every Man in the World carrieth about his Neck a Wallet, in the Fore-bag where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were contained the Faults and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances of others, always exposed to his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43704:67"/>
view and knowledge; and in the other Scrip thereof, which hangs behind, are kept the Bearers proper Transgressions, and inauspicious Adventures, at no time seen by him, nor thought upon, unless he be a person that hath a favourable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect from the Heavens.</p>

            </head>
            <p>A Little while thereafter <hi>Pantagruel</hi> sent for <hi>Panurge,</hi> and said unto him, The Affection which I bear you being now inveterate, and setled in my Mind by a long continuance of time, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth me to the serious consideration of your Welfare and Profit; in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remark what I have thought thereon: It hath been told me that at <hi>Panzoust</hi> near <hi>Crouly,</hi> dwelleth a very famous <hi>Sibyl,</hi> who is endowed with the skill of foretelling all things to come. Take <hi>Epestemon</hi> in your Company, repair towards her, and hear what she will say unto you. She is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:43704:67"/>
possibly (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) she is some <hi>Canidia, Sagane</hi> or <hi>Pythonisse,</hi> either where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with us is vulgarly called a <hi>Witch.</hi> I being the more easily induced to give Credit to the truth of this Character of her, that the place of her Abode is vilely stained with the abominable repute of abounding more with <hi>Sorcerers</hi> and <hi>Witches</hi> than ever did the Plains of <hi>Thessaly.</hi> I should not, to my thinking, go thither willingly, for that it seems to me a thing unwarrantable, and altogether forbidden in the Law of <hi>Moyses.</hi> We are not <hi>Iews,</hi> (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) nor is it a matter judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously confess'd by her, nor authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by others that she is a <hi>Witch.</hi> Let us for the present suspend our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and defer till after your return from thence, the sifting and garbeling of those Niceties. Do we know but that she may be an Eleventh <hi>Sibyl,</hi> or a Second <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra?</hi> But although she were neither, and she did not merit the Name or Title of any of these Renowned Prophetesses, what Hazard, in the Name of God, do you run, by offering to talk and confer with her of the instant Perplexity and Perturbation of your Thoughts? Seeing especially (and which is most of all) she is in the Estimation of those that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, held to know more,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43704:68"/>
and to be of a deeper reach of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, than is either customary to the Country wherein she liveth, or to the Sex whereof she is. What hindrance, hurt or harm doth the laudable desire of Knowledge bring to any Man, were it from a Sot, a Pot, a Fool, a Stool, a Winter Mittam, a Truckle for a Pully, the Lid of a Goldsmiths Crucible, an Oil-Bottle, or old Slipper? You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have read, or heard at least, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his having obtained a glorious Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the King <hi>Darius</hi> in <hi>Arbeles,</hi> refused in the Presence of the splendid and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Courtiers that were about him, to give Audience to a poor certain despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like Fellow, who through the Soilicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Mediation of some of his Royal Attendants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was admitted humbly to beg that Grace and Favour of him: But sore did he repent, although in vain, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and ten thousand times thereafter, the surly State which he then took upon him to the Denial of so just a Suit, the Grant whereof would have been worth unto him the value of a Brace of potent Cities. He was indeed Victorious in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> but withal so far distant from <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> his Hereditary Kingdom, that the Joy of the one did not expel the extream
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43704:68"/>
Grief, which through occasion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had inwardly conceived; for not being able with all his Power to find or invent a convenient Mean and Expedient, how to get or come by the certainty of any News from thence; both by reason of the huge remoteness of the places from one to another, as also because of the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditive Interposition of many great Rivers, the interjacent Obstacle of divers wild Deserts, and obstructive Interjection of sundry almost inaccessible Mountains. Whilst he was in this sad quandary and sollicitous pensiveness, which, you may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, could not be of a small Vexation to him; considering that it was a matter of no great difficulty to run over his whole Native Soil, possess his Country, seize on his Kingdom, install a new King in the Throne, and plant thereon Foreign Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, long before he could come to have any Advertisement of it. For obviating the Jeopardy of so dreadful Inconveniency, and putting a fit Remedy thereto, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sydonian</hi> Merchant of a low Stature, but high Fancy, very poor in shew, and to the outward appearance of little or no Account, having presented himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, went about to affirm and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he had excogitated and hit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ready mean and way, by the which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43704:69"/>
those of his Territories at home should come to the certain notice of his <hi>Indian</hi> Victories, and himself be perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the state and condition of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Macedonia</hi> within less then five days. Whereupon the said <hi>Alexander,</hi> plunged into a sullen Animadvertency of mind, through his rash Opinion of the Improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of performing a so strange and impossible-like Undertaking, dismissed the Merchant without giving ear to what he had to say, and villify'd him. What could it have cost him to hearken unto what the honest Man had invented and contrived for his good? What Detriment, Annoyance, Damage or Loss could he have undergone to listen to the Discovery of that Secret, which the good Fellow would have most willingly revealed unto him? Nature, I am perswaded, did not without a cause frame our Eyes open, putting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no Gate at all, nor shutting them up with any manner of Inclosures, as she hath done unto the Tongue, the Eyes, and other such out-jetting parts of the Body: The Cause, as I imagine, is, to the end that every Day and every Night, and that continually, we may be ready to hear, and by a perpetual hearing apt to learn: For of all the Senses, it is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for the reception of the knowledge
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43704:69"/>
of Arts, Sciences and Disciplines; and it may be, that Man was an Angel, (that is to say, a Messenger sent from God) as <hi>Raphael</hi> was to <hi>Toby.</hi> Too suddenly did he contemn, despise and misregard him; but too long thereafter, by an untimely and too late Repentance did he do Pennance for it. You say very well, (answered <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistemon</hi>) yet shall you never for all that induce me to believe, that it can tend any way to the Advantage or Commodity of a Man, to take Advice and Counsel of a <hi>Woman,</hi> namely, of such a Woman, and the Woman of such a <hi>Country.</hi> Truly I have found<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) a great deal of good in the Counsel of <hi>Women,</hi> chiefly in that of the Old Wives amongst them; who for every time I consult with them, I readily get a Stool or two extraordinary, to the great Solace of my Bum-gut pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. They are as Slothounds in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of their Scent, and in their Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings no less Sententious than the Rubricks of the Law. Therefore in my Conceit it is not an improper kind of Speech to call them <hi>Sage</hi> or <hi>Wise Women.</hi> In confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of which Opinion of mine, the customary style of my Language allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them the Denomination of <hi>Presage Women.</hi> The Epithet of <hi>Sage</hi> is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, because they are surpassing dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43704:70"/>
in the knowledge of most things. And I give them the Title of <hi>Presage,</hi> for that they <hi>Divinely</hi> foresee, and certainly <hi>foretel</hi> future Contingencies, and Events of things to come. Sometimes I call them not <hi>Maunettes,</hi> but <hi>Monettes,</hi> from their wholsom Monitions. Whether it be so, ask <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Empedocles,</hi> and our Master <hi>Ortuinus.</hi> I furthermore praise and commend above the Skies the ancient memorable Institution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine <hi>Germans,</hi> who ordained the Responces and Documents of <hi>Old Women</hi> to be highly extolled, most cordially reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and prised at a rate, in nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the weight, test and standerd of the Sanctuary: And as they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfully prudent in receiving of these sound Advices, so by honouring and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them did they prove no less fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the happy Success of all their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. Witness the Old Wife <hi>Antinia,</hi> and the good Mother <hi>Villed,</hi> in the days of <hi>Vespasian.</hi> You need not any way doubt, but that Feminine Old Age is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fructifying in Qualities <hi>Sublime,</hi> I would have said <hi>Sibylline.</hi> Let us go, by the help; let us go, by the Vertue.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43704:70"/>
with this protestation nevertheless, that if I happen to get a sure information, or otherways find, that she doth use any kind of Charm or Enchantment in her Responses, it may not be imputed to me for a blame to leave you at the Gate of her House, without accompanying you any further in.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43704:71"/>
snotty, her Nose still drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and herself still drooping, faint, and pithless. Whilst in this wofully wretched case she was making ready for her Dinner, Porridge of wrinkled green Colworts, with a bit skin of yellow Bacon, mixed with a twice before crooked sort of watrish, unsavoury Broath, extracted out of bare and hollow Bones. <hi>Epistemon</hi> said, By the Cross of a Groat, we are to blame, nor shall we get from her any Responce at all: for we have not brought along with us the <hi>Branch of Gold.</hi> I have (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) provided pretty well for that, for here I have it within my Bag, in the substance of a Gold Ring, accompanied with some fair Pieces of small Money. No sooner were these words spoken, when <hi>Panurge</hi> coming up towards her, after the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial performance of a profound and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Salutation, presented her with six Neats-Tongues dried in the Smoke, a great Butter-pot full of fresh Cheese, a Boracho furnished with good Beverage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Rams Cod stored with Single Pence, newly coyned: At last he, with a low Curtsie, put on her <hi>Medical</hi> Finger, a pretty hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Golden Ring, whereinto was right artificially inchased a precious Toadstone of <hi>Beausse.</hi> This done, in few words, and very succinctly did he set open, and expose

unto her the motive Reason of his coming, most civilly and courteously entreating her, that she might be pleased to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to give him an ample and plenary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, concerning the future good luck of his intended Marriage.</p>
            <p>The old Trot for a while remained si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, pensive, and girning like a Dog, then, after she had set her withered Breech upon the bottom of a Bushel, she took into her Hands three old Spindles, which when she had turned and whirled betwixt her Fingers very diversly, and after several fashions, she pryed more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into, by the tryal of their points; the sharpest whereof she retained in her hand, and threw the other two under a Stone Trough; after this she took a pair of Yarn Windles, which she nine times unintermittedly veered, and frisked about, then at the ninth revolution or turn, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching them any more, maturely perpending the manner of their motion, she very demurely waited on their repose and cessation from any further stirring. In sequel whereof, she pull'd off one of her wooden Pattens, put her Apron over her Head, as a Priest use to do his <hi>Amice,</hi> when he is going to sing <hi>Mass,</hi> and with a kind of antick, gaudy, party-colour'd String, knit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it under her Neck. Being
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43704:72"/>
thus covered and muffled, she whiffed off a lusty good Draught out of the Borachoe, took three several Pence forth of the Ram Cod Fob, put them into so many Walnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells, which she set down upon the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Feather-pot; and then after she had given them three Whisks of a Broom Besom a-thwart the Chimney, casting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fire half a Bevin of long Heather, together with a Branch of dry Laurel, she observed with a very hush, and coy si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in what form they did burn, and saw, that although they were in a flame, they made no kind of noise, or crackling din, hereupon she gave a most hideous and horribly dreadful shout, muttering betwixt her Teeth some few barbarous words, of a strange termination.</p>
            <p>This so terrified <hi>Panurge,</hi> that he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with said to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> The Devil mince me into a <hi>Gally-mafry,</hi> if I do not tremble for fear. I do not think but that I am now inchanted; for <hi>she uttereth not her Voice in the terms of any Christian Language.</hi> O look, I pray you, how she seemeth unto me, to be by three full spans higher than she was, when she began to hood her self with her Apron.</p>
            <p>What meaneth this restless wagging of her slouchy Chaps? What can be the signification of the uneven shrugging of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43704:73"/>
her hulchy Shoulders? to what end doth she quaver with her Lips, like a Monkey in the dismembring of a Lobster? My Ears through horrour glow; ah! how they tingle. I think I hear the skreaking of <hi>Proserpina;</hi> the Devils are breaking loose to be all here. O the foul, ugly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Beasts! Let us run away! by the Hook of God, I am like to die for fear! I do not love the Devils; they vex me, and are unpleasant Fellows. Now let us fly, and betake us to our heels. Farewel <hi>Gammer;</hi> Thanks and Grammercy for your Goods. I will not marry, no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, I will not; I fairly quit my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest therein, and totally abandon and renounce it, from this time forward, even as much as at present. With this, as he endeavoured to make an escape out of the room, the <hi>old Crone</hi> did anticipate his flight, and make him stop; the way how she prevented him was this: whilst in her hand she held the Spindle, she f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

you will; find them if you can; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Destinies of your Marriage written in them.</p>
            <p>No sooner had she done thus speaking, when she did withdraw herself unto her lurking Hole, where on the upper Seat of the Porch, she tucked up her Gown, her Coats and Smock, as high as her Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and gave them a full inspection of the <hi>Nockandroe:</hi> which being perceived by <hi>Panurge,</hi> he said to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Gods Bodekins, I see the <hi>Sybil's Hole.</hi> She sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly then bolted the Gate behind her, and was never since seen any more. They joyntly ran in hast after the fallen and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed Leaves, and gathered them at last, though not without great labour and toyl, for the Wind had scattered them amongst the Thorn-bushes of the Valley.

               <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> and <hi>Panurge</hi> did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly Expound the Verses of the <hi>Sybil</hi> of <hi>Panzoust.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Leaves being thus collected, and orderly disposed, <hi>Epistemon</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> returned to <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Court, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well pleased, and other part discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: glad for their being come back, and vexed for the trouble they had sustained by the way, which they found to be craggy, rugged, stony, rough, and ill adjusted. They made an ample and full Relation of their Voyage, unto <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> as likewise of the Estate and Condition of the <hi>Sybil.</hi> Then having presented to him the Leaves of the <hi>Sycamore,</hi> they shew him the short and twattle Verses that were written in them. <hi>Pantagruel</hi> having read and considered the whole sum and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the matter, fetch'd from his Heart a deep and heavy Sigh, then said to <hi>Panurge:</hi> You are now, forsooth, in a good taking, and have brought your Hogs
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:43704:74"/>
to a fine Market: the Prophesie of the <hi>Sybil</hi> doth explain and lay out before us, the same very Predictions which have been denotated, foretold, and presaged to us by the Decree of the <hi>Virgilian Lots,</hi> and the Verdict of your own proper <hi>Dreams:</hi> to wit, that you shall be very much disgraced, shamed, and discredited by your Wife: for that she will make you a <hi>Cuckold</hi> in prostituting herself to others, being big with Child by another than you; will steal from you a great deal of your Goods, and will beat you, scratch, and bruise you, even from plucking the skin in apart from off you; will leave the Print of her Blows in some Member of your Body. You understand as much (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Panurge</hi>) in the veritable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and Expounding of recent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, as a Sow in the matter of Spice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Be not offended (Sir, I beseech you) that I speak thus boldly; for I find myself a little in Choler, and that not without cause, seeing it is the contrary that is true; take heed, and give attentive Ear unto my words: The old Wife said, that as the Bean is not seen till first it be unhuskt, and that its swad or hull be shaled, and <hi>pilled</hi> from off it: so is it that my vertue and transcendent worth will never come by the <hi>Mouth of Fame,</hi> to be blazed abroad
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43704:75"/>
proportionable to the height, extent, and measure of the excellency thereof, until <hi>preallably</hi> I get a Wife, and make the full half of a married Couple. How many times have I heard you say, that the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Magistrate, or Office of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, discovereth the Merits, Parts, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of the Person so advanced and promoted, and what is in him: that is to say, we are then best able to judge aright of the Deservings of a Man, when he is called to the management of Affairs: for when before he lived in a private Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we could have no more certain knowledge of him, then of a <hi>Bean</hi> within his <hi>Husk.</hi> And thus stands the first Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle explained: otherways could you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the good Fame, Repute, and Estimation of an Honest Man, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tayl of a Whore?</p>
            <p>Now to the meaning of the Second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: My Wife will be <hi>with Child,</hi> (here lies the prime Felicity of Marriage) but not of me. Copsody, that I do believe indeed: It will be of a pretty little Infant: O how heartily I shall love it! I do alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dote upon it; for it will be my dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fedle-darling, my gentiel Dilli-minion. From thenceforth no Vexation, Care, or Grief, shall take such deep impression in my Heart, how hugely great or vehement
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:43704:75"/>
soever it otherways appear; but that it shall evanish forthwith, at the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sight of that my future Babe; and at the hearing of the Chat and Prating of its Childish Gibbridge: And blessed be the Old Wife. By my truly, I have a mind to settle some good Revenue or Pension upon her, out of the readiest Increase of the Lands of my <hi>Salmigondinois;</hi> not an inconstant, and uncertain Rent-seek, like that of witless, giddy-headed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Batchellors,</hi> but sure and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of the nature of the well-payed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of <hi>Regenting Doctors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Interpretation doth not please you, think you my Wife will <hi>bear</hi> me in her Flanks: Conceive with me, and be of me delivered, as Women use in Childbed to bring forth their Young Ones: so as that it may be said, <hi>Panurge</hi> is a second <hi>Bacchus,</hi> he hath been twice born; he is re-born, as was <hi>Hypolitus,</hi> as was <hi>Proteus,</hi> one time of <hi>Thetis;</hi> and secondly, of the Mother of the Philosopher <hi>Apollonius:</hi> as were the two <hi>Palices,</hi> near the Flood <hi>Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoe,</hi> in <hi>Sicily:</hi> his Wife was big of Child with him. In him is renewed and begun again the <hi>Palintocy,</hi> and of the <hi>Megariens,</hi> and the <hi>Palingenesie</hi> of <hi>Democritus.</hi> Fie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such Errors, to hear stuff of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rends mine Ears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:43704:76"/>The words of the third Article are: <hi>She will suck me at my best End.</hi> Why not? that pleaseth me right well. You know the thing, I need not tell you, that it is my intercrural Pudding with one end. I swear and promise, that in what I can, I will preserve it sappy, full of juyce, and as well victualled for her use as may be; she shall not <hi>suck</hi> me, I believe, in vain, nor be destitute of her allowance; there shall her <hi>justum</hi> both in Peck and Lippy be furnish'd to the full eternally. You ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this passage allegorically, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it to Theft and Larceny. I love the Exposition, and the Allegory pleaseth me; but not according to the Sence whereto you stretch it. It may be that the sincerity of the Affection which you bear me, moveth you to harbour in your Breast those refractory thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, with a suspition of my Adversity to come. We have this saying from the Learned, <hi>That a marvelously fearful thing is Love,</hi> and that <hi>true Love is never without fear.</hi> But (Sir) according to my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you do understand both of and by your self, that here <hi>Stealth</hi> signifieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, no more then in a thousand other places of Greek and Latin, Old and Modern Writings, but the sweet fruits of amorous Dalliance, which <hi>Venus</hi> liketh
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:43704:76"/>
best, when reap'd in secret, and cull'd by fervent Lovers filchingly.</p>
            <p>Why so? I prithee tell: Because when the Feat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the loose Coat Skirmish hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth to be done under-hand and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, between two well-disposed, athwart the Steps of a Pair of Stairs, lurkingly, and in covert, behind a Suit of Hangings, or close hid and trussed upon an unbound Faggot, it is more pleasing to the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Goddess, (and to me also, I speak this without prejudice to any better, or more sound Opinion) then to perform that Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busting Art, after the <hi>Cynick</hi> manner, in the view of the clear Sun-shine, or in a rich Tent, under a precious stately Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, within a glorious and sublime Pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or yet on a soft Couch betwixt rich Curtains of Cloth of Gold, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment, at long intermediate Respits, enjoying of Pleasures and Delights a Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, all at great ease, with a huge fly-flap Fan of Crimson Sattin, and a Bunch of Feathers of some <hi>East-Indian</hi> Ostrich, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to give Chace unto the Flyes all round about: whilst, in the Interim, the Female picks her Teeth with a stiff Straw, pick'd even then from out of the bottom of the Bed she lies on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:43704:77"/>If you be not content with this my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, are you of the mind that my Wife will <hi>suck</hi> and sup me up as People use to gulp and swallow Oysters out of the Shell? Or as the <hi>Cilician</hi> Women, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Testimony of <hi>Dioscorides,</hi> were wont to do the Grain of <hi>Alkermes?</hi> Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that is an Error. Who seizeth on it, doth neither gulch up, nor swill down; but takes away what hath been packed up, catcheth, snatcheth, and plies the Play of <hi>Hey pass, Repass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth Article doth imply, That my Wife will <hi>flay</hi> me, but <hi>not at all.</hi> O the fine Word! You interpret this to beating Strokes and Blows. Speak wisely: Will you eat a Pudding? Sir, I beseech you to raise up your Spirits above the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sized pitch of earthly Thoughts unto that hight of sublime Contemplation, which reacheth to the Apprehension of the Mysteries and Wonders of Dame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And here be pleased to condemn your self, by a renouncing of those Errors which you have committed very grosly, and somewhat perversly, in expounding the Prophetick Sayings of the Holy <hi>Sybil.</hi> Yet put the case (albeit I yield not to it) that by the Instigation of the Devil, my Wife should go about to wrong me, make me a Cuckold downwards to the very
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:43704:77"/>
Breech, disgrace me otherways, steal my Goods from me; yea, and lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently her Hands upon me; she neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less should fail of her Attempts, and not attain to the proposed end of her unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Undertakings.</p>
            <p>The Reason which induceth me hereto, is grounded totally on this last Point, which is extracted from the profoundest Privacies of a Monastick Pantheology, as good Friar <hi>Arther Wagtaile</hi> told me oncé upon a <hi>Monday</hi> morning; as we were (if I have not forgot) eating a Bushel of Trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pies; and I remember well it rained hard: God give him the good Morrow.</p>
            <p>The Women at the beginning of the World, or a little after, conspired to <hi>flay</hi> the Men quick, because they found the Spirit of Mankind inclined to domineer it, and bear rule over them upon the face of the whole Earth; and in pursuit of this their Resolution, promised, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, sworn and covenanted amongst them all, by the pure Faith they owe to the nocturnal Sanct <hi>Rogero.</hi> But O the vain Enterprises of Women! O the great Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility of that Sex Feminine! They did begin to <hi>flay</hi> the Man, or <hi>pill</hi> him, (as says <hi>Catullus</hi>) at that Member which of all the Body they loved best; to wit, the nervous and cavernous Cane; and that above five
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43704:78"/>
thousand years ago; yet have they not of that small part alone flayed any more till this hour but the Head: In meer despite whereof the <hi>Iews</hi> snip off that parcel of the Skin in Circumcision, choosing far rather to be called Clip-yards, Raskals, than to be <hi>flayed</hi> by Women, as are other Nations. My Wife, according to this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Covenant, will <hi>flay</hi> it to me, if it be not so already. I heartily grant my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereto, but will not give her leave to <hi>flay</hi> it all: Nay, truly will I not, my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble King. Yea, but (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) you say nothing of her most dreadful Cries and Exclamations, when she and we both saw the Lawrel-bough burn without yielding any noise or crackling. You know it is a very dismal Ornen, an inauspicious sign, unlucky judice, and token formidable, bad, disastrous, and most unhappy, as is certified by <hi>Propertius, Tibullus,</hi> the quick Philosopher <hi>Porphyrius, Eustachius</hi> on the <hi>Iliads</hi> of <hi>Homer,</hi> and by many others.</p>
            <p>Verily, verily, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) brave are the Allegations which you bring me, and Testimonies of two-footed Calves. These Men were Fools, as they were Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; and Dotards, as they were Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; full of Folly, as they were of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> praiseth the Counsel of Dumb Men.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PAntagruel,</hi> when this Discourse was ended, held for a pretty while his Peace, seeming to be exceeding sad and pensive, then said to <hi>Panurge,</hi> the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirit misleads, beguileth and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth you. I have read that in times past the surest and most veritable Oracles were not those which either were delivered in Writing, or utter'd by word of Mouth in speaking: For many times, in their Interpretation, right witty, learned and ingenious Men have been deceived thro' Amphibolories, Equivoks, and Obscurity of Words, no less than by the brevity of their Sentences. For which cause <hi>Apollo,</hi> the God of Vaticination, was Surnamed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Those which were represented then by Signs and outward Gestures were accounted the truest and the most infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. Such was the Opinion of <hi>Heracli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> And <hi>Iupitur</hi> did himself in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43704:79"/>
give forth in <hi>Amon</hi> frequently Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Nor was he single in this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for <hi>Apollo</hi> did the like amongst the <hi>Assyrians.</hi> His prophesying thus unto those People, moved them to paint him with a large long Beard, and Cloaths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming an old setled Person, of a most posed, stayed and grave Behaviour; not naked, young and beardless, as he was pourtrayed most usually amongst the <hi>Graecians.</hi> Let us make trial of this kind of Fatidicency; and go you take Advice of some dumb Person without any speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I am content, (quoth <hi>Panurge.</hi>) But, says <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> it were requisite that the Dumb you consult with be such as have been deaf from the hour of their Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and consequently dumb; for none can be so lively, natural, and kindly dumb, as he who never heard.</p>
            <p>How is it, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) that you conceive this matter? If you apprehend it so, that never any spoke, who had not before heard the Speech of others, I will from that Antecedent bring you to infer very logically a most absurd and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical Conclusion. But let it pass; I will not insist on it. You do not then believe what <hi>Herodotus</hi> wrote of two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who at the special Command and Appointment of <hi>Psammeticus</hi> King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:43704:79"/>
having been kept in a petty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Cottage, where they were nourished and entertained in a perpetual silence, did at last, after a certain long space of time, pronounce this word <hi>Bee,</hi> which in the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Language signifieth <hi>Bread,</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) do I believe, than that it is a meer abusing of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to give Credit to the words of those, who say that there is any such thing as a Natural Language. All Speeches have had their primary Origin from the Arbitrary Institutions, Accords and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nations in their respective Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendments to what should be noted and betokened by them. An Articulate Voice (according to the Dialecticians) hath naturally no signification at all; for that the sence and meaning thereof did totally depend upon the good will and pleasure of the first Deviser and Imposer of it. I do not tell you this without a Cause; for <hi>Bartholus, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de Verb. Oblig.</hi> very seriously reporteth, that even in his time there was in <hi>Cugubia</hi> one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Sir Nello de Gabrielis,</hi> who although he by a sad mischance became altogether deaf, understood nevertheless every one that talked in the <hi>Italian</hi> Dialect howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he expressed himself; and that only by looking on his external Gestures, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43704:80"/>
casting an attentive Eye upon the divers motions of his Lips and Chaps. I have read, I remember also, in a very literate and eloquent Author, that <hi>Turidates</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> in the days of <hi>Nero,</hi> made a Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was received with great Honour and Solemnity, and with all manner of Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: Yea, to the end there might be a sempiternal Amity and Correspondence preserved betwixt him and the <hi>Roman</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; there was no remarkable thing in the whole City which was not shown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>At his Departure the Emperor bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him many ample Donatives of an inestimable Value: And besides, the more entirely to testifie his Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, heartily intrusted him to be pleased to make choice of any whatsoever thing in <hi>Rome</hi> was most agreeable to his Fancy; with a Promise juramentally confirmed, That he should not be refused of his Demand. Thereupon, after a suitable Return of Thanks for a so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offer, he required a certain <hi>Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudding,</hi> whom he had seen to act his part most egregiously upon the Stage, and whose meaning (albeit he knew not what it was he had spoken) he understood per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly enough by the Signs and Gesticula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43704:80"/>
which he had made. And for this Suit of his, in that he asked nothing else, he gave this Reason, That in the several wide and spacious Dominions, which were reduced under the Sway and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Sovereign Government, there were sundry Countries and Nations much differing from one another in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, with whom, whether he was to speak unto them, or give any Answer to their Requests, he was always necessitated to make use of divers sorts of <hi>Truchmen</hi> and Interpreters: Now with this Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, sufficient for supplying all their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will that great Inconveniency here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be totally removed; seeing he is such a fine Gesticulator, and in the Practice of <hi>Chirology</hi> an Artist so compleat, expert and dextrous, that with his very Fingers he doth speak. Howsoever you are to pitch upon such a dumb Bone as is deaf by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from his Birth; to the end that his Gestures and Signs may be the more vively and truly Prophetick, and not counterfeit by the intermixture of some adulterate Lustre and Affectation. Yet whether this dumb Person shall be of the Male or Female Sex is in your Option, lieth at your Discretion, and altogether dependeth on your own Election.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:43704:81"/>I would more willingly (quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) consult with and be advised by a Dumb Woman, were it not that I am affraid of two things. The first is, That the greater part of Women, whatever it be that they see, do always represent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Fancies, think and imagine, that it hath some relation to the sugred entring of the goodly <hi>Ithypallos,</hi> and graffing in the Cleft of the overturned Tree, the quick-set Imp of the Pin of Copulation. Whatever Signs, Shews or Gestures we shall make, or whatever our Behaviour, Carriage or Demeanour shall happen to be in their view and Presence, they will interpret the whole in reference to the act of <hi>Androgynation,</hi> and the culbatizing Exercise, by which means we shall be abusively disappointed of our Designs, in regard that she will take all our Signs for nothing else but Tokens and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of our Desire to entice her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lists of a <hi>Cyprian</hi> Combat, or Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senconny Skirmish.</p>
            <p>Do you remember what hapned at <hi>Rome</hi> two hundred and threescore Years after the Foundation thereof? A young <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman encountring by chance at the Foot of Mount <hi>Celion</hi> with a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Latin</hi> Lady named <hi>Verona,</hi> who from her very Cradle upwards had always been
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43704:81"/>
both deaf and dumb, very civilly asked her, (not without a Chironomatick Italia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nising of his Demand, with various Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctigation of his Fingers, and other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticulations, as yet customary amongst the Speakers of that Country) what Senators in her Descent from the top of the Hill she had met with going up thither. For you are to conceive, that he knowing no more of her Deafness than Dumbness, was ignorant of both. She in the mean time, who neither heard nor understood so much as one word of what he had said, streight imagin'd, by all that she could apprehend in the lovely Gesture of his manual Signs, that what he then required of her was, what her self had a great mind to, even that which a Young Man doth naturally desire of a Woman. Then was it, that by Signs (which in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of Venerial Love are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more attractive, valid and efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than Words) she beckned to him to come along with her to her House; which when he had done, she drew him aside to a privy Room, and then made a most lively alluring Sign unto him, to shew that the Game did please her. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any more Advertisement, or so much as the uttering of one Word on either side, they fell to, and bringuardised it lustily.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:43704:82"/>The other Cause of my being averse from consulting with dumb Women, is, that to our Signs they would make no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer at all, but suddenly fall backwards in a divarication posture, to intimate thereby unto us the reality of their consent to the supposed motion of our tacit Demands. Or if they should chance to make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre-signs responsory to our Propositions, they would prove so foolish, impertinent, and ridiculous, that by them our selves should easily judge their thoughts to have no excursion beyond the duffling Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy. You know very well how at <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiniole,</hi> when the religious Nun, sister <hi>Fatbum,</hi> was made big with Child by the young <hi>Stifly-Stantor,</hi> her Pregnancy came to be known, and she cited by the <hi>Abbess,</hi> and in a full Convention of the Convent, accused of Incest. Her excuse was, That she did not consent thereto, but that it was done by the violence and impetuous force of the Friar <hi>Stifly-stand-to't. Hereto</hi> the Abbess very austerely replying, Thou naughty wicked Girl, why didst thou not cry, a Rape, a Rape, then should all of us have run to thy Succour. Her answer was, That the Rape was committed in the <hi>Dorter,</hi> where she durst not cry, because it was a place of sempiternal Silence. But (quoth the Abbess) thou roguish Wench,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43704:82"/>
why didst not thou then make some sign to those that were in the next Chamber beside thee? To this she answered, That with her Buttocks she made a sign unto them, as vigorously as she could, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one of them did so much as offer to come to her help and assistance. But (quoth the Abbess) thou scurvy baggage, why didst not thou tell it me immediately after the perpetration of the Fact, that so we might orderly, regularly, and canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally have accused him? I would have done so, had the case been mine, for the clearer manifestation of mine Innocency. I truly, Madam, would have done the like with all my heart and soul, (quoth Sister <hi>Fatbum</hi>) but that fearing I should remain in Sin, and in the hazard of Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if prevented by a sudden Death, I did confess my self to the Father Fryar before he went out of the Room, who for my Penance, enjoyned me not to tell it, or reveal the matter unto any. It were a most enormous and horrid Offence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable before God and the Angels, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal a Confession: such an abominable Wickedness would have possibly brought down Fire from Heaven, wherewith to have burnt the whole Nunnery, and sent us all headlong to the bottomless Pit, to bear company with <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram.</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:43704:83"/>
You will not (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) with all your Jesting make me laugh; I know that all Monks, Fryars, and Nuns had rather violate and infringe the highest of the Commandments of God, then break the least of their Provincial Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
            <p>Take you therefore <hi>Goatsnose,</hi> a Man very fit for your present purpose; for he is, and hath been, both dumb and deaf from the very remotest Infancy of his Childhood.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> How <hi>Goatsnose</hi> by signs maketh answer to <hi>Panurge.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>GOatsnose</hi> being sent for, came the day thereafter to <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Court; at his arrival to which <hi>Panurge</hi> gave him a fat Calf, the half of a Hog, two Punchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Wine, one Load of Corn, and thirty Franks of small Money: then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought him before <hi>Pantatgruel,</hi> in presence of the Gentlemen of the Bed-chamber, he made this sign unto him.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:43704:83"/>
He yawned along time, and in yawning made without his mouth with the thumb of his right hand the figure of the Greek Letter <hi>Tau</hi> by frequent reiterations. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he lifted up his eyes to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then turned them in his Head like a Shee-goat in the painful fit of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Birth, in doing whereof he did cough and sigh exceeding heavily: This done, after that he had made demonstration of the want of his Codpiece, he from under his shirt took his Placket-racket in a full gripe, making it therewithal clack very melodiously betwixt his Thighs: then no sooner had he with his Body stooped a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forwards, and bowed his left Knee, but that immediately thereupon holding both his Arms on his Breast, in a loose faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Posture, the one over the other, he paused awhile. <hi>Goatsnose</hi> looked wistly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and having heedfully enough view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him all over, he lifted up into the Air his left Hand, the whole fingers whereof he retained fist-ways closed together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Thumb and the Fore-finger, whose Nails he softly joyned and coupled to one another. I understand (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) what he meaneth by that sign: it denotes <hi>marriage,</hi> and withal the number <hi>thirty,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Profession of <hi>Pythagorians,</hi> you will be <hi>married.</hi> Thanks to you (quoth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43704:84"/>
               <hi>Panurge</hi>) in turning himself towards <hi>Goats<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nose,</hi> my little Sewer, pretty Masters-mate, dainty Baily, curious Sergeant-Marshal, and jolly Catchpole-leader. Then did he lift higher up than before his said left Hand, stretching out all the five Fingers thereof, and severing them as wide from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he possibly could get done. Here (says <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) doth he more amply and fully insinuate unto us, by the Token which he sheweth forth of the <hi>Quinary number,</hi> that you shall be <hi>married.</hi> Yea, that you shall not only be affianced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed, wedded, and <hi>married,</hi> but that you shall furthermore cohabit, and live jollily and merrily with your Wife; for <hi>Pythagoras</hi> called <hi>five</hi> the <hi>Nuptial Number,</hi> which together with <hi>marriage,</hi> signifieth the <hi>Consummation</hi> of Matrimony, because it is composed of a <hi>ternary</hi> the first of the odd, and <hi>binary,</hi> the first of the even Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as of a Male and Female knit and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited together. In very deed it was the fashion of old in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Festivals to light <hi>five</hi> wax Tapers, nor was it permitted to kindle any more at the magnifick Nuptials of the most Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Wealthy; nor yet any fewer at the penurious Weddings of the Poorest and most Abject of the World. Moreover in times past, the Heathen, or <hi>Paynius</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43704:84"/>
the Assistance of <hi>five</hi> Deities, or of one helpful (at least) in <hi>five</hi> several good Offices to those that were to be married: of this sort were the Nuptial <hi>Iove, Iuno,</hi> President of the Feast, the fair <hi>Venus, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> the Goddess of Eloquence and Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and <hi>Diana,</hi> whose aid and succour was required to the labour of Child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Then shouted <hi>Panurge,</hi> O the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile <hi>Goatsnose,</hi> I will give him a Farm near <hi>Gnais,</hi> and a Wind-mill hard by <hi>Mireba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais.</hi> Hereupon the dumb Fellow sneezeth with an impetuous vehemency, and huge concussion of the Spirits of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, withdrawing himself in so doing with a jerting turn towards the left hand. By the Body of a Fox new slain (quoth <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi>) what is that? this maketh nothing for your advantage; for he betokeneth thereby that your <hi>marriage</hi> will be inauspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and unfortunate. This snezing (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine of <hi>Terpsion,</hi> is the <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Demon) if done towards the right side, it imports and portendeth, that boldly, and with all assurance, one may go whither he will, and do what he listeth, according to what deliberation he shall be pleased to have thereupon taken: his entires in the beginning, progress in his proceedings, and success in the events and issues will be all lucky, good, and happy. The quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43704:85"/>
thereto is thereby implied and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saged, if it be done towards the left. You (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) do take always the matter at the worst, and continually, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Davus,</hi> casteth in new disturbances and obstructions; nor ever yet did I know this old paultry <hi>Terpsion</hi> worthy of citation, but in points only of Cosenage and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. Nevertheless (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>). <hi>Cicero</hi> hath written I know not what to the same purpose in his <hi>Second Book of Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Panurge</hi> then turning himself towards <hi>Goatsnose</hi> made this sign unto him. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his Eye-lids upwards, wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ched his Jaws from the right to the left side, and drew forth his Tongue half out of his Mouth; this done, he posited his left Hand wholly open (the mid-finger wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which was perpendicularly placed upon the Palm thereof) and set it just in the room where his Codpiece had been. Then did he keep his right Hand altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shut up in a fist, save only the Thumb, which he streight turned backwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly under the right Arm-pit, and settled it afterwards on that most eminent part of the Buttocks which the <hi>Arabs</hi> call the <hi>Alkatim.</hi> Suddenly thereafter he made this interchange, he held his right Hand after the manner of the left, and posited
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43704:85"/>
it on the place wherein his Codpiece some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time was, and retaining his left Hand in the form and fashion of the right, he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it upon his <hi>Alkatim:</hi> this altering of Hands did he reiterate nine several times; at the last whereof, he reseated his Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids into their own first natural position. Then doing the like also with his Jaws and Tongue, he did cast a squinting look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Goatsnose,</hi> diddering and shivering his Chaps, as Apes use to do now-a-days, and Rabbets, whilst almost starved with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they are eating Oats in the Sheaf.</p>
            <p>Then was it that <hi>Goatsnose</hi> lifting up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air his right Hand wholly open and displayed, put the Thumb thereof, even close unto its first articulation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two third Joints of the middle and ring fingers, pressing about the said Thumb thereof very hard with them both, and whilst the remainent Joints were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and shrunk in towards the Wrist, he stretched forth with as much straitness as he could, the fore and little fingers. That hand thus framed and disposed of, he laid and posited upon <hi>Panurge</hi>'s Navel, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving withal continually the aforesaid Thumb, and bearing up, supporting, or under-propping that Hand upon the above specified, and fore and little fingers, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two Leggs. Thereafter did he make
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43704:86"/>
in this posture his Hand by little and little, and by degrees and pauses, successively to mount from athwart the Belly to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, from whence he made it to ascend to the Breast, even upwards to <hi>Panurges</hi>'s Neck, still gaining ground, till having reached his Chin he had put within the concave of his Mouth his afore-mentioned Thumb: then fiercely brandishing the whole Hand, which he made to rub and grate against his Nose, he heaved it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up, and made the fashion, as if with the Thumb thereof he would have put out his Eyes. With this <hi>Panurge</hi> grew a little angry, and went about to withdraw, and rid himself from this ruggedly untoward dumb Devil. But <hi>Goatsnose</hi> in the mean time prosecuting the intended purpose of his <hi>Prognosticatory Response,</hi> touched very rudely with the above-mentioned shaking Thumb, now his Eyes, then his Forehead, and after that, the borders and corners of his Cap. At last <hi>Panurge</hi> cried out saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Before God, Master-Fool, if you do not let me alone, or that you will presume to vex me any more, you shall receive from the best hand I have a Mask, wherewith to cover your rascally scoundred Face, yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

make sign to him of a hail of Fisticuffs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Muzzle.</p>
            <p>What the Devil (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) means this busie restless Fellow? what is it that this Polypragmonetick Ardelione to all the Fiends of Hell doth aim at? he hath almost thrust out mine Eyes, as if he had been to potch them in a Skillet with Butter and Eggs, by God, <hi>da Iurandi,</hi> I will feast you with flirts and raps on the Snout, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlarded with a double row of bobs and finger filipings? Then did he leave him in giving him by way of <hi>Salve</hi> a Volley of Farts for his Farewel. <hi>Goatsnose</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Panurge</hi> thus to slip away from him, got before him, and by meer strength en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing him to stand, made this sign unto him. He let fall his right Arm toward his Knee on the same side as low as he could, and raising all the fingers of that Hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a close fist, past his dexterer Thumb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the foremost and mid-fingers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging. Then scrubbing and swindg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little with his left Hand alongst, and upon the uppermost in the very bought of the Elbow of the said dexter Arm, the whole Cubit thereof by leisure fair, and softly, at these thumpatory warnings, did raise and elevate it self even to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and above it, on a suddain did he then let it fall down as low as before: and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:43704:87"/>
after that, at certain intervals and such spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time, raising and abasing it, he made a shew thereof to <hi>Panurge.</hi> This so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Panurge,</hi> that he forthwith lifted his Hand to have strucken him the dumb Royster, and given him a sound whirret on the Ear, but that the respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which he carried to the Presence of <hi>Pantagruel</hi> restrained his Choler, and kept his Fury within bounds and limits. Then said <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> If the bare signs now vex and trouble you, how much more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously will you be perplexed and disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the real things, which by them are represented and signified. All Truths agree, and are consonant with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this dumb Fellow Prophesieth and Foretelleth that you will be <hi>married, cuckold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beaten</hi> and <hi>robbed.</hi> As for the marriage (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) I yield thereto, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the verity of that point of his Prediction; as for the rest I utterly abjure and deny it: and believe Sir, I beseech you, if it may please you so to do, that <hi>in the matter of Wives and Horses, never any Man was predestinated to a better Fortune than I.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> How <hi>Panurge</hi> consulteth with an old French Poet, named <hi>Raminagrobis.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Never thought (said <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) to have encountred with any Man so head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong in his Apprehensions, or in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions so wilful, as I have found you to be, and see you are. Nevertheless, the better to clear and extricate your Doubts, let us try all courses, and leave no stone unturned, nor wind unsailed by. Take good heed to what I am to say unto you, the <hi>Swans,</hi> which are Fouls consecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> never chant but in the hour of their approaching Death, especially in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> Flood, which is a River that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth along some of the Territories of <hi>Phrygia.</hi> This I say, because <hi>Elianus</hi> and <hi>Alexander Wyndius</hi> write, that they had seen several Swans in other places die, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any of them sing, or chant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their death. However, it passeth for current that the imminent death of a Swan is presaged by his foregoing Song, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43704:88"/>
that no <hi>Swan</hi> dieth until preallably he have Sung.</p>
            <p>After the same manner <hi>Poets,</hi> who are under the protection of <hi>Apollo,</hi> when they are drawing near their latter end, do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily become Prophets, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of that God sing sweetly, in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticinating things which are to come. It hath been likeways told me frequently, That old decrepit Men upon the Brinks of <hi>Charon</hi>'s Banks, do usher their Decease with a disclosure, all at ease (to those that are desirous of such Informations) of the determinate and assured truth of future Accidents and Contingencies. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber also that <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> in a certain Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of his, calleth folks <hi>Sybils,</hi>

               </gap> by the Shore, we see afar off Mariners, Sea faring men, and other Travellers alongst the curled Waves of <hi>Azure Thetis</hi> within their Ships, we then consider them in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence only, and seldom proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to wish them a happy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous Arrival: but when they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near to the Haven, and come to wet their Keels within their Harbour, then both with words and gestures we salute them, and heartily congratulate their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess safe to the Port wherein we are our selves. Just so the Angels, Heroes, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43704:88"/>
good Demons (according to the Doctrine of <hi>Platonicks</hi>) when they see Mortals draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near unto the Harbour of the Grave, as the most sure and calmest Port of any, full of Repose, Ease, Rest, Tranquility; free from the Troubles and Sollicitudes of this tumultuous and tempestuous World; then is it that they with alacrity Hale and Salute them, Cherish and Comfort them, and speaking to them lovingly, begin even then to bless them with Illuminations, and to communicate unto them the abstrusest Mysteries of Divination. I will not offer here to confound your Memory by quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting antick Examples of <hi>Isaac,</hi> of <hi>Iacob,</hi> of <hi>Patroclus</hi> towards <hi>Hector,</hi> of <hi>Hector</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Achilles,</hi> of <hi>Polymnester</hi> towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamemnon,</hi> of <hi>Hecuba,</hi> of the <hi>Phodian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned by <hi>Possidonius,</hi> of <hi>Calanus</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian towards <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, of <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> towards <hi>Mezentius,</hi> and of many others; it shall suffice for the present, that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate unto you the learned and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Knight and Cavalier <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Ballay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> late Lord of <hi>Langcy,</hi> who died on the Hill of <hi>Tarara,</hi> the Tenth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macterick</hi> year of his Age, and of our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation 1543. according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Account. The last three or four hours of his Life he did imploy in the serious ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance of a very pithy Discourse, whilst
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43704:89"/>
with a clear Judgment, and Spirit void of all Trouble, he did foretell several impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Things, whereof a great deal is come to pass, and the rest we wait for. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, his <hi>Prophesies</hi> did at that time seem unto us somewhat strange, absurd, and unlikely; because there did not then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear any sign of efficacy enough to engage our Faith to the belief of what he did prognosticate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>We have hear near to the Town of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomer,</hi> a Man that is both <hi>Old</hi> and a <hi>Poet,</hi> to wit, <hi>Raminogrobis,</hi> who to his Second Wife espoused my Lady <hi>Broadsow,</hi> on whom he begot the fair <hi>Basoche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it hath been told me, he is a dying, and so near unto his latter end, that he is almost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very last moment, point, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle thereof; repair thither as fast as you can, and be ready to give an attentive Ear to what he shall <hi>chant</hi> unto you: it may be, that you shall obtain from him what you desire, and that <hi>Apollo</hi> will be pleased, by his means, to clear your scruples. I am content (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) let us go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Epistemon,</hi> and that both instantly and in all hast, least otherways his Death prevent our coming. Wilt thou come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, Fryar <hi>Ihon?</hi> Yes, that I will, (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) right heartily to do thee a Courtesie, my Billy-ballocks; for
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43704:89"/>
I love thee with the best of my Milt and Liver. Thereupon, incontinently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further lingring to the way, they all three went, and quickly thereafter (for they made good speed) arriving at the Poetical Habitation, they found the jolly Old Man, albeit in the Agony of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from this World, looking chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with an open Countenance, splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Aspect, and Behaviour full of alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. After that <hi>Panurge</hi> had very civilly saluted him, he in a free Gift did present him with a Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Ring, which he even then put upon the Medical Finger of his Left Hand, in the Collet or Bezle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was inchased an Oriental Saphire, very fair and large. Then, in imitation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> did he make an Oblation unto him of a fair <hi>White Cock;</hi> which was no sooner set upon the Tester of his Bed, then that with a high raised Head and Crest, lustily shaking his Feather-Coat, he crowed <hi>Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriphonically</hi> loud. This done, <hi>Panurge</hi> very courteously required of him, that he would vouchsafe to favour him with the Grant and Report of his Sence and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, touching the future Destiny of his intended <hi>Marriage.</hi> For answer hereto, when the honest Old Man had forthwith commanded Pen, Paper, and Ink to be brought unto him, and that he was at the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43704:90"/>
same Call conveniently served with all the three, he wrote these following Verses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <hi>PAnurge,</hi> at his issuing forth of <hi>Ramina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobris's</hi> Chamber, said, as if he had been horribly affrighted, by the Vertue of God, I believe that he is an <hi>Heretick,</hi> the Devil take me, if I do not; he doth so villanously rail at the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Fryars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Iacobins:</hi> who are the two Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spheres of the Christian World; by whose Gyronomonick Circumbilvaginations, as by two Celivagous Filopendulums<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the Autonomatick Metagrobolism of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> Church, when tottering and emblu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricated with the Gibble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gabble Gibbrish of this odious Error and Heresie, is homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrically poysed. But what harm in the Devil's Name, have these poor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils the <hi>Capucins</hi> and <hi>Minims</hi> done unto him? Are not these beggarly Devils suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently wretched already? Who can imagine that these poor Snakes, the very Extracts of <hi>Ichthyophagy,</hi> are not throughly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:43704:91"/>
enough besmoaked and besmeared with Misery, Distress, and Calamity? Dost thou think, Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> by thy Faith, that he is in the State of Salvation? He goeth, before God, as surely damned to Thirty thousand baskets full of Devils, as a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Bill to the lopping of a Vine-Branch.</p>
            <p>To <hi>revile</hi> with opprobrious Speeches the good and couragious <hi>Props</hi> and <hi>Pillars of the Church,</hi> is that to be called a <hi>Poetical Fury?</hi> I cannot rest satisfied with him, he sinneth grosly, and blasphemeth against the true Religion. I am very much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at his scandalizing Words, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious Obloquy. I do not care a straw (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) for what he hath said; for although every body should twit and jerk them, it were but a just retaliation, seeing all Persons are served by them with the like Sauce: therefore do I pretend no Interest therein. Let us see nevertheless what he hath written. <hi>Panurge</hi> very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively read the Paper which the Old Man had penned, then said to his two Fellow-Travellers, <hi>The poor Drinker doteth:</hi> howsoever, I excuse him; for that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is now drawing near to the end, and final closure of his Life: Let us go make his <hi>Epitaph.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:43704:92"/>By the Answer which he hath given us, I am not, I protest, one jot wiser then I was, hearken here <hi>Epistemon,</hi> my little Bully, dost not thou hold him to be very Resolute in his <hi>Responsory</hi> Verdicts? he is a witty, quick, and subtle Sophister.

in us to deal so in the matter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide so well for him, that albeit he come to lose both Body and Life, he may at least escape the risk and danger of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation of his Soul. We will by our holy perswasions bring him to a sence and feeling of his Escapes, induce him to acknowledge his Faults, move him to a cordial Repentance of his Errors, and stir up in him such a sincere. Contrition of Heart for his Offences, as will prompt him with all earnestness to cry Mercy, and to beg Pardon at the Hands of the good <hi>Fathers,</hi> as well of the absent, as of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uch as are present: Whereupon we will take Instrument formally and authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extended, to the end he be not, after his Decease, declared an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and condemned, as were <hi>the Hobgoblins of the Provost's Wife of</hi> Orleans, to the undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Punishments, Pains and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as are due to, and inflicted on those that inhabit the horrid Cells of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Regions: and withal incline, instigate, and perswade him to bequeath, and leave in Legacy (by way of an amends and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the outrage and injury done) to those good <hi>Religious Fathers,</hi> throughout all the Convents, Cloysters, and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stries of this Province, <hi>many Bribes,</hi> a great deal of <hi>Mass-singing,</hi> store of <hi>Obits,</hi>

and that sempiternally, on the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Day of his Decease, every one of them all be furnished with a quintuple Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and that the great Borrachoe, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the best Liquor, trudge apace along the Tables, as well of the young Duckling, Monkito's, Lay-Brothers, and lowermost degree of the Abbey-Lubbards, as of the Learned Priests, and Reverend Clerks. The very meanest of the Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Mitiants unto the Order being equally admitted to the benefit of those Funerary and Obsequial Festivals, with the aged Rectors, and professed Fathers; this is the surest ordinary means, whereby from God he may obtain forgiveness.</p>
            <p>Ho, ho, I am quite mistaken, I digress from the purpose, and fly out of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, as if my Spirits were a wool-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering. The Devil take me, if I go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Vertue, God, the Chamber is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready full of Devils. O what a swinging, thwacking Noise is now amongst them! O the terrible Coyl that they keep! Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, do you not hear the rustling thump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bustle of their Stroaks and Blows, as they scuffle with one another, like true Devils indeed, who shall gulp up the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minogrobis</hi> Soul, and be the first Bringer of it, whilst it is hot, to Monsieur <hi>Lucifer.</hi> Beware, and get you hence: for my part,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43704:95"/>
I will not go thither; the Devil roast me if I go. Who knows but that these hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry mad Devils may in the hast of their rage and fury of their impatience, take a <hi>quid</hi> for a <hi>quo,</hi> and instead of <hi>Raminagro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> snatch up poor <hi>Panurge</hi> frank and free? Though formerly, when I was deep in Debt, they always failed. Get you hence: I will not go thither. Before God, the very bare apprehension thereof is like to kill me. To be in the place where there are greedy, famished, and hunger-starved Devils; amongst factious Devils: amidst trading and trafficking Devils: O the Lord preserve me! Get you hence, I dare pawn my Credit on it, that no <hi>Iacobin, Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, Carme Capucin, Theatin,</hi> or <hi>Minim,</hi> will bestow any personal Presence at his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

What the Deuce moved him to be so snappish and depravedly bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the good Fathers of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Why did he cast them off, reject them, and drive them quite out of his Chamber, even in that very nick of time when he stood in greatest need of the aid, suffrage, and assistance of their devout
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:43704:95"/>
Prayers, and holy Admonitions? Why did not he by Testament leave them, at least, some jolly Lumps and Cantles of substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Meat, a parcel of Cheek-puffing Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and a little Belly-Timber, and Provision for the Guts of these poor Folks, who have <hi>nothing but their Life in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let him go thither, who will; the Devil take me, if I go; for if I should, the Devil would not fail to snatch me up. <hi>Cancro:</hi> Ho, the Pox! Get you hence, Fryar <hi>Ihon;</hi> Art thou content that Thirty thousand Waineload of Devils should get away with thee at this same very instant? If thou be, at my Request, do these Three things: <hi>First,</hi> Give me thy Purse; for besides, that thy Money is marked with Crosses, and the Cross is an Enemy to Charms, the same may befall to thee, which not long ago happened to <hi>Ihon Dodin,</hi> Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Excise of <hi>Coudray,</hi> at the Ford of <hi>Vede,</hi> when the Soldiers broak the Planks. This money'd Fellow meeting at the very Brink of the Bank of the Ford, with Fryar <hi>Adam Crankcod,</hi> a <hi>Franciscan Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servantin</hi> of <hi>Mirebeau,</hi> promised him a new Frock, provided, that in the transporting of him over the Water, he would bear him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Neck and Shoulders, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of carrying dead Goats: for he was a lusty, strong-limb'd, sturdy Rogue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:43704:96"/>The Condition being agreed upon, Friar <hi>Crankcod</hi> trusseth himself up to his very Ballocks, and layeth upon his Back like a fair little Saint <hi>Christopher,</hi> the load of the said Supplicant <hi>Dodin,</hi> and so car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd him gayly and with a good Will; as <hi>Aeneas</hi> bore his Father <hi>Anchises</hi> through the Conflagration of <hi>Troy,</hi> singing in the mean while a prety <hi>Avemaris Stella.</hi> When they were in the very deepest place of all the Foord, a little above the Master-wheel of the Water-Mill, he asked if he had any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coin about him. Yes, (quoth <hi>Dodin</hi>) a whole Bag full; and that he needed not to mistrust his Ability in the performance of the Promise, which he had made unto him, concerning a new Frock. How<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (quoth Friar <hi>Cranckcod</hi>) thou knowest well enough, that by the express Rules, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Injunctions of our Order, we are forbidden to carry on us any kind of Money: Thou art truly unhappy, for having made me in this point to commit a hainous Trespass. Why didst thou notleave thy Purse with the Miller<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fail thou shalt presently receive thy Reward for it; and if ever hereafter I may but lay hold upon thee within the Limits of our Chancel at <hi>Mirebeau,</hi> tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

his Burthen, he throws me down your <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> headlong.</p>
            <p>Take Example by this <hi>Dodin,</hi> my dear Friend Friar <hi>Iohn,</hi> to the end that the Devils may the better carry thee away at thine own ease. Give me thy Purse. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no manner of Cross upon thee. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lieth an evident and manifestly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Danger: For if you have any Silver coined with a Cross upon it, they will cast thee down headlong upon some Rocks; as the Eagles use to do with the Tortoises for the breaking of their Shells, as the bald Pate of the Poet <hi>Eschilus</hi> can suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bear witness. Such a Fall would hurt thee very sore by Sweet Bully, and I would be sorry for it; or otherways they will let thee fall, and tumble down into the high swollen Waves of some capacious Sea, I know not where; but I warrant thee far enough hence, (as <hi>Icarus</hi> fell) which from thy Name would afterwards get the Denomination of the <hi>Funnelian</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Out of Debt: For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils carry a great liking to those that are out of Debt. I have sore felt the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof in mine own particular; for now the lecherous Varlets are always woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, courting me, and making much of me, which they never did when I was
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43704:97"/>
all to pieces. The Soul of one in Debt is insipid, dry, and heretical altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

as much as the Splendour and Light of the Sun. In Confirmation of the Verity whereof he related this Story, That <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> at his Descent into Hell to all the Devils of those Regions, did not by half so much terrifie them with his <hi>Club</hi> and <hi>Lion's Skin,</hi> as afterwards <hi>Aeneas</hi> did with his clear shining Armour upon him, and his Sword in his hand well furbished and unrusted, by the Aid, Council and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Sybilla Cumana.</hi> That was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the reason why the Senior <hi>Ihon Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo di Trivulcio,</hi> whilst he was a dying at <hi>Chartres,</hi> called for his Cutlass, and died with a Drawn Sword in his hand, laying about him alongst and athwart around the Bed, and every where within his reach, like a stout, doughty, valorous and Knight-like Cavaleer: By which resolute manner of Fence he scared away and put to flight all the Devils that were then ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wait for his Soul at the passage of his Death. When the <hi>Malsorets</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balists</hi> are asked, Why it is that none of all the Devils do at any time enter into the Terestrial Paradice? Their Answer hath been, is, and will be still, That there is a <hi>Cherubin</hi> standing at the Gate thereof with a Flame-like glistering Sword in his hand. Although to speak in the true <hi>Diabological</hi> Sence or Phrase of <hi>Toledo,</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:43704:98"/>
I must needs confess and acknowledge, that veritably the Devils cannot be killed, or die by the stroke of a Sword. I do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless avow and maintain, according to the Doctrine of the said <hi>Diabology,</hi> that they may suffer a Solution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity; (as if with thy Shable thou shouldst cut athwart the Flamme of a burning Fire, or the gross opacous Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of a thick and obscure Smoak) and cry out, like very Devils, at their Sense and Feeling of this Dissolution, which in real Deed I must averr and affirm is devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly painful, smarting and dolorous.</p>

            <p>But the most fearful and tumultuous Coil and Stir, the terriblest and most boisterous Garboil and Hurry, the chiefest rustling <hi>Black Santus</hi> of all, and most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Hurly Burly, springeth from the grievously plangorous howling and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Devils, who Pell-mell, in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-head Confusion, waiting for the poor Souls of the maimed and hurt Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, receive unawares some Stroaks with Swords, and so by those means suffering a Solution of, and Division in the <hi>Continui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of their Aerial and Invisible Substances: As if some Lackey, snatching at the Lard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slices, stuck in a piece of Roast-meat on the Spit, should get from Mr. <hi>Greazyfist</hi> a good rap on the Knuckles with a Cudgel, they cry out and shout like Devils.

have been speaking here of well-furbished Armour and bright shining Swords. But so is it not (Friar <hi>Ihon</hi>) with thy Weapon; for by a long discontinuance of Work, ceslation from Labour, desisting from making it officiate, and putting it into that practice wherein it had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accustomed; and in a word, for want of occupation, it is, upon my Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more rusty than the Key-hole of an old Poudering-Tub.

            </head>
            <p>HAving left the Town of <hi>Villomere,</hi> as they were upon their return towards <hi>Pantagruel, Panurge</hi> in addressing his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43704:99"/>
to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> spoke thus: My most ancient Friend and Gossip, thou seest the perplexity of my Thoughts, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est many Remedies for the removal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; art thou not able to help and succour me? <hi>Epistemon</hi> thereupon taking the Speech in hand, represented unto <hi>Panurge,</hi> how the open Voice and common Fame of the whole Country did run upon no other Discourse, but the derision and mockery of his new Disguise; wherefore his Counsel unto him was that he would in the first place be pleased to make use of a little <hi>Hellebore,</hi> for the purging of his Brain of that peccant humour, which thro' that extravagant and fantastick Mummery of his had furnished the People with a too just occasion of flouting and gibbing, jeering and scoffing him; and that next he would resume his ordinary Fashion of Accoutrement, and go apparelled as he was wont to do. I am (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) my dear Gossip <hi>Epistemon,</hi> of a mind and resolution to Marry, but am afraid of being a Cuckold, and to be unfortunate in my Wedlock: For this cause have I made a Vow to young St. <hi>Francis,</hi> (who at <hi>Plessiletours</hi> is much reverenced of all Women, earnestly cried unto by them, and with great Devotion; for he was the first Founder of the Confraternity of good
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43704:100"/>
Men, whom they naturally covet, affect and long for) <hi>to wear Spectacles in my Cap,</hi> and <hi>to carry no Codpiece in my Breeches,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the present Inquietude and Perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Spirits be fully setled.</p>
            <p>Truly (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) that is a pretty jolly <hi>Vow,</hi> of Thirteen to a Dozen: It is a shame to you, and I wonder much at it, that you do not return unto your self, and recall your Senses from this their wild swarving and straying abroad to that rest and stilness which becomes a vertuous Man. This whimsical Conceit of yours brings me to the remembrance of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promise made by the <hi>Shaghaired Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives,</hi> who having in their Controversie against the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for the Terreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Tyree</hi> lost the Battle, which they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped should have decided it for their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>vowed</hi> to carry never any hair on their Heads, till preallably they had recovered the loss of both their Honour and Lands: As likewise to the memory of the <hi>Vow</hi> of a pleasant <hi>Spaniard</hi> called <hi>Michel Doris,</hi> who <hi>vowed</hi> to carry in his Hat a piece of the Shin of his Leg, till he should be revenged of him who had struck it off. Yet do not I know which of these two deserveth most to wear a Green and Yellow Hood with a Hares Ears tied to it, either the aforesaid vain-glorious <hi>Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:43704:100"/>
or that <hi>Euguerrant,</hi> who having forgot the art and manner of writing Histories, set down by the <hi>Samosatian</hi> Philosopher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maketh a most tediously long Narrative and Relation thereof: For at the first reading of such a profuse Discourse, one would think it had been broached for the introducing of a Story of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and moment concerning the waging of some formidable War, or the notable change and mutation of potent States and Kingdoms; but in conclusion, the World laugheth at the capricious Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, at the <hi>English-man</hi> who had affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as also at their Scribler <hi>Euguerrant,</hi> more driveling at the Mouth than a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-pot. The Jest and Scorn thereof is not unlike to that of the Mountain of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> which by the Poet was made to cry out and lament most enormously as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Pangs and Labour of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, at which deplorable and exorbitant Cries and Lamentations the whole Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood being assembled in expectation to see some marvellous monstrous Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, could at last perceive no other but the paultry ridiculous Mouse.</p>
            <p>Your mousing (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) will not make me leave my musing why Folks should be so frumpishly disposed, seeing I am certainly perswaded that some flout,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:43704:101"/>
who merit to be flouted at; yet as my <hi>Vow</hi> imports so will I do. It is now a long time since, by <hi>Iupiter Philos,</hi> we did swear Faith and Amity to one another: Give me your Advice, and tell me your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion freely, Should I marry or no? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) the case is hazardous, and the danger so eminently apparent, that I find my self too weak and insufficient to give you a punctual and peremptory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution therein; and if ever it was true, the <hi>Iudgment is difficult</hi> in matters of the <hi>Medicinal</hi> Art, what was said by <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> of <hi>Lango,</hi> it is certainly so in this case. True it is, that in my Brain there are some rowling Fancies, by means whereof some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what may be pitched upon of seeming efficacy to the disintangling your mind of those dubious Apprehensions wherewith it is perplexed; but they do not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly satisfie me. Some of the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Sect affirm, that whosoever is able to see his proper <hi>Genius,</hi> may know his own Destiny. I understand not their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; nor do I think that you adhere to them; there is a palpable Abuse. I have seen the experience of it in a very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gentleman of the Country of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strangowre.</hi> This is one of the Points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is yet another not much better. If there were any Authority now in the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:43704:101"/>
Oracles of <hi>Iupiter Ammon;</hi> of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Lebadia, Delphos, Delos, Cyrra, Patara, Tegires, Preneste, Lycia, Colophon,</hi> or in the <hi>Castalian</hi> Fountain; near <hi>Antiochia</hi> in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> between the <hi>Branchidians;</hi> of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> in <hi>Dodona;</hi> of <hi>Mercure</hi> in <hi>Phares;</hi> near <hi>Parras;</hi> of <hi>Apis,</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> of <hi>Serapis</hi> in <hi>Canorie;</hi> of <hi>Faunus</hi> in <hi>Menalia,</hi> and <hi>Albu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> near <hi>Tivoly;</hi> of <hi>Tiresias</hi> in <hi>Orchomenie;</hi> of <hi>Mosus</hi> in <hi>Silicia;</hi> of <hi>Orpheus</hi> in <hi>Lisbos;</hi> and of <hi>Trophonius</hi> in <hi>Lucadia.</hi> I would in that case advise you, and possibly not, to go thither for their Judgment concerning the Design and Enterprize you have in hand. But you know that they are all of them become as dumb as so many Fishes, since the <hi>Advent</hi> of that <hi>Saviour King,</hi> whose coming to this World hath made all Oracles and Prophesies to cease; as the approach of the Suns radiant Beams expelleth Goblins, Bugbears, Hobthrushes, Broams, Schriech-Owl-Mates, Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walking Spirits, and Tenebrions. These now are gone; but although they were as yet in continuance, and in the same Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Rule and Request that formerly they were, yet would not I counsel you to be too credulous in putting any Trust in their Responses: Too many Folks have been deceived thereby. It stands further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more upon Record, how <hi>Agrippina</hi> did
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:43704:102"/>
charge the fair <hi>Lollia</hi> with the Crime of having interrogated the Oracle of <hi>Apollo Clarius,</hi> to understand if she should be at any time married to the Emperor <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius;</hi> for which Cause she was first ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and thereafter put to a shameful and ignominious Death.</p>
            <p>But (saith <hi>Panurge</hi>) let us do better; the <hi>Ogygian</hi> Islands are not far distant from the Haven of <hi>Sammalo:</hi> Let us, after that we shall have spoken to our King, make a Voyage thither. In one of these four <hi>Isles,</hi> to wit, that which hath its primest Aspect towards the Sun setting, it is reported, (and I have read in good Antick and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Authors) that there reside many Soothsayers, Fortune-tellers, Vaticinators, Prophets, and Diviners of things to come; that <hi>Saturn</hi> inhabiteth that place, bound with fair Chains of Gold, and within the Concavity of a Golden Rock, being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished with Divine <hi>Ambrosie</hi> and <hi>Nectar,</hi> which are daily in great store and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance transmitted to him from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, by I do not well know what kind of Fowls (it may be that they are the same Ravens, which in the Deserts are said to have fed St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the first Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) he very clearly foretelleth unto every one, who is desirous to be certified of the condition of his Lot, what his Destiny
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43704:102"/>
will be, and what future Chance the Fates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have ordained for him: for the <hi>Parques,</hi> or <hi>Weerd Sisters</hi> do not twist, spin, or draw out a Thread; nor yet doth <hi>Iupiter</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, project, or deliberate any thing, which the good old Coelestial Father knoweth not to the full, even whilst he is a sleep: This will be a very summary Abbreviation of our Labour, if we but hearken unto him a little upon the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous debate and canvassing of this my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. That is (answered <hi>Epistemon</hi>) a Gullery too evident, a plain Abuse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Fib too fabulous. I will not go, not I, I will not go.</p>

            <p>NEvertheless, (quoth <hi>Epistemon,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his Discourse) I will tell you what you may do, if you will believe me, before we return to our King: Hard by here, in the <hi>Brown-wheat Island,</hi> dwelleth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of Astrology, Geomancy, Chiromancy, Metopomancy, and others of a like stuff and nature, he foretelleth all things to come: Let us talk a little, and confer with him about your Business. Of that (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) I know nothing: but of this much concerning him I am assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that one day, and that not long since, whilst he was prating to the Great King, of Coelestial, Sublime, and Transcendent Things, the Lackqueys and Footboys of the Court, upon the upper Steps of Stairs between two Doors, jumbled, one after another, as often as they lifted, his Wife; who is passable fair, and a pretty snug Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Thus he who seemed very clearly to see all Heavenly and Terrestrial Things without Spectacles, who discoursed bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Adventures past, with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence opened up present Cases and Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and stoutly professed the presaging of all future Events and Contingencies, and was not able with all the Skill and Cunning that he had, to perceive the Bumbasting of his Wife, whom he repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be very chast; and hath not till this hour, got Notice of any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Yet let us go to him, seeing you will have it so: for surely we can never learn too much. They on the very next ensuing Day, came to <hi>Her Trippa</hi>'s. Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43704:103"/>
               <hi>Panurge,</hi> by way of Donative, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him with a long Gown lined all thorough with Wolves-skins, with a short Sword mounted with a gilded Hilt, and covered with a Velvet Scabbard, and with fifty good single Angels: then in a familiar and friendly way did he ask of him his Opinion touching the Affair. At the very first <hi>Her Trippa</hi> looking on him very wist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the face, said unto him: Thou hast the Metoposcopy, and Physiognomy of a Cuckold; I say, of a notorious and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cuckold. With this casting an eye upon <hi>Panurge</hi>'s right Hand in all the parts thereof, he said, This rugged Draught which I see here, just under the Mount of <hi>Iove,</hi> was never yet but in the Hand of a Cuckold. Afterwards, he with a White Lead Pen, swiftly, and hastily drew a certain Number of diverse kinds of Points, which by Rules of Geomancy he coupled and joyned together, then said, Truth it self is not truer, then that it is certain, thou wilt be a Cuckold, a little after thy Marriage. That being done, he asked of <hi>Panurge</hi> the Horoscope of his Nativity; which was no sooner by <hi>Panurge</hi> tendred unto him, then that, erecting a Figure, he very promptly and speedily formed and fashion'd a compleat Fabrick of the Houses of Heaven, in all their parts, whereof when
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43704:104"/>
he had considered the Situation and the Aspects in their Triplicities, he fetched a deep sigh, and said: I have clearly enough already discovered unto you the Fate of your Cuckoldry, which is unavoidable, you cannot escape it; and here have I got of new a further assurance thereof, so that I may now hardily pronounce, and affirm without any scruple or hesitation at all, that thou wilt be a Cuckold; that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, thou wilt be beaten by thine own Wife, and that she will purloyn, filch, and steal of thy Goods from thee; for I find the <hi>Seventh House,</hi> in all its Aspects, of a malignant Influence, and every one of the Planets threatning thee with Disgrace, according as they stand seated towards one another, in relation to the Horned Signs of <hi>Aries, Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Capricorn:</hi> In the <hi>Fourth House</hi> I find <hi>Iupiter</hi> in a Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as also in a Tetragonal Aspect to <hi>Saturn,</hi> associated with <hi>Mercury:</hi> thou wilt be soundly pepper'd, my good honest Fellow, I warrant thee.

            <p>When all Cuckolds shall be at a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rendezvous, thou shouldst be their Standard-bearer. But whence comes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Ciron-worm betwixt these two Fingers?
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43704:104"/>
This <hi>Panurge</hi> said, putting the Fore-finger of his Left-hand, betwixt the Fore and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger of the Right, which he thrust out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Her Trippa,</hi> holding them open af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of two Horns, and shutting into a Fist his Thumb, with the other Fingers. Then in turning to <hi>Epistemon,</hi> he said, Lo here the true <hi>Ollus</hi> of <hi>Martial,</hi> who addicted and devoted himself wholly to the observing the Miseries, Crosses, and Calamities of others, whilst his own Wife, in the Interim, did keep an open Bawdy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</p>
            <p>This Varlet is poorer then ever was <hi>Irus,</hi> and yet he is a proud, vaunting, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, self-conceited, over-weening, and more insupportable then Seventeen Devils; in one word, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Come, let us leave this Madpash Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, this hair-brain'd Fop, and give him leave to rave and dose his Belly-full, with his private and intimately acquainted Devils; who, if they were not the very worst of all the infernal Fiends, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have daigned to serve such a knavish, barking Cur as this is. He hath not learnt the first Precept of Philosophy, which is, <hi>Know thy Self:</hi> for whilst he braggeth and boasteth, that he can discern the least
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43704:105"/>
Mote in the Eye of another, he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to see the huge Block that puts out the sight of both his Eyes. This is such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Polypragmon,</hi> as is by <hi>Plutarch</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: He is of the nature of the <hi>Lamian</hi> Witches, who in forreign Places, in the Houses of Strangers, in Publick, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the common People, had a sharper and more piercing Inspection into their Affairs then any <hi>Lync;</hi> but at home in their own proper Dwelling-Mansions, were blinder then Mold-Warps, and saw nothing at all: for their Custom was at their return from abroad, when they were by themselves in private to take their Eyes out of their Head, from whence they were as easily removable as a Pair of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles from their Nose, and to lay them up into a wooden Slipper, which for that purpose did hang behind the Door of their Lodging.</p>

Oyl and Wax: By Tephromancy, thou wilt see the Ashes thus aloft dispersed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting thy Wife in a fine Posture: By Botonomancy, for the nonce I have some few Leaves in reserve: By Sicomancy; O Divine Art in Fig-tree Leaves! By Icthiomancy, in ancient times so celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and put in use by <hi>Tiresias</hi> and <hi>Polyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> with the like certainty of event as was tried of old at the <hi>Dina-ditch</hi> within that Grove consecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> which is in the Territory of the <hi>Lycians:</hi> By Choiramancy.

Chaw, turd; (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) or yet by Alectryomancy. If I should here with a Compass draw a round, and in looking upon thee, and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Lot, divide the Circumference thereof into four and twenty equal parts, then form a several Letter of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet upon every one of them; and lastly, posit a Barly Corn or two upon each of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43704:107"/>
these so disposed Letters, I durst promise upon my Faith and Honesty, that if a young Virgin Cock be permitted to range alongst and athwart them, he should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat the Grains which are set and placed upon these Letters, <hi>A.

I will, if you please, suddenly set up again, and revive some one lately deceased, as <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Tyan</hi> did to <hi>Achilles,</hi> and the <hi>Pythoniss</hi> in the Presence of <hi>Saul;</hi> which Body so raised up and requickned, will tell us the Sum of all you shall require of him; no more nor less than at the Invocation of <hi>Erictho,</hi> a certain defunct Person foretold to <hi>Pompy</hi> the whole progress and issue of the fatal Battle fought in the <hi>Pharsalian</hi> Fields? Or if you be afraid of the Dead, as commonly all Cuckolds are, I will make use of the Faculty of Sciomancy.

Go, get thee gone (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) thou Frantick Ass, to the Devil, and be bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, filthy <hi>Bordachio</hi> that thou art, by some <hi>Albanian,</hi> for a Steeple-crown'd Hat. Why the Devil didst not thou counsel me as well to hold an Emerald, or the Stone of a <hi>Hyena</hi> under my Tongue? Or to furnish and provide my self with Tongues of Whoops, and Hearts of Green Frogs? Or to eat of the Liver and Milt of some Dragon? To the end that by those means I might at the chanting and chirping of Swans and other Fowls, understand the Substance of my future Lot and Destiny, as did of old the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> in the Country of <hi>Mesopotamia?</hi> Fifteen brace of Devils seize upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul of this horned, Renegado, miscreant Cuckold, the Inchanter, Witch, and Sorcerer of Antichrist to all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of Hell.</p>
            <p>Let us return towards our King: I am sure he will not be well pleased with us, if he once come to get notice that we have been in the Kennel of this muffled Devil. I repent my being come hither. I would willingly dispence with a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Nobles, and Fourteen Yeomans, on condition that he who not long since did blow in the bottom of my Breeches, should instantly with his squirting Spittle
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:43704:108"/>
inluminate his Mustaches. O Lord God now! how the Villain hath besmoaked me with Vexation and Anger, with Charms and Witchcraft, and with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Coyl and Stir of Infernal and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Devils! The Devil take him: say <hi>Amen;</hi> and let us go drink. I shall not have any Appetite for my Victuals (how good Cheer soever I make) these two days to come, hardly these four.</p>

            <p>My Harcabuzing Cod, and Buttock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirring Ballock, Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my Friend: I do carry a singular respect unto thee, and honour thee with all my Heart, thy Counsel I hold for a choice and delicate Morsel, therefore have I reserved it for the last Bit. Give me thy Advice freely, I beseech thee; Should I marry, or no? Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi> very merrily, and with a sprightly chearfulness made this Answer to him: Marry, in the Devil's Name,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:43704:111"/>
Why not? What the Devil else shouldst thou do, but marry? Take thee a Wife, and furbish her Harnish to some tune: Swinge her Skin-coat, as if thou wert beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Stock-fish; and let the repercussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Clapper from her resounding Metal, make a Noise, as if a double Peal of Chiming. Bells were hung at the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters of thy Ballocks. As I say Marry, so do I understand, that thou shouldst fall to work as speedily as may be: yea, my meaning is, that thou oughtest to be so quick and forward therein, as on this same very day, before Sun-set, to cause, proclaim thy Banes of Matrimony, and make provision of Bedsteads. By the Blood of a Hog's-pudding, till when wouldst thou delay the acting of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's part? Dost thou not know, and is it not daily told unto thee, that the end of the World approacheth? We are nearer it by three Poles, and half a Fathom, then we were two days ago. The <hi>Antichrist</hi> is already born, at least it is so reported by many: the truth is, that hitherto the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his wrath have not reached further then to the scratching of his Nurse and Governesses: his Nails are not sharp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as yet, nor have his Claws attained to their full growth; he is little.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:43704:111"/>
               <hi>Crescat; Nos qui vivimus, multiplicemur.</hi> It is written so, and it is holy stuff, I warrant you: The truth whereof is like to last as long as a Sack of Corn may be had for a Penny, and a Punction of pure Wine for Three-pence. Would thou be content to be found with thy Genitories full in the Day of Judgment? <hi>Dum vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris judicari.</hi> Thou hast (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) a right, clear, and neat Spirit, Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my Metropolitan Cod; thou speakst in very deed pertinently, and to purpose: That belike was the reason which moved <hi>Leander</hi> of <hi>Abydos</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> whilst he was swimming through the <hi>Hellespontick</hi> Sea, to make a Visit to his Sweetheart <hi>Hero</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> to pray unto <hi>Neptune,</hi> and all the other Marine Gods, thus:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Now, whilst I go, have pity on me,</l>
               <l>And at my back returning drown me.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>He was loath, it seems, to die with his Cods over-gorged: He was to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, therefore do I promise, that from henceforth no Malefactor shall by Justice be executed within my Jurisdiction of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migondinois,</hi> who shall not, for a day or two at least before, he be permitted to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; such a precious thing should not be foolishly cast away; he will perhaps therewith beget a Male, and so depart the more contentedly out of this Life, that he shall have left behind him one for one.</p>

            </head>
            <p>BY Saint <hi>Rigomet</hi> (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) I do advise thee to nothing, my dear Friend <hi>Panurge</hi>) which I would not do my self, were I in thy place: only have a special care, and take good heed thou soulder well together the Joynts of the double backed, and two bellied Beast, and fortifie thy Nerves so strongly, that there be no discontinuance in the Knocks of the <hi>Venerian</hi> thwacking, else thou art lost, poor Soul: for if there pass long intervals betwixt the Priapising Feats, and that thou make an intermission of too large a time, that will befall thee, which be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ides the Nurses, if they desist from giving suck to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43704:112"/>
Children, they lose their Milk; and if continually thou do not hold thy Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory Tool in exercise, and keep thy Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal going, thy <hi>Lacticinian</hi> Nectar will be gone, and it will serve thee only as a Pipe to piss out at, and thy Cods for a Wallet of lesser value then a Beggars Scrip. This is a certain truth I tell thee, Friend, and doubt not of it; for my self have seen the sad experiment thereof in many, who cannot now do what they would, because before they did not what they might have done.: <hi>Ex desuetudine amittuntur Privilegia:</hi> Non-usage oftentimes destroys ones Right, say the learned Doctors of the Law: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my <hi>Billy,</hi> entertain as well as possibly thou canst, that <hi>Hypogastrian,</hi> lower sort of Troglodytick People, that their chief plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure may be placed in the case of sempiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal labouring. Give order that henceforth they live not like adle Gentlemen, idly upon their Rents and Revenues, but that they may work for their Livelyhoood, by breaking ground within the <hi>Paphian</hi> Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Nay truly (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) Fryar <hi>Ihon,</hi> my left Ballock, I will believe thee, for thou dealest plain with me, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest down-right square upon the business, without going about the Bush with frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous circumstances, and unnecessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations. Thou with the splendour of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43704:113"/>
a piercing Wit, hast dissipated all the lour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clouds of anxious Apprehensions and Suspicions, which did intimidate and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me: therefore the Heavens be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to grant to thee, at all She-conflicts, a stiff-standing Fortune. Well then, as thou hast said, so will I do, I will, in good Faith, Marry; in that point there shall be no failing, I promise thee, and shall have always by me pretty Girls clothed with the Name of my Wives Waiting-Maids, that lying under thy Wings, thou mayest be Night-Protector of their Sister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>Let this serve for the first part of the Sermon. Hearken (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) to the Oracle of the Bells of <hi>Varenes;</hi> What say they? I hear and understand them (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) their Sound is by my Thirst, more uprightly fatidical, then that of <hi>Iove</hi>'s Great Kettles in <hi>Dodona.</hi> Heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; <hi>Take thee a Wife, take thee a Wife, and marry, marry, marry: for if thou marry, thou shalt find good therein, herein, here in a Wife thou shalt find good; so marry, marry.</hi> I will assure thee, that I shall be married, all the Elements invite and prompt me to it: let this Word be to thee a Brazen Wall, by diffidence not to be broken thorough. As for the Second part of this our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Thou seemest in some measure to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43704:113"/>
mistrust the readiness of my Paternity, in the practising of my Placket-Racket with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Aphrodisian</hi> Tennis-Court at all times fitting, as if the stiff God of Gardens were not favourable to me. I pray thee, favour me so much as to believe, that I still have him at a beck, attending always my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, docile, obedient, vigorous, and active in all things, and every-where, and never stubborn or refractory to my will or pleasure.</p>
            <p>I need no more, but to let go the Reins, and slacken the Leash, which is the Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and when the Game is shewn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, say, Hey, <hi>Iack,</hi> to thy Booty, he will not fail even then to flesh himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Prey, and tuzle it to some purpose. Hereby you may perceive, although my future Wife were as unsatiable and glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous in her Voluptuousness, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Venery, as ever was the Empress <hi>Messalina,</hi> or yet the Marchioness in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and I desire thee to give credit to it, that I lack not for what is requisite to overloy the Stomach of her Lust, but have wherewith aboundingly to please her.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Salomon</hi> said, who indeed of that matter speaketh Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and learnedly: as also how <hi>Aristotle</hi> after him declared for a truth, That for the greater part, the Lechery of a Woman
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43704:114"/>
is ravenous and unsatisfiable: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, let such as are my Friends, who read those passages, receive from me for a most real verity, that I for such a <hi>Gill,</hi> have a fit <hi>Iack;</hi> and that, if Womens things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be satiated, I have an Instrument inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable; an Implement as copious in the giving, as can in craving be their <hi>Vade Mecums.</hi> Do not here produce ancient Examples of the <hi>Paragons</hi> of <hi>Paillardise,</hi> and offer to match with my Testiculatory A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the <hi>Priapaean</hi> Prowess of the fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Fornicators, <hi>Hercules, Proculus, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who in his <hi>Alchoran</hi> doth vaunt, that in his Cods he had the vigour of Threescore Bully Ruffians; but let no zealous Christian trust the Rogue, the filthy ribald Rascal is a Lyar. Shall thou need to urge Authorities, or bring forth the Instance of the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, of whom <hi>Theophrastus Plinius,</hi> and <hi>Athenaeus</hi> testifie, that with the help of a certain Herb, he was able, and had given frequent Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, to toss his sinewy Piece of Generation, in the Act of carnal Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, above Threescore and ten times in the space of Four and twenty hours. Of that I believe nothing, the number is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posititious, and too prodigally foisted in: Give no Faith unto it, I beseech thee, but prithee trust me in this, and thy credulity
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:43704:114"/>
therein shall not be wronged; for it is true, and <hi>Probatum est,</hi> that my Pionier of Nature, the sacred <hi>Ithyphallian</hi> Champion, is of all stiff-intruding Blades the primest: Come hither my Ballockette, and hearken, Didst thou ever see the Monk of <hi>Castres</hi> Cowl? when in any House it was laid down, whether openly in the view of all, or covertly out of the sight of any, such was the ineffable Vertue thereof for exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and stirring up the People of both Sexes unto Lechery, that the whole Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and Indwellers, not only of that, but likeways of all the circumjacent places thereto, within three Leagues around it, did suddenly enter into Rut, both Beasts and Folks, Men and Women, even to the Dogs and Hogs, Rats and Cats.</p>
            <p>I swear to thee, that many times hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have perceived, and found in my <hi>Codpiece</hi> a certain kind of Energy, or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Vertue, much more irregular, and of a greater Anomaly, then what I have related: I will not speak to thee either of House or Cottage, nor of Church or Market, but only tell thee, that once at the Representation of the <hi>Passion,</hi> which was acted at Saint <hi>Mexents;</hi> I had no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er entred within the Pit of the Theater, but that forthwith, by the vertue and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult property of it, on a sudden all that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:43704:115"/>
were there, both Players and Spectators, did fall into such an exorbitant Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lust, that there was not Angel, Man, Devil, nor Deviless, upon the place, who would not then have Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collitched it with all their Heart and Soul.</p>
            <p>The Prompter forsook his Copy, he who played <hi>Michael</hi>'s part, came down to rights, the Devils issued out of Hell, and carried along with them most of the pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty little Girls that were there; yea, <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> got out of his Fetters; in a word: seeing the huge Disorder, I disparked my self forth of that inclosed place, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Censor,</hi> who perceiving by reason of his presence, the <hi>Floralian</hi> Festivals out of order, withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> How Friar <hi>Ihon</hi> comforteth <hi>Panurge</hi> in the douhtful matter of Cuckoldry.</head>
            <p>I Understand thee well enough, said Friar <hi>Ihon;</hi> but <hi>time makes all things plain.</hi> The most durable Marbre or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr is subject to Old Age and Decay. Though for the present thou possibly be not weary of the Exercise, yet is it like, I will hear thee confess a few years hence, that thy Cods hang dangling downwards for want of a better Truss. I see thee waxing a little hoar-headed already; thy Beard by the Distinctions of grey, white, tawny and black, hath to my thinking the resemblance of a Map of the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial Globe, or Geographical Cart. Look attentively upon, and take Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of what I shall show unto thee. Behold there <hi>Asia,</hi> here are <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Lo there <hi>Africk;</hi> here is the Mountain of the <hi>Moon,</hi> yonder thou mayst perceive the Fenny Marsh of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> On this side lieth <hi>Europe:</hi> Dost thou
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:43704:116"/>
not see the Abby of <hi>Tileme?</hi> This little Tuft, which is altogether white, is the <hi>Hyperborean Hills.</hi> By the thirst of my Throple, Friend, when Snow is on the Mountains, I say the Head and the Chin, there is not then any considerable Heat to be expected in the Valleys and Low-Countries of the Codpiece. By the Kibes of thy Heels (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) thou dost not understand the Topicks. When Snow is on the tops of the Hills, Lightning, Thunder. Tempest, Whirlwinds, Storms, Hurricanes, and all the Devils of Hell rage in the Valleys. Wouldst thou see the experience thereof, go to the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the <hi>Swissers,</hi> and earnestly perpend with thy self there the Situation of the Lake of <hi>Wendelberliok,</hi> about four Leagues distant from <hi>Berne,</hi> on the <hi>Syon</hi>-side of the Land. Thou twittest me with my Grey Heirs, yet considerest not how I am of the Nature of Leeks, which with a white Head carry a green, fresh, streight, and vigorous Tail.</p>
            <p>The truth is nevertheless, (why should I deny it) that I now and then discern in my self some indicative Signs of Old Age. Tell this, I prithee, to no body, but let it be kept very close and secret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us two; for I find the Wine much sweeter now, more savoury to my taste,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:43704:116"/>
and unto my Palate of a better relish than formerly I was wont to do; and withal, besides mine accustomed manner, I have a more dreadful Apprehension than I ever heretofore have had of lighting on bad Wine. Note and observe that this doth argue and portend I know not what of the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>Occident</hi> of my time, and signifieth that the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Meridian</hi> of mine Age is past. But what then? my Gentle Companion, that doth but beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that I will hereafter drink so much the more. That is not, the Devil hale it, the thing that I fear; nor is there where my Shoo pinches. The thing that I doubt most, aud have greatest reason to dread and suspect, is, that through some long absence of our King <hi>Pantagruel</hi> (to whom I must needs bear Company, should he go to all the Devils of <hi>Berathrum</hi>) my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Wife shall make me a Cuckold. This is, in truth, the long and the short on't: For I am by all those whom I have spoke to menac'd and threatned with a Horned Fortune; and all of them affirm, it is the Lot to which from Heaven I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated. Every one (answered Friar <hi>Ihon</hi>) that would be a Cuckold, is not one: If it be thy Fate to be hereafter of the number of that <hi>Horned</hi> Cattle, then may I conclude with an <hi>Ergo,</hi> thy Wife
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:43704:117"/>
will be beautiful, and <hi>Ergo,</hi> thou wilt be kindly used by her: Likewise with this <hi>Ergo</hi> thou shalt be blissed with the fruition of many Friends and Well-willers: And finally with this other <hi>Ergo</hi> thou shalt be <hi>saved,</hi> and have a place in <hi>Paradise.</hi> These are Monachal Topicks and Maxims of the Cloyster: Thou mayst take more liberty to sin: Thou shalt be more at ease than ever: There will be nevertheless left for thee, nothing diminished, but thy Goods shall increase notably: And if so be it was preordinated for thee, wouldst thou be so impious as not to acquiesce in thy Destiny? Speak thou jaded Cod,</p>

Neither the one nor the other (quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) would I choose to be: But if I get an inkling of the matter, I will provide well enough, or there shall not be one stick of Wood within Five hundred Leagues about me, whereof to make a Cudgel. In good Faith (Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) I speak now seriously unto thee, I think it will be my best not to marry: Hearken to what the Bells do tell me, now that we are nearer to them: <hi>Do not Marry, Marry not, not, not, not, not; Marry, Marry not, not, not, not, not: If thou Marry, thou wilt miscarry, carry, carry; thou'lt repent it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it, sent it: if thou Marry, thou a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold, a Cou-cou-Cuckoe, Cou-cou-Cuckold thou shalt be.</hi> By the worthy Wrath of God I begin to be angry; this <hi>Campa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O how I am vexed! you Monks and Fryars of the Cowl-pated, and Hood-poll'd Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, have you no Remedy nor Salve against this Malady of Graffing Horns in Heads? Hath Nature so abandoned Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane-kind, and of her help left us so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, that married Men cannot know
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:43704:121"/>
how to sail through the Seas of this mortal Life, and be safe from the Whirlpools, Quicksands, Rocks, and Banks, that lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longst the Coast of <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will (said Fryar <hi>Ihon</hi>) shew thee a way, and teach thee an expedient, by means whereof thy Wife shall never make thee a Cuckold without thy knowledge, and thine own consent. Do me the favour, I pray thee, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) my pretty soft downy Cod; now tell it, <hi>Billy,</hi> tell it, I beseech thee. Take (quoth Fryar <hi>Ihon) Hans Carvel</hi>'s Ring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Finger, who was the King of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda's</hi> chief Jeweller; besides that, this <hi>Hans Carvel</hi> had the Reputation of being very skilful and expert in the Lapidary's Profession, he was a studious, learned, and ingenious Man, a Scientifick Person, full of Knowledge, a great Philosopher, of a sound Judgment, of a prime Wit, good Sence, clear Spirited, an honest Creature, Courteous, Charitable, Giver of Alms, and of a Jovial Humour, a Boon Companion, and a Merry Blade, if ever there was any in the World: He was somewhat Gorbellied, had a little Shake in his Head, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect unwieldy of his Body; in his Old Age he took to Wife the Bayliff of <hi>Concordat</hi>'s Daughter, a young, fair, jolly, gallant, spruce, frisk, brisk, neat, feat, smirk, smug, compt, quaint, gay, fine, trixy, trim, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:43704:122"/>
proper, graceful, handsome, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, comely; and kind, a little too much to her Neighbours and Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it fell out, after the expiring of a scantling of Weeks, that Master <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> became as jealous as a Tygar, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a very profound suspition, that his new-married Gixy did keep a Buttock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirring with others: to prevent which inconveniency, he did tell her many tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Stories of the total Ruine of several Kingdoms by Adultery; did read unto her the Legend of chast Wives; then made some Lectures to her in the praise of the choice Vertue of Pucidity, and did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent her with a Book in Commendation of Conjugal Fidelity: wherein the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness of all licentious Women was odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously detested; and withal, he gave her a Chain enriched with pure Oriental Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires. Notwithstanding all this, he found her always more and more inclined to the reception of her Neighbour Copes-mates, that day by day his Jealousie increased; in sequel whereof, one Night as he was lying by her, whilst in his Sleep the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Fancies of the leacherous Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Wife, did take up the Celluls of his Brain, he dreamt that he encountred with the Devil, to whom he had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the full the buzzing of his Head,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43704:122"/>
and suspicion that his Wife did tread her Shooe awry; the Devil, he thought, in this perplexity, did for his comfort, give him a Ring, and therewithal did kindly put it on his Middle-finger, saying, <hi>Hans Carvel,</hi> I give thee this Ring, whilst thou carriest it upon that Finger, thy Wife shall never carnally be known by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thy self, without thy special knowledge and consent. Grammercy (quoth <hi>Hans Carvel</hi>) my Lord Devil, I renounce <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if ever it shall come off my Finger. The Devil vanished, as is his Custom, and then <hi>Hans Carvel</hi> full of Joy awaking, found that his Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger was as far as it could reach within the <hi>What-do-you-call-it</hi> of his Wife. I did forget to tell thee, how his Wife, as soon as she had felt the Finger there, said in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyling her Buttocks, Off, yes, nay, tut, pish, tush, aye, Lord, that is not the thing which should be put up in that place. With this <hi>Hans Carvel</hi> thought that some pilferring Fellow was about to take the Ring from him.</p>
            <p>Is not this an Infallible and Sovereign Antidote? therefore, if thou wilt believe me, in imitation of this Example, never fail to have continually the Ring of thy Wife's Commodity upon thy Finger. When that was said, their Discourse and their Way ended.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> Convocated together a <hi>Theologian, Physitian, Lawyer,</hi> and <hi>Philosopher,</hi> for extricating <hi>Panurge</hi> out of the perplexity wherein he was.</head>
            <p>NO sooner were they come into the Royal Palace, but they, to the full, made Report unto <hi>Pantagruel</hi> of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of their Expedition; they shew him the Response of <hi>Paminagrobis.</hi> When <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> had read it over and over again, the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>oftner he perused it, being the better pleased therewith; he said, in addressing his Speech to <hi>Panurge,</hi> I have not as yet seen any Answer framed to your Demand, which affordeth me more Contentment: for in this his succinct Copy of Verses, he summarily, and briefly, yet fully enough expresseth, how he would have us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that every one in the Project and Enterprize of Marriage, ought to be his own Carver, sole Arbitrator of his proper Thoughts, and from himself alone take Counsel in the main and peremptory
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:43704:123"/>
closure of what his Determination should be, in either his assent to, or dissent from it. Such always hath been my Opinion to you, and when at first you spoke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to me, I truly told you this same very thing; but tacitly you scorned my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and would not harbour it within your mind. I know for certain, and therefore may I with the greater confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence utter my conception of it, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ty,</hi> or Self love, is that which blinds your Judgment, and deceiveth you.</p>
            <p>Let us do otherways, and that is this: Whatever we are, or have, consisteth in Three Things: the Soul, the Body, and the Goods: now for the preservation of these Three, there are Three sorts of Learned Men ordained, each respectively to have care of that one which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to his charge. <hi>Theologues</hi> are appointed for the Soul, <hi>Physitians</hi> for the Welfare of the Body, and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> for the Safety of our Goods: hence it is, that it is my Resolution to have on <hi>Sunday</hi> next with me at Dinner, a <hi>Divine,</hi> a <hi>Physician,</hi> and a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> that with those Three assembled thus together, we may in every Point and Particle, confer at large of your Perplexity. By Saint <hi>Picot</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Panurge</hi>) we never shall do any good that way: I see it already, and you
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43704:124"/>
see your self how the World is vilely abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as when with a Fox-tayl one claps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Breech, to cajole him. We give our Souls to keep to the <hi>Theologues,</hi> who for the greater part are <hi>Hereticks:</hi> Our Bodies we commit to the <hi>Physitians,</hi> who never themselves take any <hi>Physick:</hi> and then we intrust our Goods to <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who never go to <hi>Law</hi> against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. You speak like a Courtier (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) but the first Point of your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion is to be denied: for we daily see how good <hi>Theologues</hi> make it their chief Business, their whole and sole Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by their Deeds, their Words, and Writings, to extirpate Errors and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies out of the Hearts of Men; and in their stead profoundly plant the true and lively Faith. The Second Point you spoke of I commend: for whereas the Professors of the Art of <hi>Medicine,</hi> give so good order to the <hi>Prophylactick,</hi> or <hi>Conservative</hi> part of their Faculty, in what concerneth their proper Healths, that they stand in no need of making use of the other Branch, which is the <hi>Curative,</hi> or <hi>Therapentick,</hi> by Medicaments. As for the Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, I grant it to be true: for Learned <hi>Advocates</hi> and <hi>Counsellors</hi> at <hi>Law,</hi> are so much taken up with the Affairs of others in their Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Pleadings, and such-like Patroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:43704:124"/>
of those who are their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Clients, that they have no leisure to attend any Controversies of their own. Therefore, on the next ensuing <hi>Sunday,</hi> let the Divine be our godly Father <hi>Hippothadee,</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honest Master <hi>Rondibilis,</hi> and the Legist our good Friend <hi>Bridlegoose:</hi> nor will it be (to my thinking) amiss, that we enter into the <hi>Pythagorick Field,</hi> and choose for an Assistant to the Three afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Doctors, our ancient faithful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, the Philosopher <hi>Trouillogan;</hi> especially seeing a perfect Philosopher, such as is <hi>Trouiilogan,</hi> is able positively to resolve all whatsoever Doubts you can propose. <hi>Carpalin,</hi> have you a care to have them here all Four on <hi>Sunday</hi> next at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without fail.</p>
            <p>I believe (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Country, in all the Corners thereof, you could not have pitched upon such other Four: which I speak not so much in regard of the most excellent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and Accomplishments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all of them are endowed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Discharge and Management of each his own Vocation and Calling, (wherein without all doubt or controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, they are the Paragons of the Land, and surpass all others) as for that <hi>Rondibilis</hi> is marrried now, who before was not: <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothadee</hi>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:43704:125"/>
was not before, nor is yet: <hi>Bridle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goose</hi> was married once, but is not now: and <hi>Trouillogan</hi> is married now, who wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was to another Wife before. Sir, if it may stand with your good liking, I will ease <hi>Carpalin</hi> of some parcel of his Labour, and invite <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> my self, with whom I of a long time have had a very intimate familiarity, and unto whom I am to speak on the behalf of a pretty hopeful Youth, who now studieth at <hi>Tholouse,</hi> under the most learned, vertuous Doctor <hi>Boissonnet.</hi> Do what you deem most expedient (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) and tell me, if my Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation can in any thing be steadable for the promoval of the good of that Youth, or otherways serve for bettering of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity and Office of the worthy <hi>Boissonet,</hi> whom I do so love and respect, for one of the ablest and most sufficient in his way, that any where are extant.

Do you find any trouble or disquiet in your Body by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate stings and pricklings of the Flesh? That I do (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) in a hugely strong and almost irresistible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Be not offended, I beseech you, good Father, at the freedom of my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. No truly, Friend, not I, (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) there is no reason why I should be displeased therewith: But in this Carnal Strife and Debate of yours, have you obtained from God the Gift and <hi>special Grace</hi> of Continency? In good Faith, not, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) My Counsel to you in that case (my Friend) is, that you marry, (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) for you should rather choose to marry once, than to burn still in Fires of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence. Then <hi>Panurge,</hi> with a jovial Heart and a loud Voice, cried out, That is spoke gallantly, without circumbiliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginating about and about, and never hit it in its centred Point. Grammercy, my good Father. In truth I am resolved now to marry, and without fail I shall do
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43704:126"/>
it quickly. I invite you to my Wedding; by the Body of a Hen, we shall make good Cheer, and be as merry as Crickets: You shall wear the Bridegroom's Colours; and if we eat a Goose, my Wife shall not rost for me. I will intreat you to lead up the first Dance of the Brides Maids, if it may please you to do me so much Favour and Honour. There resteth yet a small Difficulty, a little Scruple, yea, even less than nothing, whereof I humbly crave your Resolution; Shall I be a Cuckold, Father, yea or no? By no means, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) will you be Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kolded, if it please God. O the Lord help us now, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) whither are we driven to, good Folks? To the <hi>Conditionals,</hi> which according to the Rules and Precepts of the Dialectick Faculty, admit of all contradictions and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. <hi>If my Transalpine Mule had Wings, my Transalpine Mule would fly.</hi> If it please God I shall not be a Cockold, but I shall be a Cuckold if it please him. Good God, if this were a condition which I knew how to prevent, my Hopes should be as high as ever, nor would I despair: But you here send me to God's Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to the Closet of his little Pleasures. You my <hi>French</hi> Countrymen, which is the way you take to go thither?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:43704:127"/>My honest Father, I believe it will be your best not to come to my Wedding: The clutter and dingle dangle noise of Marriage Guests will but disturb you, and break the serious Fancies of your Brain. You love Repose, with Solitude and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; I really believe you will not come. And then you Dance but indifferently, and would be out of Countenance at the first Entry. I will send you some good things to your Chamber, together with the <hi>Bride's Favour,</hi> and there you may drink our Health, if it may stand with your good liking. My Friend (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) take my Words in the Sence wherein I meaned them, and do not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpret me. When I tell you, <hi>if it please God,</hi> do I to you any wrong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? Is it an ill Expression? Is it a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming Clause or Reserve any way scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous unto the World? Do not we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by honour the Lord God Almighty, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, Pretector and Conserver of all things? Is not that a mean, whereby we do acknowledge him to be the sole Giver of all whatsoever is good? Do not we in that manifest our Faith, that we believe all things to depend upon his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and incomprehensible Bounty? and that without him nothing can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nor after its Production be of any
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:43704:127"/>
value, force, or power, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring aid and favour of his assisting Grace? Is it not a canonical and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Exception, worthy to be premised to all our Undertakings? Is it not expedient that what we propose unto our selves, be still referred to what shall be disposed of by the Sacred Will of God, unto which all things must acquiesce in the Heavens as well as on the Earth? Is not that verily a sanctifying of his Holy Name? My Friend, you shall not be a Cuckold, if it please God, nor shall we need to despair of the knowledge of his good Will and Pleasure herein, as if it were such an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse and mysteriously hidden Secret, that for the clear understanding thereof it were necessary to consult with those of his Celestial Privy Council, or expresly make a Voyage unto the <hi>Empyrean</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where Order is given for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating of his most holy Pleasures.</p>
            <p>The great God hath done us this good, that he hath declared and revealed them to us openly and plainly, and described them in the Holy Bible. There will you find that you shall never be a Cuckold, that is to say, your Wife shall never be a Strumpet, if you make choice of one of a commendable Extraction, descended of honest Parents, and instructed in all
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:43704:128"/>
Piety and Vertue: Such a one as hath not at any time hanted or frequented the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Conversation of those that are of corrupt and deprav'd Manners; one loving and fearing God, who taketh a singular delight in drawing near to him by Faith, and the cordial observing of his Sacred Commandments: And finally, one who standing in awe of the Divine Majesty, of the most High, will be loath to offend him, and lose the favourable kindness of his Grace through any defect of Faith, or transgression against the Ordinances of his Holy Law, wherein Adultery is most rigorously forbidden, and a close Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to her Husband alone most strictly and severely enjoyned; yea, in such sort, that she is to cherish, serve and love him above any thing, next to God, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth to be beloved. In the interim, for the better schooling of her in these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and that the wholsom Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a Matrimonial Duty may take the deeper Root in her Mind, you must needs carry your self so on your part, and your behaviour is to be such, that you are to go before her in a good Example, by entertaining her unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a Conjugal Amity, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally approving your self in all your Words and Actions a faithful and discreet Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:43704:128"/>
and by living not only at home, and privately with your own Houshold and Family, but in the face also of all Men, and open view of the World, devotely, vertuously and chastly, as you would have her on her side to deport and demean her self towards you, as becomes a Godly, Loyal and Respectful Wife, who maketh Conscience to keep inviolable the Tie of a Matrimonial Oath.</p>
            <p>For as that <hi>Looking-glass</hi> is not the best, which is most deck'd with Gold and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, but that which representeth to the Eye the liveliest shapes of Objects set before it: Even so that Wife should not be most esteemed who richest is, and of the noblest Race, but she who fearing God, conforms her self nearest unto the Humour of her Husband.</p>
            <p>Consider how the <hi>Moon</hi> doth not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row her Light from <hi>Iupiter, Mars, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> or any other of the Planets; nor yet from any of those Splendid Stars which are set in the spangled Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but from her Husband only, the bright <hi>Sun,</hi> which she receiveth from him more or less, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his <hi>Aspect,</hi> and variously bestowed Eradiations. Just so should you be a Pattern to your Wife in Vertue, goodly Zeal and true Devotion, that by your
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43704:129"/>
Radiance in darting on her the <hi>Aspect</hi> of an Exemplary Goodness, she, in your imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, may outshine the Luminaries of all other Women. To this effect you daily must implore God's Grace to the Protection of you both. You would have me then (quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> twisting the Whiskers of his Beard on either side with the Thumb and Fore-finger of his Left Hand) to espouse and take to Wife the prudent frugal Woman described by <hi>Solomon:</hi> Without all doubt she is clead, and truly to my best remembrance I never saw her; the Lord forgive me. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless I thank you, Father; eat this slice of Marchpane, it will help your Disgestion; then shall you be presented with a Cup of Claret Hypocras, which is right healthful and stomached. Let us proceed.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>PAnurge</hi> continuing his Discourse, said, The first word which was spoken by him who guelded the Lubbardly quaffing Monks of <hi>Saussiniac,</hi> after that he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoned Friar <hi>Corcil,</hi> was this, <hi>To the rest.</hi> In like manner, I say, <hi>to the rest.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beseech you, my good Master <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilis,</hi> should <hi>I marry or not?</hi> By the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pace of my Mule, quoth <hi>Rondibilis,</hi> I know not what Answer to make to this Problem of yours.</p>
            <p>You say that you feel in you the <hi>prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stings</hi> of Sensuality, by which you are stirred up to Venery. I find in our Faculty of <hi>Medicine,</hi> and we have founded our Opinion therein upon the deliberate Resolution and final Decision of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Platonicks,</hi> that <hi>Carnal Concupiscence</hi> is cooled and quelled five several ways.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:43704:130"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> By the means of <hi>Wine.</hi> I shall easily believe that, (quoth Friar <hi>Ihon</hi>) for when I am well whitled with the Juyce of the Grape, I care for nothing else so I may sleep. When I say (quoth <hi>Rondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis</hi>) that <hi>Wine</hi> abateth Lust, my meaning is, <hi>Wine</hi> immoderately taken; for by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy proceeding from the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drinking of Strong Liquor, there is brought upon the Body of such a Swill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down Bouser a chilness in the Blood, a slackening in the Sinews, a Dissipation of the Generative Seed, a numbness and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betation of the Senses, with a perversive wriness and Convulsion of the Muscles; all which are great L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts and Impediments to the Act of Generation. Hence it is that <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the God of Bibbers, Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Drunkards is most commonly painted Beardless, and clad in a Womans Habit, as a Person altogether Effeminate, or like a libbed Eunuch. <hi>Wine</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less taken moderately worketh quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Effects, as is implied by the old Proverb, which saith, That <hi>Venus</hi> takes cold when not accompanied with <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi> This Opinion is of great Antiquity, as appeareth by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Diodorus</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> and confirmed by <hi>Pausanias,</hi> and universally held amongst
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43704:130"/>
the <hi>Lampsacians,</hi> that <hi>Don Priapos</hi> was the Son of <hi>Bace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Fervency of Lust is aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by certain <hi>Drugs,</hi> Plants, Herbs and Roots, which make the Taker cold, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leficiated, unfit for, and unable to perform the Act of Generation; as hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten experimented in the Water-Lilly, <hi>Heraclea, Agnus Castus,</hi> Willow-twigs, Hemp-stalks, Woodbind, Honey <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or lastly, Shut up, stop and obstruct the ways, passages and conduits through which the Seed should have been expelled, evacuated and ejected. We have nevertheless of those Ingredients, which being of a contrary Operation, heat the Blood, bend the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43704:131"/>
Nerves, unite the Spirits, quicken the Senses, strengthen the Muscles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rouze up, provoke, excite and inable a Man to the vigorous Accomplishment of the Feat of Amorous Dalliance. I have no need of those, (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) God be thanked, and you my good Master. Howsoever I pray you take no exception or offence at these my words; for what I have said was not out of any ill Will I did bear to you, the Lord he knows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Ardour of Lechery is very much subdued and mated by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Labour</hi> and continual Toiling: For by painful Exercises and laborious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so great a Dissolution is brought upon the whole Body, that the Blood which runneth alongst the Channels of the Veins thereof, for the Nourishment and Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of each of its Members, hath neither time, leisure nor power to afford the Seminal Resudation, or superfluity of the third Concoction, which Nature most carefully reserves for the conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Individual, whose Preservation she more heedfully regardeth than the propagating of the Species, and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication of Humane Kind. VVhence it is, that <hi>Diana</hi> is said to be chast, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is never idle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but always busied about her Hunting, For the same reason
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43704:131"/>
was a Camp, or Leaguer of old called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum,</hi> as if they would have said <hi>Castum:</hi> because the Soldiers, Wrestlers, Runners, Throwers of the Bar, and other such-like Athletick Champions, as are usually seen in a Military Circumvallation, do unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly travel and turmoil, and are in a perpetual stir and agitation. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Hippocrates</hi> also writeth in his Book, <hi>De<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aere Aqua &amp; locis:</hi> That in his time there were People in <hi>Scythia</hi> as impotent as Eunuchs, in the discharge of a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Exploit; because that without any cessation, pause, or respit, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from off Horseback, or otherways as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduously employed in some troublesome and molesting Drudgery.</p>
            <p>On the other part, in opposition and repugnancy hereto, the Philosophers say, <hi>That Idleness is the Mother of Luxury.</hi> When it was asked <hi>Ovid,</hi> Why <hi>Egistus</hi> became an Adulterer? he made no other Answer but this: <hi>Because he was idle.</hi> Who were able to rid the World of Loytring and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness, might easily frustrate and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>Cupid</hi> of all his Designs, Aims, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, and Devices, and so disable and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall him, that his Bow, Quiver, and Darts should from thenceforth be a meer need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Load and Burthen to him: for that it could not then lie in his power to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:43704:132"/>
strike, or wound any of either Sex, with all the Arms he had. He is not, I believe, so expert an Archer, as that he can hit the Cranes flying in the Air, or yet the young Stags skipping through the Thickets, as the <hi>Parthians</hi> knew well how to do; that is to say, People moyling, sinking, and hurrying up and down, restless, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repose. He must have those husht, still, quiet, lying at a stay, lither, and full of ease, whom he is able, though his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help him, to touch, much less to pierce with all his Arrows, in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, <hi>Theophrastus</hi> being asked on a time, What kind of Beast or Thing he judged a toyish, wanton Love to be? he made Answer, <hi>That it was a Passion of idle and sluggish Spirits.</hi> From which pretty Description of ticking Love-tricks that of <hi>Diogenes</hi>'s hatching was not very discrepant, when he defined Leachery, <hi>Occupation of Folks destitute of all other Occupation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this cause the <hi>Syconian</hi> Engraver, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nachus,</hi> being desirous to give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that Sloath, Drouziness, Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and Laziness were the prime Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Governesses of Ribaldry, made the Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> (not standing, as other Stone-Cutters had used to do, but) sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:43704:132"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The tickling pricks of Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency are blunted by an eager Study; for from thence proceedeth an incredible resolution of the Spirits, that oftentimes there do not remain so many behind as may suffice to push and thrust forwards the Generative Resudation to the places thereto appropriated, and therewithal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ate the Cavernous Nerve; whose office is to ejaculate the Moisture for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Humane Progeny. Least you should think it is not so, be pleased but to contemplate a little the Form, Fashion, and Carriage of a Man exceeding earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set upon some Learned Meditation, and deeply plunged therein, and you shall see how all the Arteries of his Brains are stretched forth, and bent like the String of a Cross-bow, the more promptly, dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and copiously to suppeditate, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and supply him with store of Spirits, sufficient to replenish, and fill up the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles, Seats, Tunnels, Mansions, Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacles, and Celluls of the common Sense; of the Imagination, Apprehension, and Fancy; of the Ratiocination, Arguing, and Resolution; as likewise of the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Recordation, and Remembrance; and with great alacrity, nimbleness, and agility to run, pass, and course from the one to the other, through those Pipes, Windings,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:43704:133"/>
and Conduits, which to skilful Anatomists are perceivable, at the end of the <hi>Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Net,</hi> where all the Arteries close in a terminating Point: which Arteries taking their rise and origine from the <hi>left Capsul</hi> of the Heart, bring through several Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits, Ambages, and Anfractuosities, the Vital, to subtilize and refine them to the Aetherial Purity of Animal Spirits. Nay, in such a studiously musing Person, you may espy so extravagant Raptures of one, as it were, out of himself, that all his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties for that time will seem to be suspended from each their proper charge and office, and his exteriour Senses to be at a stand. In a word, you cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways choose then think, that he is by an extraordinary Extasie quite transported out of what he was, or should be; and that <hi>Socrates</hi> did not speak improperly, when he said, <hi>That Philosophy was nothing else but a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon Death.</hi> This possibly is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why <hi>Democritus</hi> deprived himself of the Sense of Seeing, prizing at a much lower rate the loss of his Sight, than the diminution of his Contemplations; which he frequently had found disturbed by the vagrant, flying-out strayings of his unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and roving Eyes. Therefore is it, that <hi>Pallas,</hi> the Goddess of Wisdom, Tutress, and Guardianess of such as are diligently
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:43704:133"/>
studious, and painfully industrious, is, and hath been still accounted a Virgin. The <hi>Muses</hi> upon the same consideration are esteemed perpetual <hi>Maids:</hi> and the <hi>Graces</hi> for the like reason, have been held to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a sempiternal <hi>Pudicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember to have read, that <hi>Cupid</hi> on a time being asked of his Mother <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> why he did not assault and set upon the <hi>Muses,</hi> his Answer was, <hi>That he found them so fair, so sweet, so fine, so neat, so wise, so learned, so modest, so discreet, so courteous, so vertuous, and so continually busied and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed:</hi> One in the Speculation of the Stars; another in the Supputation of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; the Third in the Dimension of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Quantities; the Fourth in the Composition of Heroick Poems; the Fifth in the jovial Interludes of a Comick Strain; the Sixth in the stately Gravity of a Tragick Vein; the Seventh in the Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Disposition of Musical Airs; the Eighth in the compleatest manner of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Histories, and Books on all sorts of Subjects; and the Ninth in the Mysteries, Secrets, and Curiosities of all Sciences, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, Disciplines, and Arts whatsoever, whether Liberal or Mechanick; that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching near unto them, he unbended his Bow, shut his Quiver, and extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Torch, through meer shame and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:43704:134"/>
fear, that by mischance he might do them some hurt or prejudice: which done, he thereafter put off the Fillet wherewith his Eyes were bound, to look them in the Face, and to hear their Melody and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Odes. There took he the greatest pleasure in the World; that many times he was transported with their Beauty and pretty Behaviour, and charmed asleep by the Harmony: so far was he from assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or interrupting their Studies. Under this Article may be comprised, what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> wrote in the aforecited Treatise concerning the <hi>Scythians,</hi> as also that in a Book of his entituled, <hi>Of Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Production;</hi> where he hath affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all such Men to be unfit for Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as have their <hi>Parotid</hi> Arteries cut; whose Situation is beside the Ears: for the reason given already, when I was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the resolution of the Spirits, and of that Spiritual Blood, whereof the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are the sole and proper Receptacles; and that likewise he doth maintain a large portion of the Parastatick Liquor, to issue and descend from the Brains and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</p>

Sir, my worthy Master

(quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) I will do it, do not you doubt thereof; and that quickly enough, I warrant you.

               <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> How <hi>Rondibilis</hi> declareth Cuckoldry to be naturally one of the Appendances of Marriage.</head>
            <p>THere remaineth as yet, quoth <hi>Panurge</hi> going on in his Discourse, one small scruple to be cleared: you have seen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, I doubt not, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, <hi>S. P. Q. R.</hi> Si, Peu, Que, Rien: <hi>Shall not I be a Cuckold?</hi> By the Haven of Safety, cried out <hi>Rondibilis,</hi> what is this you ask of me? If you shall be a Cuckold: My Noble Friend, I am married, and you are like to be so very speedily: therefore be pleased from my Experiment in the matter, to write in your Brain, with a Steel-pen, this subsequent Ditton, <hi>There is no married Man who doth not run the hazard of being made a Cuckold.</hi> Cuckoldry natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attendeth Marriage; the Shadow doth not more naturally follow the Body, then Cuckoldry ensueth after Marriage, to place fair Horns upon the Husband's Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:43704:136"/>And when you shall happen to hear any Man pronounce these three Words: <hi>He is Married:</hi> if you then say he is, hath been, shall be, or may be a Cuckold, you will not be accounted an unskilful Artist in framing of true Consequences. Tripes and Bowels of all the Devils, cries <hi>Panurge,</hi> what do you tell me? My dear Friend, (answered <hi>Rondibilis</hi>) as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> on a time, was in the very nick of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forwards from <hi>Lango</hi> to <hi>Polystilo,</hi> to Visit the Philosopher <hi>Democritus,</hi> he wrote a familiar Letter to his Friend <hi>Dionoys,</hi> wherein he desired him, That he would during the interval of his absence, carry his Wife to the House of her Father and Mother, who were an honourable Couple, and of good Repute; because I would not have her at my Home, (said he) to make abode in Solitude: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this her Residence beside her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, do not fail (quoth he) with a most heedful care and circumspection to pry into her ways, and to espy what places she shall go to with her Mother, and who those be that shall repair unto her: Not (quoth he) that I do mistrust her Vertue, or that I seem to have any diffidence of her Pudicity, and chaste Behaviour; for of that I have frequently had good and real proofs: but I must freely tell you,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43704:136"/>
               <hi>She is a Woman:</hi> there lies the suspition.</p>
            <p>My worthy Friend, the Nature of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is set forth before our Eyes, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to us by the <hi>Moon,</hi> in divers other things, as well as in this, that they squat, sculck, constrain their own Inclinations, and with all the Cunning they can, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble and play the Hypocrite in the sight and presence of their Husbands; who come no sooner to be out of the way, but that forthwith they take their advantage, pass the time merrily, desist from all labour, frolick it, gad abroad; lay aside their counterfeit Garb, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare and manifest the interiour of their Dispositions; even as the <hi>Moon,</hi> when she is in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with the <hi>Sun,</hi> is neither seen in the Heavens, nor on the Earth, but in her <hi>Opposition,</hi> when remotest from him, shineth in her greatest fulness, and wholly appeareth in her brightest splendour whilst it is Night: <hi>Thus Women are but Women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I say <hi>Womankind,</hi> I speak of a Sex so frail, so variable, so changeable, so fickle, inconstant, and imperfect, that in my Opinion, <hi>Nature</hi> (under favour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless of the prime Honour and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is due unto her) did in a manner mistake the Road which she had traced formerly, and stray exceedingly
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:43704:137"/>
from that Excellence of Providential Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the which she had created and formed all other things, when she built, framed, and made up the <hi>Woman.</hi> And having thought upon it a Hundred and five times, I know not what else to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine therein, save only that in the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, hammering, forging, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the <hi>Woman,</hi> she hath had a much tenderer regard, and by a great deal more respectful heed to the delightful Consort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and sociable Delectation of the <hi>Man,</hi> than to the Perfection and Accomplishment of the individual <hi>Womanishness,</hi> or <hi>Muliebrity.</hi> The Divine Philosopher <hi>Plato,</hi> was doubtful in what Rank of living Creatures to place and collocate them, whither amongst the <hi>Rational Animals,</hi> by elevating them to an upper Seat in the Specifical Classis of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;</hi> or with the <hi>Irrational,</hi> by degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to a lower Bench on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site side, of a Brutal kind, and meer <hi>Bestia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:</hi> for Nature hath posited in a privy, secret, and intestine place of their Bodies, a sort of Member (by some not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently termed an <hi>Animal</hi>) which is not to be found in Men. Therein sometimes are engendred certain Humors so saltish, brackish, clammy, sharp, nipping, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prickling, and most eagerly tickling, that by their stinging Acrimony, rending
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:43704:137"/>
Nitrosity, figging Itch, wrigling Mordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, and smarting Salsitude, (for the said Member is altogether sinewy, and of a most quick and lively feeling) their whole Body is shaken and ebrangled, their Senses totally ravished and transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the operations of their Judgment and Understanding utterly confounded, and all disordinate Passions and Perturbations of the Mind thoroughly and absolutely allowed, admitted, and approved of; yea, in such sort, that if Nature had not been so favourable unto them, as to have sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled their Forehead with a little Tincture of Bashfulness and Modesty, you should see them in a so frantick mood run mad after Lechery, and hye apace up and down with hast and Lust, in quest of, and to fix some Chamber-Standard in their <hi>Paphian</hi> Ground, that never did the <hi>Pretides, Mimallonides,</hi> nor <hi>Lyaean Thyads</hi> deport themselves in the time of their <hi>Bacchanalian Festivals,</hi> more shamelesly, or with a so affronted and brazen-faced Impudency; because this terrible <hi>Animal</hi> is knit unto, and hath an Union with all the chief and most principal parts of the Body, as to Anatomists is evident. Let it not here be thought strange that I should call it an <hi>Animal,</hi> seeing therein I do no otherwise than follow and adhere
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:43704:138"/>
to the Doctrine of the <hi>Academick</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatetick</hi> Philosophers. For if a proper Motion be a certain mark and infallible token of the Life and Animation of the Mover, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth) and that any such thing as <hi>moveth of its self</hi> ought to be held <hi>Animated,</hi> and of a <hi>Living Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> then assuredly <hi>Plato</hi> with very good reason did give it the Denomination of an <hi>Animal;</hi> for that he perceived and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in it the proper and <hi>self-stirring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Suffocation, Precipitation, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugation, and of Indignation, so extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violent, that oftentimes by them is taken and removed from the Women all other sense and moving whatsoever, as if she were in a swounding <hi>Lipothymy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numming <hi>Sincop, Epileptick,</hi> Apoplectick Palsey, and true resemblance of a pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Death.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in the said <hi>Member</hi> there is a manifest discerning Faculty of Scents and Odours very perceptible to Women, who feel it fly from what is rank and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury, and follow fragrant and Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Smells. It is not unknown to me how <hi>Cl. Gallen</hi> striveth with might and main, to prove that these are not proper and particular Notions proceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsically from the thing it self, but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, and by chance. Nor hath it
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:43704:138"/>
escaped my notice, how others of that Sect have laboured hardly, yea, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of their Abilities, to demonstrate that it is not a sensitive discerning or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in it of the difference of Wafts and Smells, but meerly a various manner of Vertue and Efficacy, passing forth and flowing from the diversity of odoriferous Substances applied near unto it. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, if you will studiously examine, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously ponder and weigh in <hi>Critolaus</hi>'s Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the strength of their Reasons and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, you shall find that they, not only in this, but in several other matters also of the like nature, have spoken at random, and rather out of an ambitious Envy to check and reprehend their Betters, than for any design to make enquiry into the solid Truth.</p>
            <p>I will not launch my little Skif any further into the wide Ocean of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, only will I tell you that the Praise and Commendation is not mean and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is due to those honest and good Women, who living chastly and without blame, have had the power and vertue to curb, range and subdue that unbridled, heady and wild <hi>Animal</hi> to an obedient, submissive and obsequious yielding unto Reason. Therefore here will I make an end of my Discourse thereon, when I
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:43704:139"/>
shall have told you, that the said <hi>Animal</hi> being once satiated (if it be possible that it can be contented or satisfied) by that Aliment, which Nature hath provided for it out of the Epididymal Store-house of Man, all its former and irregular and disordered Motions are at an end, laid and asswaged; all its vehement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Longings lulled, pacified and quieted; and all the furious and raging Lusts, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Desires thereof appeased, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, calmed and extinguished. For this cause let it seem nothing strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if we be in a perpetual Danger of being <hi>Cuckolds;</hi> that is to say, such of us as have not wherewithal fully to satisfie the Appetite and Expectation of that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

(quoth <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi>) have you no preventive Cure in all your Medicinal Art for hindring ones Head to be Horny-graffed at home, whilst his Feet are plodding abroad?

               <hi>CHAP. XXXIII. Rondibilis</hi> the Physician's Cure of Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koldry.</head>
            <p>AT that time (quoth <hi>Randibilis</hi>) when <hi>Iupitur</hi> took a view of the state of his <hi>Olympick</hi> House and Family, and that he had made the Calender of all the Gods and Goddesses, appointing unto the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival of every one of them its proper day and season, establishing certain fixed places and stations for the pronouncing of Oracles, and relief of travelling Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and ordaining Victims, Immolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Sacrifices suitable and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Dignity and Nature of the worshipped and adored Deity. Did not he do (asked <hi>Panurge</hi>) therein, as <hi>Tintou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ille</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Auxerre</hi> is said once to have done? This Noble Prelate loved entirely the pure Liquor of the Grape, as every honest and judicious Man doth; therefore was it that he had an especial care and regard to the Bud of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, as to the great Grandfather of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:43704:140"/>
But so it is, that for sundry Years together he saw a most pitiful Havock, Desolation and Destruction made amongst the Sprouts, Shootings, Buds, Blossoms and Sciens of the Vines by hoary Frosts, Dank-fogs, hot Mists, unseasonable Colds, chill Blasts, thick Hail, and other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Chances of foul Weather happening, as he thought, by the dismal inauspicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Holy Days of St. <hi>George,</hi> St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Eutrope, Holy Rood,</hi> the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eension,</hi> and other Festivals, in that time when the Sun passeth under the Sign of <hi>Taurus;</hi> and thereupon harboured in his Mind this Opinion, that the afore-named <hi>Saints</hi> were <hi>Saint</hi> Hail-flingers, <hi>Saint</hi> Frost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senders, <hi>Saint</hi> Fogmongers, and <hi>Saint</hi> Spoilers of the Vine-buds; for which cause be went about to have transmitted their Feasts from the Spring to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be Celebrated between <hi>Christmas</hi> and <hi>Epiphany,</hi> (so the Mother of the <hi>three Kings</hi> called it)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> allowing them with all Honour and Reverence the liberty then to freeze, hail and rain as much as they would; for that he knew that at such a time Frost was rather profitable than hurtful to the Vine-buds, and in their steads to have placed the Festivals of St. <hi>Christopher,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> St. <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> St. <hi>Ann,</hi> St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and St. <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi>

yea, and to have gone so far as to collocate and transpose the middle of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> in, and to the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> because during the whole Space of their Solemnity, there was so little danger of hoary Frosts and cold Mists, that no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers are then held in greater Request, than the Afforder of refrigerating Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Makers of Junkets, fit Disposers of cooling Shades, Composers of green Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and Refreshers of Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iupiter</hi> (said <hi>Rondibilis</hi>) forgot the poor Devil <hi>Cuckoldry,</hi> who was then in the Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> very eagerly solliciting a pedling Suit at Law for one of his Vassals and Tenants; within some few days there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, (I have forgot how many) when he got full notice of the Trick, which in his Absence was done unto him, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly desisted from prosecuting Legal Processes, in the behalf of others, full of Sollicitude to pursue after his own business, lest he should be fore-closed: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he appeared personally at the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of the great <hi>Iupiter,</hi> displayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the importance of his preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Merits; together with the acceptable Services, which in Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments he had formerly performed; and therefore, in all humility, begged of him, that he would be pleased not to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:43704:141"/>
leave him alone amongst all the Sacred Potentates, destitute and void of Honour, Reverence, Sacrifices and festival Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. To this Petition <hi>Iupiter's</hi> Answer was excusatory, That all the Places and Offices of his House were bestowed. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless so importuned was he by the continual Supplications of Monsieur <hi>Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koldry,</hi> that he, in fine, placed him in the Rank, List, Roll, Rubrick and Catalogue; and appointed Honours, Sacrifices and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival Rites to be observed on Earth in great Devotion, and tendred to him with Solemnity.</p>
            <p>The Feast, because there was no void, empty nor vacant place in all the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was to be celebrated jointly with, and on the same day that had been conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Goddess <hi>Iealousie:</hi> His Power and Dominion should be over Married Folks, especially such as had handsom Wives: His Sacrifices were to be Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Diffidence, Mistrust, a lowring powt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sullenness, Watchings, Wardings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchings, Plyings, Explorations, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Way-layings, Ambushes, narrow Observations, and malicious Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of the Husband's Scouts and Espials of the most privy Actions of their Wives.

               </gap>xiliary Suffrage, or adminiculary Assistance; that he should never hold in any Reckoning Account or Estimation; that he should never daign to enter within their Houses, neither at the Doors, Windows, nor any other place thereof; that he should never haunt nor frequent their Companies or Conversations; how frequently soever they should invocate him, and call upon his Name; and that not only he should leave and abandon them to rot alone with their Wives in a sempiternal Solitariness, without the benefit of the diversion of any Copesmate or Corrival at all; but should withal shun and eschew them, fly from them, and eternally forsake and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:43704:142"/>
them as impious Hereticks and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Persons, according to the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom'd manner of other Gods, towards such as are too slack in offering up the Duties and Reverences which ought to be performed respectively to their Divinities: As is evidently apparent in <hi>Bacchus</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards negligent Vine-dressers; in <hi>Ceres</hi> against idle Plow-men and Tillers of the Ground; in <hi>Pomona</hi> to unworthy Fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Custard-mongers; in <hi>Neptune</hi> towards dissolute Mariners and Sea-faring Men; in <hi>Vulcan</hi> towards loytering Smiths and Forge-men; and so throughout the rest.</p>
            <p>Now, on the contrary, this infallible Promise was added, that unto all those who should make a <hi>Holy Day</hi> of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited Festival, and cease from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worldly Work and Negotiation, lay aside all their own most important occasions, and to be so wretchless, heedless, and careless of what might concern the management of their proper Affairs, as to mind nothing else but a suspicious espying and prying into the secret Deportments of their Wives, and how to koop, shut up, hold at under, and deal cruelly and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steerly with them, by all the Harshness and Hardships that an implacable, and every way inexorable Jealousie can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43704:143"/>
and suggest, conform to the Sacred Ordinances of the afore-mentioned Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Oblations, he should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually favourable to them, should love them, sociably converse with them, should be Day and Night in their Houses, and never leave them destitute of his Presence. Now I have said, and you have heard my Cure.</p>
            <p>Ha, ha, ha, (quoth <hi>Capalin</hi> laughing)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is a remedy yet more apt and proper than <hi>Hans Carvel's</hi> Ring: The Devil take me if I do not believe it. The Humour, Inclination and Nature of Women is like the Thunder, whose Force in its Bolt, or otherways, burneth, bruiseth and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only hard, massive and resisting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without staying or stopping at soft, empty and yielding matters: For it pash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into pieces the Steel Sword, without doing any hurt to the Velvet Scabbard which insheatheth it: It rusheth also, and consumeth the Bones, without wounding or endammaging the Flesh, wherewith they are vailed and covered: Just so it is, that Women for the greater part never bend the Contention, Subtilty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Disposition of their Spirits, unless it be to do what is prohibited and forbidden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:43704:143"/>Verily, (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) some of of our Doctors averr for a truth, that the first Woman of the World, whom the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call <hi>Eve,</hi> had hardly been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or allured into the Temptation of eating of the Fruit of the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> if it had not been forbidden her so to do. And that you may give the more Credit to the Validity of this Opinion, consider how the cautelous and wily Tempter did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate unto her, for an antecedent to his <hi>Enthymeme,</hi> the <hi>Prohibition</hi> which was made to taste it, as being desirous to infer from thence, <hi>It it forbidden thee; therefore thou shouldst eat of it, else thou canst not be a Woman.</hi>

            <p>WHEN I was (quoth <hi>Carpalin</hi>) a Whoremaster at <hi>Orleans,</hi> the whole Art of Rhetorick in all its Tropes and Figures, was not able to afford unto me a Colour or Flourish of greater force and

value; nor could I by any other form or manner of Elocution pitch upon a more perswasive Argument for bringing young beautiful married Ladies into the Snares of Adultery, through alluring and inticing them to tast with me of Amorous Delights, then with a lively Sprightfulness to tell them in down-right terms, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to them, (with a great shew of Detestation of a Crime so horrid) how their Husbands were jealous. This was none of my Invention: It is written, and we have Laws, Examples, Reasons and daily Experiences confirmative of the same.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43704:144"/>
confess themselves to one another, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>Religious</hi> Women were subject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> some petty secret Slips and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which would be a foul and burning shame for them to discover and to reveal to Men, how Sacerdotal soever their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were: but that they would freelier, more familiarly, and with greater chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, open to each other their Offences, Faults, and Escapes, under the Seal of Confession. There is not any thing (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Pope) fitting for you to impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate of me, which I would not most willingly condescend unto: but I find one inconvenience; you know, <hi>Confession should be kept secret:</hi> and Women are not able to do so. Exceeding well (quoth they) most Holy Father, and much more closely then the best of Men.</p>
            <p>The said Pope on the very same day, gave them in keeping a pretty Box, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he purposely caused a little Linnet to be put, willing them very gently and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously to lock it up in some sure and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den place; and promising them, by the <hi>Faith of a Pope,</hi> that he should yield to their Request, if they would keep secret what was enclosed within that deposited Box: enjoyning them withal, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume one way nor other, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, to go about the opening thereof,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:43704:145"/>
under pain of the highest Ecclesiastical Censure, Eternal Excommunication. The Prohibition was no sooner made, but that they did all of them boyl with a most ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent desire to know, and see what kind of thing it was that was within it: they thought long already, that the Pope was not gone, to the end they might joyntly, with the more leisure and ease apply themselves to the Box-opening Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
            <p>The Holy Father, after he had given them his Benediction, retired and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himself to the Pontifical Lodgings of his own Palace; but he was hardly gone three Steps from without the Gates of their <hi>Cloyster,</hi> when the good Ladies throngingly, and as in a hudled Crowd, pressing hard on the Backs of one another, ran thrusting and shoving who should be first at the setting open of the forbidden Box, and descrying of the <hi>Quod latitat</hi> within.</p>
            <p>On the very next day thereafter, the Pope made them another Visit, of a full design, purpose, and intention (as they imagined) to dispatch the Grant of their sought and wished-for Indulgence: but before he would enter into any Chat or Communing with them, he commanded the Casket to be brought unto him: it
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43704:145"/>
was done so accordingly; but by your leave, the Bird was no more there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then was it, that the Pope did represent to their <hi>Maternities,</hi> how hard a matter and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it was for them to keep Secrets reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them in <hi>Confession,</hi> unmanifested to the Ears of others; seeing for the space of Four and twenty hours they were not able to lay up in secret a Box, which he had highly recommended to their Discretion, Charge and Custody.</p>
            <p>Welcome, in good Faith, my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, welcome: It did me good to hear you talk, the Lord be praised for all.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43704:146"/>
spoke and spoke again; yea, within few hours she spoke so loud, so much, so fiercely, and so long, that her poor Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band returned to the same Physitian for a Recipe to make her hold her Peace: There are (quoth the <hi>Physician</hi>) many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Remedies in our Art, to make dumb Women speak, but there are none, that ever I could learn therein, to make them silent. The only Cure which I have found out, is their Husband's <hi>Deafness.</hi> The Wretch became within few Weeks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by Vertue of some Drugs, Charms or Enchantments, which the <hi>Physician</hi> had prescribed unto him, so <hi>deaf,</hi> that he could not have heard the Thundring of Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Canons at a <hi>Salve.</hi> His Wife perceiving, that indeed he was as <hi>deaf</hi> as a Door-nail, and that her Scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was but in vain, sith that he heard her not, she grew stark mad.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the Doctor asked for his Fee of the Husband; who answered, That truly he was <hi>deaf,</hi> and so was not able to understand what the tenure of his Demand might be. Whereupon the Leech bedusted him with a little, I know not what, sort of Powder; which rendred him a Fool immediately: so great was the stultificating Vertue of that strange kind of pulverized Dose. Then did this
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:43704:146"/>
Fool of a Husband, and his mad Wife joyn together, falling on the Doctor and the Surgeon, did so scratch, bethwack, and bang them, that they were left half dead upon the place, so furious were the Blows which they received: I never in my Life-time laughed so much, as at the acting of that Buffoonry.</p>

            <p>AS this Discourse was ended, <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> said to the Philosopher <hi>Trouillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> Our loyal, honest, true and trusty Friend, the Lamp from hand to hand is come to you; it falleth to your turn to give an Answer, Should <hi>Panurge,</hi> pray you, marry, yea or no?

better of the Game. But howsoever tell me, Should I marry or no? Neither the one nor the other, answered <hi>Trouillogan.</hi> The Devil take me, quoth <hi>Panurge,</hi> if these odd Answers do not make me dote, and may be snatch me presently away, if I do understand you. Stay awhile until I fasten these Spectacles of mine on this left Ear, that I may hear you better. With this <hi>Pantagruel</hi> perceived at the Door of the great Hall, (which was that day their Dining Room) <hi>Gargantua</hi>'s little Dog, whose Name was <hi>Kyne;</hi> for so was <hi>Toby</hi>'s Dog called, as is Recorded. Then did he say to these who were there present, Our King is not far off, let us all rise. That word was scarcely sooner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ose to do their King that Reverence and Duty which became them. After that <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> had most affably saluted all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen there present, he said, Good Friends, I beg this Favour of you, and therein you will very much oblige me, that you leave not the places where you sate, nor quit the Discourse you were upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:43704:148"/>Let a Chair be brought hither unto this end of the Table, and reach me a Cup full of the strongest and best Wine you have, that I may drink to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. You are in Faith, all welcom, Gentlemen. Now let me know what Talk you were about. To this <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel</hi> answered, That at the beginning of the Second Service <hi>Panurge</hi> had proposed a Problematick Theme, to wit, <hi>Whether he should marry, or not marry?</hi> That Father <hi>Hippothadee,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Rondibilis</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready dispatched their Resolutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; and that just as his Majesty was coming in, the faithful <hi>Trouillogan,</hi> in the delivery of his Opinion, hath thus far proceeded, that when <hi>Panurge</hi> asked, whether he ought to <hi>marry, yea or no.</hi> At first he made this Answer, <hi>Both together.</hi> When this same Question was again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, his second Answer was, <hi>Not the one nor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other. Panurge</hi> exclaimeth, that those Answers are full of Repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Contradictions, protesting that he understands them not, nor what it is that can be meaned by them. If I be not mistaken, quoth <hi>Gargantua,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it very well: The Answer is not unlike to that which was once made by a Philosopher in ancient times, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrogated, if he had a Woman,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:43704:149"/>
whom they named him, to his Wife; <hi>I have her,</hi> quoth he, but <hi>she hath not me;</hi> possessing her, by her I am not possest. Such another Answer, quoth <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> was once made by a certain bouncing Wench of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who being asked, if at any time she had had to do with a Man? <hi>No,</hi> (quoth she) <hi>but sometimes Men have to do with me.</hi> Well then (quoth <hi>Rondibilis</hi>) let it be a <hi>Neuter</hi> in Physick; as when we say a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is <hi>Neuter,</hi> when it is neither sick nor healthful; and a <hi>Mean</hi> in Philosophy; <hi>that</hi> by an Abnegation of both Extreams, and <hi>this</hi> by the Participation of the one and of the other: Even as when luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Water is said to be both hot and cold; or rather, as when Time makes the Partition, and equally divides betwixt the two, a while in the one, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, as long, in the other opposite extremity. The holy Apostle, (quoth <hi>Hippothadee</hi>) seemeth, as I conceive, to have more clearly explained this Point, when he said, <hi>Those that are married, let them be as if they were not married;</hi> and those that have Wives, let them be as if they had no Wives at all. I thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) the having and not having of a Wife. To have a Wife, is to have the use of her in such a way as Nature hath ordained, which is for the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43704:149"/>
Aid, Society and Solace of Man, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating of his Race: To have no Wife is not to be uxorious, play the Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and be lazy about her, and not for her sake to distain the Lustre of that Affection which Man owes to God; or yet for her to leave those Offices and Duties which he owes unto his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, unto his Friends and Kindred; or for her to abandon and forsake his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Studies, and other businesses of Account, to wait still on her Will, her Beck, and her Buttocks. If we be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this Sense to take having and not having of a Wife, we shall indeed find no Repugnancy nor Contradiction in the Terms at all.</p>

               <p>When he had done thus speaking, he withdrew himself from the Company; <hi>Pautagruel,</hi> and others with him would have followed and accompanied him, but he would not permit them so to do. No sooner was <hi>Gargantua</hi> departed out of the

Banquetting-Hall, then that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> said to the invited Guests: <hi>Plato's Timee,</hi> at the <hi>Beginning</hi> always of a solemn Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Convention, was wont to count those that were called thereto; we on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, shall at the Closure and <hi>End</hi> of this Treatment, reckon up our Number, One, Two, Three; Where is the Fourth?

               <p>I will (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) understand how that matter goeth; it is now above
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43704:154"/>
Forty Years, that he hath been constantly the Judge of <hi>Fonsbeton:</hi> during which space of time, he hath given Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Definitive Sentences: of Two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand three hundred and nine whereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Appeal was made by the Parties whom he had judicially condemned from his inferiour Judicatory, to the Supream Court of the Parliament of <hi>Mirlingois,</hi> in <hi>Mirlingues,</hi> they were all of them never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless confirmed, ratified and approved of by an Order, Decree, and final Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the said Sovereign Court, to the casting of the <hi>Appellants,</hi> and utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Suits wherein they had been soiled at Law, for ever and a day: that now in his Old Age he should be perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally summoned, who in all the foregoing time of his Life, hath demeaned himself so unblamably in the Discharge of the Office and Vocation he had been called unto; it cannot assuredly be, that such a change hath happened without some notorious Misfortune and Disaster: I am resolved to help and assist him in Equity and Justice to the uttermost extent of my power and ability. I know the Malice, Despight, and Wickedness of the World to be so much more now-a-days exaspered, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and aggravated by what it was not long since, that the best Cause that is, how
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:43704:155"/>
just and equitable soever it be, standeth in great need to be succoured, aided and supported.

               <p>Then Dinner being done, and the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles drawn and removed, when <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had very cordially and affectionately thanked his invited Guests, for the Favour which he had enjoyed of their Company, he presented them with several rich and costly Gifts, such as Jewels, Rings set with precious Stones, Gold and Silver Vessels; with a great deal of other sort of Plate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; and lastly, taking of them all his Leave, retired himself into an inner Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:43704:156"/>
and extricate your Thoughts out of the implicating Involutions and Fetterings of the grievous and lamentable Gins and Springs of Anguish and Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the greater difficulty there is in the relieving of you, and you remain faster bound then ever: nor do I know for the removal of this Inconveniency, any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but one.</p>
            <p>Take heed; I have often heard it said in a Vulgar Proverb, <hi>The Wise may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by a Fool.</hi> Seeing the Answers and Responses of sage and judicious Men, have in no manner of way satisfied you, take Advice of some Fool; and possibly by so doing, you may come to get that Councel which will be agreeable to your own Heart's desire and contentment. You know how by the Advice and Councel and Prediction of <hi>Fools,</hi> many Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, States, and Commonwealths have been preserved, several Battels gained, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers doubts of a most perplexed Intricacy resolved: I am not so diffident of your Memory, as to hold it needful to refresh it with a Quotation of Examples; nor do I so far undervalue your Judgment, but that I think it will acquiesce in the Reason of this my subsequent Discourse.</p>

            <p>After this manner, the Son of <hi>Picus,</hi> King of the <hi>Latins,</hi> that great Southsayer
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43704:157"/>
               <hi>Faunus,</hi> was called <hi>Fatuus,</hi> by the witless Rabble of the common People. The like we daily see practised amongst the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Players, whose Drammatick Rolls, in distribution of the Personages, appoint the acting of the <hi>Fool</hi> to him who is the wisest of the Troop. In approbation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of this fashion, the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> allow the very same <hi>Horoscope</hi> to Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to Sots. Whereof a right pregnant instance by them is given in the Nativities of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> and <hi>Choroebus;</hi> the latter of which two is by <hi>Euphorion</hi> said to have been a <hi>Fool:</hi> and yet had with the former the same <hi>Aspects,</hi> and heavenly <hi>Genethlick</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences.</p>
            <p>I shall not, I suppose, swerve much from the purpose in hand, if I relate unto you, what <hi>Ihon Andrew</hi> said upon the Return of a <hi>Papal Writ,</hi> which was directed to the Mayor of <hi>Rochel;</hi> and Burgesses after him by <hi>Panorm,</hi> upon the same Pontifical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; <hi>Barbatia,</hi> on the <hi>Pandects,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently by <hi>Iason,</hi> in his Councels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Seyny Ihon</hi> the noted Fool of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Caillets,</hi> fore-great Grandfather. The Case is this:</p>
            <p>At <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Roast-meat Cookery of the <hi>Petit Chastelet,</hi> before the Cook-Shop of one of the Roast-meat Sellers of that Lane, a certain hungry Porter was
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43704:157"/>
eating his Bread, after he had by Parcels kept it a while above the Reek and Steam of a fat Goose on the Spit, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a great Fire, and found it so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smoaked with the Vapour, to be savoury; which the Cook observing, took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, till after having ravined his Penny Loaf, whereof no Morsel had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smoakified, he was about discamping and going away; but by your leave, as the Fellow thought to have departed thence shot-free, the Master-Cook laid hold upon him by the Gorget, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed payment for the Smoak of his Roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat. The Porter answered, that he had sustained no loss at all; that by what he had done there was no Diminution made of the Flesh, that he had taken nothing of his, and that therefore he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him in any thing: As for the Smoak in question, that, although he had not been there; it would howsoever have been evaporated: besides that, before that time it had never been seen nor heard, that Roast-meat Smoak was sold upon the Streets of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Cook hereto replied, That he was not obliged nor any way bound to feed and nourish for nought a Porter whom he had never seen before with the Smoak of his Roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat; and thereupon swore, that if he
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43704:158"/>
would not forthwith content and satisfie him with present Payment for the Repast which he had thereby got, that he would take his crooked Staves from off his Back; which instead of having Loads thereafter laid upon them, should serve for Fuel to his Kitchin Fires. Whilst he was going about so to do, and to have pulled them to him by one of the bottom Rungs, which he had caught in his Hand, the sturdy Porter got out of his Gripes, drew forth the knotty Cudgel, and stood to his own Defence. The Altercation waxed hot in Words, which moved the gaping Hoydons of the sottish <hi>Parisians</hi> to run from all parts thereabouts to see what the issue would be of that babling Strife and Contention. In the interim of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, to very good purpose <hi>Seiny Ihon</hi> the <hi>Fool</hi> and Citizen of <hi>Paris,</hi> hapned to be there, whom the Cook perceiving, said to the Porter, Wilt thou refer and submit unto the noble <hi>Seiny Thon,</hi> the Decision of the Difference and Controversie which is betwixt us? Yes, by the Blood of a Goose, answered the Porter, I am content. <hi>Seiny Ihon</hi> the <hi>Fool,</hi> finding that the Cook and Porter had compromised the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Variance and Debate to the Discretion of his Award and Arbitriment; after that the Reasons on either side
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43704:158"/>
whereupon was grounded the mutual fierceness of their brawling Jar had been to the full displayed and laid open before him, commanded the Porter to draw out of the Fab of his Belt a piece of Money, if he had it. Whereupon the Porter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately without delay, in Reverence to the Authority of such a Judicious Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, put the tenth part of a Silver <hi>Phillip</hi> into his hand. This little <hi>Phillip Seiny Ihon</hi> took, then set it on his Left Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to try by feeling if it was of a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient weight; after that, laying it on the palm of his hand he made it ring and tingle, to understand by the Ear if it was of a good Alloy in the Metal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was composed: Thereafter he put it to the Ball or Apple of his Left Eye, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore by the sight if it was well stamped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and marked; all which being done, in a profound Silence of the whole doltish People, who were there Spectators of this Pageantry, to the great Hope of the Cooks, and Despair of the Porters Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency in the Suit that was in agitation, he finally caused the Porter to make it sound several times upon the Stall of the Cooks Shop. Then with a <hi>Presidential Majesty</hi> holding his Bable (Scepter-like) in his Hand, muffling his Head with a Hood of Martern Skins, each side where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:43704:159"/>
had the resemblance of an Apes Face, sprucified up with Ears of pasted Paper, and having about his Neck a bucked Ruff, raised, furrowed, and ridged, with Ponting Sticks of the shape and fashion of small Organ Pipes; he first with all the force of his Lungs Coughed two or three times, and then with an audible Voice pronounced this following Sentence, The Court declareth, that <hi>the Porter, who ate his Bread at the Smoak of the roast, hath ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy paid the Cook with the sound of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:</hi> And the said Court <hi>Ordaineth,</hi> that every one return to his own home, and attend his proper business, without Cost and Charges, and for a Cause. This Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, Award and Arbitriment of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risian Fool,</hi> did appear so equitable, yea, so admirable to the aforesaid <hi>Doctors,</hi> that they very much doubted, if the matter had been brought before the <hi>Sessions for Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> of the said place, or that the Judges of the <hi>Rota</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> had been Umpires therein; or yet that the <hi>Areopagites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had been the Deciders thereof, if by any one part, or all of them together, it had been so judicially sententiated and awarded. Therefore advise if you will be counselled by a <hi>Fool.</hi>

the Ground, fine Singer in a Church-Desk, of good Repute and Credit, and older than the most aged of all your Worships; who was wont to say, that he had seen the great and goodly Good Man the <hi>Council of Lateran,</hi> with his wide and broad brimmed Red Hat: As also, that he had beheld and looked upon the fair and beautiful <hi>Pragmatical Sanction,</hi> his Wife, with her huge Rosary or Pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notrian Chapelet of Jeat-beads, hanging at a large Sky-coloured Ribbond.

which Qualities our Statute and Common Laws, Civil and Municipal together, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low many excuses for any slips or escapes, which through the invincible Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of either, have been inconsiderately stumbled upon by a Person so qualified. <hi>Thirdly, Gentlemen,</hi> I must needs display before you another Case, which in Equity and Justice maketh much for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of <hi>Bridlegoose:</hi> to wit, that this one, sole, and single fault of his, ought to be quite forgotten, abolished, and swallowed up, by that immense and vast Ocean of Just Dooms and Sentences, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath given and pronounced: his Demeanours for these Forty Years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that he hath been a Judge, having been so evenly ballanced in the Scales of Uprightness, that Envy itself, till now, could not have been so impudent as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse and twit him with any Act worthy of a Check or Reprehension: As if a Drop of the Sea were thrown into the <hi>Loire,</hi> none could perceive, or say that by this single Drop, the whole River should be salt and brackish.</p>
            <p>Truly, it seemeth unto me, that in the whole Series of <hi>Bridlegoose</hi>'s Juridical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, there hath been, I know not what, of extraordinary favouring of the unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Benignity of God, that all those his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:43704:179"/>
Sentences, Awards, and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have been confirmed and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of by your selves, in this your own Venerable and <hi>Sovereign Court:</hi> for it is usual (as you know well) with him whose ways are inscrutable, to manifest his own ineffable Glory, in blunting the perspicacy of the Eyes of the Wise, in weakning the Strength of potent Oppressors, in depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Pride of rich Extortioners, and in erecting, comforting, protecting, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, upholding, and shoaring up the poor, feeble, humble, silly, and foolish Ones of the Earth. But waving all these matters, I shall only beseech you, not by the Obligations which you pretend to owe to my Family, for which I thank you; but for that constant and unfeigned Love and Affection which you have always found in me, both on this and on the other side of <hi>Loire,</hi> for the Maintenance and Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of your Places, Offices, and Dignities, that for this one time, you would pardon and forgive him, upon these two Conditions: <hi>First,</hi> That he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, or put a sufficient Surety for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the Party wronged by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice of the Sentence in question: for the fulfilment of this Article, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide sufficiently. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That for his subsidiary Aid in the weighty Charge
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:43704:180"/>
of Administrating Justice, you would be pleased to appoint, and assign unto him some pretty, little, vertuous Counseller, younger, learneder, and wiser then he, by the Square and Rule of whose Advice he may regulate, guide, temper and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in times coming all his Judiciary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures, or otherways, if you intend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to depose him from his Office, and to deprive him altogether of the State and Dignity of a Judge, I shall cordially intreat you to make a Present and free Gift of him to me, who shall find in my Kingdoms Charges and Employments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wherewith to imbusie him, for the bettering of his own Fortunes, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of my Service.

Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> and others, he forthwith at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them, walked to the utter Gate, where all them immediately took Horse to return towards <hi>Gargantua. Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> by the way related to them from point to point, the manner of <hi>Bridlegoose</hi>'s sententiating Differences at Law. Friar <hi>Ihon</hi> said, that he had seen <hi>Peter Dandin,</hi> and was acquainted with him at that time when he sojourned in the Monastery of <hi>Fontaine le Conte,</hi> under the Noble Abbot <hi>Ardillon.

               <hi>CHAP. XLIV.</hi> How Pantagruel relateth a strange Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Perplexity of Humane Iudgment.</head>
            <p>SEeing you talk (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) of dark, difficult, hard and knotty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, I will tell you of one controverted before <hi>Cneius Dolobella,</hi> Proconsul in <hi>Asia.</hi> The Case was this.</p>
            <p>A Wife in <hi>Smyrna</hi> had of her first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band a Child named <hi>Abece;</hi> he dying, she after the expiring of a Year and Day, married again, and to her Second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band bore a Boy called <hi>Edege:</hi> A pretty long time thereafter it happened (as you know the Affection of Step-fathers and Step-dams is very rare, towards the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the first Fathers and Mothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased) that this Husband, with the help of his Son <hi>Edege,</hi> secretly, wittingly, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and treacherously murthered <hi>Abece.</hi> The Woman came no sooner to get Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Fact, that it might not go unpunished, she caused kill them both,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:43704:181"/>
to revenge the Death of her first Son. She was Apprehended and carried before <hi>Cneius Dolobella,</hi> in whose Presence, she, without dissembling any thing, confessed all that was laid to her Charge; yet alledged that she had both Right and Reason on her side for the killing of them. Thus was the state of the Question. He found the business so dubious and intricate, that he knew not what to determin therein, nor which of the Parties to incline to. On the one hand, it was an execrable Crime to cut off at once both her Second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and her Son. On the other hand, the Cause of the Murther seemed to be so natural, as to be grounded upon the Law of Nations, and the rational Instinct of all the People of the World; seeing they two together had feloniously and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therously destroyed her first Son. Not that they had been in any manner of way wronged, outraged or injured by him, but out of an ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>icious Intent to possess his Inheritance. In this doubtful Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary and Uncertainty what to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he sent to the <hi>Areopagites</hi> then sitting at <hi>Athens,</hi> to learn and obtain their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Judgment. That Judicious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate very sagely perpending the Reasons of his Perplexity, sent him word, to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon her personally to compear before
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:43704:182"/>
him, a precise Hundred Years thereafter, to answer to some Interrogatories touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain Points, which were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Verbal Defence: Which Resolution of theirs did import, that it was in their Opinion a so difficult and inextricable a matter, that they knew not what to say or judge therein. Who had decided that Plea by the Chance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the <hi>Dice,</hi> could not have erred nor awarded amiss on which side soever he had past his casting and condemnatory Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: If against the Woman, she deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Punishment for usurping Sovereign Authority, by taking that Vengeance at her own hand, the inflicting whereof was only competent to the Supream Power, to administer Justice in Criminal Cases: If for her, the just Resentment of a so atrocious Injury done unto her, in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering her innocent Son, did fully excuse and vindicate her of any Trespass or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence about that particular committed by her. But this continuation of <hi>Bridlegoose</hi> for so many years, still hitting the Nail o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To answer (quoth <hi>Epistemon</hi>) categorically to that which you wonder at, I must ingen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously confess and avow that I cannot; yet
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:43704:182"/>
conjecturally to guess at the reason of it, I would refer the Cause of that marvelously long continued happy Success in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Results of his Definitive Sentences to the favourable <hi>Aspect</hi> of the Heavens, and Benignity of the <hi>Intelligences;</hi> who, out of their love to Goodness, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving contemplated the pure Simplicity and sincere Unfeignedness of Judge <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlegoose</hi> in the acknowledgment of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities, did regulate that for him by Chance, which by the profoundest Act of his maturest Deliberation he was not able to reach unto. That likeways which possibly made him to diffide in his own Skill and Capacity, notwithstanding his being an expert and understanding Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, for any thing that I know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, was the Knowledge and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he had of the Antenomies, Contrarieties, Antilogies, Contradictions, Traversings and Thwartings of Laws, Customs, Edicts, Statutes, Orders and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in which dangerous Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Equity and Justice being structured and founded on either of the opposite Terms, and a Gap being thereby opened for the ushering in of Injustice and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, through the various Interpretations of Self ended Lawyers, being assuredly perswaded that the Infernal Calumniator,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:43704:183"/>
who frequently transformeth himself into the likeness of a Messenger or Angel of Light, maketh use of these cross Glosses and Expositions in the Mouths and Pens of his Ministers and Servants, the perverse Advocates, bribing Judges, Law-monging Attorneys, prevaricating Counsellors, and other such like Law-wrestling Members of a Court of Justice, to turn by those means Black to White, Green to Grey, and what is Streight to a Crooked ply; for the more expedient doing whereof these <hi>Diabolical</hi> Ministers make both the Pleading Parties believe that their Cause is just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for it is well known that there is no Cause how bad soever, which doth not find an Advocate to patrocinate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, else would there be no Process in the World, no Suits at Law, nor Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the Bar. He did in these Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as I conceive, most humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Direction of his Judicial Proceedings to the upright Judge of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, God Almighty; did submit himself to the Conduct and Guideship of the blessed Spirit, in the Hazard and Perplexity of the Definitive Sentence; and by this <hi>Alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> Lot, did as it were implore and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Divine Decree of his <hi>Good Will</hi> and Pleasure, in stead of that which we call the <hi>Final Iudgment of a Court.</hi> To
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:43704:183"/>
this effect, to the better attaining to his purpose, which was to judge righteously, he did in my Opinion throw and turn the <hi>Dice,</hi> to the end, that by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence aforesaid, the best <hi>Chance</hi> might fall to him whose Action was uprightest, and backed with greatest Reason; in doing whereof he did not stray from the Sence of <hi>Talmudists,</hi> who say that there is so little harm in that manner of searching the Truth, that in the Anxiety and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexedness of Humane Wits, God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifesteth the Secret Pleasure of his Divine Will.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I will neither think nor say, nor can I believe, that the unstreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is so irregular, or the Corruption so evident, of those of the Parliament of <hi>Mirlingois</hi> in <hi>Mirlingues,</hi> before whom <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlegoose</hi> was Arraigned for Prevarication, that they will maintain it to be a wors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43704:184"/>
and perfidious Knave, so pernicious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, avaricious and perverse in his ways, that it was his ordinary custom to sell Laws, Edicts, Declarations, Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Ordinances, as at an Outroop or Putsale, to him who offered most for them. Thus did he shape Measures for the Pleaders, and cut their Morsels to them by and out of these little Parcels, Fragments, Bits, Scantlings and Shreds of the Law now in use, altogether conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, suppressing, disannulling and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the remainder, which did make for the total Law; fearing that if the whole Law were made manifest and laid open to the knowledge of such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in it, and the Learned Books of the Ancient <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Law, upon the Exposition of the <hi>Twelve Tables</hi> and <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian</hi> Edicts, his villanous Pranks, Naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness and vile Impiety should come to the publick notice of the World. Therefore were it better in my Conceit, that is to say, less inconvenient, that Parties at Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance in any Juridicial Case, should in the dark march upon Caltropes, then to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Determination of what is their Right to such unhallowed Sentences and horrible Decrees: As <hi>Cato</hi> in his time wished and advised, that every Judiciary Court should be paved with Caltropes.</p>

            <p>ON the sixth Day thereafter <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was returned home, at the very same hour that <hi>Triboulet</hi> was by Water come from <hi>Blois. Panurge</hi> at his Arrival gave him a Hogs Bladder, puffed up with Wind, and resounding, because of the hard Pease that were within it: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he did present him with a guilt Wooden Sword, a hollow Budget made of a Tortoise shell, an Osier Watled Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Bottle full of <hi>Briton</hi> Wine, and Five and Twenty Apples of the Orchard of <hi>Blanduco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he be such a Fool (quoth <hi>Carpalin</hi>) as to be won with Apples, there is no more Wit in his Pate than in the Head of an ordinary Cabbage. <hi>Triboulet</hi> girded the Sword and Scrip to his side, took the Bladder in his Hand, ate some few of the Apples, and drunk up all the Wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurge</hi> very wistly and heedfully looking upon him, said, I never yet saw a Fool,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:43704:185"/>
(and I have seen ten thousand Franks worth of that kind of Cattle) who did not love to drink heartily, and by good long Draughts. When <hi>Triboulet</hi> had done with his Drinking, <hi>Panurge</hi> laid out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and exposed the Sum of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, wherein he was to require his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in eloquent and choicely-sorted Terms, adorned with Flourishes of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick. But before he had altogether done, <hi>Triboulet</hi> with his Fist gave him a bouncing Whirret between the Shoulders, rendred back into his Hand again the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty Bottle, filipped and fli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted him on the Nose with the Hogs Bladder; and lastly, for a final resolution, shaking and wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Head strongly and disorderly, he answered nothing else but this, <hi>By God, God; mad Fool, beware the Monk: Buzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, Hornepipe.</hi> These Words thus finished, he slipped himself out of the Company, went aside, and ratling the Bladder, took a huge Delight in the Melody of the rickling, crackling noise of the Pease; after which time it lay not in the power of them all to draw out of his Chaps the Articulate Sound of one Syllable; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that when <hi>Panurge</hi> went about to interrogate him further, <hi>Triboulet</hi> drew his Wooden Sword, and would have stuck him therewith. I have fished fair now,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:43704:185"/>
(quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) and brought my Pigs to a fine Market. Have I not got a brave Determination of all my Doubts, and a Responce in all things agreeable to the Oracle that gave it? He is a great <hi>Fool</hi> that is not to be denied; yet is he a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Fool</hi> who brought him hither to me. That Bolt, quoth <hi>Carpalin,</hi> levels point blank at me; but of the three I am the greatest <hi>Fool,</hi> who did impart the Secret of my Thoughts to such an Idiot Ass and Native Ninny.</p>
            <p>Without putting our selves to any stir or trouble in the least, (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) let us maturely and seriously consider and perpend the Gestures and Speech which he hath made and uttered: In them veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably (quoth he) have I remarked and observed some excellent and notable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries; yea, of such important and worth and weight, that I shall never henceforth be astonished, nor think strange, why the <hi>Turks</hi> with a great deal of Worship and Reverence, Honour and Respect Natural Fools, equally with their Primest Doctors, Mufties, Divines and Prophets. Did not you take heed (quoth he) a little before he opened his Mouth to speak, what a shog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, shaking and wagging his Head did keep? By the approved Doctrine of the ancient Philosophers, the customary Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:43704:186"/>
of the most expert Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the received Opinions of the learnedest Lawyers, such a brangling A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation and Moving should by us all be judged to proceed from, and be quickned and suscitated by the coming and Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophetizing and Fatielical Spirit, which entring briskly, and on a sudden, into a shallow Receptacle of a debil Substance (for as you know, and as the Proverb shews it, <hi>a little Head containeth not much Brains</hi>) was the cause of that Commotion. This is conform to what is avouched by the most skilful Physicians, when they affirm, that Shakings and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings fall upon the Members of a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, partly because of the Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and violent Impetuosity of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Load that is carried, and other part, by reason of the Weakness and Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity that is in the vertue of the bearing Organ: A manifest Example whereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in those, who fasting, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carry to their Head a great Goblet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Wine without a trembling and a shaking in the Hand that holds it. This of old was accounted a Prefiguration and mystical pointing out of the <hi>Pythian</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineress, who used always before the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of a Responce from the <hi>Oracle,</hi> to shake a Branch of her Domestick Lawrel.
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:43704:186"/>
               <hi>Lampridius</hi> also testifieth, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Heliogabulus,</hi> to acquire unto himself the Reputation of a <hi>Sooth-sayer,</hi> did, on several Holy Days of prime Solemnity, in the Presence of the Fanatick Rabble, make the Head of his <hi>Idol,</hi> by some slight within the Body thereof, publickly to shake. <hi>Plautus,</hi> in his <hi>Asserie,</hi> declareth likeways, that <hi>Saurius,</hi> whithersoever he walked like one quite distracted of his Wits, keepeth such a furious lolling and mad-like shaking of his Head, that he commonly affrighted those who casually met with him in his Way. The said Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in another place shewing a Reason why <hi>Charmides</hi> shook and brangled his Head, assevered that he was transported, and in an Extasie. <hi>Catullus</hi> after the same manner maketh mention in his <hi>Berecyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> and <hi>Atys,</hi> of the place wherein the <hi>Menades, Bacchical</hi> Women, She-Priests of the <hi>Lyaean</hi> God, and demented Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses, carrying Ivy Boughs in their hands, did shake their Heads. As in the like case amongst the <hi>Gauls,</hi> the guelded Priests of <hi>Cybele</hi> were wont to do in the celebrating of some Festivals, which according to the sense of the ancient Theologues, have from thence had their Denomination; for <gap reason="foreign">

about, shake the Head, and play the part of one that is wry-necked.</p>
            <p>Semblably <hi>Titus Livius</hi> writeth, that in the Solemnization time of the <hi>Bacchana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Fobedayes at <hi>Rome,</hi> both Men and Women seemed to Prophetize and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticinate, because of an affected kind of wagging of the Head, shrugging of the Shoulders, and Jectigation of the whole Body, which they used then most pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. For the common Voice of the Philosophers, together with the Opinion of the People, asserteth for an irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Truth, that Vaticination is seldom by the Heavens bestowed on any, without the Concomitancy of a little Phrensie, and a Head shaking, not only when the said presaging Vertue is infused, but when the Person also therewith inspired declareth and manifesteth it unto others. The Learned Lawyer <hi>Iulien,</hi> being asked on a time, if that Slave might be truly esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be healthful and in a good plight, who had not only convers'd with some fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, maniack and enraged People, but in their Company had also prophesied, yet without a Noddle-shaking Concussion, answered, That seeing there was no Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagging at the time of his Predictions, he might be held for sound and compotent enough.

               <hi>CHAP. XLVI.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> and <hi>Panurge</hi> diversly interpret the Words of <hi>Triboulet.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HE says you are a <hi>Fool;</hi> and what kind of <hi>Fool?</hi> A <hi>mad</hi> Fool, who in your old Age would enslave your self to the Bondage of Matrimony, and shut your Pleasures up within a Wedlock, whose Key some Ruffian carries in his Codpiece. He says furthermore, <hi>beware</hi> of the <hi>Monk.</hi> Upon mine Honour, it gives me in my mind, that you will be cuckold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>Monk.</hi> Nay, I will engage mine Honour, which is the most precious Pawn I could have in my Possession, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I were sole and peaceable Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator over all <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> that if you marry, you will surely be one of the Horned Brotherhood of <hi>Vulcan.</hi> Hereby may you perceive how much I do attribute to the wise <hi>Foolery</hi> of our Morosoph <hi>Triboulet.</hi> The other Oracles and Responses did in the general prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate you a Cuckold, without descending
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:43704:188"/>
so near to the point of a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, as to pitch upon what Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, amongst the several sorts of Men, he should profess who is to be the Copes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of your Wife, and Hornifyer of your proper self. Thus noble <hi>Triboulet</hi> tells it us plainly, from whose Words we may gather with all ease imaginary, that your Cuckoldry is to be infamous, and so much the more scandalous, that your Conjugal Bed will be incestuously conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with the Filthiness of a <hi>Monkery</hi> Lecher. Moreover he says, that you will be the <hi>Hornepipe of Buzansay.</hi> That is to say, well horned, hornified and cornuted: And as <hi>Triboulet</hi>'s Unkle asked from <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, for a younger Brother of his own who lived at <hi>Blois,</hi> the <hi>Hornepipes</hi> of <hi>Buzansay,</hi> for the Organ Pipes, through the mistake of one Word for another: Even so, whilst you think to marry a wise, humble, calm, discreet and honest Wife, you shall unhappily stumble upon one witless, proud, lowd, obstreperous, bawling, clamourous, and more unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant than any <hi>Buzansay-hornepipe.</hi> Consider withal, how he flirted you on the Nose with the <hi>Bladder,</hi> and gave you a sound thumping Blow with his Fist upon the ridge of the Back. This denotates and presageth, that you shall be banged, beaten
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:43704:189"/>
and filipped by her; and that also she will steal of your Goods from you, as you stole the Hogs Bladder from the little Boys of <hi>Vaubreton.</hi> Plat contrary (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) not that I would impudently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt my self from being a Vassal in the Territory of <hi>Folly;</hi> I hold of that Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and am subject thereto, I confess it; and why should I not? for the whole World is <hi>foolish.</hi> In the old <hi>Lorrain</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (<hi>fou</hi> for <hi>oou) All</hi> and <hi>Fool</hi> were the same thing. Besides it is avouched by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that infinite is the number of <hi>Fools:</hi> From an Infinity nothing can be deducted or abated; nor yet by the Testimony of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> can any thing thereto be added or subjoyned. Therefore were I a <hi>mad Fool,</hi> if being a <hi>Fool</hi> I should not hold my self a Fool. After the same manner of speaking, we may averr the number of the mad and enraged Folks to be infinite. <hi>Avicenne</hi> maketh no Bones to assert, that the several kinds of <hi>Madness</hi> are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.</p>
            <p>Though this much of <hi>Triboulet</hi>'s words tend little to my Advantage, how be it the Prejudice which I sustain thereby be common with me to all other Men, yet the rest of his Talk and Gesture maketh altogether for me. He said to my Wife, <hi>Be weary of the Monky;</hi> that is as much,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:43704:189"/>
as if he should be chery, and take as much delight in a Monky as ever did the <hi>Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> of <hi>Catullus</hi> in her Sparrow; who will for his Recreation pass his time no less joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at the exercise of snatching Flies, then heretofore did the merciless Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catcher <hi>Domitian.</hi> Withal he meant by another part of his Discourse, that she should be of a Jovial Country-like Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as gay and pleasing as a harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Hornepipe</hi> of <hi>Saulian</hi> or <hi>Buzansy.</hi> The veridical <hi>Triboulet</hi> did therein hint at what I liked well, as perfectly knowing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Propensions of my Mind, my natural Disposition, and the Biass of my Interior Passions and Affections: For you may be assured, that my Humour is much better satisfied and contented with the pretty frolick rural discheveled Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesses, whose Bums through their course Canvas Smocks smell of the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-grass of the Field, than with those great Ladies in Magnifick Courts, with their Flandan, Top-knots and Sultana's, their Polvil, Postillo's and Cosmeticks. The homely sound likeways of a Rustical <hi>Hornepipe,</hi> is more agreeable to my Ears, than the curious Warbling and musical Quavering of Lutes, Teorbes, Viols, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becks and Violins. He gave me a lusty rapping thwack on my Back. What then?
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:43704:190"/>
Let it pass in the Name and for the Love of God, as an Abatement of, and Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from so much of my future Pains in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> He did it not out of any evil intent: He thought belike to have hit some of the Pages: He is an honest <hi>Fool,</hi> and an innocent Changeling. It is a Sin to harbour in the Heart any bad Conceit of him. As for my self, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pardon him. He flirted me on the Nose: In that there is no harm; for it importeth nothing else, but that betwixt my <hi>Wife</hi> and me there will occur some toyish wanton Tricks, which usually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all new married Folks.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XLVII.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> and <hi>Panurge</hi> resolved to make a Visit to the Oracle of the Holy Bottle.</head>
            <p>THere is as yet another Point (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) which you have not at all considered on, although it be the chief and principal Head of the matter. He put the <hi>Bottle</hi> in my hand, and restored it
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:43704:190"/>
me again. How interpret you that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage? What is the meaning of that? He possibly (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) signifieth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that your <hi>Wife</hi> will be such a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, as shall daily take in her Liquor kindly, and ply the Pots and <hi>Bottles</hi> apace. Quite otherways (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) for the <hi>Bottle</hi> was empty. I swear to you, by the prickling brambly Thorn of St. <hi>Fiacre</hi> in <hi>Brie,</hi> that our unique Morosoph, whom I formerly termed the Lunatick <hi>Triboulet,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth me, for attaining to the final Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of my Scruple, to the Response-giving <hi>Bottle:</hi> Therefore do I renew afresh the first Vow which I made, and here in your Presence protest and make Oath by <hi>Styx</hi> and <hi>Acheron,</hi> to carry still Spectacles in my Cap, and never to wear a Codpiece in my Breeches, until upon the Enterprize in hand of my Nuptial Undertaking, I shall have obtained an Answer from the <hi>Holy Bottle.</hi> I am acquainted with a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, understanding, and discreet Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and besides a very good Friend of mine, who knoweth the Land, Country, and Place where its <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Oracle</hi> is built and posited: He will guide and conduct us thither sure and safely. Let us go thither, I beseech you: Deny me not, and say not, Nay; reject not the Suit I make unto you, I intreat you. I
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:43704:191"/>
will be to you an <hi>Achates,</hi> a <hi>Damis,</hi> and heartily accompany you all along in the whole Voyage, both in your going forth and coming back. I have of a long time known you to be a great Lover of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrination, desirous still to learn new things, and still to see what you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen before.</p>
            <p>Very willingly (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to your Request. But before we enter in upon our Progress towards the Accomplishment of so far a Journey, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished and fraught with eminent Perils, full of innumerable Hazards, and every way stored with evident and manifest Dangers. What Dangers (quoth <hi>Panurge</hi>) interrupting him? Dangers fly back, run from, and shun me whither soever I go seven Leagues around: As in the Presence of the Soveraign a subordinate Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is eclipsed; or as Clouds and Darkness quite evanish at the bright coming of a Radiant Sun; or as all Sores and Sicknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses did suddenly depart, at the approach of the Body of St. <hi>Martin Aquande:</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) before we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to set forwards on the Road of our projected and intended Voyage, some few Points are to be discussed, expedited and dispatched. <hi>First,</hi> Let us send back <hi>Triboulet</hi> to <hi>Blois,</hi> (which was instantly
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:43704:191"/>
done, after that <hi>Pantagruel</hi> had given him a Frize Coat.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Design must be backed with the Advice and Counsel of the King my Father. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> It is most needful and expedient for us, that we search for, and find out some <hi>Sybille</hi> to serve us for a Guide, Truchman and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter. To this <hi>Panurge</hi> made answer, That his Friend <hi>Xenomanes</hi> would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly suffice for the plenary Discharge and Performance of the <hi>Sybil</hi>'s Office; and that furthermore, in passing through the <hi>Lanternatory</hi> Revelling Country, they should take along with them a Learned and profitable <hi>Lanterne,</hi> which would be no less useful to them in their Voyage, than was that of the <hi>Sybil</hi> to <hi>Aeneas</hi> in his Descent to the <hi>Elysian</hi> Fields. <hi>Carpalin</hi> in the interim, as he was upon the conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of <hi>Triboulet,</hi> in his passing by, hearkened a little to the Discourse they were upon, then spoke out, saying, Ho, <hi>Panurge,</hi> Master Freeman, take my Lord <hi>Debitis</hi> at <hi>Calais</hi> alongst with you, for he is <hi>Goud-fallot,</hi> a good Fellow: He will not forget those who have been <hi>Debitors:</hi> These are <hi>Lanternes:</hi> Thus shall you not lack for both <hi>Fallot</hi> and <hi>Lanterne.</hi> I may safely with the little Skill I have (quoth <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) prognosticate, that by the way we shall engender no Melancholy;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:43704:192"/>
I clearly perceive it already: The only thing that vexeth me is, that I cannot speak the <hi>Lanternatorie</hi> Language. I shall (answered <hi>Panurge</hi>) speak for you all; I understand it every whit as well as I do mine own Maternal Tongue, I have been no less used to it than to the Vulgar <hi>French.</hi>

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:43704:193"/>
of what had pass'd and occurred worthy of his Observation in his Travels abroad, since their last Interview: Then, acquainting him with the Design he had in hand, besought him that it might stand with his good Will and Pleasure to grant him leave to prosecute and go thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitch with the Enterprize which he had undertaken. The good Man <hi>Gargantua</hi> having in one hand two great Bundles of Petitions, indorsed and answered; and in the other some remembrancing Notes and Bills, to put him in mind of such other Requests of Supplicants, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit presented, had nevertheless been nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther read nor heard, he gave both to <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich Gallet,</hi> his ancient and faithful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Requests; then drew aside <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel,</hi> and with a Countenance more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and jovial than customary, spoke to him thus: I praise God, and have great reason so to do, my most dear Son, that he hath been pleased to entertain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n you a constant Inclination to vertuous Actions. I am well content that the Voyage which you have motioned to me be by you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, but withal, I could wish you would have a mind and desire to marry, for that I see you are of competent years. <hi>Panurge</hi> in the mean while was in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of preparing and providing for
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:43704:193"/>
Remedies, Salves and Cures against all such Lets, Obstacles and Impediments as he could in the heighth of his Fancy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive might by <hi>Gargantua</hi> be cast in the way of their Itinerary Design. Is it your Pleasure (most dear Father) that you speak? (answered <hi>Pantagruel</hi>) For my part I have not yet thought upon it. In all this Affair I wholly submit and rest in your good liking and Paternal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For I shall rather pray unto God that he would throw me down stark dead at your Feet, in your Pleasure, then that against your pleasure I should be found married alive. I never yet heard that by any Law, whether Sacred or Profane, yea, amongst the rudest and most barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations in the World, it was allowed and approved of, that Children may be suffered and tolerated to marry at their own good Will and Pleasure, without the Knowledge, Advice or Consent asked and had thereto of their Fathers, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and nearest Kindred. All Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors every where upon the Face of the whole Earth, have taken away and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Licentious Liberty from Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and totally reserved it to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:43704:194"/>My dearly beloved Son (quoth <hi>Gargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>) I believe you, and from my Heart thank God for having endowed you with the Grace of having both a perfect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and entire liking to laudable and praise worthy things; and that through the Windows of your exterior Senses he hath vouchsased to transmit unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Faculties of your Mind, nothing but what is good and vertuous. For in my time there hath been found on the Continent a certain Country, wherein are I know not what kind of <hi>Pastophorian</hi> Mole-catching Priests, who albeit averse from engaging their proper Persons into a Matrimonial Duty, like the Pontifical Flamens of <hi>Cibele</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> as if they were Capons and not Cocks; full of Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiousness, Salacity and Wantonness, who yet have nevertheless, in the matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Affairs, taken upon them to prescribe Laws and Ordinances to married Folks. I cannot goodly determine what I should most abhor, detest, loath and abominate, whether the Tyrannical Presumption of those dreaded Sacerdotal <hi>Molecatch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:43704:194"/>
Businesses quite contrary, and diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically opposite to the Quality, State and Condition of their Callings, Professions and Vocations; or the superstitious Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and senceless Scrupulousness of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Folks, who have yielded Obedience, and submitted their Bodies, Fortunes and Estates to the Discretion and Authority of such odious, perverse, barbarous, and unreasonable Laws. Nor do they see that which is clearer than the Light and Splendour of the Morning Star, how all these Nuptial and Connubial Sanctions, Statutes and Ordinances have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, made and instituted, for the sole Benefit, Profit and Advantage of the <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Mists,</hi> and mysterious <hi>Flamens,</hi> and nothing at all for the good Utility or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument of the silly hood-winked mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried People; which administreth unto others a sufficient Cause for rendring these Church-men suspicious of Iniquity, and of an unjust and fraudulent manner of dealing, no more to be connived at nor countenanced, after that it be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scales of Reason, than if with a reciprocal Temerity the <hi>Laicks</hi> by way of Compensation would impose Laws to be followed and observed by those <hi>Mysts</hi> and <hi>Flamens;</hi> how they should behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the making and Performance of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:43704:195"/>
their Rites and Ceremonies, and after what manner they ought to proceed in the offering up, and immolating of their various Oblations, Victims and Sacrifices; seeing that besides the Edecimation and Tith-haling of their Goods, they cut off and take Parings, Shreddings and Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of the Gain proceeding from the Labour of their Hands, and Sweat of their Brows, therewith to entertain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the better. Upon which Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in my Opinion, their Injunctions and Commands would not prove so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and impertinent as those of the Ecclesiastick Power, unto which they had tendred their blind Obedience.</p>
            <p>For as you have very well said, there is no place in the World where legally a Licence is granted to the Children to marry without the Advice and Consent of their Parents and Kindred. Nevertheless by those wicked Laws and <hi>Mole-catching</hi> Customs, whereat there is a little hinted in what I have already spoken to you, there is no scurvy, mezely, lepro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

how noble, how fair, how rich, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and chaste soever she be, and that out of the House of her own Father, in his own Presence, from the Bosom of her Mother, and in the sight and despight of her Friends and Kindred looking on a so woful Spectacle, provided that the Rascal Villain be so cunning as to associate unto himself some <hi>Mystical Flamen,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant made betwixt them two, shall be in hope some day to participate of the Prey.</p>

May not these Fathers and Mothers (think you) be sorrowful and heavy-hearted, when they see an unknown Fellow, a Vagabond Stranger, a barbarous Lowt, a rude Curr, rotten, fleshless, putrified, scraggy, boily, botchy, poor, a forlorn Caitif and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Snake, by an open Rapt, snatcht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before their own Eyes their so fair, delicate, neat, well-behavioured, richly provided for, and healthful Daughters, on whose Breeding and Education they had

How doleful, trist and plangorous would such a Sight and Pageantry prove unto them? You shall not need to think that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachrymation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their Confederates, at the Decease of <hi>Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Drusus,</hi> was comparable to this Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theirs? Neither would I have you to believe, that the Discomfort and Anxiety of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> when the <hi>Greek Helen,</hi> by the Perfidiousness of the
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:43704:196"/>
Adulterous <hi>Trojan Paris</hi> was privily stollen away out of their Country, was greater or more pitiful than this ruthful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Collugency of theirs? You may very well imagine that <hi>Ceres,</hi> at the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment of her Daughter <hi>Proserpina,</hi> was not more attristed, sad, nor mournful than they. Trust me, and your own Reason, that the loss of <hi>Osyris</hi> was not so regreatable to <hi>Isis;</hi> nor did <hi>Venus</hi> so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Death of <hi>Adonis;</hi> nor yet did <hi>Hercules</hi> so bewail the straying of <hi>Hylas;</hi> nor was the Rapt of <hi>Polyxena</hi> more throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingly resented and condoled by <hi>Pryamus</hi> and <hi>Hecuba,</hi> than this aforesaid Accident would be sympathetically bemoaned, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, ruthful and anxious to the wofully desolate and disconsolate Parents.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this, the greater part of so vilely abused Parents, are so timerous and afraid of Devils and Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins, and so deeply plunged in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, that they dare not gainsay nor contradict, much less oppose and resist those unnatural and impious Actions, when the <hi>Mole-catcher</hi> hath been present at the perpetrating of the Fact, and a Party Contracter and Covenanter in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable Bargain. What do they do then? They wretchedly stay at their own mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:43704:197"/>
Homes, destitute of their well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Daughters; the Fathers cursing the days and the hours wherein they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and the Mothers howling and crying that it was not their fortune to have brought forth Abortive Issues, when they hapned to be delivered of such unfortunate Girls; and in this pitiful plight spend at best the remainder of their Time with Tears and Weeping for those their Children of, and from whom they expected (and with good reason should have obtained and reaped) in these latter days of theirs, Joy and Comfort. Other Parents there have been, so impatient of that Affront and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty put upon them and their Families, that, transported with the Extremity of Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a mad and frantick mood, through the Vehemency of a grievous Fury and raging Sorrow, have drowned, hanged, killed, and otherways put violent hands on themselves. Others again of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental Relation, have upon the reception of the like Injury, been of a more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and heroick Spirit, who (in imitation, and at the Example of the Children of <hi>Iacob,</hi> revenging upon the <hi>Sichemits</hi> the Rapt of their Sister <hi>Dina</hi>) having found the Rascally Ruffian in the Association of his mystical <hi>Mole-catcher</hi> closely and in hugger-mugger, conferring,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:43704:197"/>
parlying, and coming with their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for the suborning, corrupting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praving, perverting and enticing these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, unexperienced Maids unto filthy Lewdnesses, have, without any further Advisement on the matter, cut them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly into pieces, and thereupon forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thrown out upon the Fields their so dismembred Bodies, to serve for Food unto the Wolves and Ravens. Upon the chivalrous, bold and couragious Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a so valiant, stout and man-like Act, the other <hi>Mole catching Symmists</hi> have been so highly incensed, and have so chaffed, fretted and fumed thereat, that Bills of Complaint and Accusations ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in a most odious and detestible manner put in before the competent Judges, the <hi>Arm of Secular Authority</hi> hath with much Importunity and Impetuosity been by them implored and required, they proudly contending, that the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God</hi> would become contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if exemplary Punishment were not speedily taken upon the Persons of the Perpetrators of such an enormous, horrid, sacrilegious, crying, heinous, and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crime.</p>
            <p>Yet neither by Natural Equity, by the Law of Nations, nor by any Imperial Law whatsoever, hath there been found
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:43704:198"/>
so much as one Rubrick, Paragraph, Point or Tittle, by the which any kind of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement or Correction hath been adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed due to be inflicted upon any for their Delinquency in that kind. Reason op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, and Nature is repugnant: For there is no vertuous Man in the World, who, both naturally and with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, will not be more hugely troubled in Mind, hearing of the News of the Rapt, Disgrace, Ignominy and Dishonour of his Daughter, than of her Death. Now any Man finding in hot Blood, one who with a fore-thought Felony hath mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his Daughter, may, without tying himself to the Formalities and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of a Legal Proceeding, kill him on a sudden, and out of hand, without incurring any hazard of being attainted and apprehended by the Officers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for so doing. What wonder is it then? or how little strange should it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any rational Man, if a Lechering Rogue, together with his <hi>Mole catching</hi> Abetter, be entrapped in the flagrant Act of suborning his Daughter, and stealing her out of his House, (though her self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thereto) that the Father in such a case of Stain and Infamy by them brought upon his Family, should put them both to a shameful Death, and cast their Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:43704:198"/>
upon Dunghils to be devoured and eaten up by Dogs and Swine, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise fling them a little further off to the direption, tearing and rending asunder of their Joynts and Members by the Wild Beasts of the Field.</p>
            <p>Dearly beloved Son, have an especial Care, that after my Decease none of these Laws be received in any of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; for whilst I breath, by the Grace and Assistance of God I shall give good Order.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore you have totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto my Discretion the Disposure of you in Marriage, I am fully of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that I shall provide sufficiently well for you in that Point. Make ready and prepare your self for <hi>Panurge</hi>'s Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: Take along with you <hi>Epistemon,</hi> Friar <hi>Ihon,</hi> and such others as you will choose: Do with my Treasures what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your self shall seem most expedient: None of your Actions, I promise you, can in any manner of way displease me. Take out of my Arcenal <hi>Thalasse,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Equipage, Furniture or Provision you please, together with such Pilots, Mariners and Truchmen, as you have a mind to; and with the first fair and favourable Wind set sail and make out to Sea in the Name of God our Saviour. In
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:43704:199"/>
the mean while, during your Absence, I shall not be neglective of providing a <hi>Wife</hi> for you, nor of those Preparations, which are requisite to be made for the more sumptuous solemnizing of your Nuptials with a most splendid Feast, if ever there was any in the World, since the days of <hi>Assuerus.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XLIX.</hi> How <hi>Pantagruel</hi> did put himself in a readiness to go to Sea; and of the Herb named <hi>Pantagruelion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WIthin very few days after that <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> had taken his Leave of the good <hi>Gargantua,</hi> who devoutly prayed for his Sons happy Voyage, he arrived at the Sea-Port, near to <hi>Sammalo,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Panurge, Epistemon,</hi> Friar <hi>Ihon</hi> of the <hi>Funnels, Abbot</hi> of <hi>Theleme,</hi> and others of the Royal House, especially with <hi>Xenoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the great Traveller, and Thwarter of dangerous ways, who was come at the bidding and appointment of <hi>Panurge,</hi> of whose <hi>Castlewick</hi> of <hi>Salmigondin</hi> he did
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:43704:199"/>
hold some petty Inheritance by the Tenure of a <hi>Mesnefee. Pantagruel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come thither, prepared and made ready for launching a Fleet of Ships, to the number of those which <hi>Ajax</hi> of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> had of old equipped, in Convoy of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Soldiery against the <hi>Trojan</hi> State. He likewise picked out for his use so many Mariners, Pilots, Sailors, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, Artificers, Officers and Soldiers, as he thought fitting; and therewithal made Provision of so much Victuals of all sorts, Artillery, Munition of divers kinds, Cloaths, Moneys, and other such Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, Stuff, Baggage, Chaffer and Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, as he deemed needful for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Design of a so tedious, long and perillous Voyage. Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, it was observed, how he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some of his Vessels to be fraught and loaded with a great quantity of an Herb of his called <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> not only of the green and raw sort of it, but of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected also, and of that which was nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well befitted for present use after the fashion of Conserves. The Herb <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruelion</hi> hath a little Root somewhat hard and ruff, roundish, terminating in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuse and very blunt Point, and having some of its Veins, Strings or Filaments coloured with some spots of white, never
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:43704:200"/>
fixeth it self into the ground above the profoundness almost of a Cubit, or Foot and a half; from the Root thereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the only Stalk, orbicular, cane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, green without, whitish within, and hollow like the Stem of <hi>Smyrgium, Olus Atrum,</hi> Beans and Gentian, full of long Threds, streight, easie to be broken, jog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, snipped, nicked and notched a little after the manner of Pillars and Columns, slightly farrowed, chamfered, guttred and channel'd, and full of Fibres, or Hairs like Strings, in which consisteth the chief Value and Dignity of the Herb, especially in that part thereof which is termed <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> as he would say the <hi>Mean;</hi> and in that other which hath got the Denomination of <hi>Milasea.</hi> Its Height is commonly of five or six Foot; yet sometimes it is of such a tall Growth, as doth surpass the length of a Lance, but that is only when it meeteth with a sweet, easie, warm, wet and well-soaked Soil, (as is the ground of the Territory of <hi>Olone,</hi> and that of <hi>Rasea,</hi> near to <hi>Preneste</hi> in <hi>Sabinia</hi>) and that it want not for Rain enough about the Season of the <hi>Fishers Holydays,</hi> and the <hi>Estival Solstice.</hi> There are many Trees whose Height is by it very far exceeded, and you might call it <hi>Dendromalache</hi> by the Authority of <hi>Theophrastus.</hi> The Plant
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:43704:200"/>
every year perisheth; the Tree, neither in the Trunk, Root, Bark or Boughs, being durable.</p>
            <p>From the Stalk of this <hi>Pantagruelian</hi> Plant there issue forth several large and great Branches, whose Leaves have thrice as much length as breadth, always green, roughish and rugged like the Alcanet, or <hi>Spanish</hi> Buglose, hardish, slit round about like unto a Sickle, or as the Saxifragum, Betony, and finally ending as it were in the Points of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Spear, or of such a Lancet as Surgeons commonly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make use of in their Phlebotomizing Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. The Figure and shape of the Leaves thereof is not much different from that of those of the Ash-tree, or of <hi>Egrimony;</hi> the Herb it self so being like the <hi>Eupato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Plant, that many skilful <hi>Herbalists</hi> have called it the <hi>Domestick Eupator,</hi> and the <hi>Eupator</hi> the wild <hi>Pantagruelion.</hi> These Leaves are in equal and parallel Distances spread around the Stalk, by the number in every Rank either of Five or Seven, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having so highly favoured and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd this Plant, that she hath richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned it with these two <hi>odd, divine</hi> and <hi>mysterious</hi> Numbers. The Smell thereof is somewhat strong, and not very pleasing to nice, tender and delicate Noses: The Seed inclosed therein mounteth up to the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:43704:201"/>
very top of its Stalk, and a little above it.</p>
            <p>This is a numerous Herb; for there is no less abundance of it than of any other whatsoever. Some of these Plants are Spherical, some Romboid, and some of an oblong shape, and all of those either black, bright-coloured or tawny, rude to the touch, and mantled with a quickly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blasted-away Coat, yet such a one as is of a delicious Taste and Savour to all shrill and sweetly singing Birds, such as Linnets, Goldfinches, Larks, Canary Birds, Yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammers, and others of that Airy chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Quire; but it would quite extinguish the Natural Heat and Procreative Vertue of the Semence of any Man, who would eat much, and often of it. And although, that, of old, amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> there was certain kinds of Fritters and Pancakes, Buns and Tarts made thereof, which commonly for a lickorish Daintines; were presented the Table after Supper, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the Palat, and make the Wine relish the better. Yet is it of a difficult Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and offensive to the Stomach; for it engendreth bad and unwholsom Blood, and with its exorbitant Heat woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them with grievous, hurtful, smart and noysom Vapours. And as in divers Plants and Trees there are two Sexes,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:43704:201"/>
Male and Female, which is perceptible in Lawrels, Palms, Cypresses, Oaks, Holmes, the Daffadil, Mandrake, Fearn, the Agarick, Mushrum, Birthwort, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, Penny-royal, Peony, Rose of the Mount, and many other such like. Even so, in this Herb there is a <hi>Male</hi> which beareth no Flower at all, yet it is very copious of, and abundant in Seed. There is likeways in it a <hi>Female,</hi> which hath great store and plenty of whitish Flowers, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to little or no purpose; nor doth it carry in it Seed of any worth at all, at least comparable to that of the Male. It hath also a larger Leaf, and much softer than that of the Male; nor doth it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together grow to so great a height. This <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> is to be sown at the first coming of the Swallows, and is to be plucked out of the Ground when the Grashoppers begin to be a little hoarse.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. L.</hi> How the famous <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> ought to be prepared and wrought.</head>
            <p>THE Herb <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> in <hi>September;</hi> under the Autumnal Equinox, is dressed and prepared several ways, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the various Fancies of the People, and Diversity of the Climates wherein it groweth. The first Instruction which <hi>Pantagruel</hi> gave concerning it, was, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest and dispoil the Stalk and Stem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of of all its Flowers and Seeds, to mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and mortifie it in Pond, Pool, or Lake-water, which is to be made run a little for five days together, if the Season be dry, and the Water hot; or for full nine or twelve days, if the weather be cloudish, and the Water cold: Then must it be parched before the Sun, till it be drained of its Moisture: After this it is in the Shadow, where the Sun shines not, to be peeled, and its Rind pulled off: Then are the Fibres and Strings thereof to be parted, (wherein, as we have already
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:43704:202"/>
said, consisteth its prime Vertue, Price, and Efficacy) and severed from the woody part thereof, which is improfitable, and serveth hardly to any other use, than to make a clear and glistering Blaze, to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Fire, and for the Play, Pastime and Disport of little Children, to blow up Hogs Bladders, and make them rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Many times some use is made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by tipling, sweet-lipped Bibbers, who out of it frame Quills and Pipes, through which they with their Liquor-attractive Breath suck up the new dainty Wine from the Bung of the Barrel. Some modern <hi>Pantagruelists,</hi> to shun and avoid that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Labour, which such a separating and partitional Work would of necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, employ certain <hi>Catarractick</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, oomposed and formed after the same manner that the froward, pettish and angry <hi>Iuno</hi> did hold the Fingers of both her hands interwovenly clenched together, when she would have hindred the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth Delivery of <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mena,</hi> at the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Hercules;</hi> and athwart those Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racts they break and bruise to very Trash the woody parcels, thereby to preserve the better the Fibres, which are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and excellent parts. In, and with this sole Operation do these acquiesce and are contented, who, contrary to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:43704:203"/>
Opinion of the whole Earth, and in in a manner paradoxical to all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, gain their Livelihoods backwards, and by recoiling. But those that love to hold it at a higher rate, and prize it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Value, for their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Profit, do the very same which is told us of the recreation of the three fatal Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Parques,</hi> or of the nocturnal Exercise of the noble <hi>Circe;</hi> or yet of the Excuse which <hi>Penelope</hi> made to her fond wooing Youngsters and effeminate Courtiers, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the long Absence of her Husband <hi>Ulysses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these means is this Herb put into a way to display its inestimable Vertues, whereof I will discover a part: (for to relate all is a thing impossible to do) I have already interpreted and exposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the Denomination thereof. I find that Plants have their Names given and bestowed upon them after several ways: Some got the Name of him who first found them out, knew them, sowed them, improved them by Culture, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them to a tractability, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them to the uses and subse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>viences they were fit for: As the <hi>Mercuriale</hi> from <hi>Mercury, Panacee</hi> from <hi>Panace</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Esculapius,</hi> in <hi>Armois</hi> from <hi>Artemis,</hi> who is <hi>Diana; Eupatorie</hi> from the King
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:43704:203"/>
               <hi>Eupator; Telephion</hi> from <hi>Telephus; Euphor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium</hi> from <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> King <hi>Iuba</hi>'s Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; <hi>Clymenos</hi> from <hi>Clymenus; Alchibiadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> from <hi>Alcibiades; Gentiane</hi> from <hi>Gentius</hi> King of <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> and so forth, through a great many other Herbs or Plants. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ancient Times, this Prerogative of imposing the Inventors Name upon an Herb found out by him, was held in a so great account and estimation, that as a Controversie arose betwixt <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> from which of them two that Land should receive its Denomination, which had been equally found out by them both together, though thereafter it was called and had the Apellation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> from <hi>Athene,</hi> which is <hi>Minerva:</hi> Just so would <hi>Lynceus</hi> King of <hi>Scythia</hi> have treacherously slain the young <hi>Trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolemus,</hi> whom <hi>Ceres</hi> had sent to shew unto Mankind the Invention of Corn, which until then had been utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, to the end, that after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Messenger (whose Death he made account to have kept secret) he might, by imposing with the less suspicion of false dealing, his own Name upon the said found out Seed, acquire unto himself an immortal Honour and Glory, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been the Inventor of a Grain so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and necessary to, and for the use of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:43704:204"/>
Humane Life. For the wickedness of which Treasonable Attempt he was by <hi>Ceres</hi> transformed into that wild Beast, which by some is called a <hi>Lynx,</hi> and by others an <hi>Oince.</hi> Such also was the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of others upon the like occasion, as appeareth by that, very sharp Wars, and of a long continuance, have been made of old betwixt some Residentary Kings in <hi>Capadocia,</hi> upon this only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, of whose Name a certain <hi>Herb</hi> should have the Appellation; by reason of which difference, so troublesom and expensive to them all, it was by them cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Polemonion,</hi> and by us for the same Cause termed <hi>Make-bate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other Herbs and Plants there are, which retain the Names of the Countries from whence they were transported: As the <hi>Median</hi> Apples from <hi>Media,</hi> where they first grew; <hi>Punick</hi> Apples from <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> (that is to say, <hi>Carthage;) Ligusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> (which we call <hi>Louage</hi>) from <hi>Liguria</hi> the Coast of <hi>Genoua; Rubarb</hi> from a Flood in <hi>Barbary</hi> (as <hi>Ammianus</hi> attesteth) called <hi>Ru; Sautonica</hi> from a Region of that Name; <hi>Fenugreek</hi> from <hi>Greece; Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanes</hi> from a Country so called; <hi>Persicarie</hi> from <hi>Persia; Sabine</hi> from a Territory of that Appellation; <hi>Staechas</hi> from the <hi>Stae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chad</hi> Islands; <hi>Spica Celtica</hi> from the Land
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:43704:204"/>
of the <hi>Celtick Gauls;</hi> and so throughout a great many other, which were tedious to enumerate. Some others again have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Denominations by way of Antiphrasis, or Contrariety; as, <hi>Absinth,</hi> because it is contrary to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; for it is bitter to the taste in drinking; <hi>Holosteon,</hi> as if it were all Bones, whilst on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there is no frailer, tenderer nor britler Herb in the whole Production of Nature than it.</p>
            <p>There are some other sorts of Herbs, which have got their Names from their Vertues and Operatious; as <hi>Aristolochie,</hi> because it helpeth Women in Child-birth; <hi>Lichen,</hi> for that it cureth the Disease of that name; <hi>Mallow,</hi> because it mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>Callithricum,</hi> because it maketh the Hair of a bright Colour; <hi>Alyssum, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merum, Bechium, Nasturtium, Aneban,</hi> and so forth through many more.</p>
            <p>Other some there are which have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Names from the admirable Qualities that are found to be in them; as <hi>Heliotropium</hi> (which is the Marigold) because it followeth the Sun; so that at the Sun rising it displayeth and spreads it self out, at his ascending it mounteth, at his declining it waineth; and when he is set it is close shut; <hi>Adianton,</hi> because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it grow near unto watry places,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:43704:205"/>
and albeit you should let it lie in Water a long time, it will nevertheless retain no Moisture nor Humidity; <hi>Hierachia, Erin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> and so throughout a great many more. There are also a great many Herbs, and Plants, which have retained the very same Names of the Men and Women who have been metamorphosed and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in them; as from <hi>Daphne</hi> the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is called also <hi>Daphne; Myrrhe</hi> from <hi>Myrrha</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cinarus; Pythis</hi> from <hi>Pythis; Cinara</hi> (which is the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chock) from one of that name; <hi>Narcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> with <hi>Saffran, Similax,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>Many Herbs likewise have got their Names of those things which they seem to have some Resemblance; as <hi>Hippuris,</hi> because it hath the likeness of a Horse's Tail; <hi>Alopecuris,</hi> because it representeth in similitude the Tail of a Fox; <hi>Psyllion,</hi> from a Flea which it resembleth; <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phinium,</hi> for that it is like a <hi>Dolphin</hi> Fish; <hi>Buglosse</hi> is so called, because it is an Herb like an Oxes Tongue; <hi>Iris,</hi> so called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in its Flowers it hath some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Rain-bow; <hi>Myosata,</hi> because it is like the Ear of a Mouse; <hi>Coronopus,</hi> for that it is of the likeness of a Crows Foot: A great many other such there are, which here to recite were needless. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:43704:205"/>
as there are Herbs and Plants which have had their Names from those of Men, so by a reciprocal Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have the Surnames of many Families taken their Origin from them; as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bii, à fabis,</hi> Beans; the <hi>Pisons, à pisis,</hi> Pease; the <hi>Lentuli</hi> from <hi>Lentils;</hi> the <hi>Cicerons, à Ciceribus, vel Ciceris,</hi> a sort of Pulse called <hi>Cichepeason,</hi> and so forth. In some Plants and Herbs the resemblance or likeness hath been taken from a higher Mark or Object, as when we say <hi>Venus</hi> Navil, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Hair, <hi>Venus</hi> Tub, <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Beard, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s Eye, <hi>Mars</hi>'s Blood, the <hi>Hermodactyl</hi> or <hi>Mercury</hi>'s Fingers, which are all of them Names of Herbs, as there are a great many more of the like Appellation. Others again have received their Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from their Forms; such as the <hi>Trefoil,</hi> because it is three-leaved; <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylon,</hi> for having five Leaves; <hi>Serpolet,</hi> because it creepeth along the ground; <hi>Helixine, Petast, Myrobalon,</hi> which the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> call <hi>Been,</hi> as if you would say an <hi>Ackorne;</hi> for it hath a kind of resemblance thereto, and withal is very oily.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. LI.</hi> Why is it called <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> and of the admirable Vertues thereof.</head>
            <p>BY such like means of attaining to a Denomination (the fabulous ways being only from thence excepted; for the Lord forbid that we should make use of any Fables in this a so venerable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story) is this <hi>Herb</hi> called <hi>Pantagruelion;</hi> for <hi>Pantagruel</hi> was the Inventor thereof: I do not say of the Plant it self, but of a certain use which it serves for, exceeding odious and hateful to Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, unto whom it is more contrarious and hurtful than the <hi>Strangle-weed, Choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitch</hi> is to the Flax, the Cats-tail to the Brakes, the Sheavgrass to the Mowers of Hay, the Fitches to the Chickny Pease, the Darnel to Barley, the Hatchet Fitch to the Lentil Pulse, the <hi>Antramium</hi> to the Beans, Tares to Wheat, Ivy to Walls, the Water Lilly to lecherous Monks, the Birchen Rod to the Scholars of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Navarre</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> Colewort to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:43704:206"/>
the Vine-tree, Garlick to the Load-stone, Onyons to the sight, Fearn-seed to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with Child, Willow Grain to vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nuns, the Yew-tree shade to those that sleep under it, Wolfsbane to Wolves and Libbards, the Smell of Fig-tree to mad Bulls, Hemlock to Goslings, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slane to the Teeth, or Oil to Trees: For we have seen many of those Rogues by vertue and right application of this Herb finish their Lives, <hi>short</hi> and <hi>long,</hi> after the manner of <hi>Phillis</hi> Queen of <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> of <hi>Benosus</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> King <hi>Latinus</hi>'s Wife, of <hi>Iphus, Autolicus, Lycambe, Arachne, Phaedra, Leda, Achius</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and many thousands more; who were chiefly angry and vexed at this Disaster therein, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being otherways sick, evil dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their Bodies, by a touch only of the <hi>Pantagruelian,</hi> they came on a suddain to have the passage obstructed, and their Pipes (through which were wont to bolt so many jolly Sayings, and to enter so many luscious Morsels) stopped, more cleaverly, than ever could have done the Squinancy.</p>
            <p>Others have been heard mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st wofully to lament, at the very instant when <hi>Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi> was about to cut the thred of their Life, that <hi>Pantagruel held them by the Gorge.</hi>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:43704:207"/>
But (well-a-day) it was not <hi>Pantagruel;</hi> he never was an Executioner: It was the <hi>Pantagruelian,</hi> manufactured and fashioned into an Halter, and serving in the place and Office of a Cravat. In that verily they <hi>solaecized,</hi> and spoke improperly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you would excuse them by a <hi>Trope,</hi> which alloweth us to posit the <hi>Inventor</hi> in the place of the thing <hi>invented;</hi> as when <hi>Ceres</hi> is taken for <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> put instead of <hi>Wine.</hi> I swear to you here, by the good and frolick Words which are to issue out of that Wine-bottle which is a cooling below in the Copper Vessel full of Fountain Water, that the noble <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> never snatch'd any Man by the Throat, unless it was such a one as was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together careless and neglective of those obviating Remedies, which were preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Thirst to come.</p>
            <p>It is also termed <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> by a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude: For <hi>Pautagruel,</hi> at the very first minute of his Birth, was no less tall than this Herb is long, whereof I speak unto you, his measure having been then taken the more easie, that he was born in the Season of the great Drowth, when they were busiest in the gathering of the said <hi>Herb,</hi> to wit, at that time when <hi>Ica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s Dog, with his fiery bawling and barking at the Sun, maketh the whole
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:43704:207"/>
World <hi>Troglodytick,</hi> and enforceth People every where to hide themselves in Dens and subterranean Caves. It is likeways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> because of the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and singular Qualities, Vertues and Properties thereof: For as <hi>Pantagruel</hi> hath been the <hi>Idea,</hi> Pattern, Prototype and Exemplary of all <hi>Iovial</hi> Perfection and Accomplishment (in the truth whereof I believe there is none of you, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Drinkers, that putteth any Question) so in this <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> have I found so much Efficacy and Energy, so much Compleatness and Excellency, so much Exquisiteness and Rarity, and so many admirable Effects and Operations of a transcendent Nature, that if the Worth and Vertue thereof had been known, when those <hi>Trees,</hi> by the relation of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> made Election of a wooden <hi>King,</hi> to rule and govern over them, it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt would have carried away from all the rest the Plurality of Votes and Suffrages.</p>
            <p>Shall I yet say more? If <hi>Oxilus</hi> the Son of <hi>Orius</hi> had begotten this Plant upon his Sister <hi>Hamadryas,</hi> he had taken more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Value and Perfection of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, then in all his Eight Children, so highly renowned by our ablest <hi>Mythologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they have sedulously recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:43704:208"/>
their Names to the never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>failing Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an eternal Remembrance. The eldest Child was a Daughter, whose Name was <hi>Vine;</hi> the next born was a Boy, and his Name was <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I shall forbear to tell you, how the Juyce or Sap thereof, being pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and distilled within the Ears, killeth every kind of Vermin, that by any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Putrefaction cometh to be bred and engendred there; and destroyeth also any whatsoever other Animal that shall have entred in thereat. If likewise you put a little of the said Juyce within a Pale or Bucket full of Water, you shall see the Water instantly turn and grow thick therewith, as if it were Milk-Curds, whereof the Vertue is so great, that the Water thus curded is a present Remedy for Horses subject to the Cholick, and such as strike at their own Flanks. The Root thereof well boiled, mollifieth the Joynts, softneth the hardness of shrunk in Sinews, is every way comfortable to the Nerves, and good against all Cramps and Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as likeways all cold and knotty Gouts. If you would speedily heal a
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:43704:208"/>
Burning, whether occasioned by Water or Fire, apply thereto a little raw <hi>Panta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruelion,</hi> that is to say, take it so as it cometh out of the Ground, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing any other Preparation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position upon it; but have a special Care to change it for some fresher, in lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as soon as you shall find it waxing dry upon the Sore.</p>
            <p>Without this <hi>Herb</hi> Kitchins would be detested, the Tables of Dining-Rooms abhorred, although there were great Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Variety of most dainty and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Dishes of Meat set down upon them; and the choicest Beds also, how richly soever adorned with Gold, Silver, Amber, Ivory, Porphyr, and the mixture of most precious Metals, would without it yield no Delight or Pleasure to the Reposers in them: Without it Millers could neither carry Wheat, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of Corn, to the Mill; nor would they be able to bring back from thence Flour, or any other sort of Meal whatsoever. Without it, how could the Papers and Writs of Lawyers Clients be brought to the Bar? Seldom is the Mortar, Lime or Plaister brought to the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house without it. Without it how should the Water be got out of a Draw-Well? In what case would Tabellions, Notaries,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:43704:209"/>
Copists, Makers of Counterpanes, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Clerks, Secretaries, Scriveners, and such like Persons be without it? Were it not for it, what would become of the Toll-rates and Rent-rolls? Would not the noble Art of Printing perish without it? Whereof could the Chassis or Paper-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows be made? How should the Bells be rung? The Altars of <hi>Isis</hi> are adorned therewith; the <hi>Pastophorian</hi> Priests are therewith clad and accoutred; and whole Humane Nature covered and wrapped therein, at its first position and producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in, and into this World: All the Luni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>I will proceed yet further, by the means of this fine <hi>Herb,</hi> the invisible Substances are visibly stopped, arrested, taken, detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Prisoner-like committed to their receptive Goals. Heavy and ponderous Weights are by it heaved, lifted up, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, veered, drawn, carried, and every way moved quickly, nimbly and easily, to the great Profit and Emolument of Humane Kind. When I perpend with my self these and such like marvellous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this wonderful <hi>Herb,</hi> it seemeth strange unto me, how the Invention of so useful a Practice did escape, through so many by-past Ages, the Knowledge of the Ancient <hi>Philosophers,</hi> considering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable Utility which from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; and the immense Labour, which without it, they did undergo in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Elucubrations. By vertue thereof,

through the retention of some Aerial Gusts, are the huge Rambarges, mighty Gallioons, the large Floyts, the <hi>Chiliander,</hi> the <hi>Myriander</hi> Ships launched from their Stations, and set a going at the Pleasure and Arbitriment of their Rulers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Stee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By the help thereof those remote Nations, whom Nature seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so unwilling to have discovered to us, and so desirous to have kept them still <hi>in abscondito,</hi> and hidden from us, that the ways through which their Countries were to be reached unto, were not only totally unknown, but judged also to be altogether impermeable and inaccessible, are now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us, and we to them.</p>
            <p>Those Voyages outreached Flights of Birds, and far surpass'd the Scope of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd Fowls, how swift soever they had been on the Wing, and notwithstanding that advantage which they have of us in swimming through the Air. <hi>Taproban</hi> hath seen the Heaths of <hi>Lapland,</hi> and both the <hi>Iava's</hi> the <hi>Riphaean</hi> Mountains, wide distant <hi>Phebol</hi> shall see <hi>Theleme,</hi> and the <hi>Islanders</hi> drink of the Flood <hi>Euphrates:</hi> By it the chill-mouthed <hi>Boreas</hi> hath sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the parched Mansions of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid <hi>Auster,</hi> and <hi>Eurus</hi> visited the Regions which <hi>Zephirus</hi> hath under his Command; yea, in such sort have Interviews been

made, by the assistance of this <hi>Sacred Herb,</hi> that maugre Longitudes and Latitudes, and all the Variations of the Zones. The <hi>Periae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> People, and <hi>Antoecian, Amphiscian, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroscian,</hi> and <hi>Periscian</hi> had oft tendred and received mutual Visits to, and from other, upon all the Climates. These strange Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits bred such Astonishment to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial <hi>Intelligences,</hi> to all the <hi>Marine</hi> and <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Gods, that they were on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all afraid: From which Amazement, when they saw how, by means of this blest <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> the <hi>Arctick</hi> People lookt upon the <hi>Antarctick,</hi> scowred the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean, passed the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> pushed through the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> measured all the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> sported under the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> having both <hi>Poles</hi> level with their <hi>Horizon;</hi> they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it high time to call a Council, for their own Safety and Preservation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Olympick</hi> Gods being all and each of them affrighted at the sight of such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, said, <hi>Pantagruel</hi> hath shapen Work enough for us, and put us more to a plunge, and nearer our Wits end, by this sole <hi>Herb</hi> of his, then did of old the <hi>Aloids,</hi> by overturning Mountains.

               <hi>CHAP. LII.</hi> How a certain kind of <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> is of that nature, that the Fire is not able to consume it.</head>
            <p>I Have already related to you great and admirable things; but if you might be induced to adventure upon the hazard of believing some other Divinity of this Sacred <hi>Pantagruelion,</hi> I very willingly would tell it you. Believe it if you will, or otherways believe it not, I care not which of them you do, they are both alike to me, it shall be sufficient for my purpose to have told you the Truth, and the Truth I will tell you: But to enter in thereat, because it is of a knaggy, difficult and rugged access, this is the Question which I ask of you, If I had put within this Bottle two Pints, the one of Wine and the other of Water, throughly and exactly mingled together, how would you unmix them? After what manner would you go about to sever them, and separate the one Liquor from
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:43704:213"/>
the other, in such sort, that you render me the Water apart, free from the Wine, and the Wine also pure, without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of one drop of Water; and both of them in the same measure, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and taste that I had embottled them? Or to state the Question otherways, If your Carr-men and Mariners, entrusted for the Provision of your Houses, with the bringing of a certain considerable number of Tuns, Punchions, Pipes, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Hogsheads of <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ves</hi> Wine, or of the Wine of <hi>Orleans, Beanne</hi> and <hi>Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux,</hi> should drink out the half, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with Water fill up the other empty halves of the Vessels as full as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as the <hi>Limosins</hi> use to do in their Carriages by Wains and Carts of the Wines of <hi>Argenton</hi> and <hi>Sangaultier.</hi> After that, how would you part the Water from the Wine, and purifie them both in such a case. I understand you well enough; your meaning is, that I must do it with an <hi>Ivy</hi> Funnel: That is written, it is true, and the Verity thereof explored by a thousand Experiments; you have learned to do this Feat before I see it: But those that have never known it, nor at any time have seen the like, would hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it were possible. Let us never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:43704:213"/>But put the case we were now living in the Age of <hi>Silla, Marius, Caesar,</hi> and other such <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors; or that we were in the time of our ancient <hi>Druids,</hi> whose custom was to burn and calcine the dead Bodies of their Parents and Lords, and that you had a mind to drink the Ashes or Cinders of your Wives or Fathers in the infused Liquor of some good White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, as <hi>Artemisia</hi> drunk the Dust and Ashes of her Husband <hi>Mansolus;</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, that you did determine to have them reserved in some fine Urn or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary Pot, how would you save the Ashes apart, and separate them from those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cinders and Ashes into which the Fuel of the Funeral and bustuary Fire hath been converted? Answer if you can; by my Figgins, I believe it will trouble you so to do.</p>
            <p>Well, I will dispatch, and tell you, that if you take of this Celestial <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> so much as is needful to cover the Body of the Defunct, and after that you shall have inwrapped and bound therein as hard and closely as you can the Corps of the said deceased Persons, and sowed up the Folding-sheet with thred of the same stuff, throw it into the Fire, how great or ardent soever it be it matters not a Straw, the Fire through this <hi>Pantagruelion</hi>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:43704:214"/>
will burn the Body, and reduce to Ashes the Bones thereof, and the <hi>Pantagruelion</hi> shall be not only not consumed nor burnt, but also shall neither lose one Atom of the Ashes inclos'd within it, nor receive one Atom of the huge bustuary heap of Ashes resulting from the blazing Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of things combustible laid round about it, but shall at last, when taken out of the Fire, be fairer, whiter, and much cleaner than when you did put it in at first: Therefore it is called <hi>Asbeston,</hi> which is as much to say as <hi>incombustible.</hi> Great plenty is to be found thereof in <hi>Carpasia,</hi> as likeways in the Climate <hi>Diasienes,</hi> at ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easie rates. O how rare and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing it is, that the Fire which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth, consumeth and destroyeth all such things else, should cleanse, purge and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this sole <hi>Pantagruelion Carpasian Asbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston!</hi> If you mistrust the Verity of this Relation and demand for further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of my Assertion a Visible Sign, as the <hi>Iews,</hi> and such incredulous Infidels use to do; take a fresh Egg, and orbicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly (or rather ovally) infold it within this Divine <hi>Pantagruelion;</hi> when it is so wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, put it in the hot Embers of a Fire, how great or ardent soever it be, and having left it there as long as you will, you shall at last, at your taking it
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:43704:214"/>
out of the Fire, find the Egg roasted hard, and as it were burnt, without any Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Change, Mutation, or so much as a Calefaction of the Sacred <hi>Pantagruelion:</hi> For less than a Million of Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> modified, taken down and amoderated to the twelfth part of one Four Pence Half-penny Farthing, you are able to put it to a trial, and make Proof thereof.</p>

of <hi>Larignum,</hi> by putting <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> to a stand at his return from amongst the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> commanded all the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, Boors, Hinds, and other Inhabitants in, near unto, and about the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont,</hi> to bring all manner of Victuals and Provision for an Army to those places, which on the Military Road he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive them for the use of his marching Soldiery; to which Ordinance all of them were obedient, save only those as were within the Garrison of <hi>Larignum;</hi> who, trusting in the natural Strength of the place, would not pay their Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Emperor purposing to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise them for their refusal, caused his whole Army to march streight towards that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, before the Gate whereof was erected a <hi>Tower,</hi> built of huge big Sparrs and Rafters of the <hi>Larch</hi> Tree, fast bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Pins and Pegs of the same Wood, and interchangeably laid on one another, after the fashion of a Pile or Stack of Timber, set up in the Fabrick thereof to such an apt and convenient heighth, that from the Parapet above the Portcullis they thought with Stones and Leavers to beat off and drive away such as should approach thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:43704:216"/>When <hi>Caesar</hi> had understood that the chief Defence of those within the Castle did consist in Stones and Clubs, and that it was not an easie matter to sling, hurl, dart, throw, or cast them so far as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Approaches, he forthwith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Men to throw great store of Bavins, Faggots and Fascines round about the Castle; and when they had made the Heap of a competent height to put them all in a fair Fire, which was thereupon incontinently done; the Fire put amidst the Faggots was so great and so high, that it covered the whole Castle, that they might well imagine the Tower would thereby be altogether burnt to Dust, and demolished. Nevertheless, contrary to all their Hopes and Expectations, when the Flame ceased, and that the Faggots were quite burnt and consumed, the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er appeared as whole, sound and entire as ever. <hi>Caesar,</hi> after a serious Consideration had thereof, commanded a Compass to be taken, without the distance of a Stone Cast from the Castle round about it there, with Ditches and Entrenchments to form a Blockade; which when the <hi>Loringians</hi> understood, they rendred themselves upon Terms: And then, by a Relation from them it was that <hi>Caesar</hi> learned the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nature and Vertue of this <hi>Wood;</hi>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:43704:216"/>
which, of it self, produceth neither Fire, Flame nor Coal; and would therefore in regard of that rare Quality of <hi>Incombu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stibility,</hi> have been admitted into this Rank and Degree of a true <hi>Pantagruelional</hi> Plant; and that so much the rather, for that <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagruel</hi> directed that all the Gates, Doors, Angiports, Windows, Gutters, frettized and embowed Seelings, Cans, and other whatsoever wooden Furniture in the Abby of <hi>Theleme</hi> should be all materiated of this kind of Timber. He like ways caused to cover therewith the Sterns, Stems, Cook-rooms or Laps, Hatches, Decks, Coursies, Bends and Walls of his Carricks, Ships, Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oons, Galays, Brigantins, Foysts, Frigates, Crears, Barks, Floyts, Pinks, Pinnaces, Huys, Catches, Capers, and other Vessels of his <hi>Thalassian</hi> Arcenal; were it not that the Wood or Timber of the <hi>Larch-tree,</hi> being put within a large and ample Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace full of huge vehemently flaming Fire, proceeding from the Fuel of other sorts and kinds of Wood, cometh at last to be corrupted, consumed, dissipated and destroyed, as are Stones in a Lime-kill: But this <hi>Pantagruelion Asbestin</hi> is rather by the Fire renewed and cleansed, than by the Flames thereof consumed or changed.
