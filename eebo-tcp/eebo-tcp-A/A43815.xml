            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And in Acts 4. 13. when the Jewish high Commission, who had convented the Apostles <hi>Peter and Iohn, saw their boldnesse, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them, that they had bin with Iesus.</hi> It was visible that Jesus had left somthing upon them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. No man ever came near to him, but he went away <hi>better from him.</hi> He delights to dart down Divine irradiations into ther minds, and to leave some heavenly tincture upon the spirits of his Saints.</p>

            <p>This was likewise <hi>Pauls advantage,</hi> whom you find in this Chapter in varietie of postures, one while you hear of his being <hi>caught up into heaven</hi>; soon after you find him at the <hi>next door to hell,</hi> being under such a black temptation of the devil, and his messenger. <hi>Here you have the best and the worst of him.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note>It is a very good hint that Austin hath, if so be there are two diverse places of Scripture, and wherein there are divers readings; whether the old Coppy, or this Coppy, or that Coppy, be true, we cannot tell: (saith he) but the more the better; this is <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins answer, the more the better</hi>; the greater variety of readings,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53311:8"/>
and a <hi>greater commendation</hi> it is to Scripture, because, though there be some vaiety of readings, in regard of particular words, yet you shall find all those readings agree in the substantialls; it is a great commendation now; and (my brethren) <hi>Scripture is not so much the words as the sense,</hi> and if the sense be the same, as to the <hi>fundament all</hi> points in all places, the multitude of various readings is no disparagement; for it is rather indeed <hi>a wonder that it is so well,</hi> and a marvellous work of providence, that <hi>a Bible running through so many hands, writing first, and then printing,</hi> and now so many hundreds above thousands of years together, divers thousands (as you know a great part of the old Testament was) that there should be no more <hi>mistakes,</hi> an admirable work of providence.</p>
            <p>But then I will ad'e this further, Many of those <hi>mistakes that are,</hi> it is an easie matter to reconcile them. I confesse, it is not very obvious <hi>to all</hi> but learned men that are <hi>Antiquaries, and Criticks,</hi> and are able to consult <hi>with books,</hi> and have seen anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Copies, &amp;c.</hi> they are prepared to reconcile; As there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference now in <hi>Mark and John</hi> concerning the times there about Christs suffering, one saith the third hour, and another saith the sixth, how shall we reconcile them?<note place="margin">Mark 15. 25. Third hour. John 19. 14. sixth hour.</note> learned men have seen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Copies, where they are both the same, an ancient Copy of the 19. of John naming the third hour.</p>
            <p>We have a place in the 27 of Matthew 5. where it is said there, as I take it, the Prophet Jeremy, if you please to turn to the 27. Chapter, or look it at your leasure; <note place="margin">See <hi>Dousius</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> his Parallels.</note> at the 9. verse then was that fullfilled, that that was spoken by <hi>Jeremias the Prophet</hi>: some tell us Jeremiah, and Zachary written <hi>contractively</hi> in the Hebrew, <hi>are the same,</hi> and some say among the Hebrews, and others say Zachary was <hi>Jeremiahs scholar,</hi> and <hi>therefore called by that name</hi>; but here is a short answer salves all; I can tell a man<note place="margin">Learned Arch-Bishop <hi>Usher.</hi>
               </note> that hath seen a Copy, six hundred years old, where there was neither Jeremy nor Zachary in, but <hi>the Prophet</hi>: there is a short and full answer.</p>
            <p>There is another place in the 1. Corinthians: (it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable) and the 15. there saith Paul, <hi>I protest by your rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that we die daily</hi>; some reade it, <hi>I protest by our rejoycing</hi>; in the 31. verse; <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 span">

or <hi>yours</hi>: whether <hi>our rejoycing, or your rejoycing</hi>; because they are both a truth; yet I could tell you what is answered; learned Criticks give this answer, that the ancient Greeks did pronounce the Eta, and the Upsilon much alike, and then when a copie came to be transcribed, he that did write did not <hi>look upon the copie,</hi> but heard one dictate and read <hi>to him,</hi> now they did pronounce <hi>Eta like Upsilon,</hi> and so the mistake <hi>might be</hi> easie; he that writ, could not well tell whether he said <gap reason="foreign" extent="1 word">
